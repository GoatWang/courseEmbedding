Local Buffer and Public Cloud for Growth and Usage Spikes

HPE Flexible Capacity prepares you for growth and gives you the agility to get applications to market right away—in minutes—without waiting months to expand the IT infrastructure and budget. So how does it work?
HPE works with you to forecast current and projected capacity—for a minimum commitment—and then creates a local buffer of IT resources beyond what you need now, that you can dip into as needed. The extra capacity is ready to be activated when you need more capacity, and it can easily expand into the Azure public cloud when needed. This ensures you have extra capacity deployed ahead of any oncoming demand.

Cloud-like Economics

The traditional mode of purchasing IT infrastructure often results in provisioning capacity that’s too high or too low for your IT needs. For example, you may spend money on unused capacity to handle unexpected growth, or struggle to meet demand when you don’t have enough capacity, or both.
HPE Flexible Capacity is a service for consumption-based IT payment that aligns cash flow to actual metered capacity usage. By deploying a flexible amount of capacity ahead of oncoming demand, you end up paying only for what you use with no upfront capital outlay.

Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB: NXES) is a technology company setting new standards of quality and innovation for B2B big data management with a focus on the lead generation marketplace. The rapid ascent of Nexus as one of the primary providers of qualified leads for the nation's largest insurance companies has been driven by its NexChange Marketplace℠, one of the only viable enterprise-level platforms for managing the supply chain between lead sources and their buyers in the rapidly consolidating lead generation industry.Having already secured a reputation as having the highest quality leads for the Auto Insurance sector, Nexus is expanding into new verticals with a move into Life Insurance already in progress. With its primary build-out expenditures made, Nexus is now positioned to leverage its lower fixed infrastructure costs and current rapid revenue growth to clone their services in a succession of additional lucrative verticals, including Health Insurance, Home Renters Insurance, Payday Loans and Educational Institutions.Nexus correctly assessed having the intermediary technology to properly track and allocate leads with a full suite of data-analysis tools would be required to survive the consolidation of the lead generation industry. The difficulty and resources required to engineer these solutions forced out dozens of smaller players. Nexus is now poised to capitalize on this as one of the last companies standing in an industry with explosive ongoing growth.

This Prospectus relates to the resale of our common stock that may be offered 
and sold from time to time by the selling shareholders. We will not receive any 
proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock in this offering.


We see very little competition for our business model, and do not anticipate
such competition to become significant in the future. While it is possible that
our business model may be duplicated in the future, at the current time we
believe our system and business method of providing both online and offline lead
generation services as one automated system is unique and therefore results in
little competition from our competitors, including our competitors in the lead
generation business.


Company Description
Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc. (“Nexus”) was incorporated in the State of
Wyoming on October 19, 1995 as Global Link Technologies, Inc. On June 10, 2008,
Global Link Technologies filed Articles of Amendment with the State of Wyoming
changing its name to MutuaLoan Corporation.  On June 16, 2011


 (as filed with the
State of Wyoming on September 16, 2011), MutuaLoan Corporation entered into a
business combination with Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc. (“Nexus Florida”).
The business combination was accounted for as a reverse merger recapitalization.
The accounting target/legal acquirer was MutuaLoan. The accounting 
acquirer/legal target was Nexus Florida. Nexus is currently conducting 
operations and generating revenue.
 
Based in Lighthouse Point, Florida, Nexus is a lead generation services company
dedicated to helping our customers identify, engage and develop long term
relationships with their clients.  Through a host of proprietary lead generation
systems designed to identify potential clients for our customers, Nexus
Enterprise Solutions, Inc. provides a broad range of internet marketing
strategies to capture targeted buyer data and use that data to generate revenues
through the sale of leads to our customers.  Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc. is
quickly expanding into a number of different industries and currently serves as
a lead generation engine for several of the nation’s largest companies in the
insurance and financial service sectors.

The Company’s current business plans include expanding its lead generation
services, and the Company derives revenue by way of the sale of leads through
our automated system.  The Company obtains its leads by purchasing them from
accredited brokers, as well as by using online and offline lead generation
methods as are described below.

Online generation includes the use of proprietary lead portals, search engine
optimization, pay per click services, email advertising, online internet
publishers, website banner advertisements as well as the use of blogs, social
networking sites, and affiliate networks and programs.

Offline generation includes the use of live phone leads, whereby the Company
would use a predictive dialer call center and an overseas outsourced call center
in order to generate potential leads for our customers.  

The cost of developing an automated system such as ours is prohibitive for a
majority of companies. We fulfill this need by allowing companies to use our
lead generation technology, forms, landing pages etc, for a fee. We currently
are back logged with the amount of companies looking to buy and sell leads to
us, our carriers and agencies.  We are currently focusing our attention on the
auto insurance market, but expect to expand to other industries in the very near
future.

Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc. (Nexus) is redefining the current prospect and
lead generation and acquisition industry by developing an information exchange
marketplace which allows our customers who are sellers and buyers of leads, and
other information assets, to operate in an optimized, transparent, and efficient
way to transact deals without the devaluation experienced in today’s markets and
systems.  This is accomplished primarily through systems and processes which
enable enhanced business intelligence and management thereby empowering
stakeholders on both sides of the transaction to make well-informed and
meaningful connections with each other.

The administrative office of the Company is located at 5340 N. Federal Highway,
Suite 206, Lighthouse Point, Florida 33064. Our telephone number: 
(561) 767-4346.

Overview and History  Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc. ("Nexus") was incorporated in the State of Wyoming on October 19, 1995 as Global Link Technologies, Inc. On June 10, 2008, Global Link Technologies filed Articles of Amendment with the State of Wyoming changing its name to MutuaLoan Corporation. On June 16, 2011 (as filed with the State of Wyoming on September 16, 2011), MutuaLoan Corporation entered into a business combination with Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc. ("Nexus Florida"). The business combination was accounted for as a reverse merger recapitalization. The accounting target/legal acquirer was MutuaLoan. The accounting acquirer/legal target was Nexus Florida. Nexus is currently conducting operations and generating revenue.  The Company operations are currently being conducted out of the Company office located at 5340 N Federal Hwy STE 206 Lighthouse Point, FL 33406 1375; (561) 767-4346. It considers that the current principal office space arrangement adequate and will reassess its needs based upon the future growth of the Company. Its fiscal year end is December 31st.  Online Generation  Using a combination of a predictive dialer call center solution and an overseas outsourced call center solution, our Company is able to generate custom live transfer leads for our customers. We utilize this method of lead generation in situations where we are confident that a high volume of live leads can be generated and sold for a profit.  Revenue Model and Distribution methods of the products or services  Our revenue model is based on customer development. We either purchase leads from accredited brokers or locate leads based on the methods described above, and then resell those leads to our customers through our automated system. The leads must meet the stringent criteria of our system. The leads are vetted through our fraud filters in order to ensure quality.  We are currently focusing our attention on the auto insurance market, but expect to expand to other industries in the very near future. The Company will identify and address additional target markets for its services other than the insurance and financial industries with market research and feedback from its customers.  - 10 -  Results of Operations  For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  The Company generated $266,852 in revenue for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, which compares to revenue of $312,409 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. Our revenues decreased during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 due to decreased sales of our services to our current customers during this period.  Cost of sales for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was $152,891, which compares to cost of sales of $187,394 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015. Our revenues decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2016, and as our sales revenue decreased, our cost of sales also decreased.  Operating expenses, which consisted solely of general and administrative expenses, and consulting and professional fees for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, were $137,018. This compares with operating expenses for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 of $138,626. The major components of general and administrative expenses include accounting fees, legal and professional fees.  As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $53,190 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016. This compares with net loss for the three month period ended September 30, 2015 of $19,141.  For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  The Company generated $964,702 in revenue for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, which compares to revenue of $1,374,577 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. Our revenues decreased during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 due to decreased sales of our services to our current customers during this period.  Cost of sales for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 was $548,798, which compares to cost of sales of $768,220 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. Our revenues decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and as our sales revenue decreased, our cost of sales correspondingly decreased.  Operating expenses, which consisted solely of general and administrative expenses, and consulting and professional fees for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, were $470,032. This compares with operating expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 of $468,481. The major components of general and administrative expenses include accounting fees, legal and professional fees.  As a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $91,931 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. This compares with net income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 of $100,284. The reason for our net loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and our net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, is due to our decreased revenue during the period.  In its audited financial statements as of December 31, 2015, the Company was issued an opinion by its auditors that raised substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern based on the Company's current financial position. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop and market our products and our ability to generate revenues.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of September 30, 2016 we had cash or cash equivalents of $130. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash or cash equivalents of $18,842.  We believe that with our existing cash flows we have sufficient cash to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months due to the fact that we believe our revenue will increase throughout the year. We believe that the amount of revenue we are generating will allow us to meet our operating requirements during the next twelve months. If our revenue is not sufficient to allow us to meet our cash requirements during the next twelve months, the company may need to raise additional funds through the sale of its equity securities. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating sufficient revenues or other funds in the future to cover these operating costs. Failure to generate sufficient revenues or additional financing when needed could cause us to go out of business.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $37,288 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. This compares to net cash provided by operating activities of $180,600 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. This change is due to a decrease in accounts receivable and a net loss versus net income during the period.  Cash flows from investing activities were $0 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. We do not anticipate significant cash outlays for investing activities over the next twelve months.  - 11 -  Cash flows used in financing activities was $56,000 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 which compares to cash flows used in financing activities of $207,500 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. The change in cash flows related to financing activities is due to the fact that we had decreased amounts used for repayment of notes payable as well as $61,000 in proceeds received from a related party note payable during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  As of September 30, 2016, our total assets were $352,010 and our total liabilities were $706,014. As of December 31, 2015, our total assets were $467,592 and our total liabilities were $763,999.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  Plan of Operation  Our plan for the twelve months beginning September 30, 2016 is to operate at a profit or at break even. Our plan is to attract sufficient additional product sales and services within our present organizational structure and resources to become profitable in our operations.  Our revenue model is based on customer development. We either purchase leads from accredited brokers or locate leads based on the methods described above, and then resell those leads to our customers through our automated system. The leads must meet the stringent criteria of our system. The leads are vetted through our fraud filters in order to ensure quality.  We are currently focusing our attention on the auto insurance market, but expect to expand to other industries in the very near future.  Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc. (Nexus) is redefining the current prospect and lead generation and acquisition industry by developing an information exchange service which allows sellers and buyers of leads, and other information assets, to operate in an optimized, transparent, and efficient way to transact deals in a more efficient manner than what is experienced in today's markets and systems. This is accomplished primarily through systems and processes which enable enhanced business intelligence and management thereby empowering stakeholders on both sides of the transaction to make well-informed and meaningful connections with each other.  Our Company generates revenue through its lead generation services, which are comprised of the lead generation methods described above and are accessed by our customers through our automated system. The cost of developing an automated system such as ours is prohibitive for a majority of companies. We fulfill a need by allowing these companies to use our technology, forms, landing pages etc, for a fee. We currently are back logged with the amount of companies looking to buy and sell leads to us, our carriers and agencies. In return, we get compensated when we sell a lead by charging our customers a fee for each lead purchased.  The Company will identify and address additional target markets for its services other than the insurance and financial industries with market research and feedback from its customers.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  We have reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on our financial condition or the results of our operations.  Seasonality  We do not expect our revenues to be impacted by seasonal demands for our services.  - 12 -  Nov 21, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

General
Information about Our Company

 

Nexus
Enterprise Solutions, Inc. (“Nexus”) was incorporated
in the State of Wyoming on October 19, 1995 as Global Link
Technologies, Inc.  On June 10, 2008, Global Link Technologies
filed Articles of Amendment with the State of Wyoming changing its
name to MutuaLoan Corporation.  On September 16, 2011,
MutuaLoan Corporation entered into a business combination with
Nexus Business Solution, Inc., at which time it also amended its
Articles of Incorporation with the State of Wyoming to change its
name to Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc.  Nexus is currently
conducting operations and generating revenue.
    

 

Based in
Lighthouse Point, Florida, Nexus is a lead generation services
company dedicated to helping the largest consumer-facing brands
identify, engage and develop long term customer
relationships.  
Through a
host of proprietary lead generation systems designed to identify
customers that are more likely to grow with its clients beyond a
single transaction, Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc. provides a
broad range of internet marketing strategies to capture targeted
buyer data and use that data to generate revenues through both
affiliate marketing and lead generation sales.  Nexus
Enterprise Solutions, Inc. is quickly expanding into a number of
different verticals and currently serves as a lead generation
engine for several of the nation’s largest companies in the
insurance and financial service sectors.

 

The
Company’s current business plans include expanding its lead
generation services, through online generation and offline
generation.  

 

Online
generation includes the use of proprietary lead portals, search
engine optimization, pay per click services, email advertising,
online internet publishers, website banner advertisements as well
as the use of blogs, social networking sites, and affiliate
networks and programs.

 

Offline
generation includes the use of live phone leads, whereby the
Company would use a predictive dialer call center and an overseas
outsourced call center in order to generate potential leads for its
customers.  

 

Our
revenue model is based on customer development. We are a lead
generating company that produces very high quality
leads.

 

A second
source of the Company’s revenue is derived by way of fees
paid for our service option. The cost of developing an automated
system such as ours is prohibitive for a majority of companies. We
fulfill this need by allowing companies to use our technology,
forms, landing pages etc, for a fee. We currently are back logged
with the amount of companies looking to buy and sell leads to us,
our carriers and agencies.  We are currently focusing our
attention on the auto insurance market, but expect to expand to
other verticals in the very near future.

 

Nexus
Enterprise Solutions, Inc. (Nexus) is redefining the current
prospect and lead generation and acquisition industry by developing
an information exchange marketplace which allows sellers and buyers
of leads, and other information assets, to operate in an optimized,
transparent, and efficient way to transact deals without the
devaluation experienced in today’s markets and systems. 
This is accomplished primarily through systems and processes which
enable disintermediation and enhanced business intelligence and
management thereby empowering stakeholders on both sides of the
transaction to make well-informed and meaningful connections with
each other.

 

The
administrative office of the Company is located at 5340 N. Federal
Highway, Suite 206, Lighthouse Point, Florida 33064, and the
company also rents offsite administrative and support services. The
Company plans to use

 The Company has not been subject to any bankruptcy,
receivership or similar proceeding.

RISK
FACTORS

 

An
investment in these securities involves an exceptionally high
degree of risk and is extremely speculative in nature. You should
carefully consider the risk factors listed below, together with the
information contained in this prospectus, any reports we file with
the SEC and the documents referred to herein.  Following are
what is believed are all of the material risks involved if one
decides to purchase shares in this offering.

 

RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COMPANY:

 

We are an
“emerging growth company,” and the reduced disclosure
requirements applicable to “emerging growth companies”
could make our common stock less attractive to
investors.

 

We are an
“emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act.
For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take
advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements
that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section
404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations
regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy
statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory
“say-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and
shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. We
will remain an “emerging growth company” until the
earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we
have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii)
The last date of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of
the date of the first sale of common stock under this registration
statement; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous
three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible
debt; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large
accelerated filer” under the Exchange Act. We will be deemed
a large accelerated filer on the first day of the fiscal year after
the market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates
exceeds $700 million, measured on October 31.

 

We cannot
predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive to
the extent we rely on the exemptions available to emerging growth
companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive
as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our
common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an
emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An
emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to
private companies.

 

A Company
that elects to be treated as an emerging growth company shall
continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest
of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which it had total
annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as indexed for inflation),
(ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth
anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under
this registration statement; (iii) the date on which it has, during
the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in
non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which is deemed to be a
‘large accelerated filer’ as defined by the SEC, which
would generally occur upon it attaining a public float of at least
$700 million.

 

However,
we are choosing to “opt out” of such extended
transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or
revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which
adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth
companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision
to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new
or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

 

Because
the Company auditors have issued a going concern opinion, there is
a substantial uncertainty that it will continue operations in which
case one could lose one’s investment
.

 

The
auditors have issued a going concern opinion because of the
Company’s recurring losses, negative working capital,
stockholder’s deficit and the absence of revenue-generating
operations.  This means that there is substantial doubt that
it can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months.
The financial statements do not




II-6

 

  

 

 

include
any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about its
ability to continue in business.  As such it may have to cease
operations and you could lose your entire investment.

 

Our
Officers and Directors have limited public company experience.
 The Company’s needs could exceed the amount of time or
level of experience they may have.  This could result in their
inability to properly manage Company affairs, resulting in it
remaining a start-up company with no revenues or profits, which
could cause the loss of one’s entire
investment.

  

The
Company business plan does not provide for the hiring of any
additional employees other than outlined in its Plan of Operations
until sales will support the expense. Until that time the
responsibility of developing the Company’s business, the
offering and selling of the shares through this prospectus and
fulfilling the reporting requirements of a public company all fall
upon the three officers and two directors.  While Jason Foster
has experience serving a wide variety of organizations from small
startups to Fortune 500 companies, none of our officers and
directors have experience in a public company setting, including
serving as a principal accounting officer or principal financial
officer.  Further, they have no experience in complying with
the various rules and regulations which are required of a public
company, and as a result, they may not be able to operate
successfully as a public company, even if the Company’s
operations are successful.  While each of the Company’s
officers and directors will use their best judgments to resolve all
potential conflicts, there is no formulated plan to resolve any
possible conflict of interest with their other business activities,
and we cannot guarantee that any potential conflicts can be
avoided.  In the event they are unable to fulfill any aspect
of their duties to the Company it may experience a shortfall or
complete lack of sales resulting in little or no profits and
eventual closure of its business.

 

Since the
Company has shown a net loss since inception, an investment in the
shares offered herein is highly risky and could result in a
complete loss of your investment if the company is unsuccessful in
its business plans.

 

Based
upon current plans, the Company expects to incur operating losses
in future periods as it incurs significant expenses associated with
the growth of its business.  Further, there is no guarantee
that it will be successful in realizing future revenues or in
achieving or sustaining positive cash flow at any time in the
future.  Any such failure could result in the possible closure
of its business or force the company to seek additional capital
through loans or additional sales of its equity securities to
continue business operations, which would dilute the value of any
shares you purchase in this offering.

 

The
Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to generate revenues
which could result in a total loss of your investment if it is
unsuccessful in its business plans.

 

While the
company has generated revenue, which are reported in the financial
statements included in this Prospectus, there can be no assurance
that it will continue to generate revenues or that revenues will be
sufficient to maintain its business.  As a result, one could
lose all of one’s investment if the Company is not successful
in its proposed business plans.

 

Growth
and development of operations will depend on the acceptance of the
Company’s proposed business.  If the Company’s
services are not deemed desirable and suitable for purchase and it
cannot establish a customer base, it may not be able to generate
future revenues, which would result in a failure of the business
and a loss of any investment one makes in the
shares.

 

The
acceptance of the Company’s lead generation services for its
customers is critically important to its success. The Company
cannot be certain that the services that it will be offering will
be appealing and as a result there may not be any demand for these
products and its sales could be limited and it may never realize
any revenues. In addition, there are no assurances that if it
alters or changes the products it offers in the future that the
demand for these new products will develop and this could adversely
affect our business and any possible revenues.

 

If demand
for the services the Company plans to offer slows, then its
business would be materially affected, which could result in the
loss of your entire investment.

 




II-7

 

  

 

 

Demand
for the services which it intends to sell depends on many factors,
including:

 




 



 



 



 





 



•



 



the number
of clients the Company is able to attract and retain over
time.





 



 



 



 





 



•



 



the
economy, and in periods of rapidly declining economic conditions,
customers may defer services such as ours in order to pay secured
debts or debts that must be made in order to remain
solvent.





 



 



 



 





 



•



 



the
competitive environment in the lead generation market that may
force it to reduce prices below its desired pricing level or
increase promotional spending.





 



 



 



 





 



•



 



the
ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet
customers’ needs for lead generation services in a timely
cost effective manner.




 

For the
long term, demand for the products it plans to offer may be
affected by:

 




 



 



 



 





 



•



 



the
ability to establish, maintain and eventually grow market share in
a competitive environment.





 



 



 



 





 



•



 



delivery
of its information globally, geopolitical changes, changes in
trading regulations, currency fluctuations, natural disasters,
pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the
cost of items it purchases, create communication issues or render
product delivery difficult which could have a material adverse
effect on its sales and profitability.




 

All of
these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in
the demand for the services it plans to offer, which could
adversely affect its sales, cash flows and overall financial
condition.  An investor could lose his or her entire
investment as a result.   

 

The loss
of the services of the current officers and directors could
severely impact the Company business operations and future
development, which could result in a loss of revenues and
one’s ability to ever sell any shares one purchases in this
offering.

 

The
performance is substantially dependent upon the professional
expertise of the current officers and board of directors.
 Each has extensive expertise in the lead generation and
services industry and the company is dependent on their abilities
to develop its business. If they are unable to perform their
duties, this could have an adverse effect on company business
operations, financial condition and operating results if it is
unable to replace them with other individuals qualified to develop
and market its business. The loss of their services could result in
a loss of revenues, which could result in a reduction of the value
of any shares you purchase in this offering as well as the complete
loss of your investment.

 

The
Company may not be able to successfully implement its business
strategy, which could adversely affect its business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.  If the
Company cannot successfully implement its business strategy, it
could result in the loss of your investment.
 

 

Successful
implementation of its business strategy depends on factors specific
to stock trading platforms and the state of the financial industry
and numerous other factors that may be beyond its control.
 Adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our
business strategy and have a material adverse effect on its
business, its financial condition, and results of operations and
cash flow:

 

·

The
competitive environment in the lead generation industry that may
force us to reduce prices below the optimal pricing level or
increase promotional spending;

·

Its
ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet
customers’ needs for trading products in a timely cost
effective manner; and

·

Its
ability to establish, maintain and eventually grow market share in
a competitive environment.

 




II-8

 

  

 

 

There are
no substantial barriers to entry into the industry and because the
company does not currently have any copyright protection for the
services it intends to sell, there is no guarantee someone else
will not duplicate its ideas and bring them to market before it
does, which could severely limit the Company proposed sales and
revenues.  If the Company cannot generate sales and revenues,
it could result in the loss of your investment.

 

Since it
has no intellectual property protection, unauthorized persons may
attempt to copy aspects of its business, including its services or
marketing materials. Any encroachment upon the Company corporate
information, including the unauthorized use of its brand name, the
use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated
against it for infringement upon another company's proprietary
information or improper use of their copyright, may affect its
ability to create brand name recognition, cause customer confusion
and/or have a detrimental effect on its business.  Litigation
or proceedings before the U.S. or International Patent and
Trademark Offices may be necessary in the future to enforce the
company intellectual property rights, to protect its trade secrets
and domain name and/or to determine the validity and scope of the
proprietary rights of others.  Any such infringement,
litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs
and diversion of resources and could seriously harm its business
operations and/or results of operations.  As a result, an
investor could lose his or her entire investment.

As the
Company intends to be conducting international business
transactions, it will be exposed to local business risks in
different countries, which could have a material adverse effect on
its financial condition or results of operations, which could
result in the loss of your investment

.

The
Company intends to promote and sell some of its services
internationally by way of using overseas outsourced call centers
for its offline lead generation services, and we expect to have
customers or call centers located in several countries. The Company
international operations will be subject to risks inherent in doing
business in foreign countries, including, but not necessarily
limited to:

•
new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local
jurisdictions; 

•
potentially adverse tax consequences, including imposition or
increase of taxes on transactions or withholding and other taxes on
remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;

•
risk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign
governments;

•
legal restrictions on doing business in or with certain nations,
certain parties and/or certain products; and

•
local economic, political and social conditions, including the
possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political
instability.

 

It may
not be successful in developing and implementing policies and
strategies to address the foregoing factors in a timely and
effective manner in the locations where it will do business.
Consequently, the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing
factors could have a material adverse effect on its base operations
and upon its financial condition and results of
operations.

Since its
services will be available over the Internet in foreign countries
and the Company will have customers residing in foreign countries,
foreign jurisdictions may require it to qualify to do business in
their country. It will be required to comply with certain laws and
regulations of each country in which it conducts business,
including laws and regulations currently in place or which may be
enacted related to Internet services available to the residents of
each country from online sites located elsewhere.

The
company operations in developing markets could expose it to
political, economic and regulatory risks that are greater than
those it may face in established markets. Further, its
international operations may require it to comply with additional
United States and international regulations.  If the company
fails to comply with the required domestic and international
regulations or violates any such regulations, it may not be able to
generate sales and revenue necessary to continue its business
plans, which could result in the loss of your investment.
 

For
example, it may be required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, or "FCPA," which prohibits companies or their agents
and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign
official or agent thereof for




II-9

 

  

 

 

the
purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in
their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct
business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair
advantage. The Company may operate in some nations that have
experienced significant levels of governmental corruption. Its
employees, agents and contractors, including companies to which it
outsources business operations, may take actions in violation of
its policies and legal requirements. Such violations, even if
prohibited by its policies and procedures, could have an adverse
effect on its business and reputation. Any failure by the Company
to ensure that its employees and agents comply with the FCPA and
applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could
result in substantial civil and criminal penalties or restrictions
on its ability to conduct business in certain foreign
jurisdictions, and its results of operations and financial
condition could be materially and adversely affected. Finally, any
additional regulatory requirements put in place by the United
States or any foreign country in which the Company operates may
expose the company to additional liability, and require the Company
to comply with complex and time consuming regulations.

In
addition, the Company ability to attract and retain customers may
be adversely affected if the reputations of the financial app
industry, online brokers as a whole or if particular service
providers knowingly relay faulty data. The perception of
untrustworthiness within the stock trading industry or of financial
apps could materially adversely affect its ability to attract and
retain customers.

Failure
of third-party service providers upon which we rely could adversely
affect our business and result in the loss of your
investment .

The
Company may rely on certain third-party service providers,
including data centers, call centers, direct posts, aggregators,
publishers, insurance carriers, insurance agencies, back-office
systems, Internet and wireless service providers and communications
facilities. Any interruption in these third-party services, or
deterioration in their   performance or
quality, could adversely affect our business. If its arrangement
with any third party is terminated, it may not be able to find
alternative systems or service providers on a timely basis or on
commercially reasonable terms. This could have a material adverse
effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING:

 

The
Offering Price of the Company Shares is arbitrary, so there is no
guarantee that the price at which you have purchased your shares
will remain the same.  A significant decrease in the price of
our shares could result in the loss of your
investment .

 

The
offering price of the company shares has been determined
arbitrarily by the Company and bears no relationship to the
Company's assets, book value, potential earnings or any other
recognized criteria of value.

 

The
trading in the Company shares will be regulated by Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15g-9 which established the definition of
a “penny stock.”   The effective result is
that fewer purchasers are qualified by their brokers to purchase
its shares, and therefore a less liquid market for the investors to
sell their shares.  Therefore, you may have a difficult time
selling your shares, or you may not be able to sell your shares at
all, which could result in the loss of your
investment.

 

The
shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and rules of the Commission.
 The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose
additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on
broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than
certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with
assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in
excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or
$300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended
by the broker-dealer.  For transactions covered by the penny
stock rules, a broker-dealer must make a suitability determination
for each purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement
prior to the sale.  In addition, the broker-dealer must make
certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including
the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer
quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer
and




II-10

 

  

 

 

certain
associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the
Commission.  Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it
difficult or impossible for you to resell any shares you may
purchase.

 

Due to
the lack of a trading market for our securities, you may have
difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering, which
could result in the loss of your investment.

 

There is
presently no demand for our common stock and no public market
exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus.  We
plan to contact a market maker immediately following the
effectiveness of this Registration Statement to file an application
to have our shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board
(OTCBB), however, there is no guarantee that a trading market will
ever develop.  The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that
displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information
in over-the-counter (OTC) securities.  The OTCBB is not an
issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does
not have any listing requirements per se, to be eligible for
quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their
filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. Market
Makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose
issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already
quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required
filings will be removed following a 30 or 60 day grace period if
they do not make their required filing during that time. The
Company cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or
approved or that its stock will be quoted for sale.  As of the
date of this filing, there have been no discussions or
understandings between Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc. or anyone
acting on its behalf with any market maker regarding participation
in a future trading market for its securities.  If no market
is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult or
impossible for you to sell any shares you purchase in this
offering.  In such case, you may find that you are unable to
achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares
without considerable delay, if at all.  In addition, if the
Company fails to have its common stock quoted on a public trading
market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it
may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares,
resulting in an inability to realize any value from your
investment.

 

You will
incur immediate and substantial dilution of the price you pay for
your shares, which could affect the overall monetary value of your
shares.  If the value of your shares significantly decreases,
you could lose your investment.

 

The
Company’s existing stockholders acquired their shares at an
average cost of $0.01 per share, a cost per share substantially
less than that which you will pay for the shares you purchase in
this offering (the price paid for the currently issued and
outstanding common stock held by the selling shareholders was
valued at an average of $0.03 per share, the price paid for the
currently issued and outstanding common stock held by Company
directors was valued at an average of $0.002 per share).
 Accordingly, any investment you make in these shares will
result in the immediate and substantial dilution of the net
tangible book value of those shares from the $0.20 you pay for
them.  Upon completion of the offering, the net tangible book
value of your shares will be $0.027 per share, $0.173 less than
what you paid for them.

 

The
company officers and directors will continue to exercise
significant control over our operations, which means as a minority
stockholder, you would have no control over certain matters
requiring stockholder approval that could affect your ability to
ever resell any of your shares.  If you are not able to resell
any shares, it may result in the loss of your
investment.

 

Our
executive officers and directors will continue to have a
significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate
transactions, including the election of directors, approval of
significant corporate transactions, changes in control of the
Company or other matters that could affect your ability to ever
resell your shares. Their interests may differ from the interests
of the other stockholders and thus result in corporate decisions
that are disadvantageous to other stockholders.

 

We may
never pay dividends to shareholders, which could reduce the
monetary gain you may realize on your investment
.

 




II-11

 

  

 

 

We have
not declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our
capital stock.  We currently intend to retain our future
earnings, if any, to support operations and to finance expansion
and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our
common stock in the foreseeable future.

 

The
declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be
made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend
upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows
and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and
other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. 
There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and, if
dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the
amount of any such dividend.  If the Company does not pay
dividends, the Company’s common stock may be less valuable
because a return on an investor’s investment will only occur
if the Company’s stock price appreciates.

 

Because
our common stock is not registered under the exchange act, we will
not be subject to the federal proxy rules and our directors,
executive offices and 10% beneficial holders will not be subject to
section 16 of the exchange act. in addition, our reporting
obligations under section 15(d) of the exchange act may be
suspended automatically if we have fewer than 300 shareholders of
record on the first day of our fiscal year.

 

Our
common stock is not registered under the Exchange Act, and we do
not intend to register our common stock under the Exchange Act for
the foreseeable future (provided that, we will register our common
stock under the Exchange Act if we have, after the last day of our
fiscal year, more than 500 shareholders of record, in accordance
with Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act; as of March 28, 2012, we
have less than 40 shareholders of record).   As long as
our common stock is not registered under the Exchange Act, we will
not be subject to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, which, among
other things, prohibits companies that have securities registered
under the Exchange Act from soliciting proxies or consents from
shareholders without furnishing to shareholders and filing with the
SEC a proxy statement and form of proxy complying with the proxy
rules.  In addition, so long as our common stock is not
registered under the Exchange Act, our directors and executive
officers and beneficial holders of 10% or more of our outstanding
common stock will not be subject to Section 16 of the Exchange
Act.  Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires
executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own
more than 10% of a registered class of equity securities to file
with the SEC initial statements of beneficial ownership, reports of
changes in ownership and annual reports concerning their ownership
of common shares and other equity securities, on Forms 3, 4, and 5
respectively.  Such information about our directors,
executive officers, and beneficial holders will only be available
through periodic reports and any registration statements on Form
S-1 we file.  Furthermore, so long as our common stock is
not registered under the Exchange Act, our obligation to file
reports under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act will be
automatically suspended if, on the first day of any fiscal year
(other than a fiscal year in which a registration statement under
the Securities Act has gone effective), we have fewer than 300
shareholders of record.  This suspension is automatic and
does not require any filing with the SEC.  In such an
event, we may cease providing periodic reports and current or
periodic information, including operational and financial
information, may not be available with respect to our results of
operations.

 

Although
we expect to apply for quotation on the OTC bulletin board (OTCBB),
we may not be approved, and even if approved, we may not be
approved for trading on the OTCBB; therefore shareholders may not
have a market to sell their shares, either in the near term or in
the long term, or both.

 

We are
not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is
presently no demand for our common stock and no public market
exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to
contact a market maker immediately following this registration
statement on Form S-1 being declared effective and apply to have
the shares quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board ("OTCBB").
The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time
quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter
securities. The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or
exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements
per se, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must
remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable
regulatory authority. Market makers are not permitted to begin
quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing
requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become
delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30
to 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing
during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be
accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. If
our




II-12

 

  

 

 

application
is rejected, our stock may then be traded on the "Pink Sheets," and
the market for resale of our shares would decrease dramatically, if
not be eliminated. As of the date of this filing, there have been
no discussions or understandings between the Company and anyone
acting on our behalf, with any market maker regarding participation
in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever
developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to
sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you
may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your
investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if
at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on
a public trading market, your common stock will not have a
quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to
ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any
value from your investment.

USE OF
PROCEEDS

 

This
Prospectus relates to the resale of our common stock that may be
offered and sold from time to time by the selling shareholders.
 We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of
common stock in this offering.

 

DETERMINATION
OF OFFERING PRICE

 

The
offering price of $0.25 per share has been determined arbitrarily
by the Directors of the company.  The price does not bear any
relationship to the company assets, book value, earnings, or other
established criteria for valuing a company. In determining the
number of shares to be offered and the offering price the board
took into consideration our capital structure and the amount of
money it would need to implement the Company business plans.
 Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an
indication of the actual value of its securities.

 

       These
shares of common stock may be sold by the selling stockholders from
time to time in the over-the-counter market or on other national
securities exchanges or automated interdealer quotation systems on
which our common stock may be listed or quoted, through negotiated
transactions or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time
of sale or at negotiated prices. The distribution of the shares by
the selling stockholders is not subject to any underwriting
agreement. The selling stockholders will sell their shares at the
initial offering price of $0.25 per share until the shares are
traded on the OTC Bulletin Board or a national securities exchange,
at which point the selling shareholders may sell the registered
shares at the prevailing market price for the shares at the
time of sale. We will file a post-effective amendment to this
registration statement to reflect a change to the market price when
the shares begin trading on a market.

 

 To
be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an
application on our behalf in order to make a market in our common
stock. There is no certainty that our shares will be quoted on the
OTC Bulletin Board or listed on any exchange.

DILUTION
OF THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR YOUR SHARES

 

Dilution
represents the difference between the offering price and the net
tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this
offering.

 

Net
tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting
total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets.
 Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary
determination of the offering price of the shares being offered.
 Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a
result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing
stockholders.

 

As of the
date of this prospectus, the net tangible book value of the Company
shares is $(233,298) or approximately $(0.013) per share, based
upon 17,471,648 shares outstanding.

  

Upon the
sale of shares offered hereby,, the net tangible book value of the
Shares held by our existing stockholders will not be increased .
However the purchasers of Shares will incur immediate dilution (a
reduction in net tangible book value per Share from the offering
price of $0.25 per Share) of $(0.263) per share.

 

The
following tables illustrate the per share dilution to the new
investors and does not give any effect to the results of any
operations subsequent to June 30, 2012:

SELLING
SHAREHOLDERS

 

      
The
following table sets forth the shares beneficially owned, as of the
date of this prospectus, by the selling stockholders prior to the
offering contemplated by this prospectus, the number of shares each
selling stockholder is offering by this prospectus and the number
of shares which each selling stockholder would own beneficially if
all such offered shares are sold.  None of the selling
stockholders is known to us to be a registered broker-dealer or an
affiliate of a registered broker-dealer.  Each of the
selling stockholders has acquired his, her or its shares solely for
investment and not with a view to or for resale or distribution of
such securities.  Beneficial ownership is determined in
accordance with SEC rules and includes voting or investment power
with respect to the securities.  The selling security holders
are under no obligation to sell all or any portion of the shares
listed below.

PLAN OF
DISTRIBUTION

 

Shares
Offered by the Selling Stockholders

 

The
selling security holders may sell some or all of their shares from
time to time at a fixed price of $.25 per share until our shares
are quoted on the OTCBB and thereafter at fixed prices, prevailing
market prices at the time of sale, at varying prices determined at
the time of sale, or privately negotiated prices. Prior to being
quoted on the OTCBB, shareholders may sell their shares in private
transactions to other individuals. As of the date of this
Prospectus, our common stock is traded on OTC Markets Pinksheets
and is very thinly traded, often with no trades taking place for a
significant amount of time.  Upon the effectiveness of this
Registration Statement, the Company plans to contact a market maker
to obtain a listing on the OTCBB. In order to be quoted on the
OTCBB, a market maker must file an application on its behalf in
order to make a market for the Company’s common stock. There
can be no assurance that a market maker shall agree to file the
necessary documents with FINRA, which operates the OTCBB, nor can
there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will
be approved or that our shares will be quoted on any
exchange.

 




II-16

 

  

 

 

Once a
market has been developed for the Company’s common stock, the
shares may be sold or distributed from time to time by the selling
stockholders directly to one or more purchasers or through brokers
or dealers who act solely as agents, at market prices prevailing at
the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market
prices, at negotiated prices or at fixed prices, which may be
changed. The distribution of the shares may be effected in one or
more of the following methods:

 




 



 





o



ordinary
brokers transactions, which may include long or short
sales,





o



transactions
involving cross or block trades on any securities or market where
our common stock is trading,





o



through
direct sales to purchasers or sales effected through
agents,





o



through
transactions in options, swaps or other derivatives (whether
exchange listed of otherwise), or





 



exchange
listed or otherwise), or





o



any
combination of the foregoing.  The selling stockholders may
also sell shares under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, if
available, rather than under this prospectus.




  

Brokers,
dealers, or agents participating in the distribution of the shares
may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or
commissions from the selling stockholders and/or the purchasers of
shares for whom such broker-dealers may act as agent or to whom
they may sell as principal, or both (which compensation as to a
particular broker-dealer may be in excess of customary
commissions). Neither the selling stockholders nor the Board
Directors of the Company can presently estimate the amount of such
compensation. It knows of no existing arrangements between the
selling stockholders and any other stockholder, broker, dealer or
agent relating to the sale or distribution of the shares. The
company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares
of the selling security holders pursuant to this prospectus. The
Company has agreed to bear the expenses of the registration of the
shares, including legal and accounting fees.

 

In
addition, in some states the shares of common stock may not be sold
unless such shares have been registered or qualified for sale in
such state or an exemption from registration or qualification is
available and is complied with.  There can be no
assurance that any selling stockholder will sell any or all of the
shares of common stock registered pursuant to the shelf
registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a
part.

 

Each
selling stockholder has informed us that it does not have any
agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person
to distribute the common stock.  None of the selling
stockholders who are affiliates of broker-dealers, other than the
initial purchasers in private transactions, purchased the shares of
common stock outside of the ordinary course of business or, at the
time of the purchase of the common stock, had any agreements, plans
or understandings, directly or indirectly, with any person to
distribute the securities.

 

We are
paying all fees and expenses incident to the registration of the
shares of common stock.  Except as provided for
indemnification of the selling stockholders, we are not obligated
to pay any of the expenses of any attorney or other advisor engaged
by a selling stockholder.  We have not agreed to
indemnify any selling stockholders against losses, claims, damages
and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities
Act.

 

If we are
notified by any selling stockholder that any material arrangement
has been entered into with a broker-dealer for the sale of shares
of common stock, if required, we will file a supplement to this
prospectus.  If the selling stockholders use this
prospectus for any sale of the shares of common stock, they will be
subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities
Act.

 

The
anti-manipulation rules of Regulation M under the Exchange Act may
apply to sales of our common stock and activities of the selling
stockholders, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of
any of the shares of common stock by the selling stockholders and
any other participating person.  Regulation M may also
restrict the ability of any person engaged in the distribution of
the shares of common stock to engage in passive market-making
activities with respect to the shares of common
stock.  Passive market making involves transactions in
which a market maker acts as both our underwriter and as a
purchaser of our common stock in the secondary
market.  All of




II-17

 

  

 

 

the
foregoing may affect the marketability of the shares of common
stock and the ability of any person or entity to engage in
market-making activities with respect to the shares of common
stock.

 

Once sold
under the registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a
part, the shares of common stock will be freely tradable in the
hands of persons other than our affiliates.

Cash
Dividends

 

As of the
date of this prospectus, the company has not paid any cash
dividends to stockholders. The declaration of any future cash
dividend will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and
will depend upon the earnings of the Company, if any, its capital
requirements and financial position, the general economic
conditions, and other pertinent conditions.  It is the
Company’s present intention not to pay any cash dividends in
the foreseeable future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in
its business operations.

the below described experts or counsel have been hired on a
contingent basis and none of them will receive a direct or indirect

DESCRIPTION
OF OUR BUSINESS

 

Executive
Summary

 

 Nexus
Enterprise Solutions, Inc. (“Nexus”) was incorporated
in the State of Wyoming on October 19, 1995 as Global Link
Technologies, Inc.  On June 10, 2008, Global Link Technologies
filed Articles of Amendment with the State of Wyoming changing its
name to MutuaLoan Corporation.  On September 16, 2011,
MutuaLoan Corporation entered into a business combination with
Nexus Business Solution, Inc., at which time it also amended its
Articles of Incorporation with the State of Wyoming to change its
name to Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc.  Nexus is currently
conducting operations and generating revenue.  On April 5,
2011, John Limansky was appointed as a director and also as Chief
Executive Officer of the Company.  On June 3, 2011, Maureen
Morgan Bokzam was appointed as a director and also as Vice
President.  In January of 2012, Jason Foster was appointed as
Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

 

The
Company has commenced full business operations and is generating
revenues.  The company does not consider itself to be a blank
check company as defined in Rule 419 of Regulation C of the
Securities Act of 1933.  Based upon the above, the Company
believes it is not within the scope of Rule 419.

 

The
Company has not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or
similar proceeding.

 

Because
its business is customer-driven, its revenue requirements will be
reviewed and adjusted based on sales.  The costs associated
with operating as a public company are included in its budget.
 Management will be responsible for the preparation of much of
the required documents to keep the costs to a minimum.
 Management believes that its revenue stream will be
sufficient to fund its operations over the next twelve
months.

 

The
Company has been issued an opinion by our auditors that raised
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern
based on its current financial position.  The ability to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company
generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the
necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its
liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next
twelve months with existing cash on hand, its revenue generation
and/or issuance of common shares.

 

Principal
services and their markets

 

Our
Company’s primary service is lead generation for its
customers.  Below, our lead generation service and process are
detailed in an effort to explain the methods by which the company
generates revenue.

 

LEAD
GENERATION DEFINITION: A lead,
in a marketing context, is a potential sales contact: an individual
or organization that expresses an interest in your goods or
services. Leads are typically obtained through the referral of an
existing customer, or through a direct response to
advertising/publicity.  A company's marketing department is
typically responsible for lead generation. Pursuing and closing
leads normally falls to the company's sales department. For
example, a vendor will display their wares at an industry trade
show, hoping to attract the attention of qualified buyers attending
the exhibit. Each inquiry for more vendor information would be a
"lead," which might subsequently be developed into a sale. A
company's lead generation efforts and its approach to dealing with
leads can significantly impact its success in the marketplace.
 Our lead generation services are derived from two separate
areas, which are online generation and offline
generation.

 

Online
generation

There are
many ways to generate leads online. Each has its own formula that
needs to be perfected in




II-19

 

  

 

 

order to
find the balance between quantity and quality. The online lead
generation methods used by the Company are as follows, with each
including a description of how the process involved with each type
of lead generation method is utilized.

 

1.
Proprietary Lead Portals : provides several ways for
advertisers to put targeted offers in front of a

buying
consumer audience via a proprietary network of websites all
specifically built for a broad or

specific
vertical. Advertisers pay per generated lead on a cost per lead
(the delivery of just the name and

contact
details) or cost per acquisition basis (an actual credit card paid
transaction.)

 

2.
Search engine optimization ( SEO ) : is the
process of improving the volume or quality of traffic to a website
from search engines via "natural" or un-paid ("organic" or
"algorithmic") search results as opposed to search engine marketing
(SEM) which deals with paid inclusion. Typically, the earlier (or
higher) a site appears in the search results list, the more
visitors it will receive from the search engine.  SEO may
target different kinds of search, including image search, local
search, video search, and industry-specific vertical search
engines. This gives a web site web presence.  As an Internet
marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work and what
people search for.  Optimizing a website primarily involves
editing its content and HTML and associated coding to both increase
its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the
indexing activities of search engines.

The
acronym "SEO" can refer to "search engine optimizers," a term
adopted by an industry of consultants who carry out optimization
projects on behalf of clients, and by employees who perform SEO
services in-house.  Search engine optimizers may offer SEO as
a stand-alone service or as a part of a broader marketing campaign.
Because effective SEO may require changes to the HTML source code
of a site,  SEO tactics may be incorporated into web site
development and design. The term "search engine friendly" may be
used to describe web site designs, menus, content management
systems, images, videos, shopping carts, and other elements that
have been optimized for the purpose of search engine exposure.
 Another class of techniques, known as black hat SEO or
spamdexing, use methods such as link farms, keyword stuffing and
article spinning that degrade both the relevance of search results
and the user experience of search engines. Search engines look for
sites that employ these techniques in order to remove them from
their indices.

 

3. Pay
Per Click: is an Internet advertising model used on websites,
in which advertisers pay their host only when their ad is clicked.
With search engines, advertisers typically bid on keyword phrases
relevant to their target market. Content sites commonly charge a
fixed price per click rather than use a bidding system.

 

Cost per
click (CPC) is the
amount of money an advertiser pays search engines and other
Internet publishers for a single click on its advertisement that
brings one visitor to its website.  In contrast to the
generalized portal, this seeks to drive a high volume of traffic to
one site, PPC implements so called affiliate model that provides
purchase opportunities wherever people may be surfing. It does this
by offering financial incentives (in the form of a percentage of
revenue) to affiliated partner sites. The affiliates provide
purchase-point click-through to the merchant. It is a pay-for
performance model—if an affiliate does not generate sales, it
represents no cost to the merchant. The affiliate model is
inherently well-suited to the web, which explains its popularity.
Variations include banner exchange, pay-per-click, and revenue
sharing programs.  

 

Websites
that utilize PPC ads will display an advertisement when a keyword
query matches an advertiser's keyword list, or when a content site
displays relevant content. Such advertisements are called
sponsored links or sponsored ads , and appear
adjacent to or above organic results on search engine results
pages, or anywhere a web developer chooses on a content
site.

 

Cost per
click (CPC) varies depending on the search engine and the level of
competition for a particular keyword.  The PPC advertising
model is open to abuse through click fraud, although Google and
others have implemented automated systems to guard against abusive
clicks by competitors or corrupt web developers.

 

4.
Email Advertising: is a form of direct marketing which uses
electronic mail as a means of communicating commercial or
fundraising messages to an audience. In its broadest sense, every
e-mail sent to a potential or current customer could be considered
e-mail marketing. However, the term is usually used to refer
to:

 




II-20

 

  

 

 

•
sending e-mails with the purpose of enhancing the relationship of a
merchant with its current or previous customers and to encourage
customer loyalty and repeat business,

 

•
sending e-mails with the purpose of acquiring new customers or
convincing current customers to

purchase
something immediately,

 

•
adding advertisements to e-mails sent by other companies to their
customers, and

 

•
sending e-mails over the Internet, as e-mail did and does exist
outside the Internet

Researchers
estimate that United States firms alone spent US$600 million on
e-mail marketing in 2008.

 

5.
Online Internet Publishers: are companies specializing in
lead generation and spend a great deal of money buying email,
search, and banner traffic to drive potential leads to proprietary
portals that they own. Using ads promoting information about
products and services, potential leads arrive at these portals at
which time they are required to fill out their full contact
information. The lead prospects see a variety of different
advertisements from all types of industries - healthcare, auto,
finance, and of course travel to name a few. The prospects then
choose freely what advertisements they are interested in by opting
into or filling out a custom form of each offer they want more
information about. After they clicked on a offer or filled out a
form, they then become a lead which will be delivered to an agency
or client real-time to email or a Contact Relationship Management
Solution. Since each lead opts in, the Internet publishers capture
the IP (“Internet Protocol”) address of the computer
each lead comes from, as well as the date and time of capture. This
protects an outbound call center against having anyone complain
against being on the Do Not Call List, because by opting in they
have given a company permission to call.

 

6.
Website Banner Advertisements: A web banner or
banner ad is a form of advertising on the World Wide Web.
This form of online advertising entails embedding an advertisement
into a web page. It is intended to attract traffic to a website by
linking to the website of the advertiser. The advertisement is
constructed from an image (GIF, JPEG, PNG), JavaScript program or
multimedia object employing technologies such as Java, Shockwave or
Flash, often employing animation, sound, or video to maximize
presence. Images are usually in a high-aspect ratio shape (i.e.
either wide and short, or tall and narrow) hence the reference to
banners. These images are usually placed on web pages that have
interesting content, such as a newspaper article or an opinion
piece. Affiliates earn money usually on a CPC (cost per click)
basis, for every unique user click on the ad, the affiliate earns
money.

 

The web
banner is displayed when a web page that references the banner is
loaded into a web browser.

This event
is known as an "impression". When the viewer clicks on the banner,
the viewer is directed to the website advertised in the banner.
This event is known as a "click through". In many cases, banners
are delivered by a central ad server.  When the advertiser
scans their log files and detects that a web user has visited the
advertiser's site from the content site by clicking on the banner
ad, the advertiser sends the content provider some small amount of
money (usually around five to ten US cents). This payback system is
often how the content provider is able to pay for the Internet
access to supply the content in the first place. Usually though,
advertisers use ad networks to serve their advertisements,
resulting in a revshare system and higher quality ad placement.
 Web banners function the same way as traditional
advertisements are intended to function: notifying consumers of the
product or service and presenting reasons why the consumer should
choose the product in question, although web banners differ in that
the results for advertisement campaigns may be monitored real-time
and may be targeted to the viewer's interests. Behavior is often
tracked through the use of a click tag.

 

Many web
surfers regard these advertisements as highly annoying because they
distract from a web page's

actual
content or waste bandwidth. (Of course, the purpose of the banner
ad is to attract attention and many advertisers try to get
attention to the advert by making them annoying. Without attracting
attention it would provide no revenue for the advertiser or for the
content provider.) Newer web browsers often include options to
disable pop-ups or block images from selected websites. Another way
of avoiding banners is to use a proxy server that blocks them, such
as Privoxy.

 

7.
Blogs: A weblog , web log or simply a
blog , is a web application which contains periodic
time-stamped posts on a common webpage. These posts are often but
not necessarily in reverse chronological order.  Such a
website would




II-21

 

  

 

 

typically
be accessible to any Internet user. "Weblog" is a portmanteau of
"web" and "log". The term "blog" came into common use as a way of
avoiding confusion with the term server log.

 

Blogs run
from individual diaries to arms of political campaigns, media
programs and corporations, and from the writing of one occasional
author to the collaboration of a large community of writers. Many
weblogs enable visitors to leave public comments, which can lead to
a community of readers centered around the blog; others are
non-interactive . The totality of weblogs or blog-related
websites is usually called the blogosphere. When a large amount of
activity, information and opinion erupts around a particular
subject or controversy in the blogosphere, it is commonly called a
blogstorm or blog swarm .  The format of weblogs
varies, from simple bullet lists of hyperlinks, to article
summaries with user provided comments and ratings. Individual
weblog entries are almost always date and time-stamped, with the
newest post at the top of the page. Because links are so important
to weblogs, most blogs have a way of archiving older entries and
generating a static address for individual entries; this static
link is referred to as a permalink. The latest headlines, with
hyperlinks and summaries, are offered in weblogs in the RSS or Atom
XML format, to be read with a feed reader.

 

A weblog
is edited, organized and published often through a content
management system or CMS .

 

8.
Social Networking: is a term that describes use of social
networks, online communities, blogs, wikis or any other online
collaborative media for marketing, sales, public relations and
customer service.

Common
social media marketing tools include Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook,
Flickr, Wikipedia, Orkut and YouTube.

 

In the
context of internet marketing, social media refers to a collective
group of web properties whose content is primarily published by
users, not direct employees of the property (e.g., the vast
majority of video on YouTube is published by non-YouTube
employees).

 

9.
Affiliate Networks: is an Internet-based marketing practice
in which a business rewards one or more affiliates for each visitor
or customer brought about by the affiliate's marketing efforts. It
is an application of crowdsourcing. Examples include rewards sites,
where users are rewarded with cash or gifts, for the completion of
an offer, and the referral of others to the site.

 

The
affiliate marketing industry has four core players: the merchant
(also known as 'retailer' or 'brand'), the network, the publisher
(also known as 'the affiliate') and the customer. The market has
grown in complexity to warrant a secondary tier of players,
including affiliate management agencies, superaffiliates and
specialized third parties vendors.

 

Affiliate
marketing overlaps with other Internet marketing methods to some
degree, because affiliates often use regular advertising methods.
Those methods include organic search engine optimization, paid
search engine marketing, e-mail marketing, and in some sense
display advertising. On the other hand, affiliates sometimes use
less orthodox techniques, such as publishing reviews of products or
services offered by a partner.

 

10.
Affiliate Programs: using one website to drive traffic to
another—is a form of online marketing, which is frequently
overlooked by advertisers. While search engines, e-mail, and
website syndication capture much of the attention of online
retailers, affiliate marketing carries a much lower profile. Still,
affiliates continue to play a significant role in e-retailers'
marketing strategies.

 

Offline
Lead Generation

Live Phone
Lead Transfer Division

Using a
combination of a predictive dialer call center solution and an
overseas outsourced call center solution, management will generate
custom live transfer leads for the education, debt settlement,
mortgage, and travel lead vertical. Management has consulted with
some of the current leaders in the call center space, and is
confident that a high volume of live leads can be generated and
sold for a profit. A pre-screened custom real-time live lead is
considered the best type of lead for any sales organization.
 From this fact alone, it is possible to charge high prices
for leads generated by the division in order to meet profitability
goals and acquisition costs goals for the client. Competitive
pricing will be determined from the ability to generate a certain
volume of leads/day for each custom

Scaling up or down for any campaign will be determined each day
from the Live Phone Lead Transfer Division Sales Manager whom will
be monitoring all campaigns each business day from the Internet and

continually grab market share through a full commission sales
force, tradeshows, networking, and a website.

 

Revenue
Model and Distribution methods of the products or
services

Our
revenue model is based on customer development.  We allow
accredited brokers to sell their leads through our system so long
as they meet the stringent criteria of our system. The majority of
our brokers are required to have their own leads to qualify and are
vetted through our fraud filters in order to ensure
quality.

 

We are
currently focusing our attention on the auto insurance market, but
expect to expand to other verticals in the very near
future.

 

Nexus
Enterprise Solutions, Inc. (Nexus) is redefining the current
prospect and lead generation and acquisition industry by developing
an information exchange marketplace which allows sellers and buyers
of leads, and other information assets, to operate in an optimized,
transparent, and efficient way to transact deals without the
devaluation experienced in today’s markets and systems. 
This is accomplished primarily through systems and processes which
enable disintermediation and enhanced business intelligence and
management thereby empowering stakeholders on both sides of the
transaction to make well-informed and meaningful connections with
each other

 

A second
source of our Company’s revenue is our fee for service
option. The cost of developing an automated system such as ours is
prohibitive for a majority of companies. We fulfill a need by
allowing these companies to use our technology, forms, landing
pages etc, for a fee. We currently are back logged with the amount
of companies looking to buy and sell leads to us, our carriers and
agencies. In return, we get compensated on the buy and sell side of
the transaction.

 

The
Company will identify and address the target market for its
services with market research and feedback from its
customers.

Competition

We see
very little competition for our business model, and do not
anticipate such competition to become significant in the
future.

 

Platform

Lead
generation services do exist. However, our automated solution is a
mass market product that enables potential buyers and sellers to
quickly purchase and sell various leads. We are in the process of
creating and operating a platform which will create a new method
for facilitating such transactions.

 

Strategy

Structured
as a technology services company, our business model is designed to
provide an automated solution to the lead generating process. We
anticipate in the near future having a solid footprint with minimal
competition.

and availability of raw materials and the names of principal
suppliers

 

The
Company does not rely on any “real” raw materials.

Patents
and Trademarks

 

The
Company currently has no patents or trademarks on its brand name;
however, as business develops and operations continue, it may seek
such protection.  Despite efforts to protect its proprietary
rights, such as its brand and product line names, since it has no
patent or trademark rights unauthorized persons may attempt to copy
aspects of the Company business, including its web site design,
services, product information and sales mechanics or to obtain and
use information that it regards as proprietary,. Any encroachment
upon the company proprietary information, including the
unauthorized use of its brand name, the use of a similar name by a
competing company or a lawsuit initiated against it for
infringement upon another company's proprietary information or
improper use of their trademark, may affect its ability to create
brand name recognition, cause customer confusion and/or have a
detrimental effect on its business.  Litigation or proceedings
before the U.S. or International Patent and Trademark Offices may
be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property
rights, to protect its trade secrets and domain name and/or to
determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of
others.  Any such litigation or adverse proceeding could
result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could
seriously harm our business operations and/or results of
operations.

 

 

Government
Approval

 

The
company does not require any government approval for its services.
 As a lead generation service provider, its business will not
be subject to any environmental laws.

 

Government
and Industry Regulation

 

The
Company will be subject to local and international laws and
regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations.
 It will also be subject to common business and tax rules and
regulations pertaining to the operation of its business.  The
Company believes that the effects of existing or probable
governmental regulations will be additional responsibilities of the
management of the Company to ensure that the Company is in
compliance with securities regulations as they apply to the
Company’s products as well as ensuring that the company does
not infringe on any proprietary rights of others with respect to
its products.   The Company will also need to maintain
accurate financial records in order to remain complaint with
securities regulations as well as any corporate tax liability it
incurs.  

 

Research
and Development Activities

 

Other
than personal time spent researching our proposed business, the
Company has spent additional funds on research and development that
was included as part of consulting services received to date. It
does not plan to spend any further funds on research and
development activities in the future.

 

Employees
and Employment Agreements

Penny
Stock Rules

 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules that regulate
broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny
stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price
of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain
national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system,
provided that current price and volume information with respect to
transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or
system).

 

A
purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to
sell the stock. The shares offered by this prospectus constitute
penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act.  The shares
will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future.  The
classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a
broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which
makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate his/her
investment.  Any broker-dealer engaged by the purchaser for
the purpose of selling his or her shares in us will be subject to
Rules 15g-1 through 15g-10 of the Securities and Exchange Act.
 Rather than creating a need to comply with those rules, some
broker-dealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny
stock.

 

The penny
stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a
penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a
standardized risk disclosure document, which:

a.

contains a
description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny
stock in both public offerings and secondary trading;

b.

contains a
description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and
of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect
to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the
Securities Act of 1934, as amended;

c.

contains a
brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including
"bid" and "ask"  price for the penny stock and the
significance of the spread between the bid and ask
price;

d.

contains a
toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary
actions;

e.

defines
significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of
trading penny stocks; and

f.

contains
such other information and is in such form (including language,
type, size and format) as the Securities and Exchange Commission
shall require by rule or regulation;

 

The
broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction
in a penny stock, to the customer:

 

a.

the bid
and offer quotations for the penny stock;

b.

the
compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the
transaction;

c.

the number
of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other
comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the
market for such stock; and

d.

monthly
account statements showing the market value of each penny stock
held in the customer's  account.




II-25

 

  

 

 

 

In
addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction
in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the
broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the
penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive
the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk
disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving
penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability
statement.  These disclosure requirements will have the effect
of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our
stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules.
Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling their
securities.

MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION

Overview

Nexus
Enterprise Solutions, Inc. (“Nexus”) was incorporated
in the State of Wyoming on October 19, 1995 as Global Link
Technologies, Inc.  On June 10, 2008, Global Link Technologies
filed Articles of Amendment with the State of Wyoming changing its
name to MutuaLoan Corporation.  On September 16, 2011,
MutuaLoan Corporation entered into a business combination with
Nexus Business Solution, Inc., at which time it also amended its
Articles of Incorporation with the State of Wyoming to change its
name to Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc.  Nexus is currently
conducting operations and generating revenue.

  

The
Company operations are currently being conducted out of the Company
office located at 5340 N Federal Hwy STE 206 Lighthouse Point, FL
33406 1375; (561) 767-4346.

 

Results
of Operations      

 

We have
generated $29,877 in revenue from our inception on June 13,
2011through December 31, 2011 and we have incurred $37,282 in cost
of sales for the same period.  We have incurred $300,521 in
operating expenses for the period from June 13, 2011 (inception)
through December 31, 2011.  We generated $349,381 in revenue
for the six months ended June 30, 2012, and incurred $222,700 of
cost of sales and total operating expenses of $1,153,063 for the
six months ended June 30, 2012. Our sales have increased steadily
since the 4 th
quarter of
2011. We anticipate continued revenue growth over the next 12
months as our website becomes more visible to search engines on the
internet. Our cost of sales grows in correlation with our sales but
not proportionately. We pay a percentage of the fees we earn for
directing internet traffic to the insurance companies to those who
direct the internet traffic to our

website.
As more customers access our website directly we will pay a smaller
percentage of revenues to other websites even though the total cost
of sales is expected to increase.  In our initial stages of
operations we incurred considerable costs through the issuance of
shares of our common stock to the consultants involved in
developing our business plan and marketing approach. Our research
and development expense was $51,301 from inception through December
31, 2011, and $173,644 for the six months ended June 30, 2012. We
incurred the research and development costs in developing our
website. We expect to continuously update our website but that such
maintenance will be less costly going forward.

 

We
incurred a net loss of $326,754 for the period from inception
through December 31, 2011 and $1,030,204 for the six months ended
June 30, 2012. We expect our net losses to decrease over the next
twelve months as our revenues increase and our operating expenses
decrease. We do not anticipate the need to hire additional staff to
handle the increased sales as our sales are processed by our
website computer servers.

Other
than the shares offered by this prospectus, no other source of
capital has been has been identified or sought.  If we succeed
in developing clients for our services and generating sufficient
sales, we will become profitable.  We cannot guarantee that
this will ever occur.  Our plan is to continue operating in a
manner which will be successful. If the company must obtain capital
to continue its operations in addition to its current revenue
stream, the Company will generate cash flow through the sale of its
common stock.  

 

Going
Concern

 

In its
audited financial statements as of December 31, 2011, the Company
was issued an opinion by its auditors that raised substantial doubt
about the ability to continue as a going concern based on the
company current financial position.

 

Immediate
Plan of Operation:

 

At
present management will concentrate on the completion of the
Registration Statement while concurrently continuing to expand its
customer base and develop its lead generation methods and services.
 

 

Continuing
Plan of Operation:

 

Successful
growth and development of the company business strategy depends on
the basic principles of supply, demand, and correlated values are
completely askew in the current lead and information asset
marketplace – especially in the insurance and financial
services verticals.  Some of the devaluation of these products
can be

attributed
to commoditization in a matured market; however, most of the forces
causing this downward spiral of value can be directly attributed to
the following factors:

 

·         Extensive
and growing intermediation between buyers and sellers

 

·
        Selling Legs to
Carriers, Agencies and Aggregators

 

·
        Forging
partnerships to increase our lead traffic

 

·         Information
quality issues driven in part from overall lower pricing to the
seller

 

·         Cost
prohibition and lack of technology expertise for many smaller,
medium, and some large players,

provides a
substantial barrier that forces many sellers to leverage long
established aggregation partners

 

·         Market
manipulation by larger players through exclusivity and preferred
partner arrangements

 

·         Matured
Internet marketing techniques such as Search Engine Optimization
(SEO), Search Engine Marketing

(SEM),
online advertising, etc., have driven marketing costs up to the
point many good marketing companies have had to shift to other
channels reducing available high quality sourced leads

 

A
significant opportunity exists for the creation of an open market
exchange that provides transparency, visibility, quality, control,
and disintermediation to all participants.  The initial
verticals of insurance and other financial services leads are
candidates to start, but there are multiple other verticals and
applications of the core technologies and systems which comprise
the Nexus Exchange platform.  The continuing plan of the
Company’s operations will be to expand our lead generation
services, which the Company believes will also expand its customer
base and revenue stream.

 

Concurrent
Developments (0-12 months)

The
Company will continue to develop and add to its customer base
through marketing and advertising, while also adding verticals to
its already existing services.  The goal for the Company in
the next twelve months is to further develop its lead generation
services, while also facilitating larger numbers of lasting
connections between its customers and their clients through lead
generation derived from search engine marketing and online as well
as offline techniques.

Expansion Continues With Push Into Life Insurance Lead GenerationMarketwiredOctober 31, 2013ReblogShareTweetShareLIGHTHOUSE POINT, FL--(Marketwired - Oct 31, 2013) -  Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc. (  OTCQB :  NXES ) announced today that the company has signed an agreement with Josh Docktor, CEO of e-InsuranceLeads.com and DocktorsInsurance.com, to provide direct access to a nationwide network of independent life insurance agents for the sale of life insurance leads by Nexus Enterprise Solutions.With the success of its NexChangeMarketplace™ System, Nexus has experienced strong revenue growth in the auto insurance lead generation sector. Nexus is acting decisively to continue and even accelerate its current revenue growth trend by moving into the parallel insurance industry verticals of life, home and health insurance. With the majority of its development costs already committed, the ability of Nexus to improve bottom line results concurrently with growing revenues is being pursued by leveraging its robust, maturing infrastructure for lead generation management into multiple market sectors.One of the key components of the lead generation supply chain is a strong customer base of independent sales agents in need of higher-quality, more affordable prospecting data. This constituency of lead buyers is a foundational sales channel for Nexus as it builds out its presence in the life insurance sector."Josh Docktor is trusted by independent insurance agents across the United States for his expertise in helping them stay on the cutting edge of sales practices, products and technology which is critical to their continued business success," stated James Bayardelle, CEO of Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc. "One of the key components of the lead generation supply chain is a strong customer base of independent sales agents who are actively seeking higher-quality, more affordable prospecting data. Josh Docktor's ability to serve a vast network of these agents, combined with the fact that he is a producing agent himself selling insurance products in over 36 states, has built him a reputation that is second to none in helping to drive the success of the independent agent community. We are pleased to report we are already making sales through this new partnership initiative," added Bayardelle."Nexus has the prospecting data engine that the independent agent community is searching for and I am proud to be a part of their effort to create a sea-change in the quality and affordability of leads available to independent brokerages across the country," commented Josh Docktor. "Their NexChangeMarketplace™ System is a breakthrough in that it provides not only high quality prospecting data for big carriers, but also provides a suite of solutions that will consistently deliver data of equal quality and maintain an affordable price structure to support thousands of independent, smaller brokerages," added Docktor.About Nexus Enterprise Solutions, Inc.

Local Buffer and Public Cloud for Growth and Usage Spikes

HPE Flexible Capacity prepares you for growth and gives you the agility to get applications to market right away—in minutes—without waiting months to expand the IT infrastructure and budget. So how does it work?
HPE works with you to forecast current and projected capacity—for a minimum commitment—and then creates a local buffer of IT resources beyond what you need now, that you can dip into as needed. The extra capacity is ready to be activated when you need more capacity, and it can easily expand into the Azure public cloud when needed. This ensures you have extra capacity deployed ahead of any oncoming demand.

Cloud-like Economics

The traditional mode of purchasing IT infrastructure often results in provisioning capacity that’s too high or too low for your IT needs. For example, you may spend money on unused capacity to handle unexpected growth, or struggle to meet demand when you don’t have enough capacity, or both.
HPE Flexible Capacity is a service for consumption-based IT payment that aligns cash flow to actual metered capacity usage. By deploying a flexible amount of capacity ahead of oncoming demand, you end up paying only for what you use with no upfront capital outlay.
