											About Us
										

True Partnership






Personally Invested in your Success
Reinsurance is a relationship business and we continually strive to live up to the promise of our name, PartnerRe, and to be the reinsurer that clients and brokers go to for a resourceful risk-discussion partner.  Watch our Brand Story to find out more about how we help insurance companies succeed.  

Partnership Starts with a Conversation
Partnership has always meant long-term stability and delivering on promises. While those qualities remain important, we believe we can do more. We know our experience, expertise and track record are only meaningful if we are able to help our clients, and that is only possible if we know what they want, what they need and what they expect. So our clients can count on us to listen carefully to their goals and challenges and to leverage our deep resources in order to deliver an appropriate solution.
In addition to our core reinsurance offerings, we are able to meet a wide variety of needs. Below are some case studies giving examples of solutions we have tailored to meet the needs of individual clients as well as broader markets.


Cut-through Facility
Protects Key Accounts
A rating downgrade threatened our client’s key accounts. We reacted immediately to help protect their business as they sought to transition back to a stronger financial position.


Data Analytics Achieves
Top Market Position
Despite an exceptional service offering, our client faced strong price competition in a mature market. Our analytics experts unlocked and restructured their data to substantially improve their group life rates and increase their competitiveness.


Loss Portfolio Transfer
Enables Growth
Our client had identified a growth opportunity to enter a new market and line of business. They needed additional capital. A customized LPT was the perfect solution.


New Health Product Answers
the Call of Affordable Care
Our clients were concerned about the assumption of significant risk arising from the Affordable Care Act (ACA). We developed a new, cost-effective ACO insurance product, enabling them to assume extra risk AND invest in important cost-saving initiatives.


Capital for a Recovering
Mortgage Sector
After the financial crisis, we helped mortgage insurers with unique capital relief solutions, ensuring they were well positioned to benefit from new growth opportunities.


New Range of Health Services
to Manage Escalating Costs
With client concerns about mounting medical claims costs, we expanded our risk solution, PULSE + Plus™, to include an even wider range of services for risk assessment, medical and catastrophic claim management and cost containment.

Opinions & Research





This award-winning, free App was developed by PartnerRe for property insurance underwriters, insurance portfolio managers, actuaries and intermediaries. The App visualizes the physical parameters of thousands of worldwide past, and potential future, extreme storm events. It is a valuable go-to reference for comparing storm events with exposures in property insurance portfolios and, where applicable, for considering the potential impact of the current ENSO forecast.
The latest version of PartnerResearch is fully updated with 2015-2016 storm data and includes the newly added functionalities of (1) ENSO tagging and (2) examples of generated extreme storm events that have not occurred within the historical experience period, but which are physically possible.

Wind field of a stochastic 1-in-250 year storm affecting central Europe.Wind field of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 hitting Miami, Florida.

At a touch:

View the path, extent and intensity of over 4,700 historic extreme storm events, some dating back 116 years, from Australia, Central Pacific, Eastern Pacific, North West Pacific, North Atlantic and Europe.
For tropical cyclones, find out whether a storm occurred in an “El Niño”, “La Niña” or “ENSO-neutral” period. For any location, identify exactly how many storms occurred within each ENSO state. Consider what this could mean for a portfolio given the current ENSO forecast.
View the path, extent and intensity of 147 generated “stochastic” storms for the U.S., Europe and the Caribbean – these are exceptional, 1-in-250 year storm events that have not yet been recorded, but which are physically possible. How, for example, do these compare with the historically recorded storms for a location? How might this impact PML calculations?
Easily select, compare and/ or save storms by name, location and year. See how many storms have affected a particular area and how severe they were. How did one storm compare to another? e.g. for Miami, how did the maximum wind speed of Hurricane Donna (1960) compare to Hurricane Andrew (1992)? Or for Japan, how did Typhoon Vera’s geographical footprint (1959) compare to that of Typhoon Mireille (1991)?

Use the data the experts are using
The App was developed by PartnerRe, incorporating wind fields from its advanced proprietary models.

											About Us
										

True Partnership






Personally Invested in your Success
Reinsurance is a relationship business and we continually strive to live up to the promise of our name, PartnerRe, and to be the reinsurer that clients and brokers go to for a resourceful risk-discussion partner.  Watch our Brand Story to find out more about how we help insurance companies succeed.  

Partnership Starts with a Conversation
Partnership has always meant long-term stability and delivering on promises. While those qualities remain important, we believe we can do more. We know our experience, expertise and track record are only meaningful if we are able to help our clients, and that is only possible if we know what they want, what they need and what they expect. So our clients can count on us to listen carefully to their goals and challenges and to leverage our deep resources in order to deliver an appropriate solution.
In addition to our core reinsurance offerings, we are able to meet a wide variety of needs. Below are some case studies giving examples of solutions we have tailored to meet the needs of individual clients as well as broader markets.


Cut-through Facility
Protects Key Accounts
A rating downgrade threatened our client’s key accounts. We reacted immediately to help protect their business as they sought to transition back to a stronger financial position.


Data Analytics Achieves
Top Market Position
Despite an exceptional service offering, our client faced strong price competition in a mature market. Our analytics experts unlocked and restructured their data to substantially improve their group life rates and increase their competitiveness.


Loss Portfolio Transfer
Enables Growth
Our client had identified a growth opportunity to enter a new market and line of business. They needed additional capital. A customized LPT was the perfect solution.


New Health Product Answers
the Call of Affordable Care
Our clients were concerned about the assumption of significant risk arising from the Affordable Care Act (ACA). We developed a new, cost-effective ACO insurance product, enabling them to assume extra risk AND invest in important cost-saving initiatives.


Capital for a Recovering
Mortgage Sector
After the financial crisis, we helped mortgage insurers with unique capital relief solutions, ensuring they were well positioned to benefit from new growth opportunities.


New Range of Health Services
to Manage Escalating Costs
With client concerns about mounting medical claims costs, we expanded our risk solution, PULSE + Plus™, to include an even wider range of services for risk assessment, medical and catastrophic claim management and cost containment.
