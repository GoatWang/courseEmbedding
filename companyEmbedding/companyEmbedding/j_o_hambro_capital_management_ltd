https://www.johcm.co.uk/certify/welcome





                 
            



                J O Hambro Capital Management (JOHCM) was launched in 1993 as an independently managed investment management boutique who are a global business managing money for clients from many different countries. They offer an alternative to the large, traditional investment management firms that have dominated the market for many years having built their business by hiring "best in class" proven fund managers that work in small teams and manage money according to the investment styles that they have developed over their long careers. J O Hambro have an excellent record of investment professional retention. They currently manage equity funds through a total of 16 different strategies, covering UK, Europe (including and excluding UK), Japan, Asia ex Japan, Global (including and excluding US) and Global Emerging Markets strategies. Each of their strategies has a defined capacity limit and have a track record of soft closing strategies to new investors. JOHCM is owned by BT Investment Management (BTIM), a leading, Australian listed fund management firm and a prominent Australian equity manager. All JOHCM investment professionals and staff have equity participation in listed BTIM shares.  JOHCM continues to operate as a stand-alone boutique within the BTIM Group. JOHCM is a significant part of the BTIM Group, providing close to 50% of profits. JOHCM’s company name, strategy range and distinctive investment performance-led approach will remain unchanged. Full investment and operational independence will remain with JOHCM. The key principles of fund manager compensation are entrenched in the firm and have been enhanced to provide additional long-term retention and incentivisation. In 2011, JOHCM won the Specialist Group of the Year award at Investment Week's Fund Manager of the Year Awards 2011. In 2010, JOHCM won the European Asset Management Company of the Year (assets under €20 billion) at funds europe awards 2010. In 2009, JOHCM were shortlisted for Specialist Asset Manager of the Year at funds Europe award 2009

J O Hambro Capital Management Selects Advisers Investment Trust 
Asset manager J O Hambro Capital Management Limited (JOHCM), based in London, has selected the Advisers Investment Trust for their U.S. mutual fund products. The Advisers Investment Trust is a turnkey series trust solution provided by Northern Trust in conjunction with Beacon Hill Fund Services.
Chicago, May 6, 2014 —
Asset manager J O Hambro Capital Management Limited ("JOHCM"), based in London, has selected the Advisers Investment Trust for their U.S. mutual fund products.  The Advisers Investment Trust is a turnkey series trust solution provided by Northern Trust in conjunction with Beacon Hill Fund Services. 
Northern Trust will provide back office operations such as fund accounting, fund administration, transfer agency and custody. Beacon Hill will serve as distributor and provide business management and governance services for the funds.
J O Hambro Capital Management Limited is an investment boutique with offices in London, Singapore and New York. With $21.8 billion of assets across a range of funds and segregated portfolios, JOHCM has expertise in equity mandates that span the globe. Its U.S. mutual funds will offer clients exposure to JOHCM's Asian, emerging markets, global, and international strategies.
"We selected the Advisers Investment Trust because of its focus on superior client service," said Helen Vaughan, Chief Operating Officer at JOHCM. "Northern Trust showed the willingness and flexibility to work with us and presented the best solution for our needs that will allow us to grow our business in the U.S. mutual fund arena."
"We are excited to expand our relationship with JOHCM," said Dan Houlihan, head of Global Fund Services in North America for Northern Trust. "The Advisers Investment Trust is a vehicle that can help simplify the entrance into the '40 Act space, particularly for foreign advisers.  Our ability to provide this solution validates our commitment to the mutual fund business while continuing to supply the high-touch service for which Northern Trust is known."

Northern Trust's Global Fund Services business provides custody, fund administration, and investment operations outsourcing solutions to investment managers across the globe and across the spectrum of asset classes.
