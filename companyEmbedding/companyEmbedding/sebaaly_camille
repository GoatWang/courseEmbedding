                "The Future Of Medicine"           Topoisomerase II is an enzyme that aggressive cancer cells make too much of. When the cell is able to make a lot of the Topoisomerase II  enzyme, it becomes able to proliferate and metastasize; so, if you can inhibit or destroy the activity of Topoisomerase II, you would then be  able to prevent cancer cells from spreading.           Our  Proprietary Technology Our licensor, Advanomics Corporation, has developed a way to replace the diester bond with a Carbon-Difluoride bond which acts as a perfect diester isostere.  This technology allows us to create a large variety of therapeutic compounds that are completely stable and often more active than the original drugs.  This unique capability allowed us to create our Lead Compound, Adva-27a, an effective and highly specific Topoisomerase II (Top2) Inhibitor.      Our Carbon-Difluoride Technology is covered by issued and pending patents filed under PCT/FR2003/002330 and PCT/FR2007/000697     Adva-27a is 16-times more effective at killing multidrug resistant  breast cancer cells than Etoposide, the drug currently in use.  Adva-27a is unaffected by P-Glycoprotein, the enzyme responsible for making cancer cells resistant to anti-tumor drugs.  Adva-27a has excellent clearance time (half-life = 54 minutes) as indicated by human microsomes stability studies.  Adva-27a clearance is independent of Cytochrome P450, a mechanism that is less likely to produce toxic intermediates.  Adva-27a is an excellent inhibitor of Topoisomerase ll with an IC50 of only 13.7 micromolar.  Adva-27a has shown excellent pharmacokinetics profile as indicated by studies done in rats  Adva-27a's initial indication will be multidrug resistant breast cancer for which there are little or no treatment options        Our Published Data show that Adva-27a is a true Topoisomerase ll Inhibitor and is significantly more effevtive at killing aggressive cancer cells than Etoposide, the current drug of choice.        Check out SBFM's drug Adva-27a (27a) vs the leading chem drug Etoposide (2) - results are better in every category except two. And in the multi drug resistance breast cancer category (MCF7R) it's over 3x more effective.           Unique Features of Adva-27a    * Adva-27a can be taken orally. * Adva-27a is not a so-called me-too drug; our technology is unique. Adva-27a will be the only Topoisomerase ll Inhibitor on the Market. * Adva-27a's initial indication will be multi-drug resistant breast cancer. Adva-27a can be used to treat other Top2 Positive Cancer Types (Prostate, Colon, Lung, Stomach, Ovarian).   Sunshine Biopharma Drug Pipeline  Adva-27a - Completed Preclinicals Compound for Small-Cell Lung Cancer - In Preclinical Studies A Third RNAi-Based Drug    They have been changing the timeline for years Now “mid/late 2017” now to start phase 1. Anyone can review past quarterlies to see that it keeps on sliding to the right. Share structure will be raised to 3B as stated here http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1402328/000135448816006700/sbfm_10k.htm Yes, dilution is going nuts, and I sure wouldn’t mind the 35% discount. Pretty much the saga continues. Imo.  Just a few random excerpts. Mostly for my own notes.  1st Q 2016  Common Stock, $0.001 per share; Authorized 500,000,000 Shares; Issued and outstanding 232,876,353 and 198,265,118 at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively   Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding 215,596,040 78,942,780  Note 1 – Descriptions of Business In July 2014, the Company formed a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, Sunshine Biopharma Canada Inc. (“Sunshine Canada”) for the purposes of conducting pharmaceutical business in Canada and elsewhere around the globe. Sunshine Canada is currently working on securing a Drug Establishment License from Health Canada and signing manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution contracts for various generic pharmaceuticals for sale in Canada and overseas.

The note is collateralized by the Patent. Pursuant to an amendment agreement effective December 28, 2015, this note was cancelled and replaced with a new note having a face value of $210,519, comprised of $155,940 in principal amount which is the seller’s (Advanomics Corporation, a related party) book value of the Patent plus $54,579 as an adjustment for the currency exchange difference, which was expensed immediately. This new, interest-free Note is automatically convertible into a fixed number of 80,968,965 shares of the Company’s $0.001 par value Common Stock upon the Company completing an increase in its authorized capital such that a sufficient number of Common shares is available for issuance. However, if the Company does not increase its capitalization within 90 days from the date of the Note, interest will begin to accrue at the rate of 10% per annum.

Note 12 – Subsequent Events In April 2016, the Directors of the Company were issued an aggregate of 36,000,000 shares of the Company’s $0.001 par value Common Stock (12,000,000 shares per Director) in consideration for services rendered through December 31, 2015 valued at $36,000. Our principal place of business is located at 469 Jean-Talon West, 3rd Floor, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3N 1R4. Our phone number is (514) 764-9698 and our website address is www.sunshinebiopharma.com.   We have not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.  Comparison of Results of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 (excerpt) General and administrative expenses during the three month period ended March 31, 2016 were $69,682, compared to general and administrative expense of $124,825 incurred during the three month period ended March 31, 2015, a decrease of $55,143. This decrease is primarily attributable to the elimination of the $50,000 license fee we incurred during 2015 that we did not incur in the three months ended March 31, 2016 because we acquired the patent rights which were the subject of the license fee.  As a result, we incurred a net loss of $305,294 ($0.00 per share) for the three month period ended March 31, 2016, compared to a net loss of $294,367 ($0.00 per share) during the three month period ended March 31, 2015.  Acquisition of Patents (excerpt)  ...we executed the aforesaid amendments to the original Patent Purchase Agreements which provided for (i) reduction of the purchase price of the Patents from $17,142,499 to $618,810, the Advanomics book value of the Patents, (ii) elimination of all cash payments obligations, and (iii) automatic convertibility of the new promissory notes for the new purchase price into an aggregate of 321,305,415 shares of Common Stock upon our increasing our authorized capital such that this number of Common Shares can be issued.  GMP Manufacturing (excerpt) In June 2015 we received a sample of the scale-up manufacturing process for evaluation and confirmation of adherence to specifications. Based upon our laboratory analyses, the sample meets all of the required chemical, physical and biological specifications. The amount of material (the “Yield”) generated by this pilot run was found to be significantly lower than anticipated and we are currently working towards finding possible solutions to increase the Yield. If the timetable for generating the 2-kilogram quantity is met, of which there can be no assurance, and subject to receipt of the necessary financing, also for which no assurances can be provided, we expect to move into Phase I of our clinical trials in mid to late 2017.  Pursuant to the terms of the Lonza Agreement, Lonza will manufacture our drug in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) in compliance with the regulations applicable in the U.S., Canada, Europe and other countries around the world relating to the manufacturing of medicinal products for human use. Lonza will build a master drug file for our Adva-27a drug and will have it ready for filing with regulatory authorities as may be required to secure ultimate drug approval. The Lonza Agreement provides for us to maintain one representative of our Company at their facility during the manufacturing process. Quality assurance and control is the responsibility of both Lonza and us during the process. http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1402328/000135448816007274/sbfm_10q.htm  http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1402328/000135448816006700/sbfm_10k.htm   =================================   January 29, 2014 S-4 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1402328/000135448814000422/sbfm_s4.htm  followed again by another withdrawel https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1402328/000135448814002116/sbfm_rw.htm  RCMP Canada. http://www.rcmp.gc.ca/en http://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/reportincident-signalerincident/index-eng.htm  SEC Complaint process https://denebleo.sec.gov/TCRExternal/index.xhtml ==================================================================           http://sunshinebiopharma.com/investor/press-releases/        Sunshine Biopharma Media Contacts: Renmark Financial Communications Inc.

Slilaty Interview   FDA links: http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/seac/index        We were incorporated in the State of Colorado on August 31, 2006 under the name “Mountain West Business Solutions, Inc.”  During our fiscal year ended July 31, 2009 our business was to provide management consulting with regard to accounting, computer and general business issues for small and home-office based companies.  Effective October 15, 2009, we executed an agreement to acquire Sunshine Biopharma, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“SBI”), in exchange for the issuance of 21,962,000 shares of our Common Stock and 850,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, each convertible into twenty (20) shares of our Common Stock (the “Agreement”).  As a result of this transaction our officers and directors resigned their positions with us and were replaced by our current management.  Following completion of this transaction we changed our name to “Sunshine Biopharma, Inc.”.  On December 21, 2011, Advanomics Corporation, a privately held Canadian company (“Advanomics”), and our licensor, exercised its right to convert the 850,000 shares of Series “A” Preferred Stock it held in our Company into 17,000,000 shares of Common Stock.     Intellectual Property    We are the exclusive licensee for the U.S. territory of Advanomics Corporation’s Adva-27a which is covered by international patent applications filed on April 27, 2007 (PCT/FR2007/000697).  These patent applications, which are now issued in Europe and the United States (US 8,236,935) and are still pending elsewhere around the world, were originally owned by Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Rouen (France) and have recently been purchased by Advanomics Corporation.  On January 14, 2013, Advanomics Corporation filed a new patent application covering Adva-27a manufacturing processes as well as new Adva-27a derivatives and compositions.     Advanomics  http://www.canada-companies-info.com/advanomics-corporationcorporation-advanomics-65q2 Advanomics Corporation, the Parent Company of Sunshine Biopharma     Head Office: Advanomics Corporation 2015 Peel Street 5th Floor Montreal, Quebec H3A 1T8 Canada  Tel: 514-764-9698 Fax: 514-764-9699 info@advanomics.com Sunshine Biopharma Media Contacts: Renmark Financial Communications Inc.
