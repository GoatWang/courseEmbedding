First Trust High Income Long/Short Fund Increases its Monthly Common 
      Share Distribution to $0.1262 Per Share for August






July 20, 2017 04:35 PM Eastern Daylight Time



WHEATON, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--First Trust High Income Long/Short Fund (the "Fund") (NYSE: FSD) has 
      increased its regularly scheduled monthly common share distribution to 
      $0.1262 per share from $0.1255 per share. The distribution will be 
      payable on August 15, 2017, to shareholders of record as of August 3, 
      2017. The ex-dividend date is expected to be August 1, 2017. The monthly 
      distribution information for the Fund appears below.
    




First Trust High Income Long/Short Fund 
            (FSD):



           
        





          Distribution per share:
        



          $0.1262
        



          Distribution Rate based on the July 19, 2017 NAV of $18.24:
        



          8.30%
        



          Distribution Rate based on the July 19, 2017 closing market price of 
          $17.09:
        



          8.86%
        



          Increase from the previous distribution of $0.1255:
        



          0.56%
        



      A portion of this distribution may come from net investment income, net 
      short-term realized capital gains or return of capital. The final 
      determination of the source and tax status of all 2017 distributions 
      will be made after the end of 2017 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV.
    

      Effective with the monthly distribution declared on February 21, 2017, 
      and continuing for all distributions declared during the following 
      eleven months, the Fund's Board of Trustees approved the commencement of 
      a distribution policy that provides for the declaration of monthly 
      distributions to common shareholders of the Fund at an annual minimum 
      fixed rate of 8.5% based on the Fund's average monthly NAV per share 
      over the prior twelve months.
    

      The Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company that 
      seeks to provide current income. The Fund has a secondary objective of 
      capital appreciation. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment 
      objectives by investing, under normal market conditions, a majority of 
      its assets in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and foreign (including 
      emerging markets) high yield corporate fixed-income securities of 
      varying maturities that are rated below-investment grade at the time of 
      purchase.
    

      First Trust Advisors L.P., the Fund's investment advisor, along with its 
      affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P., are privately-held companies 
      which provide a variety of investment services, including asset 
      management and financial advisory services, with collective assets under 
      management or supervision of approximately $107 billion as of June 30, 
      2017 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end 
      funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts.
    

      MacKay Shields LLC ("MacKay") serves as the Fund's investment 
      sub-advisor. MacKay is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of New York 
      Life Insurance Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of New York Life 
      Investment Management Holdings LLC. MacKay is a multi-product, fixed 
      income investment management firm with approximately $96.66 billion in 
      assets under management as of June 30, 2017. MacKay manages fixed income 
      strategies for high-net worth individuals, institutional clients and 
      mutual funds, including unconstrained bond, global high yield, high 
      yield, high yield active core, municipal high yield, short duration high 
      yield, low volatility high yield, municipal short term, core investment 
      grade, municipal investment grade, core plus, core plus opportunities, 
      convertibles, emerging markets credit, and bank loans.
    

      Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return 
      and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, 
      when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
    

      Principal Risk Factors: The Fund invests in non-investment grade debt 
      instruments, commonly referred to as "high-yield securities". High-yield 
      securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss 
      than securities with higher ratings. Lower-quality debt tends to be less 
      liquid than higher-quality debt.
    

      The debt securities in which the Fund invests are subject to certain 
      risks, including issuer risk, reinvestment risk, prepayment risk, credit 
      risk, and interest rate risk. Issuer risk is the risk that the value of 
      fixed-income securities may decline for a number of reasons which 
      directly relate to the issuer. Reinvestment risk is the risk that income 
      from the Fund's portfolio will decline if the Fund invests the proceeds 
      from matured, traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are 
      below the Fund portfolio's current earnings rate. Prepayment risk is the 
      risk that, upon a prepayment, the actual outstanding debt on which the 
      Fund derives interest income will be reduced. Credit risk is the risk 
      that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make 
      dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value 
      of a security may decline as a result. Interest rate risk is the risk 
      that fixed-income securities will decline in value because of changes in 
      market interest rates.
    

      In times of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political 
      conditions, the Fund may not be able, fully or partially, to implement 
      its short selling strategy. Short selling creates special risks which 
      could result in increased volatility of returns and may result in 
      greater gains or greater losses.
    

      The Fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to 
      higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the Fund 
      invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency 
      of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar.
    

      The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder 
      reports and other regulatory filings.

First Trust High Income Long/Short Fund Announces Preliminary Results 
      of Tender Offer






























WHEATON, Ill., Jul 13, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
First Trust High Income Long/Short Fund                 

/quotes/zigman/610675/composite FSD
+0.06%


 (the “Fund”) today 
      announced the preliminary results of the tender offer it conducted.


                                        








As previously announced, the Fund conducted a tender offer for up to 15% 
      of its outstanding common shares for cash at a price per share equal to 
      98% of the net asset value per share as determined as of the close of 
      the regular trading session of the NYSE on July 14, 2017. The Fund’s 
      tender offer, which expired at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on Thursday, 
      July 13, 2017, was oversubscribed. Due to the fact that the number of 
      shares tendered exceeded the number of shares the Fund offered to 
      purchase, the Fund will purchase the maximum percentage of its 
      outstanding common shares on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the 
      number of shares duly tendered by each shareholder and the terms of the 
      offer to purchase. Based on preliminary information, a total of 
      12,576,434 shares were tendered.


                                        








Those figures do not include shares tendered through notice of 
      guaranteed delivery. The Fund currently expects to announce the final 
      results of the tender offer on Wednesday, July 19, 2017.


                                        








The Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company that 
      seeks to provide current income. The Fund has a secondary objective of 
      capital appreciation. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment 
      objectives by investing, under normal market conditions, a majority of 
      its assets in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and foreign (including 
      emerging markets) high yield corporate fixed-income securities of 
      varying maturities that are rated below-investment grade at the time of 
      purchase.

      affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P., are privately-held companies

Fact Sheet







First Trust High Income Long/Short Fund (FSD)




Fund Summary|News & Literature|Historical Pricing|Distribution History|Contact Fund











Investment Objective/Strategy - First Trust High Income Long/Short Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's primary investment objective is to provide current income. The Fund has a secondary objective of capital appreciation. The Fund will seek to achieve its investment objectives by investing, under normal market conditions, a majority of its assets in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and foreign (including emerging markets) high-yield corporate fixed-income securities of varying maturities that are rated below-investment grade at the time of purchase. The Fund's investments in below-investment grade fixed-income securities are commonly referred to as "high-yield" or "junk" bonds and are considered speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal.


        There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved.

The credit quality and ratings information presented above reflect the ratings assigned by one or more nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs), including Standard & Poor's Rating Group, a division of the McGraw Hill Companies, Inc., Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings, or a comparably rated NRSRO. For situations in which a security is rated by more than one NRSRO and the ratings are not equivalent, the highest ratings are used. Sub-investment grade ratings are those rated BB+/Ba1 or lower. Investment grade ratings are those rated BBB-/Baa3 or higher. The credit ratings shown relate to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities in the Fund, and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings are subject to change.

Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's common shares outstanding.


2
Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).


3
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


4
Distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through today's date and then dividing by the most recent market price. The distribution consists of the sum of net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains, and return of capital.  Distribution rates may vary. Any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution.  See the fund's 19a-1 Notices, if any, located under the "News & Literature" section of the website for estimates of distribution sources. Final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in the current year will be made after year-end.


5
A measure of a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bond's price given a change in yield.  It accounts for the likelihood of changes in the timing of cash flows in response to interest rate movements.


6
Total return is the combination of reinvested dividend income and reinvested capital gains distributions, at prices obtained by the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, if any, and changes in the NAV and Share Price.  The NAV total return takes into account the fund's total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.


7
Leverage is a technique where a closed-end fund's manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate, seeking to increase yield and total return. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


8
Market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions, which can differ from regulatory financial reports (Forms N-CSR and N-Q) that are based on trade date recording of security transactions. Holdings are subject to change.













Risk Considerations

Investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
    

    The fund invests in non-investment grade debt instruments, commonly referred to as "high-yield securities". High yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings. Lower-quality debt tends to be less liquid than higher-quality debt.


    The debt securities in which the fund invests are subject to certain risks, including issuer risk, reinvestment risk, prepayment risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk. Issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixed-income securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer. Reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the fund's portfolio will decline if the fund invests the proceeds from matured, traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the fund portfolio's current earnings rate. Prepayment risk is the risk that, upon a prepayment, the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates.


    In times of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political conditions, the fund may not be able, fully or partially, to implement its short selling strategy. Short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns and may result in greater gains or greater losses.


    The fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the fund invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar.


    The risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the prospectus, shareholder report and other regulatory filings.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

The distribution will be payable on June 15, 2017, to shareholders of record as of June 5, 2017. The ex-dividend date is expected to be June 1, 2017. The monthly distribution information for the Fund appears below.   First Trust High Income Long/Short Fund (FSD):      Distribution per share:       $0.1247     Distribution Rate based on the May 19, 2017 NAV of $18.13:     8.25%     Distribution Rate based on the May 19, 2017 closing market price of $17.12:     8.74%     Increase from the previous distribution of $0.124:     0.56%            A portion of this distribution may come from net investment income, net short-term realized capital gains or return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax status of all 2017 distributions will be made after the end of 2017 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV.Effective with the monthly distribution declared on February 21, 2017, and continuing for all distributions declared during the following eleven months, the Fund's Board of Trustees approved the commencement of a distribution policy that provides for the declaration of monthly distributions to common shareholders of the Fund at an annual minimum fixed rate of 8.5% based on the Fund's average monthly NAV per share over the prior twelve months.The Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company that seeks to provide current income. The Fund has a secondary objective of capital appreciation. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing, under normal market conditions, a majority of its assets in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and foreign (including emerging markets) high yield corporate fixed-income securities of varying maturities that are rated below-investment grade at the time of purchase.First Trust Advisors L.P., the Fund's investment advisor, along with its affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P., are privately-held companies which provide a variety of investment services, including asset management and financial advisory services, with collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $105 billion as of April 30, 2017 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts.MacKay Shields LLC ("MacKay") serves as the Fund's investment sub-advisor. MacKay is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of New York Life Insurance Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of New York Life Investment Management Holdings LLC. MacKay is a multi-product, fixed income investment management firm with approximately $94.9 billion in assets under management as of April 30, 2017. MacKay manages fixed income strategies for high-net worth individuals, institutional clients and mutual funds, including unconstrained bond, global high yield, high yield, high yield active core, municipal high yield, short duration high yield, low volatility high yield, municipal short term, core investment grade, municipal investment grade, core plus, core plus opportunities, convertibles, emerging markets credit, and bank loans.Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Principal Risk Factors: The Fund invests in non-investment grade debt instruments, commonly referred to as "high-yield securities". High-yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings. Lower-quality debt tends to be less liquid than higher-quality debt.The debt securities in which the Fund invests are subject to certain risks, including issuer risk, reinvestment risk, prepayment risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk. Issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixed-income securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer. Reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the Fund's portfolio will decline if the Fund invests the proceeds from matured, traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the Fund portfolio's current earnings rate. Prepayment risk is the risk that, upon a prepayment, the actual outstanding debt on which the Fund derives interest income will be reduced. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates.Read MoreIn times of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political conditions, the Fund may not be able, fully or partially, to implement its short selling strategy. Short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns and may result in greater gains or greater losses.The Fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the Fund invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar.The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder reports and other regulatory filings.The Fund’s daily closing New York Stock Exchange price and net asset value per share as well as other information can be found at www.ftportfolios.com or by calling 1-800-988-5891.View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170522006358/en/ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceTODAY'S CHARTS: Don't get blindsided by Tesla's shiny new Model 3Yahoo FinanceSBUX Unicorn Frap wasn’t magical enough to save earningsYahoo Finance VideoEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredHow a one-of-a-kind business has kept 5,000 kitchens out of landfillsYahoo FinanceTax cuts just got more likelyYahoo FinanceTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsored9 ways to break free from your credit card debtYahoo FinanceHere’s where you can go to see the historic solar eclipseYahoo Finance VideoStocks whiff as earnings and economic data pour inYahoo FinanceDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderThe 37 Most Profitable Markets for Home SellersCredit.com‘What Happened’: Hillary’s new book isn’t out yet, but Twitter is already making fun of the titlee-nuf-z-nuf: What happened?
