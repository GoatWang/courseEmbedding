Product Description
Compare Miele Complete C3 Vacuums
The New Miele Calima C3 Complete replaces the Miele S8390 Calima
Don’t let the Miele Calima C3's bright and cheerful appearance fool you, this German beauty is serious about cleaning. 
You’ll smile every time you open the pantry door to start your weekly cleaning when you see the Miele C3 Calima.  The new lightweight body and thicker grab handle of this Miele complete vacuum make it even easier to pick up, and the improved tool holder keeps the hose and wand secure for one-handed transport. 
Pull out the extra long cord and tap the “on” button.  You’ll be reminded of just how long the Miele motor lasts as you listen to the ultra-quiet slow-start motor gently ramp up to full suction. Snick snick. Feel the precise click of the suction adjustment button when you tap on it with your foot.  This vacuum has so much suction, you always turn it down a bit when you’re starting on that hallway runner.
Your bright yellow pal dutifully follows behind you as you move from rug to rug, the light and powerful turbo brush whisking away all the week’s detritus . Now for the floors.  That satisfying snap means the floor bush is locked in place.  The brush glides and swivels silently across the wood. It goes everywhere you want, just like you want it to. Curving around the sofa legs, brushing up against the baseboard, sliding right underneath the bed. You can feel the soft natural hair bristles rubbing and dusting and polishing the floors, bringing them back to the way you like.
Now to get serious. You want all of it gone this time.  The lid pops us and you select the natural bristle dusting brush from inside the tool compartment. Slip it on to the stainless steel wand and slide the extension to its full height.  Baseboards, blinds, lampshades- nothing within thirty feet of you will be left behind.  Repeat. The same goes for the upholstery tool and the crevice nozzle.  Like I said, serious cleaning. 
That’s it. The house is clean. You can breathe again. That air filter actually worked. It even smells clean, like nothing, just-  air.  Tap the rewind button and watch the cord disappear.  So easy. Back to the pantry, shut the door. 
Done.  Last week is gone, locked inside that bright yellow canister with no way out.  Moving on now. Let the new week begin.
