GOLD in Newfoundland, Canada


Green Bay Project - Hammerdown & Orion Gold Deposits


Maritime Resources holds 100% of the 51.7 square kilometre (12,775 acres) Green Bay property which hosts the past producing Hammerdown gold mine and the Orion gold deposit separated by a 1.5 km distance, and the Lochinvar base-precious metals deposit. 

An Independent NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate for the Green Bay Gold property near Springdale, Newfoundland was released in 2013. The study estimates the property to contain in excess of 400,000 ounces of gold in the Measured and Indicated category and in excess of 600,000 ounces in the Inferred category, both at a 3 g/t cut-off grade. The estimate was compiled by Tetra Tech of Ontario. 


The Hammerdown gold deposit was successfully mined by Richmont Mines from 2000 to 2004 while gold prices averaged close to $300/oz. During its operation a total of 291,400 tonnes of ore were mined and milled, at an average grade of 15.83 g/t Au, recovering a total of 143,000 ounces of gold. All of the ore was processed at the Nugget Pond mill, now owned and operated by Rambler Metals, with an average gold recovery of 97.1%. Mining concluded in 2004 due to low gold prices with considerable gold mineralization remaining. The Orion gold deposit consists of two main vein systems, both of which are open along strike, up and down plunge.

The hottest province for mining exploration is not Ontario, Quebec, or even the Yukon. It is actually Newfoundland, where a staking rush has quietly taken over the province.

Until now, Newfoundland has largely been overlooked, but definitely not for its geology. Much of the island was simply inaccessible, accompanied by an archaic concession system that locked up much of the land until the 1980s.
Most of the roads in Newfoundland was limited to the coastal areas where the majority of the population lived. This is true with the railroad as well, built in the late 1800s, it followed the coast with the occasional cut across a peninsula where it was easier to build.
The Reid Newfoundland Company, founded by Sir Robert Gillespie Reid of Scotland, built Newfoundland’s railroad in 1890. As a condition of operating the Railway, Reid was compensated with 5,000 acres of Crown Land per mile operated. In 1896, Reid was commissioned to build another railway, and similar to the first contract, was compensated 5,000 acres of land for every mile he built.
The railway opened up vast tracts of land, spurring interest in Newfoundland’s natural resources. Reid was the primary benefactor, eventually owning 4,160,000 acres, including the timber, mineral and surface rights. These “Reid Lots” were akin to modern day patented claims, and made the Reid Newfoundland Company the largest landowners in the province. He became a pulp and paper, as well as mining tycoon.
Until the mid-1970s, the Newfoundland concession system granted companies large areas of land that included exclusivity. Companies can only explore so much, thus, the majority of the land under the concession system remained untouched and unexplored.
It was not until the mid-1980s the last of the concessions was finally released, including the “Reid Lots”, which were taxed away or converted to claims with the other concessions. With such a small group holding onto the majority of the prospective land for decades, its no wonder Newfoundland remained under-explored through the various gold cycles.
Richmont Mines – Leaving A Lot Of Gold Behind
In May 1995, Richmont Mines (TSE:RIC, Mkt Cap: C$695.9M) made its foray into Newfoundland, first acquiring a 60% interest in the Nugget Pond gold project, then the remaining 40% in January 1996 after spending $3 million in development work. The Nugget Pond gold mine is located on the Baie Verte Peninsula of Newfoundland, spanning 4,900 acres. On December 31, 1995, the ore reserves totaled 430,000 tons at a grade of 10.5 g/t.
(Source: Rambler Metals)
Nugget Pond began commercial production in April 1997, and produced a total of 168,748 ounces, depleting its reserves by 2001. Having a perfectly good mill, Richmont Mines simply needed more feed. In anticipation of the depletion at Nugget Pond, Richmont acquired the nearby Hammerdown property in March 2000 for $6 million.Including work performed by Richmont, Hammerdown saw close to 600 drill holes over 63,000 meters.  A trenching program led to the discovery of another deposit in Rumbullion. Hammerdown was subsequently mined between 2001-2004, during which a total of 291,400 tonnes of ore were mined and milled at an average grade of 15.74 g/t Au, recovering a total of 143,000 ounces of gold. Richmont opted to cease production due to low gold prices ($285 per ounce), even with mineralization remaining.
Fast forward to present day, the ore and mill still remain, and Maritime Resources is poised to re-start production and further explore the Green Bay Gold property, which in addition to Hammerdown, is home to three more deposits and over 1 million ounces of gold resources.

Hammerdown – After-Tax NPV of $44.2 Million – Optimization & Exploration Upside Coming
Maritime originally acquired 50% of the Green Bay Property from Commander Resources in 2010 through the issuance of 12 million shares and by spending $750,000 on the property. In 2012, Maritime exercised its option to acquire 100% through the issuance of 5 million more shares.
The Nugget Pond Mill is now owned and operated by Rambler Metals, a company Maritime has an Engineering and Evaluation study agreement with. That agreement includes the First Right for toll milling. It is important to note that Rambler acquired 4.5 million shares of Maritime in February 2012 and owns 12% of the company; it is in the best interest of Rambler to see Maritime to production.
The company recently released a PFS study on Hammerdown, which was headlined by an after-tax IRR of 34.8% and NPV of $44.2 million (producing 35,000 ounces per year for 5 years). The study confirms that Hammerdown is not just viable, but very economic in today’s gold environment. Due to the existing mill, there is low upfront capital and a very short ramp-up to gold production. And since the operation is scheduled to run at 400 tpd over a five-year period, permitting for the re-opening will be straightforward. It will not require Federal Government’s blessing.
Hammerdown currently has 179,400 ounces of gold in reserves, but also has another 376,847 ounces of inferred that can be converted with more drilling. As mentioned earlier, the Green Bay property has three other deposits that will be utilized in the future:
(Orion, Muddy Shag, Hammerdown & Rumbullion, Source: Maritime Resources)
The Rumbullion deposit remains open for at least 800 meters to the northeast, with gold veins exposed and tested on surface. The Hammerdown deposit is faulted-offset to the southwest, and is untested at 500 meters at depth. Lastly, the Orion deposit is dipping to the northeast and has at least 1,500 of untested ground. We believe there can be as much as 1 million ounces in between Orion and Hammerdown, and this exploration upside is just one factor to consider in the valuation of Maritime.
(Mineral Resource Estimate for the Green Bay Property, Source: PFS)
The value-add in the near-term will be mine optimization. While the PFS validates the profitability of Hammerdown, the consultants, WSP, were overly conservative, using capital costs that only incorporated ~25% of the existing infrastructure built by Richmont.
(Historic development vs. prefeasibility development, Source: Maritime Resources)
When the mine plug is pulled, Maritime will be able to fully assess how much of the existing substructure is intact. WSP also used pricing for brand new equipment and surface infrastructure – this as well can be significantly improved upon. Lastly, Maritime will be buying back 1% of the 2% NSR on Green Bay (with the exception of production from the Orion deposit) for C$1 million from Commander Resources.  This move will further tighten up economics and generate more value for shareholders.
Proven & Established Veterans Of The Mining Game
Maritime Resources is led by Douglas Fulcher, who brings over 30 years of mining exploration experience. Mr. Fulcher has worked with both junior and senior mining companies, most notably as the President and CEO of Abacus Mining and Exploration from 2003 until 2010, where he was instrumental in the development of the Afton-Ajax project, a copper-gold project located in South Central British Columbia, with an after-tax NPV8 of $215.6 million.
Maritime recently appointed Andrew Pooler as the company’s COO. Mr. Pooler was brought over to manage the prefeasibility study and the development and operations of the Hammerdown project. He brings over 30 years of experience as a mining engineer, his most recent role was the COO of Esperanza Resources, which was acquired by Alamos Gold for $69.4 million in 2013.
Moving Forward – Under The Radar But Not For Long
Maritime Resources currently has $500,000 cash in the treasury, and has allocated $100,000 to the portal, and another $100,000 to the de-watering operation, both scheduled to commence in Q2-3 2017. The company has also engaged Stantec Engineering to complete the EA permitting.
A surface exploration program is in the works that will aim to extend the gold vein system along trend, and to drill some step-outs to test for that treasured blue-sky potential. Nevertheless, the main focus of the campaign will be to prove up the inferred resources so that it can be considered for the inclusion in the optimized mine plan.
Maritime just acquired an option on the Whisker exploration stage property, just a 10 kilometer drive away from Hammerdown. The project exhibits the same high-grade gold encountered at Hammerdown and Orion, including nine grab samples that assayed 13.3 to 30.5 grams per tonne gold with silver values ranging from 11.8 to 37.2 g/t Ag. Maritime plans on exploring Whisker while Hammerdown is in full development.
The PFS estimates a total capital cost of $67.8 million. Once again, we see this number lowering as the mine plan is further enhanced. Opening the portal will reveal a lot, and this will be a significant catalyst for Maritime in the near future. Doug has already been approached by many groups to provide the debt financing for the project. If everything goes according to plan, Hammerdown is expected to commence production within 18 to 24 months.
One qualm investors may have is the longer than expected timeframe it took for the PFS, originally slated for Q4 2016. Speaking with management, this was a misalignment of expectations, as the PFS was revised several times. It included a comprehensive study on the different methods of small vein mining, and a dispersed consultancy team that only added to the schedule creep. As a result, MAE’s share price floundered, even with the confirmed economics.
Maritime Resources’ current share price is C$0.13, with 59.0 million shares outstanding for a market cap of C$7.7 million. We believe there is a strong disconnect between its assets and the current market price. MAE wholly-owns a proven mine and is on the cusp of a re-start. It also enjoys significant potential upside in resources not accounted for in the PFS; blue-sky exploration potential; and likely mine plan optimization. With a clean and tight share structure, we believe Maritime Resources is one of the last development brownies on the platter.

Newfoundland’s Champion Moves Towards Gold Production – Maritime Resources Corp. (CVE:MAE, OTCMKTS:MRTMF)
Palisade Research  April 27, 2017 
Category: Research 
 
Current Price: C$0.13
Shares Outstanding: 59.0 million
Market Capitalization: C$7.7 million
52-Week Range: C$0.115-C$0.31
Cash: ~C$0.5 million
Total Liabilities: ~C$0.5 million
The hottest province for mining exploration is not Ontario, Quebec, or even the Yukon. It is actually Newfoundland, where a staking rush has quietly taken over the province.

Until now, Newfoundland has largely been overlooked, but definitely not for its geology. Much of the island was simply inaccessible, accompanied by an archaic concession system that locked up much of the land until the 1980s.
Most of the roads in Newfoundland was limited to the coastal areas where the majority of the population lived. This is true with the railroad as well, built in the late 1800s, it followed the coast with the occasional cut across a peninsula where it was easier to build.
The Reid Newfoundland Company, founded by Sir Robert Gillespie Reid of Scotland, built Newfoundland’s railroad in 1890. As a condition of operating the Railway, Reid was compensated with 5,000 acres of Crown Land per mile operated. In 1896, Reid was commissioned to build another railway, and similar to the first contract, was compensated 5,000 acres of land for every mile he built.
The railway opened up vast tracts of land, spurring interest in Newfoundland’s natural resources. Reid was the primary benefactor, eventually owning 4,160,000 acres, including the timber, mineral and surface rights. These “Reid Lots” were akin to modern day patented claims, and made the Reid Newfoundland Company the largest landowners in the province. He became a pulp and paper, as well as mining tycoon.
Until the mid-1970s, the Newfoundland concession system granted companies large areas of land that included exclusivity. Companies can only explore so much, thus, the majority of the land under the concession system remained untouched and unexplored.
It was not until the mid-1980s the last of the concessions was finally released, including the “Reid Lots”, which were taxed away or converted to claims with the other concessions. With such a small group holding onto the majority of the prospective land for decades, its no wonder Newfoundland remained under-explored through the various gold cycles.
Richmont Mines – Leaving A Lot Of Gold Behind
In May 1995, Richmont Mines (TSE:RIC, Mkt Cap: C$695.9M) made its foray into Newfoundland, first acquiring a 60% interest in the Nugget Pond gold project, then the remaining 40% in January 1996 after spending $3 million in development work. The Nugget Pond gold mine is located on the Baie Verte Peninsula of Newfoundland, spanning 4,900 acres. On December 31, 1995, the ore reserves totaled 430,000 tons at a grade of 10.5 g/t.

(Source: Rambler Metals)
Nugget Pond began commercial production in April 1997, and produced a total of 168,748 ounces, depleting its reserves by 2001. Having a perfectly good mill, Richmont Mines simply needed more feed. In anticipation of the depletion at Nugget Pond, Richmont acquired the nearby Hammerdown property in March 2000 for $6 million.
Including work performed by Richmont, Hammerdown saw close to 600 drill holes over 63,000 meters.  A trenching program led to the discovery of another deposit in Rumbullion. Hammerdown was subsequently mined between 2001-2004, during which a total of 291,400 tonnes of ore were mined and milled at an average grade of 15.74 g/t Au, recovering a total of 143,000 ounces of gold. Richmont opted to cease production due to low gold prices ($285 per ounce), even with mineralization remaining.
Fast forward to present day, the ore and mill still remain, and Maritime Resources is poised to re-start production and further explore the Green Bay Gold property, which in addition to Hammerdown, is home to three more deposits and over 1 million ounces of gold resources.

(Green Bay Property & The Nugget Pond Mill, Source: Corporate Presentation)
Hammerdown – After-Tax NPV of $44.2 Million – Optimization & Exploration Upside Coming
Maritime originally acquired 50% of the Green Bay Property from Commander Resources in 2010 through the issuance of 12 million shares and by spending $750,000 on the property. In 2012, Maritime exercised its option to acquire 100% through the issuance of 5 million more shares.
The Nugget Pond Mill is now owned and operated by Rambler Metals, a company Maritime has an Engineering and Evaluation study agreement with. That agreement includes the First Right for toll milling. It is important to note that Rambler acquired 4.5 million shares of Maritime in February 2012 and owns 12% of the company; it is in the best interest of Rambler to see Maritime to production.
The company recently released a PFS study on Hammerdown, which was headlined by an after-tax IRR of 34.8% and NPV of $44.2 million (producing 35,000 ounces per year for 5 years). The study confirms that Hammerdown is not just viable, but very economic in today’s gold environment. Due to the existing mill, there is low upfront capital and a very short ramp-up to gold production. And since the operation is scheduled to run at 400 tpd over a five-year period, permitting for the re-opening will be straightforward. It will not require Federal Government’s blessing.
Hammerdown currently has 179,400 ounces of gold in reserves, but also has another 376,847 ounces of inferred that can be converted with more drilling. As mentioned earlier, the Green Bay property has three other deposits that will be utilized in the future:

(Orion, Muddy Shag, Hammerdown & Rumbullion, Source: Maritime Resources)
The Rumbullion deposit remains open for at least 800 meters to the northeast, with gold veins exposed and tested on surface. The Hammerdown deposit is faulted-offset to the southwest, and is untested at 500 meters at depth. Lastly, the Orion deposit is dipping to the northeast and has at least 1,500 of untested ground. We believe there can be as much as 1 million ounces in between Orion and Hammerdown, and this exploration upside is just one factor to consider in the valuation of Maritime.

The value-add in the near-term will be mine optimization. While the PFS validates the profitability of Hammerdown, the consultants, WSP, were overly conservative, using capital costs that only incorporated ~25% of the existing infrastructure built by Richmont.

(Historic development vs. prefeasibility development, Source: Maritime Resources)
When the mine plug is pulled, Maritime will be able to fully assess how much of the existing substructure is intact. WSP also used pricing for brand new equipment and surface infrastructure – this as well can be significantly improved upon. Lastly, Maritime will be buying back 1% of the 2% NSR on Green Bay (with the exception of production from the Orion deposit) for C$1 million from Commander Resources.  This move will further tighten up economics and generate more value for shareholders.
Proven & Established Veterans Of The Mining Game 
Maritime Resources is led by Douglas Fulcher, who brings over 30 years of mining exploration experience. Mr. Fulcher has worked with both junior and senior mining companies, most notably as the President and CEO of Abacus Mining and Exploration from 2003 until 2010, where he was instrumental in the development of the Afton-Ajax project, a copper-gold project located in South Central British Columbia, with an after-tax NPV8 of $215.6 million.
Maritime recently appointed Andrew Pooler as the company’s COO. Mr. Pooler was brought over to manage the prefeasibility study and the development and operations of the Hammerdown project. He brings over 30 years of experience as a mining engineer, his most recent role was the COO of Esperanza Resources, which was acquired by Alamos Gold for $69.4 million in 2013.
Moving Forward – Under The Radar But Not For Long
Maritime Resources currently has $500,000 cash in the treasury, and has allocated $100,000 to the portal, and another $100,000 to the de-watering operation, both scheduled to commence in Q2-3 2017. The company has also engaged Stantec Engineering to complete the EA permitting.
A surface exploration program is in the works that will aim to extend the gold vein system along trend, and to drill some step-outs to test for that treasured blue-sky potential. Nevertheless, the main focus of the campaign will be to prove up the inferred resources so that it can be considered for the inclusion in the optimized mine plan.
Maritime just acquired an option on the Whisker exploration stage property, just a 10 kilometer drive away from Hammerdown. The project exhibits the same high-grade gold encountered at Hammerdown and Orion, including nine grab samples that assayed 13.3 to 30.5 grams per tonne gold with silver values ranging from 11.8 to 37.2 g/t Ag. Maritime plans on exploring Whisker while Hammerdown is in full development.
The PFS estimates a total capital cost of $67.8 million. Once again, we see this number lowering as the mine plan is further enhanced. Opening the portal will reveal a lot, and this will be a significant catalyst for Maritime in the near future. Doug has already been approached by many groups to provide the debt financing for the project. If everything goes according to plan, Hammerdown is expected to commence production within 18 to 24 months.
One qualm investors may have is the longer than expected timeframe it took for the PFS, originally slated for Q4 2016. Speaking with management, this was a misalignment of expectations, as the PFS was revised several times. It included a comprehensive study on the different methods of small vein mining, and a dispersed consultancy team that only added to the schedule creep. As a result, MAE’s share price floundered, even with the confirmed economics.
Maritime Resources’ current share price is C$0.13, with 59.0 million shares outstanding for a market cap of C$7.7 million. We believe there is a strong disconnect between its assets and the current market price. MAE wholly-owns a proven mine and is on the cusp of a re-start. It also enjoys significant potential upside in resources not accounted for in the PFS; blue-sky exploration potential; and likely mine plan optimization. With a clean and tight share structure, we believe Maritime Resources is one of the last development brownies on the platter.

CIM definition standards were followed for the resource estimate. 
The 2013 resource models used Ordinary Krig grade estimation within a three-dimensional block model with mineralized zones defined by wireframed solids. 
A cut-off grade of 3.0 g/t Au over 1.2 metres was used for reporting resources with capping of gold grades at 125 g/t at Hammerdown and 50 g/t at Orion. 
A Specific Gravity of 2.84 was applied. 
Numbers may not add exactly due to rounding. 
Mineral Resources, which are not mineral reserves, have not demonstrated economic viability.
The quantity and grade of reported inferred resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these inferred resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured mineral resource category.
A portion of the estimated resource, specifically the Hammerdown mineralization, may be located in close proximity to previously mined areas and, as such, may not be recoverable due to structural or safety concerns.The Resource Estimate was prepared by Todd McCracken, P. Geo. of Tetra Tech, Sudbury, ON.  Mr. McCracken is a qualified person and independent of the Company, as defined by section 1.5 of NI 43-101.The mineral resource estimate is based on the combination of geological modeling, geostatistics and conventional block modeling using the Ordinary Krig method of grade interpolation. The mineral resources were estimated using a block model with parent blocks of 5m X 5m X 5 m split three times into sub-blocks. The geological model including mineralized intercepts were generated by Maritime personnel and then audited by Tetra Tech. The QAQC protocols and corresponding sample preparation and shipment procedures have been reviewed by Tetra Tech.

A technical report has been filed on SEDAR on July 3, 2013.

GREEN BAY PROPERTY SUMMARY

Maritime Resources holds 100% of the 51.7 square kilometre (12,775 acres) Green Bay property which hosts the past producing Hammerdown gold mine and the Orion gold deposit separated by a 1.5 km distance, and the Lochinvar precious metals deposit.  

The Hammerdown gold deposit was successfully mined by Richmont Mines between the years 2000 and 2004 while gold prices averaged $325/oz.  During its operation a total of 291,400 tonnes of ore were mined and milled, at an average grade of 15.83 g/t Au, recovering a total of 143,000 ounces of gold.  All of the ore was processed at the Nugget Pond mill, now owned and operated by Rambler Metals, with an average gold recovery of 97.1%.  Mining concluded in 2004 due to low gold prices with mineralization remaining, although uneconomic at that time.  The Orion gold deposit consists of two main vein systems, both of which are open along strike, up and down plunge.

HISTORY

Commander Resources Ltd. actively explored the Green Bay Project area since first acquiring the Rendell-Jackman property in 1989.  A successful exploration campaign culminated in the detailed delineation of the Hammerdown gold deposit which was subsequently sold to Richmont Mining.  Richmont actively mined the deposit from 2000 to 2004.  The ore was trucked for processing at the Nugget Pond Mill.  Mine Records show 315,000 Tonnes were mined; 157,000 ounces gold was recovered with an average grade of 16.1 g/t.  At the time of mining Hammerdown, the price of gold averaged $275 per ounce.  In 2005 Commander once again assumed responsibility for all the Green Bay Project properties and continued exploration work during the remainder of 2005. 

In 1995, Commander discovered and drill-tested the Orion gold occurrence 1,700 m southwest of the Hammerdown deposit.  At the time of mining Hammerdown, the low price of gold precluded consideration of Orion for development.  In November 1995 another cluster of five gold-in-soil anomalies (up to 85 ppb gold) was outlined 250 metres along strike to the southwest. This anomaly was drill tested in February 1996 (BB-96-32), resulting in the discovery of the western segment of the Deposit (Orion West). Drilling by Maritime Resources in 2012 between the two zones confirmed continuity of gold mineralization, making Orion at least 800 metres long in strike extent. The deposit is completely open down plunge to the northeast.


PROPERTY GEOLOGY AND GOLD VEIN SYSTEMS

The Green Bay property is host to 4 gold deposits.  These four zones are contained within a 4 kilometre long deformation/strain zone locally called the Hammerdown Deformation Zone. The Hammerdown Deformation Zone is superimposed on or near the northern boundary of a small greenstone belt.

The Catchers Pond Greenstone belt consists of a series of lower Ordovician felsic to mafic volcanics interbedded with sequences of fine grained arenaceous and chemical sediments.  It is located in north-central Newfoundland in a mineral-rich district. The greenstones are related to the Buchans Greenstones located 75 km to the south, which produced base and precious metals from rich volcanogenic deposits for over 60 years.

The Green Bay Gold Deposits lie within a northeast trending 100-250 metre wide high strain zone (structural "corridor") of strong ductile to brittle shearing that can be traced from Orion northeastward for approximately four kilometres. This structural corridor hosts the Hammerdown, Rumbullion, Muddy Shag and Orion Gold Deposits, plus several other gold mineralized zones as shown on Figs. 4 and 5.. The corridor straddles the contact between the Catchers Pond Group and the Hammerdown Basalt, though is mainly developed within the uppermost units of the Catchers Pond Group. Several detailed structural studies at the Hammerdown and Rumbullion Gold Deposits have been undertaken. (Dubé et al, 1992, Gaboury et al. 1996), the results of which are applicable to Orion and Muddy Shag as well.

THE HAMMERDOWN GOLD DEPOSIT

Hammerdown-Rumbullion-Muddy Shag Vein System:
The Hammerdown Gold Deposit consists of a series of stacked gold vein zones situated within a 250 metre long section of an 1800 metre long shear zone in the northern portion of the Hammerdown deformation zone.  Its eastern boundary is the Rumbullion Fault, a northeasterly trending fault, to the east of which is the Rumbullion gold zone which hosts several narrow, high grade gold vein zones.  To the west, the Hammerdown vein system pinches out approximately 75 metres to the southwest of a strong flexure in the shear zone which rotates the shear from east-west at Hammerdown to southwesterly.  This south-west trending shear extends for several hundred metres and hosts the Muddy Shag gold zone containing two or three gold veins.

At depth, the entire shear zone, including most gold zones, are cut off by the extensive Captain Nemo Fault, which is a north dipping, normal fault with some strike slip movement.  Geological interpretation indicates downdrop of the Hammerdown area to be several hundred metres.  As the Captain Nemo Fault cuts through the Hammerdown shear at an oblique angle, veins are cut off at depths varying from 150 to 250 metres.

Click to Enlarge
The Hammerdown Gold Vein System

At Hammerdown a total of nine gold bearing veins have shown sufficient grade and continuity to be included in reserves.  An additional six to eight small or weak vein systems have been identified in the Hammerdown zone several of these have developed into small ore shoots.  At Rumbullion, seven veins have ore lenses along part of their strike extent.

The gold bearing veins consist essentially of vein quartz with 5-20 percent pyrite occurring as massive stringers and dense disseminations.  Base metal sulphides total about one percent, with zinc content equalling combined copper and lead values.  Minor bismuth occurs as native metal as well as the sulphosalt hammarite.

Gold is intimately associated with all sulphide phases, occurring as discrete grains within sulphides, at sulphide grain boundaries and, occasionally in quartz fractures near sulphide grains. There is a direct relationship between sulphide content and gold grade in veins. The gold is always fine grained, with 80 percent being of grain size less than 20 microns and the largest grain size is slightly over 100 microns. Considering the high grades, relatively little visual gold occurs in the deposit.

At Hammerdown, the Main vein systems, designated Ml and M2, are respectively located along the north and south contacts of a fairly continuous, dyke felsic porphyry body with the enclosing sheared mafic volcanics. The M2 vein is the stronger of the two.  In places offshoot veins within the porphyry close to the M2 vein, are included in M3 reserves.

The Hammerdown hangingwall veins, designated (from south to north) N, 0, P, and Q, mostly occur in relatively "undeformed" mafic volcanics with a minor iron formation component and leucoxene-bearing mafic dykes. Other felsic porphyry sills/dykes are present, but do not influence the siting of the veins like the porphyry associated with Ml and M2.  The veins have longer strike lengths compared to the Main veins.

The Footwall veins labelled (from north to south) L, K, and J are hosted by strongly sheared mafic and felsic volcanics  invaded by felsic porphyry sills.  At least four other vein sets (LI, Kl, K2, Jl) are present.  As with the Main Zone, the porphyries play a significant role in localizing the veining, with the strongest veins occurring along the southern contact of the sills.  Dips are near vertical and all Footwall veins are truncated by the Captain Nemo Fault.

RUMBULLION GOLD VEINS

At Rumbullion, the vein with the highest grade and lateral continuity is designated RM (Rumbullion Main).  The other designated veins follow the same naming format as at Hammerdown (ie. RN, RO... RR to the north of RM; RL, RK... RC to the south).  The veins strike east-west in the western portion of the deposit then swing to the northeast in the eastern portion. Dips are steep to the north.

Just east of the Rumbullion Fault, the Rumbullion Vein system continues in an easterly direction for about 150 metres, where an abrupt flexure rotates the vein system sharply to the northeast at the regional 050 degree direction. The vein system continues to the NE for at least 800 metres, however the number ore lenses seems to reduce in this direction, mainly due to lack of drilling.  The veins also separate further to the east, making them more difficult to explore and define.  This 800 metre strike length, with several known veins over a 300-400 metre stratigraphic section, has significant exploration opportunity. This area is swamp covered, yet has a number of gold soil anomalies and has not been covered with detailed EM surveys.

The Captain Nemo Fault also splits into a North and South Fault along the northeasterly trend of Rumbullion. The Rumbullion vein zones can be divided into two groups; those above the upper branch of the Captain Nemo fault (RK-RR) and those between the upper and lower branches of the fault (RI-RC).

GOLDEN ANCHOR VEINS

Several gold bearing veins were encountered while the Lochinvar base metal deposit was being defined.  A number of high grade gold intervals and a small, unqualified gold resource was established in two of the veins.  These zones are still untested at depth.  These veins are likely the far eastern continuation of the East Rumbullion gold veins, extending over 1,000 metres.

MUDDY SHAG GOLD VEINS

At Muddy Shag two, sub-vertical dipping quartz vein zones with a strike of 050oare hosted within moderately to strongly sheared mafic to felsic volcaniclastics and minor black cherty sediments.  Both zones are gold-bearing although of lower grade than Hammerdown and Rumbullion.  Two main vein zones (MM1, MM2) show significant vertical and lateral geological continuity within which several lenses reach ore grades. A third vein (the J vein) is present only in the eastern region of Muddy Shag near the Hammerdown flexure, and yields exceptionally high gold values. Muddy Shag contains an inferred resource of 72,000 Tonnes grading 14.9 g/t Au or 34,500 ounces gold.

THE ORION GOLD DEPOSIT
Click to EnlargeGeology of the Orion Gold Deposit
ORION GOLD DEPOSIT GEOLOGY
Stratigraphy:
The Orion Gold Deposit is situated at the southern portion of the Hammerdown deformation zone and is  hosted by strongly deformed, steeply dipping metavolcanic and metasedimentary units.   A major reverse fault zone (Horsehead Fault) has thrust this assemblage over younger volcanics to the west.  This northerly striking fault dips 500 to the east and terminates the Orion Gold zones to the west. As the fault trends oblique to the N50E strike of the Orion Vein system, the base of the gold zones plunge about 400 to the northeast. Recent drilling has encountered high grade gold in the veins close to the fault, indicating a possible structural relationship of high grade gold with the plunge of the Horsehead fault. The Orion gold veins are completely open in this plunge direction and to the east.

Intruding the stratigraphy are numerous sill-like lenses of quartz-feldspar porphyry up to 6 metres thick and a myriad of mafic dykes and sills up to 10 metres thick.

Structure and Alteration:
The rocks hosting the Deposit have undergone a protracted history of complex deformation, including both folding and brittle faulting.   At least three deformational events influenced vein emplacement and overall geometry of the mineralized zones.

Discovery Vein Zone
The Discovery Zone, as the name suggests, was the first to be discovered at the Deposit.  The zone is situated near the transition from the "mixed" mafic-felsic schist (See Cross-section Fig 11) This vein zone consists of single to multiple <1-30cm quartz-calcite veins (mainly 2-5cm) with 1-3% pyrite (locally to 10%) and minor amounts of light coloured sphalerite and chalcopyrite. One vein (BB-96-66) contained 50 grains of visible gold but otherwise visible gold is generally rare. The hosting schists often have a distinct yellow ochre sericite developed adjacent to the veining. Silicification is also common. Geochemically, the zone has twice the zinc and copper content compared to the Orion Main Zone but similar though very low amounts of silver and lead.  

Click to EnlargeOrion Gold Vein System Oblique Plan View

Main Vein Zone:
The Main vein zone is situated within the "final" felsic schist generally 10-30 metres northwest of the Discovery Zone. Like the Discovery Zone, it can be traced along strike for 950 metres. 

The zone consists of multiple 0.5-15cm quartz-calcite veins (mainly 1-3cm) and strong patchy silicification with 5-10% disseminated pyrite (up to 25%) and minor, though locally abundant chalcopyrite and sphalerite. Visible gold was observed in two drill holes. The host schists are strongly sericitic, silicified and locally display salmon-coloured bleaching. 

EMS Zone:
The EMS Zone is the smallest of the three "significant" zones at the Deposit. Like the Discovery and Main Zones it is contained within a distinct stratigraphic interval; in this case the graphitic cherty sediments/volcanic turbidite unit. The zone has a much shorter strike of 350 metres while "better grade" mineralization is confined to only about a 50 metre strike between 50 and 100 metres below surface. The zone occurs approximately 100 metres southeast of the Discovery Zone. The grade x thickness longitudinal section shows a slightly steeper easterly plunge (45°) compared to the two zones described above.

A.	Hammerdown-Rumbullion Eastern Extension

The Hammerdown-Rumbullion vein system has significant gold exploration potential eastward from its current resource delimitation.  Early drill testing of eastward extending Rumbullion veins, when gold prices ranged from $250 - $300/ounce, found less and less ore grade zones.  Exploration drilling therefore ended in this direction in the mid-late 1990's.  When Richmont reached out to mine the higher grade lenses at East Rumbullion in the early 2000's, with gold prices still low, the cost of long haulage drifts soon overcame profitability of mining the extended lenses and their exploration in this direction ceased.

At the eastern end of the property, Major General Resources discovered several continuous gold veins north of the Lochinvar base metal deposit and encountered some relatively high grade gold intersections.  A small gold resource (20,000 oz) was calculated for one of these veins but  shelved due to low gold prices.

These Lochinvar Hanging Wall veins (see map above) are identical to Rumbullion veins and occur in the same structure and rock sequences.   Scattered drill holes between Rumbullion and Lochinvar veins have encountered narrow gold veins so the system is known to be continuous.

It is therefore considered likely that additional gold resources can be developed in this 800 metre long extension east of Hammerdown-Rumbullion veins.  Drilling here will be shallow, near surface holes.

B.	Orion Deeps Extension

Maritime's first drill program at Green Bay in 2011 significantly increased gold resources at the Orion deposit.  This drilling not only closed the gap between the (old) Orion east and west zones, it also encountered some of the highest grade gold intervals at Orion. 

This new drilling, when combined with earlier drill results, clearly shows a higher grade gold zone plunging north-easterly at about -40 degrees.  As this plunge direction is parallel to a strong regional fault for several hundred metres, it is considered that the two controls are related.

The Orion down-plunge gold opportunity is completely open at depth and has never been drill tested.  A deep drill hole program is required to test the extent of the Orion deposit to the northeast.

C.	Hammerdown Down Fault Block

The possible extension of the Hammerdown gold deposit has always been limited by the Captain Nemo Fault which removed the lower extension of the vein system in an unknown direction.  The veins are terminated between 150 m and 250 m depth by this very sharp fault.  Fragments of the ore grade veins were actually encountered in the fault during mining operations by Richmont Mines.  However, they only drilled two deep holes in search for continuation of the veins.

The direction and distance of the fault offset has never been resolved, however geological and magnetic mapping of the property indicates it has not been moved more than several 100's of metres.  In late 2010, Maritime completed a deep searching geophysical survey to the south of the Captain Nemo fault and located a target at depth.  There has been preliminary testing of this target and it remains available for further work.
