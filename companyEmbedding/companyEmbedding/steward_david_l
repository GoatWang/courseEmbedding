Early years[edit]
Steward was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Dorothy, a homemaker, and Harold Steward, a mechanic.[4] As a child growing up in Clinton, Missouri, Steward faced poverty and discrimination.[5]
"I vividly remember segregation—separate schools, sitting in the balcony at the movie theater, being barred from the public swimming pool," notes Steward, who was among a small group of African-American high-school students who integrated the public swimming pool in Clinton in 1967. "These experiences had a profound effect on the man I am today. I am not one to back down when it comes to taking a stand for what I believe." Steward found a purpose for the hardship he encountered in his early years—it strengthened his character and taught him perseverance. "The adversities I encountered during my youth served as my training ground for hard times I eventually faced as a struggling entrepreneur."[6]
Steward received his B.S. degree in business from Central Missouri State University in 1973.[2][4]
Business career[edit]
After graduating from college, Steward worked at Wagner Electric as a production manager (1974–1975), a sales representative at Missouri Pacific Railroad Company(1975–1979), and a senior account executive at Federal Express (1979–1984), where he was recognized as salesman of the year and inducted into the company's hall of fame in 1981. He owned Transportation Business Specialists and Transport Administrative Services in the years leading up to founding World Wide Technology.[4]
Founding World Wide Technology[edit]
In 1990, Steward founded World Wide Technology, a leading systems integrator that provides technology products, services and supply chain solutions to customers around the globe.[2] In 1993, WWT concentrated its focus on the implementation of enterprise wide imaging, conversion services, and telecommunication networks. These integrated solutions have greatly enhanced WWT's overall market position and long term viability.[7]
In 1999 World Wide Technology spun off its telecommunications division to form Telcobuy.com. Sales for the two companies continued to grow, although revenues slipped in 2002 as World Wide Technology felt the impact of the technology recession. In 2003 combined reported revenues passed $1 billion, and Steward formed World Wide Technology Holding Company as the parent company for the two firms.[4]
In 2011, World Wide Technology's annual revenue are estimated to be greater than $3.2 billion, ranking it as one of St. Louis’ largest private companies.[8]

Early years[edit]
Steward was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Dorothy, a homemaker, and Harold Steward, a mechanic.[4] As a child growing up in Clinton, Missouri, Steward faced poverty and discrimination.[5]
"I vividly remember segregation—separate schools, sitting in the balcony at the movie theater, being barred from the public swimming pool," notes Steward, who was among a small group of African-American high-school students who integrated the public swimming pool in Clinton in 1967. "These experiences had a profound effect on the man I am today. I am not one to back down when it comes to taking a stand for what I believe." Steward found a purpose for the hardship he encountered in his early years—it strengthened his character and taught him perseverance. "The adversities I encountered during my youth served as my training ground for hard times I eventually faced as a struggling entrepreneur."[6]
Steward received his B.S. degree in business from Central Missouri State University in 1973.[2][4]
Business career[edit]
After graduating from college, Steward worked at Wagner Electric as a production manager (1974–1975), a sales representative at Missouri Pacific Railroad Company(1975–1979), and a senior account executive at Federal Express (1979–1984), where he was recognized as salesman of the year and inducted into the company's hall of fame in 1981. He owned Transportation Business Specialists and Transport Administrative Services in the years leading up to founding World Wide Technology.[4]
Founding World Wide Technology[edit]
In 1990, Steward founded World Wide Technology, a leading systems integrator that provides technology products, services and supply chain solutions to customers around the globe.[2] In 1993, WWT concentrated its focus on the implementation of enterprise wide imaging, conversion services, and telecommunication networks. These integrated solutions have greatly enhanced WWT's overall market position and long term viability.[7]
In 1999 World Wide Technology spun off its telecommunications division to form Telcobuy.com. Sales for the two companies continued to grow, although revenues slipped in 2002 as World Wide Technology felt the impact of the technology recession. In 2003 combined reported revenues passed $1 billion, and Steward formed World Wide Technology Holding Company as the parent company for the two firms.[4]
In 2011, World Wide Technology's annual revenue are estimated to be greater than $3.2 billion, ranking it as one of St. Louis’ largest private companies.[8]
Publications[edit]

David Steward: Building a Business 


 CBN.com Beating the Odds
David grew up in a Christian home in the small town of Clinton, Missouri. As a teen, he lived through the racially tense '60s and recalls attending segregated schools, sitting in the balcony of the movies, and being barred from the public swimming pool. David doesnt harbor any negative feelings about having to endure those days, especially since his mother warned him against becoming bitter and resentful. "I literally lived on the other side of the railroad tracks," says David, "but I learned that division doesnt work." 
Though his family had few material possessions, David believes he inherited considerable wealth from his parents because they taught him what was important: treating people right. David recalls homeless people stopping by the house. "No one was ever turned away," he says. "I saw faith in action." David also remembers his mother giving her last dollar to the church. "I knew it was seed to be sown with the expectation of a harvest," says David. These principles of sowing and reaping have stayed with him for his entire life.
David always had a lifelong dream of owning his own business. "It was a burning desire inside of me," he says. After college, David spent ten years in sales for three Fortune 500 companies. As the senior accountant for a major corporation, David was awarded Salesman of the Year and was made a member of the companys hall of fame. They presented an ice bucket with his initials engraved inside. David looked inside the bucket and realized it was empty. "This was a defining moment," says David. "I asked myself, Is this what I want out of life?" At the time, David and his family were living paycheck to paycheck. But David had complete faith in God. "It was clear in my mind that my belief in God, coupled with the desire to work hard to serve others, meant I was destined to succeed." 
He founded World Wide Technology (WWT) in 1990 on a shoestring budget and 7 employees. WWT is the largest black-owned business in the United States, and with over $1 billion in revenues last year, WWT is the second black-owned business to ever hit the billion-dollar mark. They have over 450 employees and help companies develop systems that create databases of virtually any type that their customers may require for tracking orders. 
Platform for Ministry
While his e-commerce business is thriving, David gives credit to the teachings in the Bible. While starting his business, the odds were stacked against him. "Looking back to 1990, it was nothing short of a miracle," says David. "It was a leap of faith." David sees his company as his ministry. It provides an opportunity for him to apply the lessons in the Bible and also serves as a platform on which to serve God by being an ambassador in the business world. 
His pastor, Dr. Lynn Mims, of Union Memorial United Methodist Church, asked him to start a Sunday school class for businesspeople. David was concerned about the long-term commitment but wanted to somehow accommodate his pastors request. Davids wife, Thelma, reminded him what the Bible says in Luke 12:48, "From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required." So they started the Bible study and called it Doing Business By the Book, the catalyst for his book, Doing Business by the Good Book: 52 Lessons on Success Straight from the Bible. Today the class is attended by governors of Missouri, past and present; Senators; Congressman; and other dignitaries. 
Two of the most important lessons David teaches are the following: (1) good leadership is love  "I love my employees and show them through my actions," he says; and (2) blessed to be a blessing  serving others and doing good for others is the bottom line. Davids hope is that the corporate world picks up his book and that it directs them to the Bible. "This is the milk that gets people excited about the prosperity God has for their lives. If it directs them to the Word, then mission accomplished."

World Wide Technology Founder and Chairman David Steward (Image: Courtesy of Subject)
This week on The Urban Business Roundtable, Renita D. Young speaks with David L. Steward, the founder and chairman of Maryland Heights, Mo.-based World Wide Technology Inc. (WWT), the nation’s largest Black-owned business. With 2010 revenues of more than $4.1 billion, WWT is ranked No. 1 on the Black Enterprise 100s list of the nation’s largest Black-owned industrial/service companies.
Steward, who grew up in rural Missouri, spent his early career in jobs including working for the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company and as an account executive with Federal Express. Then, in 1990, he created WWT, a leading systems integrator and the leading supplier of advanced technology solutions to the U.S. government. The company offers products from more than 3,000 manufacturers from around the world and ranks as one of the leading Cisco Systems partners in the country. Steward is also the author of Doing Business By The Good Book: 52 Lessons on Success Straight From The Bible. (Hyperion)
Also, UBR Contributor Samantha Pass sits down with author and self-made entrepreneur Nolan McCants. The owner of a full-service public relations firm by the age of 18, McCants represented Fortune 500 companies, non-profit agencies, entrepreneurs and the entertainment industry, and was recognized in 1990 by the U.S. Small Business Administration as Illinois’ Young Entrepreneur of the Year. In addition to being an entrepreneur and author of the book You Can Do It!: Inspiration and Motivation For Those Daring To Dream BIG, McCants is also a pastor and international speaker, overseer of an international alliance of churches, and an award-winning fine arts photographer. McCants joins the Roundtable to share how he did and how you can do it, too.
And finally, every week on UBR, you’ll hear Pepper Miller’s YOU-TURN    segment, get motivation and inspiration from author and  entrepreneurial  icon Farrah Gray, a weekly wrap-up of business news  from USA Today business correspondent Charisse Jones, our Patient Investor Report from Ariel Investments and key economic intelligence for small business owners from our UBR economists Derrick Collins and Rashid Carter.
Pepper Miller is the Founder and President of The Hunter Miller Group and the host of The Urban Business Roundtable, a weekly radio show, sponsored by Ariel Investments, airing CST Wednesdays at 8:30 a.m., Thursdays at 6:30 p.m. and Saturdays at 9:30 a.m. on WVON-AM 1690, the Talk of Chicago. You can also listen live online at WVON.com.

Publisher's Description▼▲
An indispensable volume that shows how to succeed in business by using the Bible and its lessons as a source of inspiration and guidance n 1990, David L. Steward founded his company, Worldwide Technology, Inc., on a shoestring budget and borrowed money, well aware of the high-risk nature of the venture he was undertaking. Despite the fact that he was a novice entrepreneur, he was certain he would succeed. Steward believed intensely that God wouldn't let him down.Doing Business by the Good Book shares the inspiring lessons culled straight from the Bible, that Steward used to build his privately held billion-dollar company into a global information technology enterprise.

Publisher's Weekly▼▲
Jesus' teachings were not meant to be spoken only  on Sunday, writes Steward, 
CEO of World Wide Technology Inc.,  the world's largest African-American-owned 
company. Rather,  those teachings were meant to be implemented everywhere,  
including the workplace. In this book, Steward shares 52  biblical principles 
in short, easy-to-read chapters that can be  digested once a week for a full 
year or devoured in one sitting.  Steward draws heavily on his own knowledge of 
building a  high-tech company from the ground up, and also his corporate  
experiences at FedEx and Union Pacific. He has a real knack for  helping 
readers see how biblical principles relate to those  experiences and to 
contemporary business issues. Even the trendy  notion of  "branding" is placed 
thoughtfully with a relevant  Scripture (Matthew 12:33: "Either make the tree 
good, and its  fruit good, or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for the  
tree is known by its fruit."). Christian businesspeople who want  a solid 
introduction to biblical ethics in the workplace will  particularly enjoy his 
fine chapters on accountability,  enthusiasm, customer satisfaction and 
networking. (Jan.)   Copyright 2004 Reed Business Information.    



ChristianBookPReviews.com▼▲
With the help of best-selling author Robert Shook (Longaberger: An American Success Story), Steward recounts how he overcame obstacles common to any entrepreneur and also those specific to an African-American in the world of high technology. In a very readable style, Steward links biblical and business principles. 

Steward delivers 52 chapters, each initiated by a biblical passage that emphasize their impact on his personal struggle to build a billion-dollar business. Included are: 

Being a Customer-Driven Company  In everything do to others as you would have them do to you. --Matthew 7:12 
Implementation  Be doers of the world, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves. --James 1:22 
Praise and Recognition  Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it. -- Proverbs 3:27 
Good Leadership  This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. --John 15:12 
Consistency  Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. --Hebrews 11:1 
Christian business owners, mangers and supervisors will all not only benefit from reading this book but also enjoy the informative content and conversational style. -- Judy Waggoner, Christian Book Previews.com

      ■ David L. Steward founded and served as chairman of World Wide
      Technology, a private company majority-owned by Steward, with reported
      revenues in excess of $1 billion. World Wide Technology specialized in
      procuring, building, and deploying information technology infrastructure
      for customers. In 2000 and 2001 
      
        Black Enterprise
      
       recognized World Wide Technology as the largest business in the United
      States with majority African-American ownership.
    

      EARLY INFLUENCES
    

      Steward credited his work ethic to his father, a mechanic and small farmer
      who also worked a variety of odd jobs to support his large family. Steward
      himself had farming chores before school each day, and mowed lawns,
      shoveled snow, and sold Christmas cards door-to-door to make extra money.
    

      Born in Chicago but raised in Clinton, Missouri, Steward faced poverty and
      discrimination as an African-American during his childhood. "I
      vividly remember segregation—separate schools, sitting in the
      balcony at the movie theater, being barred from the public swimming
      pool." Steward was among a small group of African-American
      high-school students who integrated the public swimming pool in Clinton in
      1967. "These experiences had a profound effect on the man I am
      today. I am not one to back down when it comes to taking a stand for what
      I believe." Steward found a purpose for the hardship he encountered
      in his early years—it strengthened his character and taught him
      perseverance. "The adversities I encountered during my youth served
      as my training ground for hard times I eventually faced as a struggling
      entrepreneur" (
      
        Doing Business by the Good Book
      
      , 2004).
    

      BUILT CORPORATE CAREER
    

      After graduating from college, Steward worked as a substitute teacher and
      for the Boy Scouts of America while searching for a permanent position. He
      was a manufacturing supervisor at Wagner Electric, but was laid off. In
      1976 Steward accepted a marketing and sales position with the Missouri
      Pacific Railroad Company.
    

      Later Steward worked for Federal Express as a senior account executive. He
      was recognized as salesman of the year and inducted into the
      company's hall of fame in 1981. He was presented with a
      trophy—an ice bucket with his engraved initials. When he looked
      inside the bucket, he noticed that it was empty. Steward saw this as a
      defining moment in his career, and he asked himself if that was what he
      wanted out of life. At the time Steward had two small children, a
      mortgage, and "all the trappings of success that keep you locked
      into a job" (
      
        Doing Business by the Good Book
      
      , 2004), but he was ready to venture out as an entrepreneur.
    

      STARTED FIRST BUSINESS
    

      Steward had done marketing work for the owner of a consulting firm that
      audited and reviewed freight-bill charges. Steward bought the firm in 1984
      and renamed it Transportation Business Specialists. In 1987 he founded a
      sister company, Transport Administrative Services. Steward first audited
      overcharges for railroad customers, seeking refunds for customers who were
      charged too much. Then he found a new approach, auditing undercharges for
      the railroad companies. In 1987 Transport Administrative Services was
      hired by Union Pacific Railroad to audit three years' worth of
      freight bills for undercharges, which meant managing $15 billion of rate
      information for a single client. Steward's company built a local
      area network to handle the data.
    

      FOUNDED WORLD WIDE TECHNOLOGY
    

      Steward founded World Wide Technology in 1990 because of this successful
      experience in integrating technology to solve business problems. The first
      years were difficult. Steward never missed an employee payroll, but many
      times could not pay himself. The company's debt reached $3.5
      million, and in 1993 a collection company repossessed his car from the
      company parking lot. Steward persevered because of his belief "that
      what we were doing for our employees and customers was meaningful. I had
      faith that our company was capable of providing exceptional value"
      (
      
        Doing Business by the Good Book
      
      , 2004).
    

      As a small minority-owned firm, World Wide Technology was approached by
      the St. Louis office of the Small Business Administration (SBA) about
      serving government customers. The SBA provided introductions and support
      that helped World Wide Technology land its first federal contracts.
      Steward remained grateful to the SBA for opening doors for his business. A
      turning point for the company came in 1995 with a contract to supply
      computer workstations for U.S. troops in Bosnia. Since no commercial
      software existed for the purpose, World Wide Technologies developed an
      Internet program to help the military track the equipment. The program
      proved successful, and the company began developing other Internetbased
      applications for its customers.
    

      In 1999 World Wide Technology spun off its telecommunications division to
      form Telcobuy.com. Sales for the two companies continued to grow, although
      revenues slipped in 2002 as World Wide Technology felt the impact of the
      technology recession. In 2003 combined reported revenues passed $1
      billion, and Steward formed World Wide Technology Holding Company as the
      parent company for the two firms.
    

      FAITH INFLUENCED BUSINESS PRACTICES
    


        St. Louis Commerce
      
       magazine found Steward's defining qualities to be "an
      enduring curiosity about technology, a talent for motivating others, a
      genuine interest in people and their well-being, a willingness to take
      risks, and the vision to build a company infrastructure that can sustain
      tremendous growth" (July 1, 1998). Steward based his business
      practices on his Christian faith. A 
      
        St. Louis Post-Dispatch
      
       article described Steward as "a religious man who sprinkles his
      conversation with Bible verses but never comes across as preachy"
      (June 14, 2000).
    

      Maximizing profit was never Steward's sole motivation; his
      objective was to serve others, and financial success was a byproduct. He
      found great satisfaction in providing his employees with opportunities to
      succeed and prosper. "I can't wait to come to work each
      morning so I can make a difference in the lives of others…. I feel
      sorry for people who just go through the motions at work" (
      
        Doing Business by the Good Book
      
      , 2004). Steward emphasized customer service at World Wide Technology.
      Each paycheck bore the imprint, "A satisfied customer made this
      check possible."
    

      ADDED ROLE OF AUTHOR
    

      In 1999 Steward and his wife were asked by their pastor to conduct a
      weekly Sunday school class for businesspeople. In 2004 Steward published 
      
        Doing Business by the Good Book
      
      , with Bible passages and personal interpretations drawn from the class.
      Steward served on the boards of numerous community and nonprofit
      organizations and in leadership roles with the United Way in St. Louis.

Early years[edit]
Steward was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Dorothy, a homemaker, and Harold Steward, a mechanic.[4] As a child growing up in Clinton, Missouri, Steward faced poverty and discrimination.[5]
"I vividly remember segregation—separate schools, sitting in the balcony at the movie theater, being barred from the public swimming pool," notes Steward, who was among a small group of African-American high-school students who integrated the public swimming pool in Clinton in 1967. "These experiences had a profound effect on the man I am today. I am not one to back down when it comes to taking a stand for what I believe." Steward found a purpose for the hardship he encountered in his early years—it strengthened his character and taught him perseverance. "The adversities I encountered during my youth served as my training ground for hard times I eventually faced as a struggling entrepreneur."[6]
Steward received his B.S. degree in business from Central Missouri State University in 1973.[2][4]
Business career[edit]
After graduating from college, Steward worked at Wagner Electric as a production manager (1974–1975), a sales representative at Missouri Pacific Railroad Company(1975–1979), and a senior account executive at Federal Express (1979–1984), where he was recognized as salesman of the year and inducted into the company's hall of fame in 1981. He owned Transportation Business Specialists and Transport Administrative Services in the years leading up to founding World Wide Technology.[4]
Founding World Wide Technology[edit]
In 1990, Steward founded World Wide Technology, a leading systems integrator that provides technology products, services and supply chain solutions to customers around the globe.[2] In 1993, WWT concentrated its focus on the implementation of enterprise wide imaging, conversion services, and telecommunication networks. These integrated solutions have greatly enhanced WWT's overall market position and long term viability.[7]
In 1999 World Wide Technology spun off its telecommunications division to form Telcobuy.com. Sales for the two companies continued to grow, although revenues slipped in 2002 as World Wide Technology felt the impact of the technology recession. In 2003 combined reported revenues passed $1 billion, and Steward formed World Wide Technology Holding Company as the parent company for the two firms.[4]
In 2011, World Wide Technology's annual revenue are estimated to be greater than $3.2 billion, ranking it as one of St. Louis’ largest private companies.[8]

Early years[edit]
Steward was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Dorothy, a homemaker, and Harold Steward, a mechanic.[4] As a child growing up in Clinton, Missouri, Steward faced poverty and discrimination.[5]
"I vividly remember segregation—separate schools, sitting in the balcony at the movie theater, being barred from the public swimming pool," notes Steward, who was among a small group of African-American high-school students who integrated the public swimming pool in Clinton in 1967. "These experiences had a profound effect on the man I am today. I am not one to back down when it comes to taking a stand for what I believe." Steward found a purpose for the hardship he encountered in his early years—it strengthened his character and taught him perseverance. "The adversities I encountered during my youth served as my training ground for hard times I eventually faced as a struggling entrepreneur."[6]
Steward received his B.S. degree in business from Central Missouri State University in 1973.[2][4]
Business career[edit]
After graduating from college, Steward worked at Wagner Electric as a production manager (1974–1975), a sales representative at Missouri Pacific Railroad Company(1975–1979), and a senior account executive at Federal Express (1979–1984), where he was recognized as salesman of the year and inducted into the company's hall of fame in 1981. He owned Transportation Business Specialists and Transport Administrative Services in the years leading up to founding World Wide Technology.[4]
Founding World Wide Technology[edit]
In 1990, Steward founded World Wide Technology, a leading systems integrator that provides technology products, services and supply chain solutions to customers around the globe.[2] In 1993, WWT concentrated its focus on the implementation of enterprise wide imaging, conversion services, and telecommunication networks. These integrated solutions have greatly enhanced WWT's overall market position and long term viability.[7]
In 1999 World Wide Technology spun off its telecommunications division to form Telcobuy.com. Sales for the two companies continued to grow, although revenues slipped in 2002 as World Wide Technology felt the impact of the technology recession. In 2003 combined reported revenues passed $1 billion, and Steward formed World Wide Technology Holding Company as the parent company for the two firms.[4]
In 2011, World Wide Technology's annual revenue are estimated to be greater than $3.2 billion, ranking it as one of St. Louis’ largest private companies.[8]
Publications[edit]

        Stewards donate laptops to City Academy
    


Special to The American

Apr 12, 2012
 3





























































































City Academy sixth graders accepted a surprise gift recently from the David L. Steward family: brand new laptop computers that they will take with them after graduation and as they begin the next chapter of their educational journeys into secondary schools for the 2012-2013.
“We are very pleased to have the opportunity to reward these hard-working students with the laptops,” said David L. Steward Sr., Founder and Chairman of the Board of the St. Louis-based company World Wide Technology, Inc.
“City Academy’s mission to prepare students for the highest-possible level of academic success aligns closely with my family’s priorities for the community. This gift is a gesture of congratulations, and we hope it also serves as an encouragement for these students to continue working hard.”
City Academy’s current class of sixth graders will graduate on May 23, 2012. They have been accepted to some of the area’s most competitive secondary schools, including Crossroads, Chaminade, Villa Duchesne, Visitation Academy, John Burroughs, MICDS, St. Louis Priory, Westminster, Central Christian and Whitfield.





City Academy is located at 4175 North Kingshighway. Founded in 1999, the school is the only private, independent elementary school in St. Louis providing scholarship support to 100 percent of its students.

 I think that for a laptop is the best gift ever that a student can receive from school. As they are starting a new chapter of their lives, the laptop will come in very handy, even so, they should first check out http://www.antivirus.com/, it's always better to be protected against all kind of online threats, than to lose important data.

This is great, I used to work at Tucson Computer Support and if they need any support with those laptops I can put a good word for them.I think it is better for them to have specialists to help them if they need.

Graduation for 6th graders is IMPOSSIBLE. The kids at that age and grade get "promoted" to the next level. They'll have a PROMOTION gift and a PROMOTION celebration, perhaps. Graduation can come after 12th grade or else higher education. Great gift and super that they get it now so that there are others in the school to help them get the computers productive before they depart.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
