Mickey H. -

Greg, Gerlyn & Patrick are always amazing and go above and beyond with customer service. I've rented from them four different times.  They're always providing continued professionalism and high-level customer service.  They are the one and only place that I will rent a U-Haul from as well as store my belongings even if I have to drive 100 miles to get there!




Christine S. -

I checked a few storage places within the area, and All Storage Anthem had the best service and most clean facilities by far.  Greg and Gerlyn made me feel like family.  Love the restroom on site too. 




Lai W. -

I would definitely recommend All Storage of Anthem.  There is no hassle at all working with the front desk, the staff is very pleasant, and the property is very clean!




Richard L. -

Gerlyn’s attention to detail and excellent customer service keep me a dedicated unit holder.




Monica S. -

Everyone is amazing here at All Storage of Anthem—they are always helpful and treat me with great respect!




Ray O. -

The staff is really friendly and courteous, and the facility is very clean.  I would recommend All Storage of Anthem to all my friends and family members!




Maynard B. -

The management and staff here are excellent and friendly.  They assist you in choosing a unit size most appropriate for your needs.  The units are clean and reasonably priced.  Rent with All Storage of Anthem and you will be well satisfied!

Greg, Gerlyn & Patrick are always amazing and go above and beyond with customer service. I've rented from them four different times.  They're always providing continued professionalism and high-level customer service.  They are the one and only place that I will rent a U-Haul from as well as store my belongings even if I have to drive 100 miles to get there!




Christine S. -

I checked a few storage places within the area, and All Storage Anthem had the best service and most clean facilities by far.  Greg and Gerlyn made me feel like family.  Love the restroom on site too.
