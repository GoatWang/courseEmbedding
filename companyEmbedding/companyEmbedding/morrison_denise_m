Patrick James Miller for Fortune


Since becoming CEO in 2011, Morrison is moving the biggest U.S. soup company beyond chicken noodle. In January, Campbell became the first Big Food company to say it would voluntarily label genetically modified ingredients in its products, and a month later it committed $125 million to a venture capital project investing in food-related startups. Meanwhile, Morrison is targeting $300 million in cost savings by the end of 2018. The transformation is not easy. Campbell saw revenues and profits drop 1% and 15%, respectively, in its last fiscal year.

        LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREDenise Morrison's childhood in Elberon, N.J., was far from typical.Her father expected Morrison and her three younger sisters to read at least one book each week and then present a written or oral report to the family.When Morrison wanted a new bike, he asked her to write a proposal with detailed reasoning on why she should get it.And way before "take your daughter to work day" was common, her dad, Dennis Sullivan — an executive at telecommunication firms such as New Jersey Bell and AT&T — brought his daughters to the office."He taught us to love business," Morrison says. "Our dinner tables were like focus groups. He would bring home different products, not just to show us, but to get our input. ... He would say that one day the world would open up for women and he wanted us to be ready for that."Morrison's mother, Connie, a homemaker and realtor, shared lessons, too. One major piece of advice was that ambition is a part of femininity.That parental coaching, paired with Morrison's inherent determination, helped propel her to an elite position. She is the 12th CEO in Campbell Soup's 145-year history and the first female to run the consumer goods giant.Morrison, 60, is also one of just 25 female CEOs in the Fortune 500. (Her sister Maggie Wilderotter, CEO of Frontier Communications, holds that honor as well.)Morrison took the CEO post of Camden, N.J.-based Campbell in 2011.  One of her most high-profile duties is to keep consumers buying the company's brands, which include Campbell's Soup, Prego, Pepperidge Farm, SpaghettiOs and V8.That means creating new products to appeal to buyers' taste buds, as well as using different communication strategies to reach shoppers in supermarkets as well as on social media."We're changing to deliver on consumers' expectations because consumers are changing," she says.One area of focus: better-for-you fare."We noticed a series of seismic shifts with the consumer and one of them is about health and wellness," Morrison says.In 2013, Campbell bought organic baby food maker Plum Organics. The year prior, it purchased Bolthouse Farms, a carrot producer that also sells salad dressings, juices and smoothies.Morrison is in charge during a time when soup sales are simmering on low.  In the third fiscal quarter ending April 27, U.S. soup sales were flat."I am disappointed that our plans did not drive stronger sales results in U.S. Soup," Morrison said in a statement when the results were released on May 19. She said the year-ago quarter was a tough comparison because sales were up 14% at that time.One of Campbell's struggles is "to consistently reignite U.S. soup sales growth," Morningstar Senior Analyst Erin Lash said in a recent report.Campbell's U.S. soup sales declined in fiscal 2011 and 2012, but it "managed to eke out a 5% increase in fiscal 2013," notes Lash, saying the firm "has yet to prove this increase is sustainable."Lash also says that "the firm's dominant competitive position in the U.S. soup industry, as well as investments to reshape its portfolio and expand internationally, should ultimately enable Campbell to continue generating solid cash flows over the long term."Morrison's sister, Frontier CEO Wilderotter, says that she and her siblings are well versed in overcoming challenges, as well as in seizing opportunities.  They were brought up to be confident and to come up with creative ways to solve issues, she says."Both our parents were very strong in terms of their values and in really pushing (us) to do our personal best," she says.  "They also taught us that giving back was important." (Photo: Campbell Soup)Morrison does that via  her "very active" participation with the group Catalyst, which works to expand career opportunities for women, says Ilene H. Lang, former Catalyst CEO and current senior advisor.Morrison, who is a Catalyst board member,  "values inclusion and diversity," says Lang. "She knows that with more people, and more points of view, you're going to get better results."The Campbell chief, who starts her day at 5 a.m., puts a large personal focus on helping others up the corporate ladder."I spend a lot of time mentoring and sponsoring," says Morrison.  In addition to her work at Catalyst, she also interacts with young women in a company-created Camp Campbell mentoring group that addresses topics such as leadership, innovation and entrepreneurship."I did it to give to them and I'm getting a lot out of it as well," she says.That seems to be a case of like father, like daughter.Morrison's dad passed away in March, and it was noted in his obituary that among his proudest accomplishments was mentoring his four successful daughters.Even after they became adults, he still encouraged them to strive for their next achievements."He definitely believed in setting goals," Morrison says.In a LinkedIn post from June 2013, Morrison writes that after she was appointed CEO, her dad congratulated her and then asked, "What's your next goal?"Her reply: "To build a great company."CONNECTTWEET

Early life[edit]
Denise Morrison was born in Elberon, New Jersey, and is one of four sisters who have all enjoyed successful business careers. The "Sullivan Sisters" were featured in a 2007 Wall Street Journal article, "Raising Women to Be Leaders."[3] Denise is the first-born; Maggie Wilderotter is chairman and CEO of Frontier Communications; Colleen Bastkowski was a regional vice president of sales at Expedia Corporate Travel;[4] and Andrea Doelling, a champion horse jumper, was senior vice president of sales at AT&T Wireless.[5] Their father, Dennis Sullivan, a Korean War veteran and AT&T executive, wanted to share everything he knew about business with his girls. He reportedly talked with them while they were still in grade school about setting profit-margin goals. Their mother, Connie Sullivan, taught them that ambition is a part of femininity.[3]
Denise Morrison graduated from Long Branch High School. She earned her B.S. degree in economics and psychology from Boston College, graduating magna cum laude. She was inducted into the Order of the Cross and Crown Honor Society for academic and extracurricular achievement.[2]

Morrison joined Campbell in April 2003 as President-Global Sales and Chief Customer Officer, and was named President-Campbell USA in June 2005. She was named Senior Vice President and President-North America Soup, Sauces and Beverages in October 2007 and handled the Campbell USA, North America Foodservice, and Campbell Canada businesses. She was appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer in October 2010, leading all of Campbell's global businesses, corporate strategy, global advertising & design and research & development.[2]
Before joining Campbell's, Morrison served as Executive Vice President and General Manager of Kraft Foods' Snacks and Confections divisions, responsible for leading brands such as Planters nuts, Life Savers candies, and Altoids mints.[2]
Morrison began her career in the sales organization at Procter & Gamble in Boston, Mass. She later joined Pepsi-Cola in Trade and Business Development. She then spent most of the 1980s at Nestle USA, where she held senior marketing and sales positions. In 1995, Denise moved to Nabisco Inc. She served as Senior Vice President and led the Nabisco Food Company's sales organization and was General Manager for the Down the Street division.[2]
Morrison's compensation at the beginning of fiscal year 2012 included an annual base salary of $950,000, a fiscal 2011 annual cash incentive of $602,292 and a fiscal 2012 long-term incentive grant of $4,845,000.[6] Campbell's fiscal year runs from August 1 to July 31.
Board service[edit]
Morrison is a former director of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company[7] and a former Director of Ballard Power Systems Inc.[8] She is a founding member of the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation, an initiative composed of manufacturers and retailers designed to combat obesity in the marketplace, workplace, and in schools through communication and education.[9] She is also on the non-profit board of Students in Free Enterprise.[10]
Additionally, she serves on the board of the Grocery Manufacturers Association[11] and is the chair of its Health and Wellness Committee. Morrison is also on the board of the Consumer Goods Forum.[12]
She is the former chair of Catalyst's Advisory Board and former President of the N.J. Women's Forum, and has served on the Board of the Food Industry Crusade Against Hunger and Leadership California.[2]
Awards[edit]

Morrison was also named the 21st Most Powerful Woman in Business by Fortune Magazine.[1] Morrison was a featured speaker at Fortune's 2011 Most Powerful Women Summit, sharing the stage with her sister Maggie Wilderotter, Chairman and CEO of Frontier Communications. Morrison and Wilderotter are the first sisters ever to make the list together.[14]
Morrison has been recognized with many other awards as well, including: Power 50, Supermarket News 2011;[15] "Woman of Distinction" American Heart Association of New Jersey, 2010; One of the 50 Most Influential Irish Women, Irish Voice 2010;[16] Trailblazer Award;[17] "Top Woman in Grocery," Progressive Grocer magazine, 2008, 2009, and 2010;[18] One of the Top 50 Women in Business in the State of N.J., NJBIZ magazine, 2008; One of the Top 50 Women to Watch, Wall Street Journal, 2007; "Aiming High Award" by Legal Momentum, 2007;[19] and Garden State "Woman of the Year" for Corporations, Garden State Women magazine, 2007.[20]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
