Why do investors choose Kay Properties
							and Investments for their DST 1031 exchange?



Specialization - All we do are DSTs.  We live and breathe DSTs every day of our lives.  Many others also offer financial planning, insurance,
								mutual funds, oil and gas, etc making them generalists and not specialists.  Our clients choose Kay Properties to be their DST specialist
								similar to how people choose a specialist for a knee or hip replacement as opposed to their general practice doctor.
Kay Properties team members have over 114 years of collective real estate experience.
Kay Properties has offices in Los Angeles, New York City and Washington DC
Licensed in all 50 States, Washington DC and the US Virgin Islands
Comprehensive DST due diligence process and analysis on every DST that we offer clients (not just broker dealer due diligence - although  
								we have that too - but our own due diligence with our lead property analyst what has analyzed over $12 Billion dollars of real estate).
DST Property Inspections - Kay Properties goal is to mystery shop each and every DST property that we offer clients (even portfolio DSTs       
								with 10-25 properties).  We believe we are one of the few firms that actually sends someone out to each property to inspect it.
Access to on-market DST properties from most of the sponsor companies and asset managers - although we reject many that do not pass our due diligence due to high risk, high fees and lack of previous performance.
Access to off-market DST properties. These exclusive DST properties are only available to Kay Properties’ clients.  These Kay Properties
								client-only DST offerings consist of an oftentimes dramatically lower fee structure than standard DSTs and as such can have higher projected 
								cash flows to our investors.
Access to leveraged DSTs for debt replacement - Typically 40-65% loan-to-offering value.
Kay Properties has access to All-Cash/Debt-Free DSTs for investors not wanting the risk of lender foreclosure.
Asset class rejection - Kay Properties will not sell the higher risk asset classes such as student housing, hotels, senior care and oil and gas…  
								Even if they pay a higher fee to us.  We will not use our clients as guinea pigs just to make a few extra bucks.
Kay Properties has participated in over $7 Billion dollars of DST properties.
Kay Properties is considered by many DST sponsors to be the undisputed leader in the DST brokerage industry.
Robust DST Inventory - Kay Properties typically has 15-30 DST properties available to qualified investors at any given time.
The loan balance of many of our DST 1031 properties - We like to buy All-Cash/Debt-Free in an effort to lower potential risk

Why do investors choose Kay Properties
							and Investments for their DST 1031 exchange?



Specialization - All we do are DSTs.  We live and breathe DSTs every day of our lives.  Many others also offer financial planning, insurance,
								mutual funds, oil and gas, etc making them generalists and not specialists.  Our clients choose Kay Properties to be their DST specialist
								similar to how people choose a specialist for a knee or hip replacement as opposed to their general practice doctor.
Kay Properties team members have over 114 years of collective real estate experience.
Kay Properties has offices in Los Angeles, New York City and Washington DC
Licensed in all 50 States, Washington DC and the US Virgin Islands
Comprehensive DST due diligence process and analysis on every DST that we offer clients (not just broker dealer due diligence - although  
								we have that too - but our own due diligence with our lead property analyst what has analyzed over $12 Billion dollars of real estate).
DST Property Inspections - Kay Properties goal is to mystery shop each and every DST property that we offer clients (even portfolio DSTs       
								with 10-25 properties).  We believe we are one of the few firms that actually sends someone out to each property to inspect it.
Access to on-market DST properties from most of the sponsor companies and asset managers - although we reject many that do not pass our due diligence due to high risk, high fees and lack of previous performance.
Access to off-market DST properties. These exclusive DST properties are only available to Kay Properties’ clients.  These Kay Properties
								client-only DST offerings consist of an oftentimes dramatically lower fee structure than standard DSTs and as such can have higher projected 
								cash flows to our investors.
Access to leveraged DSTs for debt replacement - Typically 40-65% loan-to-offering value.
Kay Properties has access to All-Cash/Debt-Free DSTs for investors not wanting the risk of lender foreclosure.
Asset class rejection - Kay Properties will not sell the higher risk asset classes such as student housing, hotels, senior care and oil and gas…  
								Even if they pay a higher fee to us.  We will not use our clients as guinea pigs just to make a few extra bucks.
Kay Properties has participated in over $7 Billion dollars of DST properties.
Kay Properties is considered by many DST sponsors to be the undisputed leader in the DST brokerage industry.
Robust DST Inventory - Kay Properties typically has 15-30 DST properties available to qualified investors at any given time.
The loan balance of many of our DST 1031 properties - We like to buy All-Cash/Debt-Free in an effort to lower potential risk

Why do investors choose Kay Properties
							and Investments for their DST 1031 exchange?



Specialization - All we do are DSTs.  We live and breathe DSTs every day of our lives.  Many others also offer financial planning, insurance,
								mutual funds, oil and gas, etc making them generalists and not specialists.  Our clients choose Kay Properties to be their DST specialist
								similar to how people choose a specialist for a knee or hip replacement as opposed to their general practice doctor.
Kay Properties team members have over 114 years of collective real estate experience.
Kay Properties has offices in Los Angeles, New York City and Washington DC
Licensed in all 50 States, Washington DC and the US Virgin Islands
Comprehensive DST due diligence process and analysis on every DST that we offer clients (not just broker dealer due diligence - although  
								we have that too - but our own due diligence with our lead property analyst what has analyzed over $12 Billion dollars of real estate).
DST Property Inspections - Kay Properties goal is to mystery shop each and every DST property that we offer clients (even portfolio DSTs       
								with 10-25 properties).  We believe we are one of the few firms that actually sends someone out to each property to inspect it.
Access to on-market DST properties from most of the sponsor companies and asset managers - although we reject many that do not pass our due diligence due to high risk, high fees and lack of previous performance.
Access to off-market DST properties. These exclusive DST properties are only available to Kay Properties’ clients.  These Kay Properties
								client-only DST offerings consist of an oftentimes dramatically lower fee structure than standard DSTs and as such can have higher projected 
								cash flows to our investors.
Access to leveraged DSTs for debt replacement - Typically 40-65% loan-to-offering value.
Kay Properties has access to All-Cash/Debt-Free DSTs for investors not wanting the risk of lender foreclosure.
Asset class rejection - Kay Properties will not sell the higher risk asset classes such as student housing, hotels, senior care and oil and gas…  
								Even if they pay a higher fee to us.  We will not use our clients as guinea pigs just to make a few extra bucks.
Kay Properties has participated in over $7 Billion dollars of DST properties.
Kay Properties is considered by many DST sponsors to be the undisputed leader in the DST brokerage industry.
Robust DST Inventory - Kay Properties typically has 15-30 DST properties available to qualified investors at any given time.
The loan balance of many of our DST 1031 properties - We like to buy All-Cash/Debt-Free in an effort to lower potential risk

Investing in a DST has some benefits over the original TIC structureBetter exit strategies; when the transfer of ownership occurs, banks do not get involved.More diversification options are available during the 45-day identification period.  The limitation to only 35 investors set forth in Revenue Procedure 2002-22 does not apply, which opens up offerings to 100 or more individual investors.  This brings minimum investment amounts to a more reasonable range of $100,000 to $250,000.There is no need for the creation of limited liability companies.  The DST automatically shields the investors from liability.

Delware Statutory Trusts (DST) are one of the preferred strategies for investors looking to carry out a 1031 exchange to defer their capital gains tax.  These property types require a minimal amount of hands-on work, but can be tricky to obtain and operate.DSTs should be owned inside of a diversified portfolio of different property types.  Retail, multi-family, student housing, medical office, and self-storage properties make excellent companions to DSTs in a successfully diversified portfolio.  There are methods to own these properties and reduce or eliminate the management responsibilities.1031 Specialist can provide DST information from a wide variety of sellers.  If you are considering owning a DST, please contact us today and allow us to understand your unique situation so that we can best satisfy your needs.To obtain information on our available DST, please sign up for our list service above.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Investing in a DST has some benefits over the original TIC structureBetter exit strategies; when the transfer of ownership occurs, banks do not get involved.More diversification options are available during the 45-day identification period.  The limitation to only 35 investors set forth in Revenue Procedure 2002-22 does not apply, which opens up offerings to 100 or more individual investors.  This brings minimum investment amounts to a more reasonable range of $100,000 to $250,000.There is no need for the creation of limited liability companies.  The DST automatically shields the investors from liability.
