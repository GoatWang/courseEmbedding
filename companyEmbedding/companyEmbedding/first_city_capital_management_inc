What are analysts saying about Avery Dennison Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Avery Dennison Corporation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "For 2017, Avery expects adjusted earnings per share to lie between $4.50 and $4.65. Avery's consistent execution of strategies continues to enhance competitive advantage while driving profitable growth. Focus on productivity, cost control and share repurchases will also drive results.  In sync with its strategy to expand in the medical sector, Avery Dennison has acquired Longford, Ireland-based Finesse Medical, a maker of materials used for wound care and skin treatments. The company has a positive record of earnings surprises in the last few quartere. Its shares have also outperformed the Zacks categorized Office Supplies & Forms sub industry year to date. However, choppy growth in Radio Frequency Identification products and raw material inflation remain near term concerns." (6/22/2017)
2. KeyCorp analysts commented, "We commend the Company on its continued robust organic growth (4% in 1Q17), but we continue to think the Company is at or near peak margins and the stock is trading well above its historical averages (AVY repurchased very little stock in the quarter, and we do not think that is a coincidence). We reiterate our Sector Weight rating on valuation." (4/26/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE:AVY) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $90.60 (1.33% downside)
