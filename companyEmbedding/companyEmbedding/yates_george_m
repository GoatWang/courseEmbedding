Job Details
               Matador Resources Company is a Dallas-based, privately held, independent energy company engaged in oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and acquisition activities in the Southwestern United States. The Company's primary focus is on natural gas operations in East Texas and North Louisiana, and the Permian and Delaware Basins of West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico, with approximately 340,000 gross acres under lease for oil and gas exploration and development. Matador intends to grow primarily through the drill bit and through an increased use of science and technology in its drilling and operational activities. Matador Resources was established in July 2003 and has attracted approximately $235 million in equity capital from several hundred individual and institutional investors, many of whom were shareholders in its predecessor, Matador Petroleum Corporation. Matador Petroleum, founded in 1988 with just $6 million in original seed capital, was one of the fastest growing oil and gas companies in the United States at the time of its sale to Tom Brown, Inc. in June 2003 for $388 million in an all-cash transaction, having delivered a 21% average annual rate of return for fifteen years to its shareholders.
