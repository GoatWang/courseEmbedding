Sage Products LLC Key Developments

Sage Products LLC Launches the Prevalon Mobile Air Transfer System to Safely and Easily Transfer Patients
Feb 28 17
Sage Products LLC announced the launch of the Prevalon Mobile Air Transfer System (MATS) to provide nurses with a safe and easy way to laterally transfer their patients. Over the course of a year, 35,000 nurse workdays are lost due to musculoskeletal injury. The Prevalon Mobile Air Transfer System (MATS) significantly reduces the cumulative effects of handling thousands of pounds of weight in multiple patient transfers that nurses routinely experience throughout a typical shift. MATS uses a patent-pending, dual-inflation design method that safely cradles and stabilizes the patient first before rising on a cushion of air, resulting in an easier and more effective patient transfer. The Prevalon Mobile Air Transfer System now joins the Prevalon AirTAP Patient Repositioning System, the Prevalon Liftaem System, the Prevalon Turn and Position System and the Prevalon Seated Positioning System to enhance Sage Products' leadership position in the field of healthcare worker safety and safe patient handling.


Sage Products Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of Comfort Shield Barrier Cream Cloths Due to Microbial Contamination
Jul 29 16
Sage Products announced it is voluntarily initiating a nationwide recall of one lot of Comfort Shield Barrier Cream Cloths to the distributor and health care facility/user level. The recall is being initiated due to product contamination with the bacteria, Burkholderia cepacia. Topical administration of a product with B. cepacia may cause serious infections in patients whose bodies cannot fight disease or in hospitalized patients, as well as certain other patient groups. These infections could be life-threatening. To date, no adverse events have been reported associated with the recalled products, which were distributed to distributors and healthcare facilities in the United States. The product, Comfort Shield Barrier Cream Cloths is a non-sterile, topical skin protectant used to treat and prevent moisture associated skin irritation caused by urine and/or stool exposure. The package contains three, single-use, disposable cloths. This recall affects the following lot of Comfort Shield Barrier Cream Cloths: Product Code - 7503, NDC Number - 53462-915-50, Lot Number - 53957, Expiration Date - 3/6/2018. Sage Products notified its distributors and health care facilities by letter, and they were provided instructions to discontinue use and return product to Sage Products. The affected lot was distributed to customers between March 31, 2016 and June 8, 2016. Customers who received affected products should discontinue use of the affected products and return them to Sage Products for credit by contacting Sage Products customer service at 1-800-421-6556, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Central Time. Customers with questions regarding this recall, or requiring replacement product, can call Sage Products customer service at 1-800-421-6556, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Central Time. Patients should contact their physician or healthcare provider if they have experienced any problems that may be related to taking or using this drug product. This recall is being conducted with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
