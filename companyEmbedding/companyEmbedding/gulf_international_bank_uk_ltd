GIB in the community
GIB has an enduring commitment to the GCC banking industry and the communities in which it operates, supporting a range of sustainable development programmes and local initiatives. In 2015, GIB has taken a further step, by launching a new community programme for a more targeted audience and a wider community related themes. Our new corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme "WAGIB" emphasises themes with long-term positive results. These involve, youth and career development, women’s empowerment, health awareness and economic development.A cornerstone of our CSR strategy is our Young Professional Development Programme, initiated in 2013, which provides career development opportunities for young GCC nationals. This programme, has played a major role in strengthening the Bank’s reputation as an ‘employer-of-choice’ in the regional banking industry.GIB cares about health awareness, involving staff in events such as World Health Day, Blood Drive campaigns, breast cancer awareness and Movember (to create awareness on male cancer issues). GIB also regularly sponsors Women empowerment programmes such as the Exhibition for Women and Labour, held under the patronage of Her Royal Highness, Princess Sabeeka bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, Wife of His Majesty the King and President of the Supreme Council for Women. GIB's success depends in large part on its employees. As a result, we focus our energy on attracting and retaining talented individuals and encourage their growth and development. We work hard to achieve an environment in which individual and team efforts are recognised, and where employees are inspired to be a part of our organisation. This includes numerous training, learning and development opportunities at each step along an employee's career path, as well as initiatives such as 'Parent's Day,' where staff bring their children to the office. GIB sponsors worthy charities and causes in its base country, the Kingdom of Bahrain, whenever the right opportunities arise. These include, but are not limited to, the Bahrain Down Syndrome Society, the annual Bahrain Marathon Relay, organised by the Bahrain Round Table in association with the Bahrain Athletics Association, and the Bahrain raft Race, held by the Rotary Club of Salmaniya.

About GIB Capital
A regional investment banking pioneer, GIB has been active in the GCC capital markets for almost two decades through offices in Riyadh, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi. The transactions that we have completed include public offerings, private sales of equity, mergers & acquisitions, debt capital markets issuances (Islamic and conventional), syndications, debt restructurings and strategic advisory. In 2008, GIB established GIB Capital, a fully-owned subsidiary based in Saudi Arabia, as part of its continued commitment to excel among its investment banking peers in the Gulf.The GIB brand has been associated with some of the most prestigious transactions in the region. GIB was the exclusive financial advisor to Saudi Telecom Company on its US$4.08 billion IPO in 2003, the largest public offering in the history of Saudi capital markets until 2014, when GIB Capital co-advised National Commercial Bank (NCB) on its US$6 billion IPO. The NCB IPO is, as of now, the Middle East’s largest ever public offering, and was also the second largest IPO globally in 2014. GIB Capital also provides comprehensive debt advisory services. Based on clients' specific requirements, GIB Capital will assist in the development of an appropriate debt strategy to achieve optimal financing solutions by keeping in perspective clients' key funding objectives.

Gulf International Bank (GIB) was established in 1976 during the first oil boom and is incorporated in the Kingdom of Bahrain as a conventional wholesale bank.[1] It is licensed by the Central Bank of Bahrain and is headquartered in Manama in Bahrain.[2]
Gulf International Bank, through its subsidiaries, provides its services in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and internationally. The company offers structured financing and advisory services for corporate and institutional customers in various sectors, including oil and gas, LNG, petrochemicals, power and water, infrastructure, telecom and technology-based projects, and aircraft and ships; and underwrites and arranges limited-recourse term financing with a range of debt finance products, such as syndicated debt finance, Islamic finance, export credit, and capital markets.[3] It also provides a range of financial advisory services. In addition, the company offers asset and fund management services to the Middle East semi-governmental institutions and European financial institutions.[3]
The bank had a tough time during the recession of 2008 and 2009 and its shareholders at the time, namely the Saudi Arabian government, injected an additional $1 billion of capital to prevent the firm from going under.[1]
Operations, subsidiaries and shareholders[edit]
The Gulf International Bank is owned principally by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, which has a 97.226% stake.[4] Two stakes of 0.730% are owned by the Kuwait Investment Authority and the Qatar Holding Company.[4] Three remaining stakes of 0.438% are each held by Bahrain Mumtalakat Holding Company, the Ministry of Finance of Oman and the Emirates Investment Authority.[4]
GIB’s main subsidiary is its UK branch, Gulf International Bank (UK) Ltd, which is based in Knightsbridge, London. The Saudi International Bank merged into this UK branch in 2000.[5] The bank also has branches in New York, Riyadh and Jeddah, in addition to representative offices in Beirut and Abu Dhabi.[6]
