Linda Marbán, Ph.D
 President, CEO and Director 

Full Bio
Dr. Marbán is currently serving as our Chief Executive Officer.  Co-founder of Capricor, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, Dr. Marbán has been with Capricor, Inc. since 2005 and became its Chief Executive Officer in 2010.  She combines her background in research with her business experience to lead Capricor and create a path to commercialization for its novel therapies. Dr. Marbán was the lead negotiator in procuring the license agreements that are the foundation of Capricor, Inc.’s intellectual property portfolio. Under her direction as Chief Executive Officer, Capricor, Inc. secured over $30.0 million in non-dilutive grants and a loan award which funds Capricor, Inc.’s research and development programs and clinical trials involving its CAP-1002 product.  Dr. Marbán’s deep knowledge of the cardiac space, in particular, allows her to provide unique direction for the Company’s development and growth.  From 2003 to 2009, Dr. Marbán was with Excigen, Inc., a biotechnology start-up company, where she was responsible for business development, operations, pre-clinical research, and supervising the development of gene therapy products in a joint development agreement with Genzyme Corp.  While at Excigen, she also negotiated a joint development and sublicense agreement with Medtronic Corp. utilizing Excigen’s technology and supervised the building of a lab in which the work was to be performed.  Dr. Marbán began her career in academic science, first at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation working on the biophysical properties of cardiac muscle. That work continued when she moved to a postdoctoral fellowship at Johns Hopkins University (“JHU”). While at JHU, she advanced to the rank of Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics, continuing her work on the mechanism of contractile dysfunction in heart failure. Her tenure at JHU ran from 2000 to 2003.  Dr. Marbán earned a Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve University in cardiac physiology.

Cell Therapy


While stem cell therapy development programs for heart disease elsewhere have used cells from embryonic or non-cardiac tissue, Capricor’s unique approach begins and ends with the heart.
Capricor’s hypothesis, which is supported by a large and growing preclinical database as well as clinical trial results, is that cardiac cells are best equipped to harness the heart’s own restorative capabilities. For this reason, Capricor uses the heart as the source of cells for its cardiosphere-derived cell (CDC) products. Capricor’s lead product candidate, CAP-1002, is an “off the shelf” product that contains CDCs made from donor hearts (allogeneic), and can be stored for later use.

What are CDCs?
Capricor’s core technology is based on cardiospheres (CSps), which are clusters of cells obtained from heart muscle. Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) are CSp cells that have been formatted into a single layer, and Capricor is developing CDCs as the potential therapeutic product CAP-1002. CDCs possess regenerative properties, meaning these cells are able to promote the growth of new heart cells. They accomplish this not by becoming part of the recipient’s heart, but by acting at a distance to cause cells in the recipient heart to divide and/or differentiate. CDCs can be injected into the coronary arteries without damaging the heart muscle, in doses sufficient for activity. Because CDCs originate in the myocardial cell lineage, Capricor believes that they are particularly well-suited to stimulate the heart’s innate restorative capabilities. The CDCs in CAP-1002 originate from tissue taken from donor hearts.

While the heart muscle appears capable of healing from daily “wear and tear”, its repair systems are insufficient to address extensive damage such as that which results either from an acute event, such as a heart attack, or from chronic injury, which may be associated with a variety of conditions. Capricor believes that, following their infusion, CDCs track to the area of injury and release growth factors and cytokines (molecules that stimulate specific cell responses) that signal the heart to repair itself. Although the infused CDCs are eventually cleared from the body, their salutary effects are believed to be long-lasting.
Since the discovery of the cardiosphere over a decade ago, basic research on CSPs and CDCs has generated a large and growing body of peer-reviewed literature. It has been shown that CDCs exert several effects that can mitigate damage and promote repair and regeneration at sites of injury, including anti-scarring, anti-programmed cell death and blood vessel growth functions. The cumulative clinical experience with CDCs has provided initial validation of their potential benefits, and is characterized by favorable safety and tolerability.


CDC’s Unique Mechanism of Action
Capricor’s CDCs secrete factors that promote the following effects:

Reduction of host cell apoptosis (programmed cell death)
Recruitment of existing stem cells
Heart cell growth
Reduction in scar formation
Increase in blood vessel density

The CDCs are eventually cleared from the body, essentially serving as a temporary local drug delivery system.
Capricor believes its cells are better equipped to embody the heart’s innate restorative capabilities than those derived from non-cardiac tissue, such as bone marrow. This was demonstrated in a preclinical study conducted by Cedars-Sinai which compared CDCs with other stem cell types (from either bone marrow or fat tissue). In this study, only the CDC group led to statistically significant improvement in ejection fraction (a measure of heart function). As compared to the other cell types, CDCs led to:

The highest cell engraftment and cardiac differentiation rates
The least degree of adverse remodeling
The lowest rate of cell apoptosis (programmed cell death)



CAP-1002 Attributes
Within cardiac cell therapy, Capricor’s cells have several differentiating characteristics that we believe make them more efficacious and easier to deliver than other cell types.


  Click Here to enlarge 


ALLOGENEIC: Allogeneic cells, which are derived from donor tissue, offer several advantages over autologous alternatives (derived from patient’s own tissue). First, as numerous doses can be created from one donor heart, the therapy can be available “off-the-shelf,” meaning the therapy could be available when needed. Additionally, there is no need for the patient to undergo an invasive tissue harvesting procedure. Finally, the cost of production is significantly less than with an autologous product.


INTRACORONARY DELIVERY: The majority of cardiac cell therapies utilize an intramyocardial injection catheter system for delivery. This entails electronic mapping of the heart followed by direct injection of the cells into the heart muscle via a catheter. Capricor delivers its cells intracoronary (IC), meaning the cells are infused into an artery, rather than injected into the heart. IC has numerous advantages over intramyocardial injection, including 1) no damage to the heart muscle, 2) faster treatment with greater ability to treat acute cases, and 3) lower cost of treatment, as additional clinician training is minimal, and no additional capital equipment or software is required. Importantly, IC infusion is a routine procedure in catheter laboratories.


CARDIAC DERIVED: The prevailing scientific dogma has long held that the heart is a terminally differentiated organ, meaning heart cells are incapable of self-renewal. Discoveries within the last few years have proven that the heart indeed contains its own stem cells. On their own, these cells are believed to compensate for normal every day wear-and-tear, but do not suffice to offset devastating injuries such as heart attacks. Capricor’s CDCs in general do not retain expression of the purported cardiac stem cell marker known as c-kit, but are uniformly identifiable by numerous other markers, and are believed to be a highly regenerative population.


Capricor believes its cells are better equipped to embody the heart’s innate restorative capabilities than those derived from non-cardiac tissue, such as bone marrow. This was demonstrated in a 2012 Cedars-Sinai preclinical study comparing CDCs head-to-head with other stem cell types (from either bone marrow or fat tissue). At three weeks, CDCs showed the following results:

CDCs were the only group in which ejection fraction (a measure of heart function) improvement reached statistical significance
The highest cell engraftment and cardiac differentiation rates
The least degree of adverse remodeling
The lowest rate of cell apoptosis (programmed cell death)

The same study also compared CDCs to purified c-kit cells, a cell population purified on the basis of a single marker called c-kit, and CDCs once again demonstrated improved performance, specifically:

CDCs showed greater improvement in ejection fraction (a measure of heart function)
CDCs released higher VEGF, SDF, IGF-1, and HGF (growth factors)



Manufacturing
 The manufacturing process for Capricor’s first generation autologous CDC product, CAP-1001 – which was evaluated in the CADUCEUS trial – began with a biopsy of cardiac tissue from the patient. This tissue was put into culture and CDCs were generated through a series of proprietary unit operations. CAP-1001 was then administered back to the same individual.
The manufacturing process for CAP-1002, Capricor’s allogeneic CDC product candidate, starts with tissue taken from donor hearts. Following expansion, processing, release testing, and quality review, CAP-1002 is cryopreserved (stored at a low temperature), allowing an inventory of “off the shelf” product to be available for administration to many patients. Under these conditions, CAP-1002 has a useful life of at least three years.
Capricor’s current manufacturing process is adequate to meet current clinical trial demands. In collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc., Capricor has been working toward the establishment of a commercial-scale process.

					Full Description



Capricor Therapeutics, Inc., incorporated on January 26, 2007, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutics. The Company focuses on discovering, developing and commercializing regenerative medicine and large molecule products for the treatment of disease, with a primary focus on the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including orphan indications. The Company has over four clinical trials aiming to treat cardiovascular diseases in various progressions of the disease state. The Company's core technology is based on cardiospheres (CSps), which are multi-cell clusters of cardiac-derived cells. The Company's lead product candidate, the Cardiosphere-Derived Cells (CDCs), are the single cell monolayer product of the CSps. CDCs are small enough that within acceptable dose limits, they can be injected down a coronary artery without damaging the heart muscle. Both CSps and CDCs are derived from a deceased human donor (allogeneic source) or from heart tissue taken directly from recipient patients themselves (autologous source).CAP-1002The Company's lead product candidate consists of allogeneic CDCs. The Company is testing CAP-1002 in its ALLSTAR Phase II clinical trial. It is a dual cohort clinical trial that has two independently recruiting strata: the first are patients having experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) (30 to 90 days post myocardial infarction) and the second are patients having suffered a myocardial infarction within one year (90 days to 1-year post MI) to see if the cells can reduce the size of older, more established scar. The Company is evaluating CAP-1002 in the DYNAMIC clinical study to assess the safety and feasibility of delivering CAP-1002 to advanced heart failure patients. Additionally, the Company is enrolling the Phase I/II HOPE-Duchenne clinical trial, which is designed to enroll approximately 24 patients in a randomized, multi-center study evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of CAP-1002 in patients with cardiomyopathy related to Duchenne muscular dystrophy.CAP-1001The Company's product candidate, CAP-1001, consists of autologous CDCs. The product was used in the Phase I CADUCEUS clinical trial.CardiospheresThe CSps are multicellular clusters called cardiospheres, a three dimensional (3D) micro-tissue, from which CDCs are derived. It has shown healing effects in pre-clinical models of heart failure.ExosomesExosomes are nano-sized, membrane-enclosed vesicles, that are filled with select molecules, including proteins, ribonucleic acids (RNAs) and microRNAs, which, when released send messages to neighboring cells to regulate cellular functions. Exosomes act as a transport vehicle out of the cell for microRNA, other fragments of genetic material and proteins that act as messengers between cells, providing regulatory function for many cell processes, including inflammation, angiogenesis, programmed cell death (apoptosis) and scarring. The Company is in pre-clinical testing to explore the therapeutic benefits that exosomes may possess and the indications in which they may be investigated.Cenderitide (CD-NP)Cenderitide (CD-NP) belongs to a class of drugs called natriuretic peptides. Cenderitide is a chimeric natriuretic peptide being developed for the treatment of heart failure patients. Specifically, Cenderitide is a dual receptor agonist acting on both the A and B receptors. Cenderitide is designed as an outpatient therapy to be delivered continuously using a validated subcutaneous infusion pump for approximately 90 days (the post-acute period) following an acute heart failure hospital admission. The Company has completed a Phase II study in approximately 14 patients with stable, chronic heart failure. The Company has initiated an additional study to further assess the safety and efficacy of Cenderitide.CU-NPThe Company's product candidate, CU-NP, is a pre-clinical rationally designed natriuretic peptide. It consists of amino acid chains identical to those produced by the human body, the ring structure of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and the N- and C-termini of Urodilatin (URO).

Capricor's stock tumbles toward record low after disappointing trial results
Shares of Capricor Therapeutics Inc.  plunged 60% toward record lows in premarket trade Friday, after the biotechnology company announced disappointing results from an interim trial of its treatment for heart-attack patients, which will result in job cuts. The company said the trial of CAP-1002 demonstrated "a low probability" of achieving a statistically-significant difference in the primary endpoint of change from baseline scar size. "The lack of a clear difference in the change in scar size from baseline to six months between the active and control groups in the interim observations from ALLSTAR was unexpected," said Chief Executive Linda Marban. She said. however, the favorable safety profile in the study supports the prospect of its administration in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The company plans to cut the size of its workforce and the scope of its operations to focus on its DMD program. The stock had rallied 15% year to date through Thursday, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  had climbed 9.9% and the S&P 500  had gained 7.0%.

Capricor's stock tumbles toward record low after disappointing trial results
Shares of Capricor Therapeutics Inc.  plunged 60% toward record lows in premarket trade Friday, after the biotechnology company announced disappointing results from an interim trial of its treatment for heart-attack patients, which will result in job cuts. The company said the trial of CAP-1002 demonstrated "a low probability" of achieving a statistically-significant difference in the primary endpoint of change from baseline scar size. "The lack of a clear difference in the change in scar size from baseline to six months between the active and control groups in the interim observations from ALLSTAR was unexpected," said Chief Executive Linda Marban. She said. however, the favorable safety profile in the study supports the prospect of its administration in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The company plans to cut the size of its workforce and the scope of its operations to focus on its DMD program. The stock had rallied 15% year to date through Thursday, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  had climbed 9.9% and the S&P 500  had gained 7.0%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
