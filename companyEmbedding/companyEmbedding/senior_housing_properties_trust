Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH) Passes Through 8% Yield Mark

Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel  , in trading on Thursday, shares of Senior Housing Properties Trust (Symbol: SNH) were yielding above the 8% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.56), with the stock changing hands as low as $19.33 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the iShares Russell 3000 ETF ( IWV  ) back on 5/31/2000 - you would have paid $78.27 per share. Fast forward to 5/31/2012 and each share was worth $77.79 on that date, a loss of $0.48 or 0.6% decrease over twelve years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $10.77 per share in dividends over the same period, increasing your return to 13.15%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.0%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 8% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Senior Housing Properties Trust (Symbol: SNH) is a member of the Russell 3000, giving it special status as one of the largest 3000 companies on the U.S. stock markets.      In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Senior Housing Properties Trust, looking at the history chart for SNH below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 8% annual yield.       According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, SNH makes up 3.28% of the SuperDividend REIT ETF (Symbol: SRET) which is trading up by about 0.1% on the day Thursday.

NEWTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Senior Housing Properties Trust (Nasdaq:SNH) today announced a regular
      quarterly cash distribution on its common shares of $0.39 per common
      share ($1.56 per share per year). This quarterly dividend will be paid
      to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 24,
      2017 and distributed on or about August 17, 2017.
    
Senior Housing Properties Trust is a real estate investment trust, or
      REIT, which owns senior living communities, medical office buildings and
      wellness centers throughout the United States. SNH is managed by the
      operating subsidiary of The RMR Group Inc. (Nasdaq:RMR), an alternative
      asset management company that is headquartered in Newton, MA.

WARNING REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS


      THIS PRESS RELEASE CONTAINS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE
      MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND
      OTHER SECURITIES LAWS. THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON
      SNH'S PRESENT BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS, BUT THESE STATEMENTS AND THE
      IMPLICATIONS OF THESE STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO OCCUR AND MAY NOT
      OCCUR FOR VARIOUS REASONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND SNH'S CONTROL. FOR
      EXAMPLE, THIS PRESS RELEASE STATES THAT SNH'S DIVIDEND RATE WILL BE
      $0.39/SHARE PER QUARTER OR $1.56/SHARE PER YEAR. A POSSIBLE IMPLICATION
      OF THIS STATEMENT IS THAT SNH WILL CONTINUOUSLY PAY QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS
      OF $0.39/SHARE PER QUARTER OR $1.56/SHARE PER YEAR IN THE FUTURE. SNH'S
      DIVIDEND RATES ARE SET AND RESET FROM TIME TO TIME BY SNH'S BOARD OF
      TRUSTEES. THE SNH BOARD CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS WHEN SETTING DIVIDEND
      RATES INCLUDING SNH'S HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED INCOME, NORMALIZED FUNDS
      FROM OPERATIONS, THE THEN CURRENT AND EXPECTED NEEDS AND AVAILABILITY OF
      CASH TO PAY SNH'S OBLIGATIONS, DISTRIBUTIONS WHICH MAY BE REQUIRED TO BE
      PAID TO MAINTAIN SNH'S TAX STATUS AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST AND
      OTHER FACTORS DEEMED RELEVANT BY SNH'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN ITS
      DISCRETION. ACCORDINGLY, FUTURE DIVIDEND RATES MAY BE INCREASED OR
      DECREASED AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE RATE AT WHICH FUTURE
      DIVIDENDS WILL BE DECLARED AND PAID. FOR THESE REASONS, AMONG OTHERS,
      INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE UPON ANY FORWARD
      LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS PRESS RELEASE.
    

      A Maryland Real Estate Investment Trust with transferable shares of
      beneficial interest listed on the Nasdaq.No shareholder, Trustee
      or officer is personally liable for any act or obligation of the Trust.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS. Donnelley Financial, LLC. d/b/a EDGAR Online and the information providers herein make no claims concerning the validity of the information provided hereby and will not be held liable for any use of this information.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please   
    click here.

        Performance returns indicate the performance of a particular security over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    
System response time and account access times may vary due to a variety of factors, including trading volumes, market conditions, system performance, and other factors.

Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.
    Motif makes no representation regarding the suitability of a particular investment or investment strategy.  You are responsible for all investment decisions you make including understanding the risks involved with your

Proper corporate governance is important to Senior Housing Properties Trust. Since we became a public company in 1999, a majority of our Board of Trustees has been independent, and all of our Board’s Committees, including our Audit Committee, have been comprised solely of Independent Trustees.

We have a five member Board of Trustees, of which three are Independent Trustees. There are three standing Committees of the Board: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee. The Board has also adopted Governance Guidelines and Committee Charters for each of its Committees. 

The Board’s Audit Committee currently has a qualified Audit Committee "financial expert" as defined by SEC rules. We also have a Director of Internal Audit who reports directly to the Board’s Audit Committee.

All of the company’s Trustees, officers and personnel are subject to a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. On December 9, 2014, Senior Housing Properties Trust’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") was amended to clarify policies regarding reporting of conflicts of interest and violations of the law and the Code. The Code was also revised to recognize that our manager is now controlled by a public company.
We also have a Governance Hotline that allows users to report matters directly to Senior Management, the Board of Trustees or the Audit Committee.

Is Senior Housing Properties Trust a Buy?
The trends look good for healthcare real estate -- is this the way to play it?

I've written several times about the merits of healthcare real estate as a long-term investment, and senior housing properties are one of my favorite types. So Senior Housing Properties Trust (NASDAQ:SNH) would seem like a logical choice. However, just because I like the industry doesn't make Senior Housing Properties Trust a great company. Let's take a closer look at this healthcare REIT and see how it stacks up against my favorite healthcare REIT, sector heavyweight Welltower (NYSE:HCN).
How does Senior Housing Properties Trust make its money? As a real estate investment trust, or REIT, Senior Housing Properties Trust has as its main business acquiring properties and leasing them to tenants. And as the name implies, this REIT's properties are mainly related to senior housing and related healthcare operations.
Currently, the company owns 428 properties -- 55% of which are some variety of senior housing (assisted living, independent living, or skilled nursing facilities), and 42% are medical office buildings.

Source: Senior Housing Properties Trust. 





Most of the properties are private-pay, which created limited exposure to government reimbursement -- which creates a big question mark for the future of many peers. And the company is well diversified, both geographically and among its 640 tenants. Finally, Senior Housing Properties partners with some of the best operators in the business to run their facilities, including Five Star Senior Living, Brookdale Senior Living, and Sunrise Senior Living.
Why invest in senior housing? Basically, there are two main compelling reasons to invest in senior housing, and healthcare in general. First, the market is highly fragmented. The healthcare real estate market is estimated to be about $1 trillion in size, and even the largest REITs have less than a 3% market share. So there is tremendous opportunity for consolidation ahead.
Second, and most importantly, the demographics indicate that the future will hold a lot of demand for senior housing properties. The U.S. population is aging rapidly, and with millions of baby boomers getting ready to retire, there will be a tremendous need for senior housing. In fact, during the 20-year period from 2010 to 2030, the 65-plus population is expected to grow by 78%.

Capital structure This is one area where Senior Housing Properties Trust looks a little riskier than its peers. Less than half (49%) of the company's capitalization consists of equity, while the other 51% is debt. And, about one-fifth of the debt is mortgage-based, meaning that the loans are secured by the underlying properties. Both of these metrics are significantly higher than those of major competitors.
The result of this level of debt is an interest coverage ratio of 3.5. In other words, Senior Housing Properties Trust earns $3.50 for every dollar in interest it needs to pay. This may sound pretty good -- and it indeed provides the company with a nice cushion before it would become unprofitable, but it significantly lags behind some of the industry's heavyweights.
For comparison, Welltower's debt makes up just under 40% of its capitalization, resulting in a much more comfortable interest coverage of 4.3, and the company has committed to maintaining a 60/40 equity/debt ratio on all new capital raised since 2010.
Dividends and performance history As far as dividends go, Senior Housing Properties Trust pays a $1.56 annual dividend, which translates into an impressive 8.9% yield as of this writing. Even more impressive is that it appears to be sustainable, at 85% of the company's normalized funds from operations (FFO) -- on the higher end, but pretty normal for a REIT. For comparison, Welltower pays out 73% of its FFO, but it produces a lower 5.1% dividend yield.





However, the dividend history isn't quite so impressive. Sure, the company has a decent history of increases, but there are two things to point out from the following chart.

Source: Senior Housing Properties Trust. 
Most obviously, notice that there haven't been any increases for the past three years. I've written before that a stock's ability to sustainably increase its dividend every year is a big factor in my decision to invest. Simply put, a stagnant dividend looks great now, but it won't look as great in a few years as inflation erodes its purchasing power.
Additionally, note that the dividend has only grown by an average of 1.8% per year since 2002 -- not the type of long-term growth rate we want to see. For comparison's sake, the aforementioned Welltower has increased its dividend at an average rate of 5.7% over its 45-year history.
Now, I'm not saying this record makes Senior Housing Properties Trust a bad dividend stock by any means, just that it lags behind peers in certain key metrics.
As far as performance is concerned, the stock has produced an average total return of 11% per year for its investors over the past 15 years -- not too bad at all. This handily beats the S&P over the same time period, but it does fall short of Welltower's performance. In fairness, past performance doesn't necessarily predict future results -- but it can be a pretty good indicator.

Valuation compared to peers I mentioned funds from operations (FFO) a little while ago. This should be thought of as the "earnings" of the REIT world, as it is the best representation of how much money these companies are actually making.
Having said that, let's take a look at how Senior Housing Properties Trust stacks up to some of its peers.

Physicians Realty Trust (DOC)

$0.92


19.9




Senior Housing Properties Trust certain trades at the low end of the valuation spectrum, which can help to make up for the higher-than-peers debt load and the added risk that comes with it.
So, is it a buy? On paper, there are several reasons why one might want to go with one of the healthcare REIT giants such as Welltower -- lower debt, stronger track record of performance, and so on. However, Senior Housing Property Trust is a solid and stable company with a dividend yield of nearly 9%, which is rare.
Additionally, while its performance history may not be quite up to the level of its peers, a 11% average total return sustained over a 15-year period is still pretty impressive. And, the fact that a stock with such a metric trades for just 9.5 times earnings make it look pretty cheap to me. As long as you're aware of the extra risk going in (like the higher debt load I discussed), Senior Housing Properties Trust could be a strong income stock for your portfolio for years to come.

Better Buy: HCP, Inc. vs. Senior Housing Properties Trust
Which of the two senior-focused REITs is the best buy now?

Healthcare real estate is an interesting long-term opportunity, as the aging U.S. population should translate into steady demand growth for healthcare. Senior housing is one of my favorite ways to invest in healthcare over the long term, as it will be a particularly strong beneficiary of the aging population and doesn't rely too much on government reimbursement programs like Medicare and Medicaid to generate income.
Two of the most senior housing-focused REITs are HCP Inc. (NYSE:HCP) and Senior Housing Properties Trust (NASDAQ:SNH). Here's a quick rundown of the companies, and which one is the better buy right now.

Image source: Getty Images.

Comparing the companies
HCP underwent a major repositioning in 2016, with the spinoff of its skilled nursing assets into a newly created REIT. Now, the company has approximately 800 properties, 44% of which are senior housing, 22% are medical offices, and 21% are life-science properties. 94% of HCP's portfolio is made up of private-pay revenue sources, which is generally more stable than properties dependent on government reimbursements.

On the other hand, Senior Housing Properties Trust owns 434 properties and concentrates on just two main property types. Senior housing makes up 53% of the portfolio, and medical offices make up 41%. There are smaller positions in skilled nursing facilities and wellness centers. 97% of the company's net operating income is derived from private-pay properties. By market cap, Senior Housing Properties Trust is approximately one-third of HCP's size.

So, both have similar focuses and are well-positioned to benefit from the aging U.S. population. HCP is larger and has a more diverse mix of properties, while Senior Housing Properties Trust has an edge in private-pay revenue.
Dividend and performance history
Senior Housing Properties Trust has the higher dividend of the two, with an annual yield of 7.3%, versus 4.7% for HCP.
Until last year's spinoff transaction, HCP maintained a fantastic record of dividend increases. In fact, the company was a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, having raised its dividend for more than 25 consecutive years. Now that the spinoff is complete and the accompanying dividend reduction has been made, it remains to be seen whether the company will continue to increase its payout going forward.
Senior Housing Properties Trust has a strong track record of dividend payments, but it has not increased its dividend since 2013. However, the company's FFO payout ratio has dropped in recent years and now sits at 83% of normalized FFO, so there's room for increases in the future. In a nutshell, both companies have strong, but not perfect, dividend histories.
Despite the higher dividend yield, there's not a major difference in the historical performance of the two companies. In fact, the total returns produced by both stocks over the past 15 years are nearly identical.

Valuation
The companies have similar portfolios and have delivered similar performances for investors. Also, both are in similar financial shape. Senior Housing Properties Trusts has a 42% leverage ratio, while HCP projects that it will have leverage in the 43% to 44% range once announced dispositions have been completed.
So, let's take a look at each company's valuation to see which might be the better choice right now.

Data sources: Guidance obtained from each company's most recent quarterly report, and adjusted/normalized FFO figures were used, where applicable. Stock prices are as of 5/25/2017. HCP's FFO is excluding the effects of spun-off assets.
Which is the best buy?
To be clear, I'm a fan of both stocks and own HCP in my personal portfolio. Both companies have similar business models and have produced nearly identical returns for shareholders. However, Senior Housing Properties looks like a far more compelling value right now, so if I were to buy one of the two today, that's the one I'd go with.

	Ladies and Gentlemen:




	 




	Senior Housing Properties Trust, a real estate investment trust organized under the laws of the State of Maryland (the Company), proposes to issue and sell to the underwriters named in

	Schedule A

	annexed hereto (the Underwriters), for whom Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (the Representatives) an aggregate of 27,000,000 common shares (the Firm Shares) of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per share (the Common Shares), of the Company.  In addition, the Company proposes to grant to the Underwriters the option to purchase up to an additional 4,050,000 Common Shares (the Additional Shares).  The Firm Shares and the Additional Shares are hereinafter collectively sometimes referred to as the Shares. The Shares are described in the Prospectus which is referred to below.




	 




	The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission), in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the Act), a registration statement (File No. 333-182468) on Form S-3 under the Act (the shelf registration statement), including a prospectus relating to, among other things, the Common Shares, preferred shares of beneficial interest,

	depository shares, guarantees, debt securities and warrants for such securities of the Company, and such amendments to such registration statement, as may have been required prior to the date hereof, have been similarly prepared and have been filed with the Commission.  Such shelf registration statement, as so amended, and any post-effective amendments thereto, have become effective under the Act.




	 




	The Company will next file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act a final prospectus supplement to the basic prospectus included in the shelf registration statement, as so amended, describing the Shares and the offering thereof, in such form as has been provided to or discussed with, and approved by, the Underwriters.




	 




	Except where the context otherwise requires, the term Registration Statement as used in this Agreement means the shelf registration statement, as amended at the time it became effective for purposes of Section 11 of the Act, as such section applies to the respective Underwriters (the Effective Time), including (i) all documents filed as part thereof or incorporated by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein and (ii) any information contained or incorporated by reference in a prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, to the extent such information is deemed, pursuant to Rule 430B or Rule 430C under the Act, to be part of the registration statement at the Effective Time.




	 




	Except where the context otherwise requires, the term Basic Prospectus as used in this Agreement means the prospectus dated June 29, 2012 included in the shelf registration statement.  Except where the context otherwise requires, the term Prepricing Prospectus as used in this Agreement means each preliminary form of the Prospectus (as defined herein) subject to completion, if any, used in connection with the offering of the Shares.  Except where the context otherwise requires, the term Prospectus Supplement as used in this Agreement means any final prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Shares, in the form filed with, or transmitted for filing to, the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act.  Except where the context otherwise requires, the term Prospectus as used in this Agreement means the Basic Prospectus together with the Prospectus Supplement, except that if such Basic Prospectus is amended or supplemented on or prior to the date on which the Prospectus Supplement was first filed pursuant to Rule 424, the term Prospectus shall refer to the Basic Prospectus as so amended or supplemented and as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement.




	 




	Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, as used herein, means the documents listed on

	Schedule B

	attached hereto and each road show (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act), if any, related to the offering of the Shares contemplated hereby that is a written communication (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act).




	 




	Disclosure Package, as used herein, means the Basic Prospectus, including without limitation the documents incorporated by reference therein as of the time of sale (as defined below), together with any Prepricing Prospectus together with the information included in

	Schedule F

	hereto and any combination of one or more of the Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, listed on

	Schedule B

	.




	 




	2














	 




	Any reference in this Agreement to the shelf registration statement, the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Prepricing Prospectus, any Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein, in each case as amended (as amended, the Incorporated Documents), including, unless the context otherwise requires, the documents, if any, filed as exhibits to such Incorporated Documents.  Any reference in this Agreement to the term amend, amendment or supplement with respect to the shelf registration statement, the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Prepricing Prospectus, any Prospectus Supplement, any Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), on or after the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, or the date of such Basic Prospectus, such Prepricing Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus or such Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, as the case may be, and deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.




	 




	The Company and the Underwriters agree as follows:




	 




	1.


	                                   


	Sale and Purchase

	.  Upon the basis of the representations and warranties and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company agrees to issue and sell to each Underwriter, and, upon the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and subject to all the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in

	Schedule A

	attached hereto (subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 8 hereof) at a purchase price of $21.2565 per share (the Purchase Price Per Share).



	 




	The Company is advised by you that the Underwriters intend (i) to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Firm Shares as soon after the date hereof as in your judgment is advisable and (ii) initially to offer the Firm Shares upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus.  You may from time to time increase or decrease the public offering price after the initial public offering to such extent as you may determine.




	 




	In addition, the Company hereby grants to the several Underwriters the option to purchase, and upon the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and subject to all the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Underwriters shall have the right to purchase, severally and not jointly, from the Company, ratably in accordance with the number of Firm Shares to be purchased by each of them (subject to such adjustment as you shall determine to avoid fractional shares), all or a portion of the Additional Shares at the Purchase Price Per Share less an amount per Share equal to any dividend or distribution payable on the Firm Shares but not payable on the Additional Shares.  This option may be exercised by you on behalf of the several Underwriters at any time on or before the thirtieth day following the date hereof, by written notice to the Company.  Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Additional Shares as to which the option is being exercised, and the date and time when the Additional Shares are to be delivered (such date and time being herein referred to as




	 




	3














	 




	the additional time of purchase);

	provided

	,

	however

	, that the additional time of purchase shall not be earlier than the time of purchase (as defined below) nor earlier than the second business day after the date on which the option shall have been exercised nor later than the tenth business day after the date on which the option shall have been exercised.  The number of Additional Shares to be sold to each Underwriter shall be the number which bears the same proportion to the aggregate number of Additional Shares being purchased as the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter on

	Schedule A

	Effective Date of Agreement; Termination

	.  This Agreement shall become effective: (i) upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto; or (ii) if, at the time this Agreement is executed and delivered, it is necessary for the registration statement or a post-effective amendment thereto to be declared or become effective before the offering of the Shares may commence, when notification of the effectiveness of the registration statement or such post-effective amendment has been released by the Commission.  Until such time as this Agreement shall have become effective, it may be terminated by notifying you, or by you, as representatives of the Underwriters, by notifying the Company.



	 




	The obligations of the several Underwriters hereunder shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. if (i) since the time of execution of this Agreement or the earlier respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, any Prepricing Prospectus, the Prospectus and the Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, there has been any material adverse change or any development involving a prospective material adverse change in the business, properties, management, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole, which would, in the judgment of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement, any Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or (ii) since the time of execution of this Agreement, there shall have occurred: (A) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the NYSE, the NYSE MKT or the NASDAQ Stock Market Inc.; (B) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Companys securities on the NYSE; (C) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either federal or New York State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (D) an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving the United States or a declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; or (E) any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (D) or (E), in the judgment of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement, any Disclosure Package or the Prospectus.




	 




	If Citigroup Global Markets Inc. elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section 7, the Company and each other Underwriter shall be notified promptly in writing.




	 




	If the sale to the Underwriters of the Shares, as contemplated by this Agreement, is not carried out by the Underwriters for any reason permitted under this




	 




	24














	 




	Agreement or if such sale is not carried out because the Company shall be unable to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall not be under any obligation or liability under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Sections 4(a)(xiv), 5 and 9 hereof), and the Underwriters shall be under no obligation or liability to the Company under this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Section 10 hereof) or to one another hereunder.




	 




	8.


	                                   


	Increase in Underwriters Commitments

	.  Subject to Sections 6 and 7 hereof, if any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to take up and pay for the Firm Shares to be purchased by it hereunder (otherwise than for reasons sufficient to justify the termination of this Agreement under the provisions of Section 7 hereof) and if the number of Firm Shares which all Underwriters so defaulting shall have agreed but failed to take up and pay for does not exceed 10% of the total aggregate number of Firm Shares, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall take up and pay for (in addition to the Firm Shares they are obligated to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof) the Firm Shares agreed to be purchased by all such defaulting Underwriters, as hereinafter provided.  Such Firm Shares shall be taken up and paid for by such non-defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters in such amount or amounts as you may designate with the consent of each Underwriter so designated or, in the event no such designation is made, such Firm Shares shall be taken up and paid for by all non-defaulting Underwriters pro rata in proportion to the aggregate number of Firm Shares set opposite the names of such non-defaulting Underwriters in

	Schedule A

	.



	 




	Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter from its obligations hereunder, the Company agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters that it will not sell any Firm Shares hereunder unless all of the Firm Shares are purchased by the Underwriters (or by substituted Underwriters selected by you with the approval of the Company or selected by the Company with your approval).




	 




	If a new Underwriter or Underwriters are substituted by the Underwriters or by the Company for a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters in accordance with the foregoing provision, the Company or you shall have the right to postpone the time of purchase for a period not exceeding five business days in order that any necessary changes in the Prospectus and other documents may be effected.




	 




	The term Underwriter as used in this Agreement shall refer to and include any Underwriter substituted under this Section 8 with like effect as if such substituted Underwriter had originally been named in

	Schedule A

	.




	 




	If the aggregate number of Firm Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase exceeds 10% of the total number of Firm Shares which all Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, and if neither the non-defaulting Underwriters nor the Company shall make arrangements within the five business day period stated above for the purchase of all the Firm Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed to purchase hereunder, this Agreement shall be terminated without further act or deed and without any liability on the part of the Company to any non-defaulting Underwriter and without any liability on the part of any




	 




	25














	 




	non-defaulting Underwriter to the Company.  Nothing in this paragraph, and no action taken hereunder, shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

	(a)


	                              

	The Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, affiliates, directors and officers and agents and any person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, any such Underwriter or any such person may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company) or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as any such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives to the Company expressly for use in, the Registration Statement or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in the Registration Statement in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was required to be stated in such Registration Statement or was necessary to make such information not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any Prospectus (the term Prospectus for the purpose of this Section 9 being deemed to include any Basic Prospectus, any Prepricing Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus and any amendments or supplements to the foregoing), in any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, in any issuer information (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) of the Company or in any Prospectus together with any combination of one or more of the Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, or in the Disclosure Package or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except, with respect to such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, insofar as any such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information concerning such Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives to the Company expressly for use in, such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Disclosure Package or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Disclosure Package in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was



	 




	26














	 




	necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.




	 




	(b)


	                             

	Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its trustees, affiliates, officers and agents and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing persons, from and against any loss, damage, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, the Company or any such person may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act, the common law or otherwise, insofar as such loss, damage, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective amendment thereof by the Company), or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Registration Statement in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was required to be stated in such Registration Statement or was necessary to make such information not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in, and in conformity with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives to the Company expressly for use in, a Prospectus or a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in such Prospectus or Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Disclosure Package in connection with such information, which material fact was not contained in such information and which material fact was necessary in order to make the statements in such information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.



	 




	(c)


	                              

	If any action, suit or proceeding (each, a Proceeding) is brought against any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9, such person (the indemnified party) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the indemnifying party) in writing of the institution of such Proceeding and such indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such Proceeding, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party) and payment of all fees and expenses;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that the omission to so notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party or otherwise.  Such indemnified party shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by such indemnifying party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding or such indemnifying party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to defend such Proceeding or such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them which are different from or additional to or in conflict with those available to such indemnifying party (in which case such



	 




	27














	 




	indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party or parties, but such indemnifying party may employ counsel and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnifying party), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by such indemnifying party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such Proceeding).  No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any such Proceeding effected without the written consent of such indemnifying party but if settled with the written consent of such indemnifying party, such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of this paragraph, then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 30 days prior notice of its intention to settle.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault, liability or failure to act, by or on behalf of such indemnified party.




	 




	(d)


	                            

	If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 9 in respect of any losses, damage, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, damages, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportion as the total proceeds from the offering (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the



	 




	28














	 




	Underwriters, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Shares.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by the Underwriters on the other and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, damages, expenses, liabilities and claims referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding.




	 




	(e)


	                              

	The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in subsection (d) above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damage which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.



	 




	(f)


	                               

	The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its partners, directors, officers, employees or agents or any person (including each partner, officer, director, employee or agent of such person) who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company, its trustees, officers, employees or agents or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Shares.  The Company and each Underwriter agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company, against any of the Companys officers, trustees, employees or agents in connection with the issuance and sale of the Shares, or in connection with the Registration Statement, any Prepricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus or the Disclosure Package.

	Schedule A

	to the Underwriting Agreement (collectively, the Underwriters), with respect to the public offering (the Offering) of common shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the Common Shares).




	 




	In order to induce you to enter into the Underwriting Agreement, the undersigned agrees that for a period from the date hereof until the end of 60 days after the date of the final prospectus supplement relating to the Offering the undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Citi), (i) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file (or participate in the filing of) a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder with respect to, any Common Shares of the Company or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Shares, or warrants or other rights to purchase Common Shares, (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of Common Shares or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Shares, or warrants or other rights to purchase Common Shares, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of Common Shares or such other securities, in cash or otherwise, or (iii) publicly announce an intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (i) or (ii).




	 




	Notwithstanding the above, if (a) during the period that begins on the date that is fifteen (15) calendar days plus three (3) business days before the last day of the Lock-Up Period and ends on the last day of the Lock-Up Period, the Company issues an

	earnings release or material news or a material event relating to the Company occurs; or (b) prior to the expiration of the Lock-Up Period, the Company announces that it will release earnings results during the sixteen (16) day period beginning on the last day of the Lock-Up Period, then the restrictions imposed by this Lock-Up Agreement shall continue to apply until the expiration of the date that is fifteen (15) calendar days plus three (3) business days after the date on which the issuance of the earnings release or the material news or material event occurs, except that such extension will not apply if within three (3) business days prior to the 15th calendar day before the last day of the Lock-Up Period, the Company delivers a certificate, signed by the Chief Financial Officer or Chief Executive Officer of the Company, certifying on behalf of the Company that (i) the Common Shares are actively traded securities (as defined in Regulation M), (ii) the Company meets the applicable requirements of Rule 139 under the Securities Act of 1933 in the manner contemplated by FINRA Rule 2711(f)(4), and (iii) the provisions of FINRA Rule 2711(f)(4) are not applicable to any research reports relating to the Company published or distributed by any of the Underwriters during the 15 days before or after the last day of the Lock-up Period (before giving effect to such extension).




	 




	The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to (a) the registration of or sale to the Underwriters of any Common Shares pursuant to the Offering and the Underwriting Agreement, (b) bona fide gifts, provided the recipient or recipients thereof agree in writing with the Underwriters to be bound by the terms of this Lock-Up Letter Agreement, or (c) dispositions to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned and/or the immediate family of the undersigned, provided that such trust agrees in writing with the Underwriters to be bound by the terms of this Lock-Up Letter Agreement.




	 




	In addition, the undersigned hereby waives any rights the undersigned may have to require registration of Common Shares in connection with the filing of a registration statement relating to the Offering.  The undersigned further agrees that, for a period from the date hereof until the end of 60 days after the date of the final prospectus relating to the Offering, the undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., make any demand for, or exercise any right with respect to, the registration of Common Shares of the Company or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Shares, or warrants or other rights to purchase Common Shares.




	 




	EA-2














	 




	If (i) the Company notifies you in writing that it does not intend to proceed with the Offering, (ii) the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the Offering is withdrawn or (iii) for any reason the Underwriting Agreement shall be terminated prior to the time of purchase (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement), this Lock-Up Letter Agreement shall be terminated and the undersigned shall be released from its obligations hereunder.

	Re:


	                            



	Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-182468)





	 




	Ladies and Gentlemen:




	 




	We have served as Maryland counsel to Senior Housing Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the Company), in connection with certain matters of Maryland law arising out of the sale and issuance of up to 31,050,000 common shares (the Shares) of beneficial interest, $.01 par value per share, of the Company (including up to 4,050,000 Shares which the underwriters in the Offering (as defined below) have the option to purchase) in an underwritten public offering (the Offering), covered by the above-referenced Registration Statement, and all amendments thereto (the Registration Statement), filed by the Company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act).




	 




	In connection with our representation of the Company, and as a basis for the opinion hereinafter set forth, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the following documents (collectively, the Documents):




	 




	1.


	                                     


	The Registration Statement and the Prospectus included therein;

	3.


	                                     


	The Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust of the Company, as amended and supplemented (the Declaration of Trust), certified by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the SDAT);

	Such other documents and matters as we have deemed necessary or appropriate to express the opinion set forth below, subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications stated herein.




	 




	In expressing the opinion set forth below, we have assumed the following:




	 




	1.


	                                     


	Each individual executing any of the Documents, whether on behalf of such individual or another person, is legally competent to do so.




	 




	2.


	                                     


	Each individual executing any of the Documents on behalf of a party (other than the Company) is duly authorized to do so.




	 




	3.


	                                     


	Each of the parties (other than the Company) executing any of the Documents has duly and validly executed and delivered each of the Documents to which such party is a signatory, and such partys obligations set forth therein are legal, valid and binding and are enforceable in accordance with all stated terms.

	Ladies and Gentlemen:




	 




	The following opinion is furnished to Senior Housing Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the Company), to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) as Exhibit 8.1 to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed within one week of the date hereof (the Form 8-K) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.




	 




	We have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with its Registration Statement on Form S-3, File No. 333-182468 (the Registration Statement), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act).  We have reviewed originals or copies of the Registration Statement, such corporate records, such certificates and statements of officers of the Company and of public officials, and such other documents as we have considered relevant and necessary in order to furnish the opinion hereinafter set forth.  In doing so, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such documents.  Specifically, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we have reviewed: (i) the Companys amended and restated declaration of trust, as amended and supplemented, and its amended and restated bylaws; (ii) the prospectus supplement dated February 4, 2015 (the Prospectus Supplement) to the final prospectus dated June 29, 2012 (as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, the Prospectus), which forms a part of the Registration Statement, relating to,

	inter alia

	, the Companys offering of common shares of beneficial interest in the Company (the common shares so offered, the Offered Securities); (iii) the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 (the Form 10-K); and (iv) the Companys Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for its quarterly periods ended March 31, 2014, June 30, 2014, and September 30, 2014 (the Forms 10-Q).




	 




	The opinion set forth below is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Treasury regulations issued thereunder, published administrative interpretations

	thereof, and judicial decisions with respect thereto, all as of the date hereof (collectively, Tax Laws), and upon the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Labor regulations issued thereunder, published administrative interpretations thereof, and judicial decisions with respect thereto, all as of the date hereof (collectively, ERISA Laws).  No assurance can be given that Tax Laws or ERISA Laws will not change.  In preparing the discussions with respect to Tax Laws matters and ERISA Laws matters in the sections of Item 1 of the Form 10-K captioned Federal Income Tax Considerations and ERISA Plans, Keogh Plans and Individual Retirement Accounts, as supplemented by the section of the Prospectus Supplement captioned Federal income tax and ERISA considerations, we have made certain assumptions therein and expressed certain conditions and qualifications therein, all of which assumptions, conditions and qualifications are incorporated herein by reference.  With respect to all questions of fact on which our opinion is based, we have assumed the initial and continuing truth, accuracy and completeness of: (i) the information set forth in the Form 10-K, in the Forms 10-Q, in the Prospectus and the Registration Statement and the documents incorporated therein by reference, and in the exhibits to the Form 10-K, the Forms 10-Q and the Registration Statement; and (ii) representations made to us by officers of the Company or contained in the Form 10-K, in the Forms 10-Q, in the Prospectus and the Registration Statement and the documents incorporated therein by reference, and in the exhibits to the Form 10-K, the Forms 10-Q and the Registration Statement, in each such instance without regard to qualifications such as to the best knowledge of or in the belief of.  We have not independently verified such information.




	 




	We have relied upon, but not independently verified, the foregoing assumptions.  If any of the foregoing assumptions are inaccurate or incomplete for any reason, or if the transactions described in the Form 10-K, in the Forms 10-Q, in the Prospectus, or the Registration Statement, or any exhibits thereto or any documents incorporated therein by reference have been consummated in a manner that is inconsistent with the manner contemplated therein, our opinion as expressed below may be adversely affected and may not be relied upon.




	 




	Based upon and subject to the foregoing: (i) we are of the opinion that the discussions with respect to Tax Laws matters and ERISA Laws matters in the sections of Item 1 of the Form 10-K captioned Federal Income Tax Considerations and ERISA Plans, Keogh Plans and Individual Retirement Accounts, as supplemented by the discussion in the section of the Prospectus Supplement captioned Federal income tax and ERISA considerations, in all material respects are, subject to the limitations set forth therein, the material Tax Laws consequences and the material ERISA Laws consequences relevant to holders of the Offered Securities; and (ii) we hereby confirm that the opinions of counsel referred to in said sections represent our opinions on the subject matter thereof.




	 




	Our opinion above is limited to the matters specifically covered hereby, and we have not been asked to address, nor have we addressed, any other matters or any other transactions.

	Further, we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes of the matters stated, represented or assumed herein or any subsequent changes in Tax Laws or ERISA Laws.




	 




	This opinion is rendered to you in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities under the Prospectus.  This opinion may not be relied upon for any other purpose, or furnished to, quoted or relied upon by any other person, firm or corporation for any purpose, without our prior written consent, except that (i) this opinion may be furnished or quoted to judicial or regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over you, and (ii) this opinion may be relied upon by purchasers and holders of the Offered Securities currently entitled to rely on it pursuant to applicable provisions of federal securities law.  Purchasers and holders of the Offered Securities are urged to consult their own tax advisors or counsel, particularly with respect to their particular tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of the Offered Securities, which may vary for investors in different tax situations.  We hereby consent to the filing of a copy of this opinion as an exhibit to the Form 8-K, which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, and to the references to our firm in the Prospectus Supplement and the Registration Statement.  In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or under the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder.
