Joseph P Palm's Experience
Title: Project Manager
               Company: Ministry Health Care Inc
Job Details
               Ministry Health Care, which includes the recently acquired Affinity Health System, is an integrated healthcare delivery system serving more than 1.1 million people across Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota. Ministry operations generate more than $2.2 billion in annual operating revenue with 15 hospitals, 46 clinics and nearly 12,000 employees. More than 650 physicians and advanced practice clinicians provide personalized care at Ministry primary and specialty care clinic locations. Home healthcare, hospice and long-term care services are also provided across the region. Sponsored by the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother, Ministry Health Care is a leading network of hospitals, clinics, long-term care facilities, home care agencies, dialysis centers and many other programs and services in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Our mission as a Catholic health care system is to further the healing ministry of Jesus by continually improving the health and well-being of all people, especially the poor, in the communities we serve.  In all that we do, the Sisters' values guide our actions. We provide holistic service that meets people's needs while considering the good of society. We involve people in decisions that are important to them. Our Christian beliefs shape our vision of social responsibility. We enable risk-taking and reward creativity that improves people's quality of life. Wherever we are, our presence is marked by compassion, integrity, collaboration and accountability. We set future directions that assure the dignity and development of people above all else. We stand with the poor. Justice calls us to confront conditions of oppression and to help change structures that violate people's dignity.  We are grateful for the courage, leadership and faith of the early Sisters, who started our first hospital, Saint Joseph's in Marshfield, Wisconsin, in 1890. From that humble start, Ministry Health Care has grown into an integrated health care network featuring 2,500 highly skilled physicians, 10,000 health care professionals and other support staff, as well as countless volunteers. Clearly, the Sisters' legacy lives on.  Ministry Health Care is a member of Marian Health System, a not-for-profit Catholic health care system sponsored by the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother. Other members of Marian Health System are Saint Clare's Health Services in Denville, New Jersey; and Saint John Health System in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Via Christi Health System in Wichita, Kansas is co-sponsored by Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother and Sisters of Saint Joseph.
Title: Strategic Planning Position

Joseph P. Palm Elected to Arabian American Development Board of Directors

		  Industry Veteran Brings More than 40 Years of Experience to the Board
		

Jun 02, 2011, 08:30 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Arabian American Development Co. 











 
















































 

 




















 


SUGAR LAND, Texas, June 2, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Arabian American Development Co. (Nasdaq:   ARSD) today announced that Joseph P. Palm, a proven executive with significant relationships in the oil and chemical markets, was elected to the Board of Directors of the Company effective May 20, 2011. Mr. Palm will serve on the Audit, Nominating, and Compensation committees of the Board. This brings the total number of board members for the Company to seven, four of whom are considered independent under Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Mr. Palm has over 40 years of industry experience primarily in marketing and business development including 13 years with BP Amoco Chemical as marketing manager and business development manager and over 25 years in marketing, product development and business development for Rohm and Haas Company, a specialty chemical company. Mr. Palm served in the United States Army from 1968 to 1971 and completed his tour as a Staff Sergeant (E-6). He has an undergraduate degree from LaSalle University, Philadelphia, Pa., and holds an MBA from Xavier University, Cincinnati.
Nick Carter, President and CEO commented, "Joe's extensive and varied experience brings unique skills in asset management, marketing, sales and new business development in our industry that will add to the depth of the Board of Directors.  We are happy to welcome Joe to the group and feel he will provide an area of expertise that will help us as we expand our reach in moving our products around the world."
Mr. Palm commented, "I look forward to working closely with the board and management to leverage the Company's reputation and competitive position in the petrochemical industry and welcome the opportunity to contribute to maximizing value for investors over the long term."
About Arabian American Development Company (ARSD)
ARSD owns and operates a petrochemical facility located in southeast Texas just north of Beaumont which specializes in high purity petrochemical solvents and other solvent type manufacturing. The Company is also the original developer and now a 41% investor in a Saudi Arabian joint stock company involving a mining project which is currently under construction in the Najran Province of southwest Saudi Arabia. The mine is scheduled to be in production in late 2011 or early 2012 and will produce economic quantities of zinc, copper, gold, and silver. 
Safe Harbor 
Statements in this release that are not historical facts are forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements are based upon management's belief as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management. Because such statements are based upon expectations as to future economic performance and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ from those projected. These risks, as well as others, are discussed in greater detail in Arabian American's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Arabian American's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,  2010, and the Company's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
