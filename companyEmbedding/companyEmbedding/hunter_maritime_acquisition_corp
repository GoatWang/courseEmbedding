Definition
Accounts Receivable is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset.

Explanation
1. Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Days sales outstanding measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company's accounts receivables are being managed.

* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.

(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we
    received in the form of a loan we received from our sponsor, as described
    below. This loan will be repaid out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds
    that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses other than
    underwriting commissions. As of the date of this prospectus, we have drawn
    down an aggregate of $50,000 under the promissory note with our sponsor.
    This loan is unsecured and bears interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR plus
    0.60%.    

(2) Includes underwriting discounts and commissions equal to 5.50% of the gross 
    proceeds from the sale of the units in the offering, or $8,250,000 (or      
    $9,487,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full),
    of which $5,250,000 (or $6,037,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment      
    option is exercised in full) will be deposited in the trust account and     
    which the underwriters have agreed to defer until the consummation of our
    initial business combination. If we consummate our initial business
    combination, $5,250,000 (or $6,037,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters as deferred
    underwriting discounts and commissions. If we fail to consummate our
    initial business combination meeting the criteria described herein within
    24 months from the closing of this offering, the underwriters have agreed
    to waive their right to these deferred underwriting discounts and
    commissions.                                                            

(3) The amount of net proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private   
    placement warrants not held in the trust account will remain constant at    
    $1,000,000 even if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised.    

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry       
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We  
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include investment earnings available to us from   
    the trust account.                                                          

After estimated non-deferred expenses of this offering and the private
placement, $150,000,000 (or $172,500,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) will be placed in a trust account in Belgium at KBC
Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.
Except for payment of taxes and investment earnings earned, after taxes payable,
on the trust account to fund our working capital requirements, the proceeds will
not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the consummation of
our initial business combination or our liquidation (after payment or provision
for our then current and estimated future liabilities). All remaining proceeds
held in the trust account, including investment earnings earned (after taxes
payable on such income and after reservation for any taxes assessed against us
by any governmental or taxing authority) on the trust account, will be available
for use in consummating our initial business combination and for payment of the
deferred underwriting discounts and commissions or will be released to public
shareholders upon exercise of their conversion rights or to public shareholders
entitled to receive liquidating distributions upon our liquidation (after
payment or provision for our then current and estimated future liabilities), as
the case may be. We may not use all of the funds remaining in the trust account
in connection with our initial business combination (and related conversion
rights), either because the consideration for the initial business combination
is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance a portion
of the consideration with our equity or debt securities or other borrowings. In
that event, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will constitute
working capital for our business after our initial business combination.

Our sponsor has provided an unsecured loan in the amount of up to $250,000 to us
to be used for the payment of certain of our offering expenses listed in the
table above, which will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the
$1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of
offering expenses. As of the date of this prospectus, we have drawn down an
aggregate of $50,000 under the promissory note with our sponsor. This loan is
unsecured and bears interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR plus 0.60%.

We have allocated $1,000,000 of the net proceeds from this offering and proceeds
from the sale of the private placement warrants to fund a portion of our working
capital. We intend to fund a portion of our working capital requirements from a
portion of the investment earnings earned (after taxes payable) on the trust
account. Under the terms of the investment management trust agreement,
investment earnings may be released to us in such amounts and at such intervals
as we request, subject to availability. Although we do not know the rate of
interest to be earned on the trust account and are unable to predict an exact
amount of time it will take to complete an initial business combination, we
believe that following the completion of this offering, it will take some time
to find a prospective target business and take all of the steps necessary to
complete an initial business combination. In order to fund working capital
deficiencies, if any, or to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, we may be required to seek loans or
additional investments from our executive officers, directors or initial
shareholders or from third parties. However, none of our executive officers,
directors or initial shareholders or any third party is under any obligation to
advance funds to us or to invest in us in such circumstances.

Our operating expenses prior to our initial business combination will include,
but not be limited to, deposits or down payments for a proposed initial business
combination, legal, accounting and other expenses, including due diligence
expenses and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
the investigation, structuring and negotiation of our initial business
combination, director and officer liability insurance premiums and reserves,
legal and accounting fees, brokers’ retainer fees, consulting fees and finder’s
fees. We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be
performed by some or all of our executive officers and directors, and also that
it may include engaging an accounting firm or other third-party consultants. No
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our executive officers or directors, or corporate shareholder or any
of our or their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in
connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, including
in connection with such due diligence activities, other than compensation paid
to our non-executive director(s). However, our executive officers and directors
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel 
expenses) incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on a 
suitable initial business combination, and our sponsor, or an affiliate thereof,
will be entitled to receive payments of an aggregate of $10,000 per month for 
office space, secretarial support and administrative services. We believe that,
based on rents and fees for similar services in Antwerp, Belgium, the fees 
charged by our sponsor, or such affiliates thereof, are at least as favorable as
we could have obtained from unaffiliated third parties. All payments made to our
executive officers, directors and initial shareholders and our or their 
affiliates, other than the $10,000 per month payment described above, must be 
reviewed and approved by the members of our audit committee or a majority of our
disinterested directors.

While it is difficult to determine what the specific operating expenses of our
business after consummation of our initial business combination may be, we
expect that they may include some or all of the following: capital expenditures,
general ongoing expenses, including overhead, payroll and costs involved in
expanding markets and in developing strategic acquisitions or alliances. In
addition, we may use any remaining proceeds held in the trust account to satisfy
any unpaid reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our executive
officers and directors, as well as any unpaid finder’s fees or similar fees or
compensation, to the extent such expenses, fees or compensation exceed the sum
of the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and proceeds
properly withdrawable by us from the trust account.

In addition, it is also possible that we could use a portion of the funds not in
the trust account to pay finder’s fees, consulting fees or other similar
compensation, or make a deposit or down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision
with respect to a particular proposed initial business combination. In the event
that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of
our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise), if the
amount were large enough and we had already used up the other funds available to
us, we could be left with insufficient funds to continue searching for other
potential target businesses or otherwise fund our business. In such case, if we
were unable to secure additional financing, we would most likely fail to
consummate an initial business combination in the allotted time and be forced to
liquidate.

We believe that amounts not held in the trust account as well as the investment
earnings earned (after taxes payable) on the trust account that may be released
to us will be sufficient to pay our costs prior to, and in connection with, our
initial business combination as contemplated herein. This belief is based on the
fact that in-depth due diligence will most likely be undertaken only after we
have negotiated and signed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or
definitive agreement for an initial business combination or other preliminary
agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business combination. However,
if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and 
negotiating our initial business combination is less than the actual amount of
such costs, we may be required to raise additional capital, the availability,
amount and cost of which is currently unascertainable and cannot be assured. To
the extent that such costs exceed the amounts not held in the trust account and
the investment earnings earned (after taxes payable) on the trust account that
may be released to us from the trust account, such costs may not be reimbursed
by us unless and until we consummate an initial business combination. The role
of our executive officers and directors after an initial business combination is
uncertain and we have no current ability to determine what remuneration, if any,
will be paid to our executive officers and directors after our initial business
combination. Our executive officers and directors may, as part of any such
business combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of the costs
incurred by them that have not been reimbursed by us prior to the initial
business combination’s closing. If the target business’ owners do not agree to
such repayment, this could cause our executive officers and directors to view
such potential initial business combination unfavorably and result in a
conflict of interest.

If we do not have sufficient funds available to cover our costs, we may be
required to seek additional financing from our executive officers, our
directors, our initial shareholders or third parties. We may not be able to
obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, and no party,
including our executive officers, our directors, our initial shareholders or
third parties, is obligated to provide any additional financing to us. If we
fail to obtain the necessary additional financing, we may be required to
liquidate prior to consummating our initial business combination.

The net proceeds of this offering and the proceeds from the sale of the private
placement warrants that are not immediately required for the purposes set forth
above, as well as deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, will be held
in the trust account and invested only in United States “government securities”
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a
maturity of 180 days or less or money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act or securities
issued by the United States so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act.

Other than (i) the repayment of the loan from our sponsor, or an affiliate
thereof, described above, (ii) administrative fees relating to office space,
secretarial support and administrative services provided to us, and (iii) the
payment of compensation to our non-executive director(s) no compensation of any
kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid to any of our
executive officers, directors or initial shareholders or any of their respective
affiliates prior to or in connection with the initial business combination.
However, our executive officers and directors may receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account,
including investment earnings earned on their pro rata portion of the funds in
the trust account (less up to $100,000 of investment earnings to pay dissolution
expenses and which investment earnings shall be net of taxes payable and any
amounts released to us to fund working capital requirements) only in the event
of our liquidation upon our failure to consummate our initial business
combination meeting the criteria described herein within 24 months from the
closing of this offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in
principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination. In no
other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust account.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial
business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities
having a business objective similar to ours, including public and private
shipping companies, other blank check companies, private equity groups and other
funds that invest in the shipping industry, as well as other operating
businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well
established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business
combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors
possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our
ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available
financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in
pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to
pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their
redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial
business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they
potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses.
Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in
successfully negotiating an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated pursuant to the laws
of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and formed for the purpose of acquiring,
through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, debt acquisition,
stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business


 combination, vessels,
vessel contracts (including contracts for the purchase and charter-in by us of
vessels) or one or more operating businesses, which we intend to be in the
international maritime shipping industry, which we refer to throughout this
prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not identified any
business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf,
initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business
combination target. At or promptly following the completion of our initial
business combination, we will use our best efforts to transfer our corporate
domicile from the Marshall Islands to Belgium, which requires our shareholders’
approval under Belgian law and compliance with other applicable legal
requirements. We have agreed with our sponsor, among other things, not to
complete the initial business combination if we are unable to obtain such
shareholder approval, subject to waiver by our sponsor in its sole discretion.
Our sponsor and members of our management team have agreed to vote any common
shares owned by them in favor of the transfer of our corporate domicile to
Belgium.

While we may pursue one or more acquisition opportunities in various sectors of
the international maritime shipping industry, or the shipping industry, in the
event that we find opportunities in one or more different sectors that are more
compelling than other sectors, including unrelated to the shipping industry, we
would pursue those opportunities.

We believe that our management team is well positioned to take advantage of
opportunities in the shipping industry, and that our contacts and sources within
the shipping industry will allow us to generate attractive acquisition
opportunities.
