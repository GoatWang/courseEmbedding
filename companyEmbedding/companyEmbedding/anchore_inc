Pool Covers 

Anchor Industries, Inc. has been the leading innovator of safety pool covers for 40 years. For example, our mesh pool covers feature super-supportive webbing sewn to the underside for extraordinary strength—and our solid vinyl is coated (not laminated) for longer life. We also provide a turn-key replacement cover program, and stand behind every cover we manufacture. What’s more, in today’s era of creatively-designed pools, custom and irregularly shaped pool covers are an Anchor specialty.
Your preferences are important to us. Do you winterize with mesh pool covers? Do you prefer the super dependable protection of solid pool covers? Anchor Industries proudly offers our customers the very best product lines for these various cover materials—we’re here to satisfy your style preferences, without ever sacrificing the homeowner’s safety.
Anchor’s Solid Classic and 5-Star Solid Safety Covers contain super strong fabrics that resist tears, rips, sun damage, and the effects of chlorine. These amazing pool covers even block ALL sunlight from a pool. This feature inhibits algae growth, ensures incredibly easy clean up in the spring, and helps keep a pool area attractive all year. Each of these pool covers is relatively easy to install and remove, plus both the Classic Pool Cover and the 5-Star Pool Cover come with a Limited 10-year warranty.
And we offer even more choices. Anchor Mesh and Defender® Mesh Safety Covers are lighter in weight and a bit easier to maneuver than their solid counterparts. Defender® Mesh reduces chemical loss from the water, and stops 98% of the sunlight, which helps prevent the growth of algae in a clean, chemically-treated and balanced chlorinated pool water.
For residential and commercial safety pool covers that are easy to install, provide water safety, and help to maintain a clean-to-pristine pool for spring openings, experience the difference 40 years of Anchor experience makes.

The ultimate result of this collaborative dynamic is an impressive range of clear span structures delivering outstanding performance and unmatched value.
Whatever your needs, Anchor/Röder clear span structures offer a multitude of options to perfectly satisfy your requirements. Our PZ (Party) Series is ideal for small gatherings, walkways, for use as service tents at large events, for adding space at restaurants, and providing coverage in small areas. Expanding into the clear span market? The Venue Series is your solution for both short- and long-term usage. For larger uses, choose our Event Series for weddings, corporate functions, meetings, hospitality rooms at sporting events, or adding space at country clubs and resorts. Even bigger needs? Our hugely popular Expo Series easily covers commercial applications, trade shows, corporate meetings, and warehousing. The category even includes Double Decker tents for sporting events and special applications where space requirements and/or viewing opportunities are crucial. To handle your largest event and storage needs, our H-Line Series provides flexible, temporary space with safety and style—it’s ideal for production or assembly applications.

Featuring expandable lengths, extremely customizable options, and impressive strength, these structures offer temporary space for storage, trade fairs, exhibitions, and motor sports events. Want to double your available square footage without increasing your footprint? The Double Decker series is built with the same modular components as our clear span tents, and offers a wide range of sizes, wall and ceiling materials, plus seating choices. These 2-story fabric structures are great for large events. Another excellent choice is the AnchorSpan® clear span modular fabric structure that’s lightweight yet durable. It’s a balance of cost and beauty, ease and effectiveness, as well as freedom of design and system interchangeability.

“We are using Docker extensively in both dev and production and have identified the need to add security scanning to our CI/CD pipeline. Anchore allows us to maintain security and transparency over our images throughout the build process and is exactly the type of solution we were looking for.”
Dave Anderson, Director of Security & IT



 
 
 
 





“Shipping Scality’s applications as containers greatly simplifies deployment & maintenance for our customers. However, enterprise customers want to be sure that the containers they are deploying are secure & well maintained. Using Anchore’s tools we can define strict policies for security and compliance that ensure only images that meet our stringent security requirements are released. Anchore allows our customers to independently verify the certification status of all their images at any time, as well as define their own specific certification policies.”
Giorgio Reni, Founder & CTO



 
 
 
 





“As containers are adopted at an accelerating rate by businesses of all shapes and sizes and deployed into production, it’s critical to know with precision what is running in a given container and where it came from,” said Stephen O’Grady, Principal Analyst with RedMonk. “Anchore is built to add just these kinds of capabilities to container infrastructure, regardless of what it’s made up of.”
