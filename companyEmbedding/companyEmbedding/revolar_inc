Terms of Service







DATE OF LAST UPDATE: November 28, 2016
Terms of Service
Revolar designs products and services that empower users to lead more secure lives. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your purchase and use of our Revolar devices, our websites, including www.revolar.com, the software embedded in Revolar devices, the Revolar mobile applications (the “App”), and other Revolar services (collectively, the “Revolar Service”).
You must accept these Terms to use the Revolar App and to use the Revolar Service. If you do not have the Revolar App, you accept these Terms by visiting www.revolar.com or using any part of the Revolar Service. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE REVOLAR APP, VISIT WWW.REVOLAR.COM OR USE THE REVOLAR SERVICE.
These Terms May Change
Because our business and the environment we all live in changes, these Terms will change over time. If we make minor changes to the Terms without materially changing your rights, we will post the modified Terms on www.revolar.com. We will notify you by email, through the Revolar Service (including through the App as appropriate), or, at our election and discretion, by presenting you with a new Terms of Service to accept. When you use the Revolar Service after a modification is posted or notified to you, you are telling us that you accept the modified terms.
Read Our Privacy Policy
Any information that Revolar collects through your use of the Revolar Service is subject to the Revolar Privacy Policy, which is part of these Terms.
Who Can Use the Revolar Service?
You may use the Revolar Service if you are over 13 years of age and are not barred from receiving services under applicable law. You may connect to the Revolar Service using a device that is manufactured, distributed, or sold by or on behalf of Revolar; the Revolar App; approved third-party applications; or www.Revolar.com (“Authorized Connections”). You may not connect to the Revolar Service with any device that is not manufactured, distributed, or sold by or on behalf of Revolar (such as a knock off or counterfeit version of a Revolar device); otherwise intends to resemble or purports to be a Revolar device; or any unauthorized application or-third party connection. Any violation or attempted violation of this provision may result in the immediate termination of your ability to access the Revolar Service. If you have questions about whether a product or application qualifies as an Authorized Connection, please contact help@Revolar.com.
Creating an Account
Full use of the Revolar App requires that you create an account by providing us with your name, a valid e-mail address and phone number (and any other required information as specified in the Revolar App). You are responsible for all activity that occurs in association with your App account. Revolar is not liable for any loss or damages caused by your failure to maintain the confidentiality of your App account credentials.
We may need to contact you about your use of the Revolar Service. These communications are part of the Revolar Service and you may not opt-out from receiving them. You can manage and opt-out from receiving other communications in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
Necessary Equipment
Full use of the Revolar Service is dependent upon your use of a computer with adequate software, or a Revolar device, supported mobile cellular device and Internet access. The maintenance and security of this equipment may influence the performance of the Revolar Service (especially the Revolar App) and it is your responsibility to ensure the equipment’s functionality.
Posting Your Content On The Revolar Service
You may make certain postings and add other content (“Your Content”) to certain existing or later-developed parts of the Revolar Service. You retain all rights to Your Content that you post to the Revolar Service. “Your Content” does not include the PII that you provide in the Revolar App (including your Revolar contacts and their contact information) or any information relating to any alert you send through a Revolar device, and that data is covered by our Privacy Policy. By making Your Content available on or through the Revolar Service you grant to Revolar a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, publicly display, publicly perform and distribute Your Content only in connection with offering, operating and providing the Revolar Service.
You are responsible for Your Content. You represent and warrant that you own Your Content or that you have all rights necessary to grant us a license to use Your Content as described in these Terms. You also represent and warrant that Your Content and the use and provision of Your Content on the Revolar Service will not: (a) infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights or other intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy; (b) violate, or encourage any conduct that would violate, any applicable law or regulation or would give rise to civil liability; (c) be fraudulent, false, misleading or deceptive; (d) be defamatory, obscene, pornographic, vulgar or offensive; (e) promote discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group; (f) be violent or threatening or promote violence or actions that are threatening to any person or entity; or (g) promote illegal or harmful activities or substances.
You also agree that Your Content will comply with the following community guidelines:

Be respectful of the opinions of others. Even though you might not agree with someone, that doesn’t mean they are wrong or deserve to be belittled. Remember that what works for you may not work for everyone else. Give everyone the same courtesy you would expect in return.
Do not post profane or explicit content.
Do not post pictures that might be considered inappropriate.
Do not post communications that could be interpreted as threatening or harassing.
Do not post, advertise, or promote products or services commercially.

Revolar’s Rights
“Revolar Content” includes any text, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video, works of authorship of any kind, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided or otherwise made available through the Revolar Service to you. Except for Your Content, all Revolar Content, the Revolar Service and its underlying technology are protected by copyright, trademark, patent, intellectual property, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, change or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Revolar Service and you further agree not to reverse engineer or otherwise tamper with a Revolar device, the App, or any other part of the Revolar Service.
What You Can Do On The Revolar Service
The Revolar Service is intended for your personal, non-commercial use.
Revolar grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to (1) access and view the Revolar Content, (2) access and use the software and mobile applications provided by the Revolar Service (including the App, but only if you have a genuine Revolar device paired with the App), and (3) use the software that is embedded into Revolar products as authorized in these Terms. This license is provided solely for your personal use and enjoyment of the Revolar Service as permitted in these Terms.
You will not use, copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, broadcast, reverse engineer, or otherwise exploit the Revolar Content, Revolar Service or any portion thereof, except as expressly permitted in these Terms. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Revolar or its licensors, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted in these Terms.
Things You Cannot Do On The Revolar Service
Except to the extent permitted by law, you may not perform, attempt to perform, or encourage or assist others in performing any of the following while accessing or using the Revolar Service: (1) use, display, mirror or frame the Revolar Service or any individual element within the Revolar Service, Revolar’s name, any Revolar trademark, logo or other proprietary information, or the layout and design of any page or form contained on a page, without Revolar’s express written consent; (2) access or tamper with non-public areas of the Revolar Service, Revolar’s computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Revolar’s providers; (3) test the vulnerability of any Revolar system or breach any security or authentication measures; (4) circumvent any technological measure implemented by Revolar or any of Revolar’s providers or any other third party (including another user) to protect the Revolar Service or Revolar Content; (5) access the Revolar Service or Revolar Content through the use of any mechanism other than through the use of an Authorized Connection, Revolar Service or Revolar API; or (6) modify, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, tamper with or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of any software that Revolar provides to you, or that is embedded or otherwise included in a Revolar device or any other part of the Revolar Service.
Our Enforcement Rights
We are not obligated to monitor access or use of the Revolar Service, Revolar Content, or Your Content or to review or edit any Revolar Content or Your Content, but we have the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Revolar Service, to ensure compliance with these Terms, and to comply with applicable law or other legal requirements. We may consult with and disclose unlawful conduct to law enforcement authorities; and pursuant to valid legal process, we may cooperate with law enforcement authorities to prosecute users who violate the law. We reserve the right (but are not required) to remove or disable access to the Revolar Service, any Revolar Content, or Your Content at any time and without notice, and at our sole discretion, if we determine that the Revolar Content, Your Content, or your use of the Revolar Service is objectionable or in violation of these Terms. We have the right to investigate violations of these Terms and any conduct that affects the Revolar Service.
Without limiting Revolar’s above rights, we may also remove or disable access to the Revolar Service if your use of the Revolar Service exceeds Revolar App alert usage or other usage limits set by Revolar from time to time.
Use The Revolar Service At Your Own Risk
Our goal is to provide helpful and accurate information on the Revolar Service, but we make no endorsement, representation or warranty of any kind about any Revolar Content, information, services or recommendations. The accuracy of the data collected and presented through the Revolar Service is not intended to match that of public or other private emergency services.
We are not responsible for the accuracy, reliability, effectiveness, or correct use of information you receive through the Revolar Service. Maps, directions, and other GPS or navigation data, including data relating to your current location, may be unavailable, inaccurate or incomplete. Use of the App also requires a data service, Bluetooth connection between the Revolar device and your smartphone, and a cellular connection. If you rely on any Revolar Content or the Revolar Service, you do so solely at your own risk.
Use Common Sense
Use of the Revolar Service should (including but not limited to a Revolar device and the App) not replace your good judgment and common sense (and that of your Revolar contacts that you designate in the Revolar App). Please read and comply with all safety and cautionary notices that accompany your Revolar device and/or the Revolar Service, including those located on your Revolar device packaging and insert, as well as any other notices posted on any part of the Revolar Service.

Revolar respects copyright law and expects its users to do the same. It is Revolar’s policy to terminate in appropriate circumstances account holders who repeatedly infringe the rights of copyright holders.
Additional Policies Apply To Product Orders
Revolar’s Terms of Sale and Return Policy and Limited Warranty apply to purchases made through the Revolar store at www.Revolar.com. All orders placed are subject to Revolar’s acceptance. We may accept, decline, or place limits on your order for any reason.
Feedback And Submissions Policy
If you submit comments, ideas, or feedback to us, you agree that we can use them without any restriction or compensation to you. We do not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas or feedback previously known to us, developed by Revolar, or obtained from sources other than you.
Idea Submission
We are always pleased to hear from users of the Revolar Service and those interested in Revolar. However, neither Revolar, nor any of its employees, may accept or consider any unsolicited ideas, including ideas for new or improved products or services, new marketing campaigns or product or service names. Therefore, please do not submit any such unsolicited ideas in any form to Revolar or any of its employees. This policy is necessary to avoid potential misunderstandings or disputes that may arise if our new products or services or marketing campaigns were to appear similar to an idea submitted by you.
If, despite our policy, you still submit an idea to us, then regardless of anything contained in your submission you agree that the following shall apply: (i) we shall have no obligation to review the submission; (ii) the submission and its contents shall automatically become the property of Revolar, without any compensation to you; (iii) we may consider the submission and its contents to be non-confidential and non-proprietary; and (iv) we may redistribute or use (for commercial purposes or otherwise) the submission and its contents for any purpose and in any way, without any compensation to you.
Feedback
If a Revolar user or other person provides us (at our request or otherwise) a comment or suggestion regarding our products or services (including the Revolar App or any of our devices) through any means, such as via any social network, these Terms shall also apply thereto.
Contests And Giveaways
Additional terms and conditions may apply to contests, giveaways and other promotions sponsored by Revolar and its partners. It is your responsibility to carefully review those terms and conditions.
You Agree to Receive Alerts And Notifications
As part of your use of the Revolar Service (specifically including but not limited to your use, if any, of a Revolar device and the App), you may receive notifications, text messages, alerts, or emails. You agree to the receipt of these communications. You can control receipt of non-service related communications in accordance with the terms of our Privacy Policy. You are responsible for any messaging or data fees you (and/or your Revolar contacts relating to your use, if any, of a Revolar device and the App) may be charged by your wireless carrier.
We Are Not Responsible For Third-Party Links On The Revolar Service
The Revolar Service contains, or may contain, links to third-party websites, apps, services and resources (collectively “Third-Party Services”) that are not under Revolar’s control. We provide these links only as a convenience and are not responsible for the content, products or services that are available from Third-Party Services. You acknowledge sole responsibility and assume all risk arising from your use of any Third-Party Services.
Revolar Does Not Control Third-Party Services That You Link With Your Revolar Account
The Revolar Service may provide the opportunity for you to link a portion of the Revolar Service with Third-Party Services. Although we may offer this opportunity, you acknowledge that any Third-Party Services that you use in connection with the Revolar Service are not part of the Revolar Service. You acknowledge that these Terms and the Revolar Privacy Policy do not apply to any Third-Party Services. You are responsible for reading and understanding the terms and conditions and privacy policy that applies to your use of any Third-Party Services.
Changes To The Revolar Service
Revolar may change or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any feature or component of the Revolar Service at any time without notice. Revolar is not liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of any feature or component of the Revolar Service. We reserve the right to determine the timing and content of software updates, which may be automatically downloaded and installed by Revolar devices without prior notice to you.
Termination
If you violate these Terms, we reserve the right to deactivate your account or access, or terminate these Terms, at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice or liability to you. Upon any such termination, we may delete Your Content and other information related to your account or access. Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancelation of the Revolar Service or your account or access, the following provisions of these Terms will survive: Posting Your Content On The Revolar Service; Revolar’s Rights; Our Enforcement Rights; Termination; Disclaimers; Indemnity; Limitation of Liability; Dispute Resolution; and General Terms.
Disclaimers
Revolar devices are subject to Revolar’s standard Warranty covering the device. OTHER THAN THE WARRANTY COVERING A REVOLAR DEVICE, THE REVOLAR SERVICE AND REVOLAR CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. We make no warranty that the Revolar Service or Revolar Content will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. We make no warranty regarding the quality, accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of the Revolar Service or any Revolar Content. You acknowledge and agree that if you rely on any Revolar Content or the Revolar Service, you do so solely at your own risk.
Indemnity
You will indemnify and hold harmless Revolar and its officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of the Revolar Service, (ii) Your Content, or (iii)your breach of any warranties made by you hereunder or your violation of any other provision of these Terms. We reserve the right to assume control of the defense of any third-party claim that is subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.
Limitation Of Liability
NEITHER REVOLAR, ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS, NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE REVOLAR SERVICE WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE REVOLAR SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT REVOLAR HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
IN NO EVENT WILL REVOLAR’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE REVOLAR SERVICE EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO REVOLAR FOR USE OF THE REVOLAR SERVICE OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO REVOLAR, AS APPLICABLE.
THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN REVOLAR AND YOU.
Dispute Resolution
You agree that any dispute between you and Revolar arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service, the Revolar Service, or any other Revolar products or services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be governed by the arbitration procedure outlined below.
Governing Law: The Terms of Service and the resolution of any Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
Informal Dispute Resolution: We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Revolar, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting help@revolar.com. We’ll try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you through email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission, you or Revolar may bring a formal proceeding.
We Both Agree To Arbitrate: You and Revolar agree to resolve any Disputes through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.
Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate: You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting legal@revolar.com within 30 days of first accepting these Terms of Service and stating that you (include your first and last name) decline this arbitration agreement. Arbitration Procedures: The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, Denver, Colorado, or any other location we agree to.
Arbitration Fees: The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Revolar will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. Revolar will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate: Either you or Revolar may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Denver, Colorado or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Revolar products or Revolar Service, or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
No Class Actions: You may only resolve Disputes with Revolar on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren’t allowed under our agreement.
Judicial Forum for Disputes: In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Revolar agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of Denver, Colorado. Both you and Revolar consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there, and service of process through first-class or overnight mail. We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.
Limitation on Claims: Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Revolar products or Revolar Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.
General Terms
Except as otherwise stated herein, these Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Revolar and you regarding the Revolar Service, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Revolar and you regarding the Revolar Service and Revolar Content. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Revolar’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Revolar may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
Any notices or other communications provided by Revolar under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms and unless otherwise provided herein, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Revolar Service. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt on the message will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
Revolar’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Revolar. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
Additional Terms May Apply
Additional terms may apply to certain Revolar products or services. In the event that there is a conflict between these Terms and any such additional terms, the additional terms will control.

PLEASE CONTACT US IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE TERMS.

Answers to Revolar's Frequently Asked Questions
Can I use my Revolar wearable without a smartphone?
No, not at this time. Our first wearable connects to your smartphone so you never have to pay a monthly fee to send alerts to friends and family.
The Revolar wearable uses Bluetooth® low-energy technology to connect to the free Revolar app on your paired smartphone. To send an alert, the Revolar wearable needs to be within Bluetooth range (typically 30-50 feet) of a paired smartphone that has cellular service or a WiFi connection.
What type of alerts and notifications can I send with my Revolar wearable?
A Check-in, signaled by a single press, sends your one-time location to designated contacts via text and/or email.
A Yellow Alert, signaled by two rapid presses of the button, can indicate that you feel uncomfortable and would like to be contacted.
A Red Alert, signaled by three or more rapid presses, may indicate that you need immediate assistance.
For both types of alerts, your Revolar contacts will be notified via text and/or email that you have sent an alert, and they’ll be provided with your live location until the alert is canceled.
Revolar users and their designated contacts should define what actions the contacts should take in the event that they receive a Check-in, Yellow or Red Alert.
Are there any ongoing fees?
Nope! There are no ongoing fees associated with sending alerts friends and family using the Revolar wearable. Note that message and data rates may apply.
Can I use my Revolar wearable while traveling internationally?
The Revolar wearable should work internationally as long as you’re within a coverage area provided by your smartphone carrier. Both data and Bluetooth must be enabled and functioning on the paired smartphone. View our operating parameters to make sure you are all set to take your wearable with you as you travel.
What smartphones are compatible with the Revolar wearable?
The Revolar wearable is compatible with the following smartphones*:

iPhone® 5 or newer models operating on iOS 9.0 or above
Most Android™ phones operating on 5.0 or above, manufactured by Samsung, LG, Google, and Huawei. 

*Exclusions apply. Some makes/models may be unsupported. Email help@revolar.com with any questions about smartphone compatibility with Revolar wearables.

Does my Revolar wearable contact 911 or emergency services?
At this time, Revolar does not call 911 or any other emergency service when a user sends an alert. Neither 911 nor any other emergency service should be listed as a Revolar contact.
Revolar provides a way for users to send an alert to up to five confirmed Revolar contacts selected by the user in the Revolar app.
There are a variety of reasons that Revolar alerts don’t contact 911 or emergency services directly. Two key reasons are that most 911 call centers can’t track cell phone location automatically and the caller needs to be able to answer the operator’s questions in order to get help, which might not be possible. That’s why our GPS alerts are sent to loved ones who can answer the operator’s questions and communicate the Revolar user’s location.
What if I accidentally send an alert? 
Revolar is designed to make the chances of an accidental alert as minimal as possible. A concave button and multi-press alert system makes false alerts rare. It also takes a bit of pressure and speed to press the button twice or more, similar to a mouse or trackpad.
In the event of an accidental alert, you can easily cancel the alert from the Revolar app. Your contacts will then be notified that you’ve canceled the alert. Please ensure that you’ve enabled notifications for the Revolar app.
Do I need to charge the Revolar wearable?
Nope! The Revolar wearable uses a simple watch battery, which lasts 6 to 12 months depending on usage. It can be replaced with a coin cell CR2032 battery available at most hardware stores or online at Amazon.
Who is Revolar for?
Revolar can help provide peace of mind to:

College students for campus safety
Young professionals with active social lives
Employees working night shifts
Seniors living on their own or with medical conditions
Real estate agents showing empty homes
People with acute medical conditions
And so many others!

This is just a short list of ways you and your loved ones can use Revolar wearables. Please note that Revolar wearables are not intended for children ages 13 and under.
Does my Revolar wearable track my location all the time?
Nope! Your Revolar wearable only tracks your location from the time an alert is sent to the time it’s canceled. When a Check-in is sent, designated contacts are provided with your one-time location.
When will my order arrive?
With standard shipping, we estimate that orders shipped within the United States arrive within 2 to 8 business days and orders shipped to Canada arrive within 7 to 14 business days.  Expedited shipping options are available during checkout. Orders take 1-2 business days to process and you'll receive tracking as soon as the shipment is on its way!
What can I do if I’m having trouble pairing my Revolar wearable?
Here are some steps you can try:


Try turning your Bluetooth connection off and back on. You can easily do this on an iPhone by sliding up on your screen to view the settings toolbar, or by swiping down on most Android phones.



Using one of your accessory cases, open the battery door of the Revolar wearable device. Remove the battery and put it back in while ensuring the orange O-ring remains in the groove. The reinstall and lock the battery door.
Make sure that your smartphone has a full charge and close any apps operating in the background that are not in use. It may also be helpful to turn off your phone and turn it back on.

When pairing, please be sure to press the button firmly in the center. It will take about 12-15 seconds to pair. If you’re still having trouble, please connect with our customer care team at help@revolar.com.

What's Revolar?
It’s the fastest way to send for help at your location. This small, powerful device empowers you to be proactive about safety and stay connected to your friends and family. Use it for up to a year on a simple, easy-to-replace battery — no charging, no cords, no hassle.










Using Revolar is Simple

Download the Free Revolar app. Then sync your device. 
Simply by pressing a button, Revolar can let your loved ones know where you are and if you need help through customizable messages that include your live location. You can click once for a Check-in when you’re home safe, twice for a Yellow Alert if you’re uneasy and want a phone call, or three times for a Red Alert to request immediate help.
 
For both Yellow and Red types of alerts, your Revolar contacts will be notified via text and/or email that you have sent an alert, and they’ll be provided with your live location until the alert is canceled.



Revolar users and their designated contacts should define what actions the contacts should take in the event that they receive a Check-in, Yellow or Red Alert.NEW FEATURES




How to use it

 

FREE STANDARD SHIPPING to the U.S and Canada- 45-day money-back guarantee & 1-year limited warranty- Revolar requires the use of a qualifying smartphone & the Revolar app.

Share Your Location With Contacts


If and When You Choose
 When you activate a Revolar Alert, your contact receives your message along with a Google Maps link that shows your location as you move. To stop sharing your location, just enter your custom PIN code in the Revolar App. Your contacts don’t need the Revolar App to receive alerts via text message and email.

Our Mission







 Our Mission is Safety For All 

At our core, we believe everyone has the right to feel safe. Our mission is to make that a reality through technology so that no one’s passion or potential is extinguished by fear.















The inspiration 


CEO Jacqueline Ros developed the idea for Revolar wearables after her sister was assaulted as a teenager. Jacqueline found herself wishing her sister had been able to simply press a button to send for help.
So that’s exactly what Jacqueline set out to build with co-founder Andrea Perdomo.











Andrea joined the journey to start Revolar as she felt the need for this product hit home. Her family moved to the United States from Colombia after her grandmother was kidnapped for 8 months and always wondered what she could have done to prevent that. 
Today, the Revolar team has grown greatly, but we’re still dedicated to one goal — helping loved ones look after one another.











 "We're here to have your back in the little and big moments."  - Jacqueline, CEO  

  "Everyone has the right to feel safe."  - Andrea, President 














The Revolar Impact












 "If we can help at least one person live a safer life, we’ve achieved our goal."  -  Tom Davison, CTO of Revolar 
















What People Are Saying









We LOVE our Revolars!

I got it as a gift and my sister loves it. Highly recommend!

Revolar isn’t sitting still with its debut product, which drew praise and national attention over the last year.
The Denver-based tech startup this week launched its second product in a year, debuting its $79 Revolar Instinct safety device, a smaller but more up-market and capable evolution of the original Revolar product it rolled out last spring.

Revolar hustled to meet product roll-out deadlines the company set for itself to maintain a high tempo of innovation, CEO and founder Jacqueline Ros told me.
“We’re a startup — you move fast or die,” Ros said. “You have no alternative. You’ll run out of money, or your competitors will pass you.”
The 22-employee company has a crew in San Francisco this week rolling out a crowdfunding campaign to drum up orders for the updated Revolar Instinct, and to promote its new features.
Revolar employees return to Denver for product launch party Friday at the WeWork co-working building in the Lower Highland neighborhood.
Late last year, Revolar worked with software design shop Pivotal’s Denver office to overhaul the original user interface and software design for its products. The company also used that collaboration to explore user feedback, and train and hire employees while also developing the Revolar Instinct product.
A software change




Ros first thought of creating a wearable safety device after her younger sister was assaulted as a teenager.
She co-founded Revolar with Andrea Perdomo. The pair went through a 2015 Techstars startup accelerator program in Boulder, only to turn around and go through another, retail-focused Techstars accelerator program in Minneapolis with retail giant Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) last summer.
Its first Revolar device had been on the market less than six months, and the entrepreneurs wanted to improve on it.
The original $59 clip-on Revolar alarm, which debuted last April, lets a user send a discreet emergency message and location to the user’s chosen contacts.
Revolar distinguishes itself from other panic buttons by giving users quick options other than calling 911. A pair of clicks sends a message asking the contacts to get in touch right away, a triple click signals an emergency and to send help right away.

The company wants to empower people to quickly defuse uncomfortable, potentially dangerous situations before they become physical emergencies, Ros said.
Based on feedback from early buyers, Revolar changed its software in November to let users trigger their own mobile phone to ring, creating a diversion that might help them get out of an uncomfortable situation.
Revolar users also like using the product to quickly check in with select loved ones and friends while traveling, providing an update on their location with just a single click of the device’s button.
A Trojan horse




 


The new Revolar Instinct beeps and vibrates to confirm a check-in message has been sent, but it doesn’t sound or vibrate when the user’s multiple clicks indicate a more serious situation.
The updated device will also come with a brushed-metal clip to more easily fix the Revolar Instinct to a bag, purse or belt loop, which is an addition to the product that stemmed from users saying they didn’t always want their Revolar clipped to their clothing but did want to have it with them and accessible.
Users also asked for ability to keep track of their daily steps, Ros said, which the startup was happy to add. But Revolar Instinct isn’t a fitness wearable, and the company isn’t moving its focus off safety as the product’s primary function, Ros said
“For now, step tracking is what we consider a Trojan horse — a capability that people want and gets them in the habit of wearing it every day,” she said.
And, one day, tracking steps may help Revolar devices detect impacts and assaults that a user can’t alert someone to themselves, Ros said.
Both versions of Revolar alarms are made by contract manufacturer Celestica in Thailand to be impact resistant and waterproof.
The company will be busy in coming weeks launching the Revolar Instinct’s crowdfunded debut and raising awareness about what the devices can do. After introducing Instinct, Revolar will continue to push to make its products more useful and more attractive, Ros said.
She envisions internet-connected clothing replacing Revolar’s hardware in a few years. It would be a natural evolution for a company that aims to make products as beautiful to wear as they are functional as safety devices, she said.
“There’s something to be said about feeling confident in every way, shape and form,” Ros said.

 Description & Guides


Lightweight. Powerful. Active.
Different alerts: A rapid double-press sends a Yellow Alert, indicating that you’re uncomfortable or need to get in touch with your contacts. A rapid triple-press sends a Red Alert, indicating that you need professional help.
GPS Link: Your Revolar contacts don't need to download the app—whenever you trigger an alert, a text message is sent to your contacts with an active GPS link.
Out of sight:Revolar is very discreet and measures less than 2 inches. It easily hides under your clothing or can be clipped onto your keychain.
Waterproof: Certified IP68, which means you can ditch the bag of rice if Revolar ends up in water.
Long battery life: Revolar uses a simple watch battery for power, which lasts up to a year.
Interchangeable: Revolar comes with two different cases: one to clip onto your clothing and one to attach to your keys.
One-touch assurance.
Revolar is the next innovation in wearables. Unlike wearables that track your steps or sleep, Revolar’s only job is to help empower you to feel more safe and connected. Anytime you feel uncomfortable or think you might be in danger, a quick double press will send a Yellow Alert (a triple press will send a Red Alert) to your pre-determined Revolar contacts—complete with your GPS location—so you can get the help you need.
Revolar connects to our app through Low Energy Bluetooth® technology. Once paired, you simply enter your Revolar Contacts, have a conversation about what the different alerts mean to you, and you’re good to go! The best part about Revolar is that it’s fully customizable.
Revolar fits your lifestyle.
Revolar takes care of all the complexity so you don’t have to. In an emergency situation you do not have time to use your phone. Calling for help with Revolar is as easy as pressing a button. In fact, it IS pressing a button.

Feel safer wherever you go—order your Revolar Wearable Safety Device from Brookstone today!
Can I use Revolar without my phone?
Because Revolar uses Bluetooth technology, your phone will need to be within Bluetooth range (typically 30 feet) and have a data or Wi-Fi connection in order to send alerts.
What kinds of alerts can I send with Revolar?
A two press “Yellow” alert typically indicates that you may be feeling uncomfortable or unsafe and would like to be contacted.

Three or more presses sends a “Red” alert that can indicate you may already be in danger and need urgent assistance.

In both alert cases, your Revolar contacts will be notified via text and/or email that you have sent an alert, and they will be provided with your location information until the alert is cancelled.
