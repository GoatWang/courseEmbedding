Our Companies History & Development(704) 638-6111 * (800) 633-8391



Williams Companies, Inc. began in 1968, under the name Williams Medical Textiles, Inc., as a manufacturer of medical products. Such items as patient gowns, adult bibs, operation room apparel and other supplies needed by hospitals and nursing homes.  We manufactured and distributed our products in the North and South Carolina.  For many years, Williams Medical Textiles, Inc. grew and began to diversify its product line, bringing in disposable diapers and underpads by the truckload.  Williams Medical Textiles, Inc. began to learn of the exportation of diapers and the need of this product in other countries.  With that new development, the company began to learn and inquire more about exporting.  Years later, with exporting products as our main lifeline, Williams Medical Textiles, Inc. begun to develop business relationships with several overseas companies.  Those customers began inquiring about other products and wanted to know if our company could locate such merchandise to be shipped overseas.  We continued to grow, as did the offices, manufacturing plant, and warehouses that we were using.  With the exporting at hand, we were forced to build more warehouses in order to meet the demands of our customer’s orders.  We continued to manufacture and distribute medical products to North Carolina and South Carolina area hospitals and nursing homes through Williams Medical Textiles, Inc.As our companies flourished, we created an in-house freight company, R.J. Transports, Inc., to handle all of our transportation needs.  Over the years, R.J. Transports, Inc. grew from one tractor and trailer to owning seven tractors and approximately 300 trailers.  The need for this large number of trailers came from the growing demand of our customers to provide them with larger amounts of used clothing, shoes, belts, purses, toys and other used materials sent to countries less fortunate than the United States.  Value Clothing, Inc.  was established with a foundation in exporting used clothing and shoes as main products.  During our growth, Value Clothing, Inc. began to help those less fortunate right here in North Carolina and our surrounding states.  As community thrift stores become over ran with clothing, shoes, belts, purses, toys, etc. our company purchases the products from them.  This in turn helps the thrift store to liquidate their stock that they can not sell and use the funds in their community work.Product exportation is the lifeline of Williams Companies, Inc.  Due to enormous business developments; we have built more warehouses, offices, and manufacturing plants.  Our company recently expanded operations from Advance, North Carolina to Salisbury, North Carolina in order to better serve our clients. At Williams Companies, Inc., Diversification is the Key.Contact us to learn more about our products and services and how we can serve your needs.

History[edit]
It was founded as Williams Brothers in 1908 by Miller and David Williams in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and soon expanded to building nationwide pipelines for natural gas and petroleum. The company relocated to Tulsa in 1919. In 1949, John H. Williams, a nephew of the founders, together with his brother Charles Williams and David's son David Williams Jr., bought the business from the founders; John H. Williams remained as president of the company until 1971 and CEO until 1979.[1]
The company went public in 1957 under the Williams Brothers name. As it diversified in the 1970s, it was renamed The Williams Companies, Inc. Since 1997, their brand identity has been simplified to "Williams".
In 1966, Williams bought the then-largest petroleum products pipeline in America, known as the Great Lakes Pipe Line Company, for about $287 million. In 1982, it expanded into natural gas transportation with the purchase of Northwest Energy Company, and extended their reach to the East Coast with the 1995 purchase of Transco Energy Company.
In 2001, Williams acquired Barrett Resources, which provided them with additional national gas reserves.
In 2002, the company found itself in financial distress due to changed market conditions and the large debt of its subsidiary Williams Communications Group. The company obtained and paid off an emergency high interest loan from Warren Buffett to stay out of bankruptcy, and redirected its focus toward natural gas production, processing, and transportation as well as increasing its resource holdings. One of the moves it made around that time (2004) was the sale of 2 of Canada's largest natural gas straddle plants, and its interest in another to Inter Pipeline Fund for US$540 million.[2]
In 2010, the company underwent a major restructuring that included a reorganization of its extensive pipeline holdings in Williams Partners LP.[3] On October 2010, Williams and Williams Partners L.P. announced that Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Malcolm would retire at the end of the year. The Board of Directors at Williams said it had elected Alan Armstrong to succeed Malcolm as CEO effective January 3, 2011. Armstrong had served as senior vice president of Williams since 2002.[4]
On February 16, 2011, Williams' board of directors had approved pursuing a plan to separate the company's businesses into two stand-alone, publicly traded corporations. The plan calls for Williams to separate its exploration and production business via an initial public offering (IPO) in third-quarter 2011 of up to 20 percent of its interest and, in 2012, a tax-free spinoff to Williams shareholders of its remaining interest.[5][needs update]
Telecommunications[edit]
The company helped to get the modern telecommunications industry off the ground by running fiber optic cable through its decommissioned pipelines. It built two nationwide networks, which subsequently spun off into separate companies. The first was sold in 1995 to LDDS, which would become WorldCom & then MCI). The second was spun off in 2001 as Williams Communications, filed for bankruptcy the following year[6] adopted the name WilTel Communications, and ultimately was acquired by and consolidated into Level 3 Communications.[7]
Lawsuits and fines[edit]
In 2002, Williams Communications Group was sued for that company officials did not properly disclose the failing company's true financial condition, and that officials' public statements belied the firm's plummeting fiscal picture.[8] In 2007, the Williams Companies agreed to pay $290 million.
Boardwalk Pipeline Partners and the Williams Companies were fined $2.4 million for 18 incidents that took place between 2006 and 2013 that include failing to monitor corrosion and waiting to repair a natural gas line showing metal loss in Kentucky.[9]
Restatement[edit]
On March 1, 1999, Jack D. McCarthy, chief financial officer, said the company's additional review and its annual audit process resulted in the previously announced 1998 pre-tax income being adjusted downward by $21.2 million.[10]
On September 16, 2004, Williams Cos. said it amended its fiscal 2003 and first-quarter 2004 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission to show a reclassification to its discontinued operations and a segment reporting change.[11]

History[edit]
It was founded as Williams Brothers in 1908 by Miller and David Williams in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and soon expanded to building nationwide pipelines for natural gas and petroleum. The company relocated to Tulsa in 1919. In 1949, John H. Williams, a nephew of the founders, together with his brother Charles Williams and David's son David Williams Jr., bought the business from the founders; John H. Williams remained as president of the company until 1971 and CEO until 1979.[1]
The company went public in 1957 under the Williams Brothers name. As it diversified in the 1970s, it was renamed The Williams Companies, Inc. Since 1997, their brand identity has been simplified to "Williams".
In 1966, Williams bought the then-largest petroleum products pipeline in America, known as the Great Lakes Pipe Line Company, for about $287 million. In 1982, it expanded into natural gas transportation with the purchase of Northwest Energy Company, and extended their reach to the East Coast with the 1995 purchase of Transco Energy Company.
In 2001, Williams acquired Barrett Resources, which provided them with additional national gas reserves.
In 2002, the company found itself in financial distress due to changed market conditions and the large debt of its subsidiary Williams Communications Group. The company obtained and paid off an emergency high interest loan from Warren Buffett to stay out of bankruptcy, and redirected its focus toward natural gas production, processing, and transportation as well as increasing its resource holdings. One of the moves it made around that time (2004) was the sale of 2 of Canada's largest natural gas straddle plants, and its interest in another to Inter Pipeline Fund for US$540 million.[2]
In 2010, the company underwent a major restructuring that included a reorganization of its extensive pipeline holdings in Williams Partners LP.[3] On October 2010, Williams and Williams Partners L.P. announced that Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Malcolm would retire at the end of the year. The Board of Directors at Williams said it had elected Alan Armstrong to succeed Malcolm as CEO effective January 3, 2011. Armstrong had served as senior vice president of Williams since 2002.[4]
On February 16, 2011, Williams' board of directors had approved pursuing a plan to separate the company's businesses into two stand-alone, publicly traded corporations. The plan calls for Williams to separate its exploration and production business via an initial public offering (IPO) in third-quarter 2011 of up to 20 percent of its interest and, in 2012, a tax-free spinoff to Williams shareholders of its remaining interest.[5][needs update]
Telecommunications[edit]
The company helped to get the modern telecommunications industry off the ground by running fiber optic cable through its decommissioned pipelines. It built two nationwide networks, which subsequently spun off into separate companies. The first was sold in 1995 to LDDS, which would become WorldCom & then MCI). The second was spun off in 2001 as Williams Communications, filed for bankruptcy the following year[6] adopted the name WilTel Communications, and ultimately was acquired by and consolidated into Level 3 Communications.[7]
Lawsuits and fines[edit]
In 2002, Williams Communications Group was sued for that company officials did not properly disclose the failing company's true financial condition, and that officials' public statements belied the firm's plummeting fiscal picture.[8] In 2007, the Williams Companies agreed to pay $290 million.
Boardwalk Pipeline Partners and the Williams Companies were fined $2.4 million for 18 incidents that took place between 2006 and 2013 that include failing to monitor corrosion and waiting to repair a natural gas line showing metal loss in Kentucky.[9]
Restatement[edit]
On March 1, 1999, Jack D. McCarthy, chief financial officer, said the company's additional review and its annual audit process resulted in the previously announced 1998 pre-tax income being adjusted downward by $21.2 million.[10]
On September 16, 2004, Williams Cos. said it amended its fiscal 2003 and first-quarter 2004 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission to show a reclassification to its discontinued operations and a segment reporting change.[11]

Williams remained as president of the company until 1971 and CEO until 1979.[1]
The company went public in 1957 under the Williams Brothers name. As it diversified in the 1970s, it was renamed The Williams Companies, Inc. Since 1997, their brand identity has been simplified to "Williams".
In 1966, Williams bought the then-largest petroleum products pipeline in America, known as the Great Lakes Pipe Line Company, for about $287 million. In 1982, it expanded into natural gas transportation with the purchase of Northwest Energy Company, and extended their reach to the East Coast with the 1995 purchase of Transco Energy Company.
In 2001, Williams acquired Barrett Resources, which provided them with additional national gas reserves.
In 2002, the company found itself in financial distress due to changed market conditions and the large debt of its subsidiary Williams Communications Group. The company obtained and paid off an emergency high interest loan from Warren Buffett to stay out of bankruptcy, and redirected its focus toward natural gas production, processing, and transportation as well as increasing its resource holdings. One of the moves it made around that time (2004) was the sale of 2 of Canada's largest natural gas straddle plants, and its interest in another to Inter Pipeline Fund for US$540 million.[2]
In 2010, the company underwent a major restructuring that included a reorganization of its extensive pipeline holdings in Williams Partners LP.[3] On October 2010, Williams and Williams Partners L.P. announced that Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Malcolm would retire at the end of the year. The Board of Directors at Williams said it had elected Alan Armstrong to succeed Malcolm as CEO effective January 3, 2011. Armstrong had served as senior vice president of Williams since 2002.[4]
On February 16, 2011, Williams' board of directors had approved pursuing a plan to separate the company's businesses into two stand-alone, publicly traded corporations. The plan calls for Williams to separate its exploration and production business via an initial public offering (IPO) in third-quarter 2011 of up to 20 percent of its interest and, in 2012, a tax-free spinoff to Williams shareholders of its remaining interest.[5][needs update]
Telecommunications[edit]
The company helped to get the modern telecommunications industry off the ground by running fiber optic cable through its decommissioned pipelines. It built two nationwide networks, which subsequently spun off into separate companies. The first was sold in 1995 to LDDS, which would become WorldCom & then MCI). The second was spun off in 2001 as Williams Communications, filed for bankruptcy the following year[6] adopted the name WilTel Communications, and ultimately was acquired by and consolidated into Level 3 Communications.[7]
Lawsuits and fines[edit]
In 2002, Williams Communications Group was sued for that company officials did not properly disclose the failing company's true financial condition, and that officials' public statements belied the firm's plummeting fiscal picture.[8] In 2007, the Williams Companies agreed to pay $290 million.
Boardwalk Pipeline Partners and the Williams Companies were fined $2.4 million for 18 incidents that took place between 2006 and 2013 that include failing to monitor corrosion and waiting to repair a natural gas line showing metal loss in Kentucky.[9]
Restatement[edit]
On March 1, 1999, Jack D. McCarthy, chief financial officer, said the company's additional review and its annual audit process resulted in the previously announced 1998 pre-tax income being adjusted downward by $21.2 million.[10]
On September 16, 2004, Williams Cos. said it amended its fiscal 2003 and first-quarter 2004 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission to show a reclassification to its discontinued operations and a segment reporting change.[11]

	Williams Partners Completes Sale of Interests in the Geismar Olefins




	Facility to NOVA Chemicals for $2.1 Billion; Enters into Long-Term




	Feedstock Supply and Transportation Agreements with NOVA Chemicals



	TULSA, Okla.  Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE: WPZ) announced today that it has completed the sale of all of its membership interest in Williams Olefins
	L.L.C., which owns an 88.46 percent undivided ownership interest in the Geismar, Louisiana, olefins plant and associated complex, to NOVA Chemicals for $2.1 billion in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment.


	Additionally, Williams Partners subsidiaries have entered into long-term supply and transportation agreements with NOVA Chemicals to provide feedstock to the
	Geismar olefins plant via Williams Partners ethane pipeline system in the U.S. Gulf Coast. These agreements will secure a meaningful long-term fee-based revenue stream for the partnership.


	Completing this successful transaction represents another important step in our natural

	gas-focused

	business
	strategy to deliver predictable long-term growth as we reduce our commodity-margin exposure, said Alan Armstrong, chief executive officer of Williams Partners general partner. Around 97 percent of our gross margins will now
	come from predictable

	fee-based

	sources, including the previously announced new long-term supply and transportation agreements with NOVA. We look forward to supporting NOVAs strategy in the Gulf Coast
	with our highly reliable ethane pipeline system as part of this

	win-win

	transaction and agreement for both companies.


	Williams Partners plans to use the cash proceeds from the Williams Olefins transaction to pay off its $850 million term loan and to fund a portion of the
	capital and investment expenditures that are a part of the partnerships extensive growth portfolio. The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE: WMB) expects that for federal tax purposes, any taxable gain generated from the transaction will be
	sheltered by tax losses carried forward.


	Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC acted as the lead financial adviser to Williams Partners on the transaction.
	Centerview Partners LLC acted as a

	co-adviser

	to Williams Partners on the transaction. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and Kean Miller LLP served as legal advisers to Williams Partners on the transaction.

	Introduction to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Financial Statements



	On April 17, 2017, we announced that we agreed to sell Williams Olefins, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary which owns an 88.46 percent
	undivided ownership interest in a Geismar, Louisiana, olefins plant and associated complex for $2.1 billion in cash. On July 6, 2017, the sale was completed and we received cash proceeds totaling $2.084 billion, reflecting adjustments for the
	estimated net working capital at closing and subject to final determination.


	The following unaudited pro forma condensed financial
	statements have been developed by applying pro forma adjustments to the individual historical audited and unaudited financial statements of Williams Partners L.P. to reflect the disposition. The following unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet
	as of March 31, 2017, has been prepared to give effect to the transaction as if the divestiture had occurred on March 31, 2017. The following unaudited pro forma condensed statements of income for the three months ended March 31,
	2017, and year ended December 31, 2016, have been prepared to give effect to the transaction as if the divestiture had occurred at the beginning of 2016. Our historical condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from and
	should be read together with the historical audited consolidated financial statements and related notes in Exhibit 99.1 of our Form 8-K dated May 25, 2017, and the historical unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes in our
	Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.


	The unaudited pro forma condensed financial statements are
	presented for illustrative purposes only to reflect the sale of Williams Olefins, L.L.C. and do not represent what our results of operations or financial position would actually have been had the sale occurred on the dates noted above, or project
	our results of operations or financial position for any future periods. The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions that management believes are factually supportable and are expected to have a continuing
	impact on our results of operations. All pro forma adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described more fully in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed financial information.

	Note 1. Pro Forma Adjustments




	Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Balance Sheet Adjustments



	The pro forma adjustments reflect $2.084 billion of cash received upon the sale of Williams Olefins, L.L.C., the removal of the related
	historical net assets of the disposal group, an accrual for certain estimated transaction-related items associated with the sale, and the impact resulting from the expected gain on disposal.



	Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Statements of Income Adjustments



	The pro forma adjustments reflect the removal of the historical results of the disposal group. The pro forma adjustments do not reflect the
	expected gain on disposal, currently estimated to be approximately $1.083 billion.









	Exhibit 99.3




	Introduction to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Financial Statements



	On April 17, 2017, our consolidated master limited partnership, Williams Partners L.P., announced that it agreed to sell Williams
	Olefins, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary which owns an 88.46 percent undivided ownership interest in a Geismar, Louisiana, olefins plant and associated complex for $2.1 billion in cash. On July 6, 2017, the sale was completed and we
	received cash proceeds totaling $2.084 billion, reflecting adjustments for the estimated net working capital at closing and subject to final determination.


	The following unaudited pro forma financial statements have been developed by applying pro forma adjustments to the individual historical
	audited and unaudited financial statements of The Williams Companies, Inc. to reflect the disposition. The following unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet as of March 31, 2017, has been prepared to give effect to the transaction as if the
	divestiture had occurred on March 31, 2017. The following unaudited pro forma condensed statements of income for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and year ended December 31, 2016, have been prepared to give effect to the
	transaction as if the divestiture had occurred at the beginning of 2016. Our historical condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from and should be read together with the historical audited consolidated financial statements and
	related notes in Exhibit 99.1 of our Form

	8-K

	dated May 25, 2017, and the historical unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes in our Quarterly Report on Form

	10-Q

	for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.


	The unaudited pro forma condensed financial statements
	are presented for illustrative purposes only to reflect the sale of Williams Olefins, L.L.C. and do not represent what our results of operations or financial position would actually have been had the sale occurred on the dates noted above, or
	project our results of operations or financial position for any future periods. The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions that management believes are factually supportable and are expected to have a
	continuing impact on our results of operations. All pro forma adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described more fully in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed financial information.

	Note 1. Pro Forma Adjustments




	Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Balance Sheet Adjustments



	The pro forma adjustments reflect $2.084 billion of cash received upon the sale of Williams Olefins, L.L.C., the removal of the related
	historical net assets of the disposal group, an accrual for certain estimated transaction-related items associated with the sale, and the impact resulting from the expected gain on disposal. The gain has been tax affected at an estimated effective
	rate of 37.6 percent.



	Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Statements of Income Adjustments



	The pro forma adjustments reflect the removal of the historical results of the disposal group, further adjusted to reflect the income
	attributable to the noncontrolling interests in Williams Partners L.P. and the effect of income taxes at an estimated effective rate of 37.6 percent. The pro forma adjustments do not reflect the expected gain on disposal, currently estimated to
	be approximately $1.083 billion, before income taxes.

I think there are many different opportunities within Williams, especially with the significant infrastructure build out in the Marcellus Shale. The most enjoyable aspect of my current job is being part of building a brand new asset. Not only is this a unique learning opportunity, but I have a role in the build out Williams and the gas industry are experiencing in the region.
