 THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the Agreement) is made effective as of the 14th day of October, 2009 (the
Effective Date), by and between Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Corporation), and Jackwyn Nemerov (the Executive).  WHEREAS, the Executive has been employed with the Corporation pursuant to an Employment Agreement dated September 9, 2004 (as amended
as of the date hereof the 2004 Employment Agreement); and  WHEREAS, the Corporation and Executive wish to amend
and restate such 2004 Employment Agreement effective as of the date hereof;  NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
covenants and premises contained herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:  ARTICLE I  EMPLOYMENT  1.1 Employment Term. The Corporation hereby agrees to employ the Executive, and the Executive hereby agrees to serve the Corporation, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, and in the Executives term sheet dated

and Duties. During the Term, the Executive shall faithfully, and in conformity with the directions of the Board of Directors of the Corporation and any Committee thereof (the Board) or the management of the Corporation
(Management), perform the duties of her employment, and shall devote to the performance of such duties her full time and attention. During the Term, the Executive shall serve in the position of Executive Vice President. During the Term,
the Executive may engage in outside activities provided those activities do not conflict with the duties and responsibilities enumerated hereunder, and provided further that the Executive receives written approval in advance from Management for any
outside business activity that may require significant expenditure of the Executives time in which the Executive plans to become involved, whether or not such activity is pursued for profit. The Executive shall be excused from performing any
services hereunder during periods of temporary incapacity and during vacations in accordance with the Corporations disability and vacation policies.  1.3 Place of Performance.

1.4 Compensation and Related Matters.  (a) Base Compensation. In consideration of her services during the Term, the Corporation shall pay the Executive cash
compensation at an annual rate of not less than nine hundred thousand dollars ($900,000) (Base Compensation), less applicable withholdings. Executives Base Compensation shall be subject to such increases as may be approved by the
Board or Management. The Base Compensation shall be payable as current salary, in installments not less frequently than monthly, and at the same rate for any fraction of a month unexpired at the end of the Term.  (b) Bonus. During the Term, the Executive shall have the opportunity to earn an annual bonus in accordance with any
annual bonus program that the Corporation maintains that would be applicable to the Executive and that is in accordance with the Executives Term Sheet.  (c) Stock Awards. During the Term, the Executive shall be eligible to participate in the Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation
1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the Incentive Plan). All grants to the Executive of stock options, restricted shares and restricted performance share units (RPSUs), if any, are governed by the terms of the Incentive Plan
and are subject, in all cases, to approval by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) in its sole discretion. In accordance with the Executives Term Sheet and with the terms of the
Incentive Plan, and subject to approval by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, the Executive shall receive, during the Term, annual grants of stock options and RPSUs that are equivalent to the award amounts specified in the
Executives Term Sheet, subject to Executives continued employment at the time of each such grant. Such stock options and RPSUs shall vest in accordance with the terms of the Incentive Plan. The Committee has the right, in its good faith
discretion, to reduce the value of any annual award provided to the Executive in accordance with the Term Sheet.  (d) Car and Driver Allowance. During the Term, the Corporation shall reimburse the Executive for the use of a car and driver.  (e) Expenses. During the Term, the Executive shall be entitled to receive prompt reimbursement for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Executive in performing services hereunder, including all
reasonable expenses of travel and living while away from home, provided that such expenses are incurred and accounted for in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Corporation.  (f) Vacations. During the Term, the Executive shall be entitled to the number of vacation days in each fiscal year,
and to compensation in respect of earned but unused vacation days, determined in accordance with the Corporations vacation program. The Executive shall also be entitled to all paid holidays given by the Corporation to its employees.
 (g) Other Benefits. The Executive shall be entitled to participate in all of the Corporations
employee benefit plans and programs in effect during the Term as would by their terms be applicable to the Executive, including, without limitation, any pension and retirement plan, supplemental pension and retirement plan, deferred compensation
plan,
  
2 



incentive plan, stock option plan, life insurance plan, medical insurance plan, dental care plan, accidental death and disability plan, and vacation, sick leave or personal leave program. The
Corporation shall not make any changes in such plans or programs that would adversely affect the Executives benefits thereunder, unless such change occurs pursuant to a program applicable to other similarly situated employees of the
Corporation and does not result in a proportionately greater reduction in the rights or benefits of the Executive as compared with other similarly situated employees of the Corporation. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, nothing paid
to the Executive under any plan or program presently in effect or made available in the future shall be in lieu of the Base Compensation or any bonus payable under Sections 1.4(a) and 1.4(b) hereof.  ARTICLE II  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT  2.1 Termination of Employment. The Executives employment may terminate
prior to the expiration of the Term under the following circumstances:  (a) Without Cause. The
Executives employment may terminate upon the Corporation notifying the Executive that her services will no longer be required, including at the end of the Term.  (b) Death. The Executives employment shall terminate upon the Executives death.  (c) Disability. If, as a result of the Executives incapacity due to physical or mental illness, the Executive
shall have been absent and unable to perform the duties hereunder on a full-time basis for an entire period of six consecutive months, the Executives employment may be terminated by the Corporation following such six-month period. 
(d) Cause. The Corporation may terminate the Executives employment for Cause. For purposes hereof,
Cause shall mean: (1) the willful and continued failure by the Executive to substantially perform her duties hereunder after demand for substantial performance is delivered to her by the Corporation that specifically identifies the
manner in which the Corporation believes the Executive has not substantially performed her duties, (2) Executives conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere to, a crime (whether or not involving the Corporation) constituting any felony or
(3) the willful engaging by the Executive in gross misconduct relating to the Executives employment that is materially injurious to the Corporation, monetarily or otherwise (including, but not limited to, conduct that constitutes
competitive activity, in violation of Article III) or which subjects, or if generally known would subject, the Corporation to public ridicule. For purposes of this paragraph, no act, or failure to act, on the Executives part shall be
considered willful unless done, or omitted to be done, by her not in good faith and without reasonable belief that her action or omission was in the best interest of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executives
employment may be terminated for Cause only by act of the Board of Directors of the Corporation and, in any event, the Executives employment shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause without (x) reasonable written notice to
the Executive setting forth the reasons for the Corporations intention to terminate for Cause, (y) the opportunity to cure (if curable) within 30 days of such written notice of the event(s) giving rise to such notice and (z) an
opportunity for the Executive, together with her counsel, to be heard by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.   
3 


(e) Voluntary Termination. The Executive may voluntarily terminate
the Executives employment with the Corporation at any time, with or without Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, Good Reason shall mean a termination of employment by the Executive within one (1) year following the
occurrence of (A) a material diminution in or adverse alteration to Executives title, base salary, benefits, position, status or duties, (B) the relocation of the Executives principal office outside the area which comprises a
fifty (50) mile radius from New York City, (C) a failure of the Corporation to comply with any material provision of this Agreement, or (D) the Corporation requires Executive to report to anyone other than Ralph Lauren and/or Roger
Farah; provided that the events described in clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D) above shall not constitute Good Reason (1) until the Executive provides written notice to the Corporation of the existence of such diminution, change,
reduction, relocation or failure within ninety (90) days of its occurrence and (2) unless such diminution, change, reduction or failure (as applicable) has not been cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of such
noncompliance has been given by the Executive to the Corporation.  2.2 Date of Termination. The date of termination
shall be:  (a) if the Executives employment is terminated by the Executives death, the date of the
Executives death;  (b) if the Executives employment is terminated by reason of Executives
disability pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or by the Corporation pursuant to Sections 2.1(a) or 2.1(d), the date specified by the Corporation; and  (c) if the Executives employment is terminated by the Executive, the date on which the Executive notifies the Corporation of her termination.  2.3 Effect of Termination of Employment.  (a) If the Executives employment is terminated by the Corporation Without Cause pursuant to Section 2.1(a), or if
the Executive resigns for Good Reason pursuant to Section 2.1(e), the Executive shall only be entitled to the following:  (i) Severance. Subject to Section 2.3(a)(v) and Section 4.1(a) hereof, the Corporation shall: (a) beginning with the first payroll period following the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of termination of Executives
employment, continue to pay the Executive, in accordance with the Corporations normal payroll practice, Executives Base Compensation, as in effect immediately prior to such termination of employment, for the longer of the balance of the
Term or the one-year period commencing on the date of such termination (whichever period is applicable shall be referred to herein as the Severance Period) provided that the initial payment shall include Base Compensation amounts for all
payroll periods from the date of termination through the date of such initial payment; and (b) pay to the Executive, on the last business day of the Severance Period, an amount equal to the bonus paid to the Executive for the most recently
completed fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which Executives employment is terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to receive any severance
  
4 



benefits under this Section 2.3(a)(i), the Executive must sign and not timely revoke a release and waiver of claims against the Corporation, its successors, affiliates, and assigns, in a
form acceptable to the Corporation on or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of termination of Executives employment.  (ii) Stock Awards. The Executive shall immediately vest in any unvested stock options as of the date of termination of the Executives employment. With respect to vested stock options, if
any, the Executive shall have one year (except as provided for in Section 4.1(a)) from the date of termination of Executives employment to exercise any vested options, but in no event later than the expiration date of such vested options.
With respect to any unvested pro-rata RPSUs and unvested cliff RPSUs awarded through the date on which the Executives employment terminates, except as provided for in Section 4.1(a): (1) any unvested pro-rata RPSUs will fully vest
upon the Corporations attainment of the applicable performance goals and will be paid in their entirety as per the terms of the Incentive Plan as soon as practicable (but in no event later than 30 days) after each applicable vesting date
without regard to Executives continued employment; and (2) any unvested cliff RPSUs will remain outstanding and the Executive will vest in such cliff RPSUs at the end of the applicable performance period based on the Corporations
actual degree of achievement of the applicable performance goals, as described in the Term Sheet, and any such cliff RPSUs will be paid in their entirety as per the terms of the Incentive Plan as soon as practicable (but in no event later than 30
days) after each applicable vesting date, without regard to Executives continued employment.  (iii)
Welfare Plan Coverages. The Executive shall continue to participate during the Severance Period in any group medical, dental or life insurance plan she participated in prior to the date of her termination, under substantially similar terms
and conditions as an active employee (i.e., the Corporation will continue to pay the Corporations portion of the costs of such participation); provided that participation in such group medical, dental or life insurance plan shall
correspondingly cease at such time as the Executive becomes eligible for a future employers medical, dental and/or life insurance coverage (or would become eligible if the Executive did not waive coverage).  (iv) Retirement Plans. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is specifically provided that the
Executive shall not accrue additional benefits under any pension plan of the Corporation (whether or not qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) during the Severance Period.  (v) Section 409A. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no amounts shall be payable
pursuant to Section 2.3(a) or Section 4.1(a) unless the Executives termination of employment constitutes a separation from service within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Department of Treasury Regulations.
If the Executive is determined to be a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the rules and regulations issued thereunder (the Code), then any amount
that becomes payable under Sections 2.3(a)(i) or 4.1(a) hereof (the Severance Payment) on account of the Executives separation from service shall not be paid to the Executive until the first business day following the
expiration of the six (6) month period immediately following the Executives separation from service (or if earlier, the date of the Executives death) if and to the extent that the Severance Payment constitutes deferred
  
5 



compensation (or may be nonqualified deferred compensation, as mutually agreed by the Corporation and the Executive, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed by the Executive)
under Section 409A of the Code and such deferral is required to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, no portion of the Severance Payment shall be delayed for six (6) months after the
Executives separation from service if such portion (x) constitutes a short term deferral within the meaning of Section 1.409A-1(a)(4) of the Department of Treasury Regulations, or (y) (A) it is being
paid due to the Corporations termination of the Executives employment without Cause or the Executives termination of employment for Good Reason; (B) it does not exceed two times the lesser of (1) the Executives
annualized compensation from the Corporation for the calendar year prior to the calendar year in which the termination of the Executives employment occurs, or (2) the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan
pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the year in which the Executives employment terminates; and (C) the payment is required under this Agreement to be paid no later than the last day of the second calendar year following
the calendar year in which the Executive incurs a separation from service. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the Executives right to receive installment payments pursuant to Section 2.3(a) shall be treated as a
right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. To the extent that any reimbursement of any expense under Section 1.4(e) or in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement are deemed to constitute taxable compensation to the
Executive, such amounts will be reimbursed or provided no later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred. The amount of any such expenses reimbursed or in-kind benefits provided in one year shall not
affect the expenses or in-kind benefits eligible for reimbursement or payment in any subsequent year, and the Executives right to such reimbursement or payment of any such expenses will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other
benefit. The determination of whether the Executive is a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code as of the time of the Executives separation from service shall made by the Corporation in
accordance with the terms of Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder (including without limitation Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i) and any successor provision thereto).  (b) If the Executives employment is terminated by reason of the Executives death or disability, pursuant to
Sections 2.1(b) or 2.1(c), the Executive (or the Executives designee or estate) shall only be entitled to whatever welfare plans benefits are available to the Executive pursuant to the welfare plans the Executive participated in prior to such
termination, and whatever stock awards may have been provided to the Executive by the Corporation the terms of which shall be governed by the provisions of the Corporations Incentive Plan and the respective award agreements, if any, under
which such stock awards were provided.  (c) If the Executives employment is terminated by the Corporation
for Cause or by the Executive without Good Reason (as defined in Section 2.1(e)), the Executive shall receive only that portion of the Executives then current Base Compensation payable through the Executives termination date. The
Executives rights with respect to any stock awards provided to the Executive by the Corporation shall be governed by the provisions of the Corporations Incentive Plan and the respective award agreements, if any, under which such stock
awards were provided.   
6 


(d) If the Corporation elects not to renew Executives employment at
the end of the Term, the Corporation shall provide Executive with written notice if its decision at least six (6) months prior to the end of the Term, and such a termination will be considered a termination Without Cause as defined in
Section 2.1(a).  ARTICLE III  COVENANTS OF THE EXECUTIVE  3.1 Non-Compete.  (a) The Corporation and the Executive acknowledge that: (i) the Corporation has a special interest in and derives
significant benefit from the unique skills and experience of the Executive; (ii) the Executive will use and have access to proprietary and valuable Confidential Information (as defined in Section 3.2 hereof) during the course of the
Executives employment; and (iii) the agreements and covenants contained herein are essential to protect the business and goodwill of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees. Accordingly, except as hereinafter
noted, the Executive covenants and agrees that during the Term and for the period of one (1) year following the termination of Executives employment for any reason, the Executive shall not provide any labor, work, services or assistance
(whether as an officer, director, employee, partner, agent, owner, independent contractor, consultant, stockholder or otherwise) to a Competing Business. For purposes hereof, Competing Business shall mean any business engaged
in the designing, marketing or distribution of premium lifestyle products, including but not limited to apparel, home, accessories and fragrance products, which competes in any material respects with the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries,
affiliates or licensees, and shall include, without limitation, those brands and companies that the Corporation and the Executive have jointly designated in writing on the date hereof, which is incorporated herein by reference and which is attached
as Schedule A, as being in competition with the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees as of the date hereof. Thus, Executive specifically acknowledges that Executive understands that she may not become employed by any
Competing Business in any capacity during the Term, provided that the Executive may own, solely as an investment, securities of any entity which are traded on a national securities exchange if the Executive is not a controlling person of, or a
member of a group that controls such entity and does not, directly or indirectly, own 2% or more of any class of securities of such entity.  (b) The non-compete provisions of this Section shall no longer be applicable to Executive if she has been notified pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof that her services will no longer be required or if
the Executive has terminated her employment for Good Reason pursuant to Section 2.1(e).  (c) It is
acknowledged by the Executive that the Corporation has determined to relieve the Executive from any obligation of non-competition upon the expiration of one (1) year following the termination of Executives employment for any reason,
and/or if the Corporation terminates the Executives employment under Section 2.1(a) or if the Executive has terminated her employment for Good Reason pursuant to Section 2.1(e). In consideration of that, and in consideration of all
of the compensation provisions in this Agreement (including the potential for the award of stock options, restricted shares and/or RPSUs and severance payments
  
7 



that may be provided to the Executive), Executive agrees to the provisions of Section 3.1(a) and also agrees that the non-competition obligations imposed herein are fair and reasonable under
all the circumstances.  3.2 Confidential Information.  (a) The Corporation owns and has developed and compiled, and will own, develop and compile, certain proprietary techniques
and confidential information as described below which have great value to its business (referred to in this Agreement, collectively, as Confidential Information). Confidential Information includes not only information disclosed by the
Corporation and/or its affiliates, subsidiaries and licensees to Executive, but also information developed or learned by Executive during the course of, or as a result of, employment hereunder, which information Executive acknowledges is and shall
be the sole and exclusive property of the Corporation. Confidential Information includes all proprietary information that has or could have commercial value or other utility in the business in which the Corporation is engaged or contemplates
engaging, and all proprietary information the unauthorized disclosure of which could be detrimental to the interests of the Corporation. Whether or not such information is specifically labeled as Confidential Information by the Corporation is not
determinative. By way of example and without limitation, Confidential Information includes any and all information developed, obtained or owned by the Corporation and/or its subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees concerning trade secrets, techniques,
know-how (including designs, plans, procedures, processes and research records), software, computer programs, innovations, discoveries, improvements, research, development, test results, reports, specifications, data, formats, marketing data and
plans, business plans, strategies, forecasts, unpublished financial information, orders, agreements and other forms of documents, price and cost information, merchandising opportunities, expansion plans, designs, store plans, budgets, projections,
customer, supplier and subcontractor identities, characteristics and agreements, and salary, staffing and employment information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not in any event include (A) Executives
personal knowledge and know-how relating to merchandising and business techniques which Executive has developed over her career in the apparel business and of which Executive was aware prior to her employment, or (B) information which
(i) was generally known or generally available to the public prior to its disclosure to Executive; (ii) becomes generally known or generally available to the public subsequent to disclosure to Executive through no wrongful act of any
person or (iii) which Executive is required to disclose by applicable law or regulation (provided that Executive provides the Corporation with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and reasonably cooperates with the Corporation at the
Corporations expense in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).  (b) Executive acknowledges and agrees that in the performance of her duties hereunder the Corporation will from time to time disclose to Executive and entrust Executive with Confidential Information. Executive also acknowledges and agrees
that the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, among other things, may be prejudicial to the Corporations interests, and an improper disclosure of trade secrets. Executive agrees that she shall not, directly or indirectly, use,
make available, sell, disclose or otherwise communicate to any corporation, partnership, individual or other third party, other than in the course of her assigned duties and for the benefit of the Corporation, any Confidential Information, either
during her Term of employment or thereafter.   
8 


(c) The Executive agrees that upon leaving the Corporations employ,
the Executive shall not take with the Executive any software, computer programs, disks, tapes, research, development, strategies, designs, reports, study, memoranda, books, papers, plans, information, letters, e-mails, or other documents or data
reflecting any Confidential Information of the Corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees.  (d)
During the Term, Executive shall disclose to the Corporation all designs, inventions and business strategies or plans developed for the Corporation, including without limitation any process, operation, product or improvement. Executive agrees that
all of the foregoing are and shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Corporation and that Executive shall at the Corporations request and cost do whatever is necessary to secure the rights thereto, by patent, copyright or otherwise, to
the Corporation.  3.3 Non-Solicitation of Employees. The Executive covenants and agrees that during the Term, and for a
period of two (2) years following the termination of Executives employment for any reason whatsoever hereunder, the Executive shall not directly or indirectly solicit or influence any other employee of the Corporation, or any of its
subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees, to terminate such employees employment with the Corporation, or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees, as the case may be, or to become employed by a Competing Business. As used herein,
solicit shall include, without limitation, requesting, encouraging, enticing, assisting, or causing, directly or indirectly.  3.4 Nondisparagement. The parties agree that during the Term and thereafter whether or not the Executive is receiving any amounts pursuant to Sections 2.3 and 4.1, the parties shall not make any
statements or comments that reasonably could be considered to shed an adverse light on the Executive or the business or reputation of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees, the Board or any officer of the Corporation or
any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees; provided, however, the foregoing limitation shall not apply to (i) compliance with legal process or subpoena, or (ii) statements in response to an inquiry from a court or regulatory body.
 3.5 Remedies.  (a) If the Executive breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the provisions of this Article III, the Corporation shall have the following rights and remedies, each of which rights and
remedies shall be independent of the other and severally enforceable, and all of which rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to the Corporation under law or equity:  (i) The right and remedy to have the obligations specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being
acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach of such obligations in this Article III will cause irreparable injury to the Corporation and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to the Corporation; and

(ii) The right to discontinue the payment of any amounts owing to the
Executive under the Agreement; provided that the Corporation shall have secured a reasoned opinion of counsel that the Executives activities constitute a material breach of the obligations in this Article III and which shall have been provided
to the Executive, the delivery of which shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any applicable privilege. To the extent Executive, by notice hereunder, disputes the discontinuance of any payments hereunder, such payments shall be segregated and
deposited in an interest bearing account at a major financial center bank in New York City pending resolution of the dispute.  (b) If any court or arbitrator determines that any of the obligations in this Article III, or any part thereof, is invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the obligations in this Article III shall not
thereby be affected and shall be given full effect, without regard to the invalid portion. In addition, if any court or arbitrator construes any of the obligations in this Article III, or any part thereof, to be unenforceable because of the duration
of such provision or the area covered thereby, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration or area of such provision and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.  3.6 The provisions of this Article III shall survive the termination of this Agreement and Executives Term of employment. 
ARTICLE IV  CHANGE IN CONTROL  4.1 Change in Control.  (a) Effect of a Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if the Executives
employment is terminated within twelve (12) months following a Change in Control (as defined in Section 4.1(b) hereof) during the Term by the Corporation for any reason other than Cause, then:  (i) Severance. The Corporation shall pay to the Executive, in lieu of any amounts otherwise due to her under
Section 2.3(a) hereof, within fifteen (15) days of the Executives termination of employment, or within the timeframe required by Section 2.3(a)(v) hereof if applicable, a lump sum amount equal to two (2) times the sum of:
(A) the Executives Base Compensation, as in effect immediately prior to such termination of employment; and (B) the bonus paid to the Executive for the most recently completed fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which her
employment is terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any portion of the severance pay that would have otherwise been due to the Executive under Section 2.3(a)(i) (had a Change in Control not occurred during the
twelve-month period prior to such termination of employment) would have been subject to Code Section 409A by reason of its failure to qualify as a short-term deferral for purposes of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) or as non-deferred
separation pay under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(9) (the 409A Severance Pay) and that the exception set forth in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(c) is not available, the 409A Severance Pay shall be deducted from the amount
otherwise payable in a lump sum in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 4.1(a)(i) and shall instead be payable to Executive in the form and on the schedule specified in Section
  
10 



2.3(a)(i) as if the Executives employment had been terminated pursuant to Section 2.3(a) hereof rather than within a twelve-month period following a Change in Control but subject to
Section 2.3(a)(v).  (ii) Stock Awards. Subject to Section 2.3(a)(v), the Executive shall
immediately become vested in any unvested stock options granted to the Executive by the Corporation prior to the Change in Control and Executive will have six (6) months from the date of termination under this circumstance to exercise all
vested options (but in no event later than the expiration date of such options). In addition, subject to Section 2.3(a)(v), any awards of RPSUs and restricted shares which are unvested shall be deemed vested immediately prior to such
Change in Control. Subject to Section 2.3(a)(v), payments to the Executive with respect to any RPSUs whose vesting accelerates as described in this Section 4.1(a)(ii) will be calculated as if any applicable performance goals had been
achieved at the specified target level and made as per the terms of the Incentive Plan but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the applicable vesting date.  (b) Definition. For purposes hereof, a Change in Control shall mean the occurrence of any of the
following:  (i) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition, in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to any person or group (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Act)) other than
Permitted Holders;  (ii) any person or group is or becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in
Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Act, except that a person shall be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all shares that any such person has the right to acquire, whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage
of time), directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the total voting power of the voting stock of the Corporation, including by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise; provided, however, that for purposes of this Agreement, the following
acquisitions shall not constitute a Change in Control: (I) any acquisition by the Corporation or any Affiliate, (II) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Corporation or any Affiliate, (III) any acquisition
by one or more of the Permitted Holders, or (IV) any acquisition which complies with clauses (A), (B) and (C) of subsection (v) below;  (iii) during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, Present and/or New Directors cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the Board;  (iv) the Permitted Holders beneficial ownership of the total voting power of the voting stock of the Corporation falls
below 30 percent and either Ralph Lauren is not nominated for a position on the Board of Directors, or he stands for election to the Board of Directors and is not elected;  (v) the consummation of a reorganization, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange or similar form
of corporate transaction involving the Corporation that requires the approval of the Corporations stockholders, whether
  
11 



for such transaction or the issuance of securities in the transaction (a Business Combination), unless immediately following such Business Combination: (A) more than 50% of the
total voting power of (x) the entity resulting from such Business Combination (the Surviving Company), or (y) if applicable, the ultimate parent entity that directly or indirectly has beneficial ownership of sufficient voting
securities eligible to elect a majority of the members of the board of directors (or the analogous governing body) of the Surviving Company (the Parent Company), is represented by the shares of voting stock of the Corporation that were
outstanding immediately prior to such Business Combination (or, if applicable, is represented by shares into which the shares of voting stock of the Corporation were converted pursuant to such Business Combination), and such voting power among the
holders thereof is in substantially the same proportion as the voting power was among the holders of the shares of voting stock of the Corporation that were outstanding immediately prior to the Business Combination, (B) no person (other than
any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Surviving Company or the Parent Company, or one or more Permitted Holders), is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of the total voting power of the
outstanding voting securities eligible to elect members of the board of directors of the Parent Company (or the analogous governing body) (or, if there is no Parent Company, the Surviving Company) and (C) at least a majority of the members of
the board of directors (or the analogous governing body) of the Parent Company (or, if there is no Parent Company, the Surviving Company) following the consummation of the Business Combination were Board members at the time of the Boards
approval of the execution of the initial agreement providing for such Business Combination; or  (vi) the
stockholders of the Corporation approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation.  For purposes of this
Section 4.1(b), the following terms have the meanings indicated: Permitted Holders shall mean, as of the date of determination: (A) any and all of Ralph Lauren, his spouse, his siblings and their spouses, and descendants of
them (whether natural or adopted) (collectively, the Lauren Group); and (B) any trust established and maintained primarily for the benefit of any member of the Lauren Group and any entity controlled by any member of the Lauren
Group. Present Directors shall mean individuals who at the beginning of any one year period were members of the Board. New Directors shall mean any directors whose election by the Board or whose nomination for election by the
shareholders of the Corporation was approved by a vote of a majority of the directors of the Corporation who, at the time of such vote, were either Present Directors or New Directors but excluding any such individual whose initial assumption of
office occurs solely as a result of an actual or threatened proxy contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person other than the Board.

 or to such other address as any party may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance
herewith, except that notices of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.  5.2 Modification or Waiver;
Entire Agreement; End of Term. No provision of this Agreement may be modified or waived except in a document signed by the Executive and the Corporation. This Agreement, along with the Term Sheet and any other documents incorporated herein by
reference, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding their employment relationship and supersedes all prior agreements, promises, covenants, representations or warranties, including, without limitation, the Executives 2004
Employment Agreement with the Corporation. To the extent that this Agreement is in any way inconsistent with any prior or contemporaneous stock award agreements between the parties, this Agreement shall control. No agreements or representations,
oral or otherwise, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party that are not set forth expressly in this Agreement. Any extensions or renewals of this Agreement must be in writing and must be agreed to by both the
Corporation and the Executive. Absent such extensions or renewals, this Agreement and all of its terms and conditions, except for those provisions in Article III as specified therein, shall expire upon the end of the Term.  5.3 Governing Law. The validity, interpretation, construction, performance, and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by
the laws of the State of New York without reference to New Yorks choice of law rules.  5.4 Arbitration. The
Corporation and the Executive mutually agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, or any other dispute between the parties arising from or related to Executives employment with the
Corporation, shall be submitted to mediation before a mutually agreeable mediator. In the event mediation is unsuccessful in resolving the claim or controversy, such claim or controversy shall be resolved by arbitration. The Corporation and
Executive agree that arbitration shall be held in New York, New York, before a mutually agreed upon single arbitrator licensed to practice law. The arbitrator shall have authority to award or grant legal, equitable, and declaratory relief. Such
arbitration shall be final and binding on the parties and fees for any arbitration shall be paid by
  
13 



the losing party. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the matter may be submitted to JAMS Dispute Resolution solely for appointment of an arbitrator. Any fees for mediation shall
be split between the parties.  5.5 No Mitigation or Offset. In the event the Executives employment with the
Corporation terminates for any reason, the Executive shall not be obligated to seek other employment following such termination and there shall be no offset of the payments or benefits set forth herein.  5.6 Withholding. All payments required to be made by the Corporation hereunder to the Executive or the Executives estate or
beneficiaries shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts as the Corporation may reasonably determine it should withhold pursuant to any applicable law.  5.7 Attorneys Fees. Each party shall bear its own attorneys fees and costs incurred in any action or dispute arising out of this Agreement and/or the employment relationship.
 5.8 No Conflict. Executive represents and warrants that she is not party to any agreement, contract, understanding,
covenant, judgment or decree or under any obligation, contractual or otherwise, with any other party that in any way restricts or adversely affects her ability to act for the Corporation in all of the respects contemplated hereby, including but not
limited to any obligations to comply with any non-compete or non-solicitation provisions.  5.9 Enforceability. Each of
the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement are separate and independent covenants, each of which has been separately bargained for and the parties hereto intend that the provisions of each such covenant shall be enforced to the fullest
extent permissible. Should the whole or any part or provision of any such separate covenant be held or declared invalid, such invalidity shall not in any way affect the validity of any other such covenant or of any part or provision of the same
covenant not also held or declared invalid. If any covenant shall be found to be invalid but would be valid if some part thereof were deleted or the period or area of application reduced, then such covenant shall apply with such minimum modification
as may be necessary to make it valid and effective. The failure of either party at any time to require performance by the other party of any provision hereunder will in no way affect the right of that party thereafter to enforce the same, nor will
it affect any other partys right to enforce the same, or to enforce any of the other provisions in this Agreement; nor will the waiver by either party of the breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of any prior or
subsequent breach of such provision or as a waiver of the provision itself.  5.10 Miscellaneous. No right or interest
to, or in, any payments shall be assignable by the Executive; provided, however, that this provision shall not preclude the Executive from designating in writing one or more beneficiaries to receive any amount that may be payable after
the Executives death and shall not preclude the legal representative of the Executives estate from assigning any right hereunder to the person or persons entitled thereto. If the Executive should die while any amounts would still be
payable to the Executive hereunder, all such amounts shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executives
  
14 



written designee or, if there be no such designee, to the Executives estate. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Executive, the Executives heirs and legal representatives and the Corporation and its successors. The section headings shall not be taken into account for purposes of the construction of any provision of this Agreement.  5.11 Meaning of Signing This Agreement. By signing this Agreement, Executive expressly acknowledges and agrees that (a) she has
carefully read it and fully understands what it means; (b) she has been advised in writing to discuss this Agreement with an independent attorney of her own choosing before signing it and has had a reasonable opportunity to confer with her
attorney and has discussed and reviewed this Agreement with her attorney prior to executing it and delivering it to the Corporation; (c) she has had answered to her satisfaction any questions she has with regard to the meaning and significance
of any of the provisions of this Agreement; and (d) she has agreed to this Agreement knowingly and voluntarily of her own free will and was not subjected to any undue influence or duress, and assents to all the terms and conditions contained
herein with the intent to be bound hereby.  5.12 Compliance with Section 409A. The parties acknowledge and agree
that, to the extent applicable, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with, and the parties agree to use their best efforts to achieve timely compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and the Department of Treasury Regulations and
other interpretive guidance issued thereunder (Section 409A), including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, in the event that the Corporation determines that any compensation or benefits payable or provided hereunder may be subject to Section 409A, the Corporation reserves the right (without any obligation to do so or to indemnify the
Executive for failure to do so), after consulting with and securing the approval of the Executive (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to adopt such limited amendments to this Agreement and appropriate policies and procedures,
including amendments and policies with retroactive effect, that the Corporation reasonably determines are necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the compensation and benefits payable under this Agreement from Section 409A and/or preserve
the intended tax treatment of the compensation and benefits provided with respect to this Agreement or (b) comply with the requirements of Section 409A.   
15 


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement effective as of the date and
year first above written.

Convent Garden reports rise in net rental income




Prachi Singh |



Friday, July 21 2017 


During the six months ended June 30, 2017, Capco said that the company
further strengthened its financial position reducing loan to value to 18
percent and increasing available liquidity to 577 million pounds (749
million dollars). The total property value of the group increased 0.2
percent like-for-like to 3.5 billion pounds (4.5 billion dollars). The
valuation of Covent Garden rose by 1.5 percent like-for-like to 2.4 billion
pounds (3.1 billion dollars), driven by rental growth of 2.8 percent
achieved over the period. 
Commenting on the H1 update, Ian Hawksworth, Chief Executive of Capco,
said in a media release: “Covent Garden which now represents two thirds of
our business is established as a world class retail and dining destination
and continues to deliver positive rental and value growth. There has been
strong operational progress across the estate with 43 new leasing
transactions signed during the period, including brands such as Kent &
Curwen. Our ERV target of 125 million pounds by December 2020 remains in
place, reflecting the positive growth prospects of the estate.”
Convent Garden performs well during H1
In the six months, Covent Garden’s ERV increased 2.8 percent
like-for-like to 98.8 million pounds (128 million dollars) and the company
said, ERV target of 125 million pounds (162 million dollars) by December
2020 remains in place. Capco said, Covent Garden’s rental growth prospects
remain strong and the estate is well placed to outperform the wider central
London market due to its innovative repositioning strategy, its
experiential approach to place-making and its global reputation.
During the period to 30 June 2017, 43 leasing transactions including new
leases and renewals representing 6.6 million pounds (8.5 million dollars)
of rental income per annum were transacted at 3.9 per cent above 31
December 2016 ERV. A new Zone A rent of over 700 pounds (909 dollars) per
square foot for The Market Building was achieved this period. Net rental
income was 23.4 million pounds (30.4 million dollars) for the first half of
the year, up 7.4 percent like-for-like compared to the first half of
2016.
Convent Garden welcomes new luxury labels
Capco added that occupancy on the estate remains high at 97 percent.
Building on the success of the gifting and luxury accessories strategy
introduced last year, Capco has further strengthened its offering at the
Royal Opera House Arcade through the signing of luxury sunglasses brand
Linda Farrow which will offer a range of timeless frames, including a pair
exclusive to Covent Garden. This addition joins the curated line-up of
premium retailers already in the Arcade, including Mulberry, The Watch
Gallery as well as N.PEAL and Tom Davies which are due to open shortly.
The latest signing to the Market Building is premium watch brand Daniel
Wellington, who have chosen Covent Garden as the location for their first
UK store. British heritage sportswear brand, Kent & Curwen, will open the
brand’s first store under the partnership of Creative Director, Daniel
Kearns and Business Partner, David Beckham later this year at 12 Floral
Street. The place is anchored by both Paul Smith and British lifestyle
concept Petersham Nurseries who will open within the Floral Court
development.
Capco further said that the transformation of Henrietta Street continues
with a strategy to create a new menswear and dining destination in London.
Luxury men’s shoe brand, Cheaney and Parisian outerwear clothing concept
K-Way opened stores at the beginning of the year. In addition, the latest
signing to the street is eyewear brand Bailey Nelson.

Swatch says profits up in first half 2017




AFP |



Friday, July 21 2017 


 Swiss watchmaker Swatch said Friday that its
profits rose in the first six months, but its performance was dampened by
the
strength of the Swiss franc.

​
"The overvalued Swiss franc dampened growth in the first half of the
year,"
Swatch said in its first half report.
"As in the previous year, the first half of 2017 was characterised by
worldwide turbulence," the report said.


"However, the Swatch Group, with its 20 strong brands and its own retail
network, is very well represented worldwide, and was therefore able to
generate net sales of 3.7 billion Swiss francs (3.3 billion euros, $3.9
billion)."


That represented a fractional decline of 0.3 percent compared with the
corresponding period a year earlier.
At constant exchange rates, sales would have risen by 1.2 percent.
Net profit grew by 6.8 percent to 281 million Swiss francs (254 million
euros), slightly short of analysts' expectations.


Looking ahead, Swatch said it "anticipates very positive growth in local
currency in the second half of the year. In addition to its already strong
own
retail business, wholesale should also develop positively."

Myer cuts profit outlook, deputy CEO steps down




Prachi Singh |



Friday, July 21 2017 


In its May update, Myer Holdings anticipated EBITDA growth to exceed
sales growth in FY2017 and NPAT to be higher than 69.3 million Australian
dollars (54.7 million dollars). However, on the back of continued weakness
in retail trading conditions, particularly in July, the company now
anticipates FY2017 NPAT to be between 66 million and 70 million Australian
dollars (52 to 55 million dollars). Myer anticipates FY2017 implementation
costs (pre-tax) to be between 18 million and 20 million Australian dollars
(14 to 15 million dollars).
Commenting on the update, Myer’s Chief Executive and Managing Director,
Richard Umbers said in a press release: “The period of June – July
stocktake sale has traditionally been an important period of profit
generation for Myer. We are responding to the challenging external
environment in a way that preserves the integrity of the new Myer strategy,
while continuing our focus on efficiency and productivity.”
Myer also announced that the company has decided to write down the full
carrying value of Myer’s 20 percent stake in Austradia, the Australian
franchisee of Topshop Topman of 6.8 million Australian dollars (5.3 million
dollars) and it has been unable to secure a deal on acceptable commercial
terms with UK based brand owner Arcadia Group to allow for the continuation
of Topshop Topman concessions in Myer.
Myer further added that as previously outlined in 1H 2017 and Q3 2017
results, the performance of sass & bide has been challenged during the past
year, so the board has assessed the carrying value and there will be an
impairment charge of 38.8 million Australian dollars (30.7 million
dollars).
Deputy CEO Daniel Bracken leaves Myer
After over two and half years in the role, Daniel Bracken, chief
merchandise and customer officer and deputy CEO has decided to step down
from his position with Myer. The company said, in addition to his line
responsibilities, Bracken played an instrumental role in developing new
Myer, and in particular with the introduction of new brands to Myer.

Prachi Singh |



Thursday, July 20 2017 


After reporting almost 59 percent fall in annual profit, Sports Direct
announced appointment of Jon Kempster as Chief Financial Officer and
executive director on the board on September 11, 2017.
"We look forward to welcoming Jon to Sports Direct. His breadth of
experience and proven track record will be a significant asset to the
company," said Dr Keith Hellawell, Chairman of Sports Direct, in a media
release.
Jon Kempster is the new CFO of Sports Direct
From July 2010 to November 2012, Kempster was group finance director
of UK logistics & distribution group Wincanton plc and was part of the
executive team which, the company said, led the successful implementation
of a new strategy which delivered a performance turnaround of the
group.
"I am really excited to be joining Sports Direct, and I look forward to
working with Mike and the team," added Kempster.
Prior to Wincanton plc, he was group finance director of industrial
group Delta plc between November 2006 - July 2010 and part of the executive
team which successfully restructured the group leading to improved
performance and profitability and which resulted in the sale of the group

of the group. Kempster was also a non-executive director of Utilitywise plc
before stepping up to the CFO role there to aid management transition (Oct
2013 - Dec 2016).

Mothercare's UK like-for-like sales rise 1.9 percent in Q1




Prachi Singh |



Thursday, July 20 2017 


UK like-for-like sales at Mothercare, for the 15 week period to July
8 2017 increased 1.9 percent. The company said, it entered the end of
season sale with lower stocks and are achieving a higher sell through rate.
The company’s online sales grew by 3.3 percent but total UK sales were
lower than last year, reflecting on-going store closure programme. Retail
space at the end of the quarter reduced to 1.4m sq. ft., with 147 stores
including 143 Mothercare and four ELC.
Commenting on the first quarter trading update, Mark Newton-Jones, Chief
Executive Officer of Mothercare said in a press release: “We have continued
to make progress in the UK during the period. Whilst online sales recorded
a lower growth, in contrast to higher sales growth in store, we don’t
believe this represents an underlying permanent shift in customer
behaviour. In our international business, the challenging economic
conditions in the Middle East continue and are impacting overall
performance, and so the outlook remains volatile.”
International retail sales were down 8.3 percent in constant currency
and up 2.2 percent in actual currency, primarily driven by continued
weakness in the Middle East. Online sales growth was 53 percent in constant
currency and 78 percent in actual currency.
The company opened 26 stores and closed 43 during the period, mainly
driven by market exits as it consolidated partners, including Kazakhstan,
ending the quarter with 1,133 stores.

customers, according to chief executive Luke Grana, informs the ‘South
China Morning Post’. 
According to the company, their revenue is growing at speed: circa 15
percent every month, with 60 percent of sales coming from its existing
customers, who on average order from Grana three times a year. 
Sources close to the company highlight that Grana is expecting its
appeal with U.S. consumers to help it gain traction in the mainland Chinese
market. The label counts Gigi Hadid, Jessica Alba and Lily Collins among
its early fans in the U.S.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials

Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."
