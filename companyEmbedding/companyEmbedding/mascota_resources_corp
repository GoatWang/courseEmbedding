The net proceeds to us from the sale of up to 1,900,000 shares of common stock 
offered at a public offering price of $0.0075 per share will vary depending upon
the total number of shares sold. The following table summarizes, in order of 
priority the anticipated application of the proceeds we will receive from this 
Offering if the maximum number of shares is sold:

                                  Amount     
                                  Assuming    
                                   Maximum     Percent of 
                                  Offering      Maximum   
GROSS OFFERING                    $  14,250         100.0%
Commission 1                      $       -           0.0%
Net Proceeds                      $  14,250         100.0%

TOTAL APPLICATION OF NET PROCEEDS $  14,250         100.0%

1 Commissions: Shares will be offered and sold by us without special 
  compensation or other remuneration for such efforts. We do not plan to enter 
  into agreements with finders or securities broker-dealers whereby the finders 
  or broker-dealers would be involved in the sale of the Shares to the 
  investors. Shares will be sold directly by us, and no fee or commission will 
  be paid.

2 Mineral exploration: We intend to use all of the net proceeds of this Offering
  to perform Phase I of our mineral exploration plan on our Mineral Claim.

3 Legal and accounting: None of the proceeds of this Offering will be used to 
  pay legal, accounting, and related compliance costs to be incurred on a 
  periodic basis as a result of our exploration programs or becoming a public 
  company. Our legal expenses incurred in connection with this Offering will be 
  paid from cash currently on hand. Other expenses associated with this Offering
  will be paid from a combination of cash on hand and funds to be received as-
  needed from our sole officer and director, Maria Ponce. Ms. Ponce has offered 
  to fund our basic legal and accounting compliance expenses through additional 
  infusions of debt capital on an as-needed basis, although she is under no 
  legal obligation to provide funding.  This offer is not the subject of a 
  formal written agreement with us, and there are no specific limits as to time 
  or dollar amount.

In the event that less than the maximum number of shares is sold we anticipate 
application of the proceeds we will receive from this Offering, in order of 
priority, will be as follows:

                     Amount Assuming                Amount Assuming                Amount Assuming    
                     75% of Offering    Percent     50% of Offering    Percent     25% of Offering    Percent 
GROSS OFFERING        $        10,688     100.0%     $         7,125     100.0%     $         3,563     100.0%
Commission            $             -       0.0%     $             -       0.0%     $             -       0.0%
Net Proceeds          $        10,688     100.0%     $         7,125     100.0%     $         3,563     100.0%
USE OF NET PROCEEDS                                                                                           
Mineral exploration   $        10,688     100.0%     $         7,125     100.0%     $         3,563     100.0%
TOTAL APPLICATION                                                                                       
OF NET PROCEEDS       $        10,688     100.0%     $         7,125     100.0%     $         3,563     100.0%

Phase 1 of our business plan calls for a work program on our Mineral Claim which
cannot be scaled back. Were full funding in the form of Offering proceeds and/or
other funds not available at the time of the commencement of Phase I, the
recommended work program would be deferred until such time as cash on hand were
available.  The table above reflects the intended use of proceeds in the event
that the total funds available to us were sufficient to complete Phase I. These
figures reflect the intended use of offering proceeds.

The legal and accounting costs of this Offering will be paid from cash on hand
and/or through additional infusions of debt capital on an as-needed basis from
our sole officer and director, Ms. Ponce. Ms. Ponce has offered to fund our
basic legal and accounting compliance expenses through additional infusions of
equity or debt capital on an as-needed basis, although she is under no legal
obligation to provide funding. This offer is not the subject of a formal written
agreement with us, and there are no specific limits as to time or dollar amount.

We currently do not have any firm arrangements for financing in addition to the
financing contemplated by this prospectus. We may not be able to obtain
financing when required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a
number of factors, including the market prices for uranium and the costs of
exploring for or commercial production of this material.


The mineral exploration industry, in general, is intensely competitive and even
if commercial quantities of reserves are discovered, a ready market may not
exist for the sale of the reserves.

Most companies operating in this industry are more established and have greater
resources to engage in the production of mineral claims. We were incorporated
on November 3, 2011 and our operations are not well-established. Our resources
at the present time are limited.  We may exhaust all of our resources and be
unable to complete full exploration of our Mineral Claim. There is also
significant competition to retain qualified personnel to assist in conducting
mineral exploration activities.  If a commercially viable deposit is found to
exist and we are unable to retai additional qualified personnel, we may be
unable to enter into production and achieve profitable operations. These
factors set forth above could inhibit our ability to compete with other
companies in the industry and enter into production of the mineral claim if a
commercial viable deposit is found to exist.

Numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of any
substances discovered. These factors include market fluctuations, the proximity
and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment, government
regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land
tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental
protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted,
but the combination of these factors may result in our not receiving an adequate
return on invested capital.


Company Description
We are an exploration stage mineral exploration company incorporated in Nevada 
on November 3, 2011. On November 10, 2011, we incorporated a wholly-owned 
subsidiary, MRC Exploration LLC in the state of Nevada, for the purposes of 
mineral exploration. On May 3, 2013, our consulting geologist


 acquired a 100% 
legal and beneficial ownership interest in the MC00000266 mining claim 
(hereafter the “Mineral Claim”) which he holds in trust for us. The Mineral 
Claim is located in the Northeast Athabasca Basin, in the Province of 
Saskatchewan, Canada. It is located on provincial lands administered by the 
Province of Saskatchewan. The legal and ownership rights on the claim are 
limited to the exploration and extraction of mineral deposits subject to 
applicable regulations. The Mineral Claim totals roughly 2,014 acres or 3.15 
square miles in size and is located approximately 25 miles north of the 
community of Points North, Saskatchewan.

The Mineral Claim comprises an irregular shaped block approximately 3 miles 
long and 1 mile wide located approximately 6 miles east of a significant
uranium occurrence known as Laroque Lake. Historic exploration work shows that 
the claims are located within an area that has potential for uranium 
mineralization.

Our currently planned exploration budget requires the expenditure of $15,000 in 
the early summer of 2014, plus the expenditure of an additional $140,000 in the 
early summer of 2015 if recommended by our consulting geologist. Further 
exploration activities beyond our currently planned exploration programs will 
be dependent upon a number of factors, including our consulting geologist’s 
recommendations based upon the exploration program results, and our available 
funds. In order to prove or disprove the economic viability of our mineral 
claim our mineral exploration costs plus our operating costs could amount to 
many millions of dollars.

The net proceeds to us from the sale of up to 1,900,000 shares of common stock 
offered at a public offering price of $0.0075 per share will vary depending upon
the total number of shares sold. The following table summarizes, in order of 
priority the anticipated application of the proceeds we will receive from this 
Offering if the maximum number of shares is sold:

                                  Amount     
                                  Assuming    
                                   Maximum     Percent of 
                                  Offering      Maximum   
GROSS OFFERING                    $  14,250         100.0%
Commission 1                      $       -           0.0%
Net Proceeds                      $  14,250         100.0%
USE OF NET PROCEEDS                                       
Mineral exploration 2             $  14,250         100.0%
TOTAL APPLICATION OF NET PROCEEDS $  14,250         100.0%

1 Commissions: Shares will be offered and sold by us without special 
  compensation or other remuneration for such efforts. We do not plan to enter 
  into agreements with finders or securities broker-dealers whereby the finders 
  or broker-dealers would be involved in the sale of the Shares to the 
  investors. Shares will be sold directly by us, and no fee or commission will 
  be paid.

2 Mineral exploration: We intend to use all of the net proceeds of this Offering
  to perform Phase I of our mineral exploration plan on our Mineral Claim.

3 Legal and accounting: None of the proceeds of this Offering will be used to 
  pay legal, accounting, and related compliance costs to be incurred on a 
  periodic basis as a result of our exploration programs or becoming a public 
  company. Our legal expenses incurred in connection with this Offering will be 
  paid from cash currently on hand. Other expenses associated with this Offering
  will be paid from a combination of cash on hand and funds to be received as-
  needed from our sole officer and director, Maria Ponce. Ms. Ponce has offered 
  to fund our basic legal and accounting compliance expenses through additional 
  infusions of debt capital on an as-needed basis, although she is under no 
  legal obligation to provide funding.  This offer is not the subject of a 
  formal written agreement with us, and there are no specific limits as to time 
  or dollar amount.

In the event that less than the maximum number of shares is sold we anticipate 
application of the proceeds we will receive from this Offering, in order of 
priority, will be as follows:

                     Amount Assuming                Amount Assuming                Amount Assuming    
                     75% of Offering    Percent     50% of Offering    Percent     25% of Offering    Percent 
GROSS OFFERING        $        10,688     100.0%     $         7,125     100.0%     $         3,563     100.0%
Commission            $             -       0.0%     $             -       0.0%     $             -       0.0%
Net Proceeds          $        10,688     100.0%     $         7,125     100.0%     $         3,563     100.0%
USE OF NET PROCEEDS                                                                                           
Mineral exploration   $        10,688     100.0%     $         7,125     100.0%     $         3,563     100.0%
TOTAL APPLICATION                                                                                       
OF NET PROCEEDS       $        10,688     100.0%     $         7,125     100.0%     $         3,563     100.0%

Phase 1 of our business plan calls for a work program on our Mineral Claim which
cannot be scaled back. Were full funding in the form of Offering proceeds and/or
other funds not available at the time of the commencement of Phase I, the
recommended work program would be deferred until such time as cash on hand were
available.  The table above reflects the intended use of proceeds in the event
that the total funds available to us were sufficient to complete Phase I. These
figures reflect the intended use of offering proceeds.

The legal and accounting costs of this Offering will be paid from cash on hand
and/or through additional infusions of debt capital on an as-needed basis from
our sole officer and director, Ms. Ponce. Ms. Ponce has offered to fund our
basic legal and accounting compliance expenses through additional infusions of
equity or debt capital on an as-needed basis, although she is under no legal
obligation to provide funding. This offer is not the subject of a formal written
agreement with us, and there are no specific limits as to time or dollar amount.

We currently do not have any firm arrangements for financing in addition to the
financing contemplated by this prospectus. We may not be able to obtain
financing when required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a
number of factors, including the market prices for uranium and the costs of
exploring for or commercial production of this material.


The mineral exploration industry, in general, is intensely competitive and even
if commercial quantities of reserves are discovered, a ready market may not
exist for the sale of the reserves.

Most companies operating in this industry are more established and have greater
resources to engage in the production of mineral claims. We were incorporated
on November 3, 2011 and our operations are not well-established. Our resources
at the present time are limited.  We may exhaust all of our resources and be
unable to complete full exploration of our Mineral Claim. There is also
significant competition to retain qualified personnel to assist in conducting
mineral exploration activities.  If a commercially viable deposit is found to
exist and we are unable to retai additional qualified personnel, we may be
unable to enter into production and achieve profitable operations. These
factors set forth above could inhibit our ability to compete with other
companies in the industry and enter into production of the mineral claim if a
commercial viable deposit is found to exist.

Numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of any
substances discovered. These factors include market fluctuations, the proximity
and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment, government
regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land
tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental
protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted,
but the combination of these factors may result in our not receiving an adequate
return on invested capital.


Company Description
We are an exploration stage mineral exploration company incorporated in Nevada 
on November 3, 2011. On November 10, 2011, we incorporated a wholly-owned 
subsidiary, MRC Exploration LLC in the state of Nevada, for the purposes of 
mineral exploration. On May 3, 2013, our consulting geologist


 acquired a 100% 
legal and beneficial ownership interest in the MC00000266 mining claim 
(hereafter the “Mineral Claim”) which he holds in trust for us. The Mineral 
Claim is located in the Northeast Athabasca Basin, in the Province of 
Saskatchewan, Canada. It is located on provincial lands administered by the 
Province of Saskatchewan. The legal and ownership rights on the claim are 
limited to the exploration and extraction of mineral deposits subject to 
applicable regulations. The Mineral Claim totals roughly 2,014 acres or 3.15 
square miles in size and is located approximately 25 miles north of the 
community of Points North, Saskatchewan.

The Mineral Claim comprises an irregular shaped block approximately 3 miles 
long and 1 mile wide located approximately 6 miles east of a significant
uranium occurrence known as Laroque Lake. Historic exploration work shows that 
the claims are located within an area that has potential for uranium 
mineralization.

Our currently planned exploration budget requires the expenditure of $15,000 in 
the early summer of 2014, plus the expenditure of an additional $140,000 in the 
early summer of 2015 if recommended by our consulting geologist. Further 
exploration activities beyond our currently planned exploration programs will 
be dependent upon a number of factors, including our consulting geologist’s 
recommendations based upon the exploration program results, and our available 
funds. In order to prove or disprove the economic viability of our mineral 
claim our mineral exploration costs plus our operating costs could amount to 
many millions of dollars.
