Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

WHAT IS CURRENCY HEDGING?


International investing provides many exciting opportunities to investors. But these opportunities come with additional risks—one of which is currency fluctuations. While currency can sometimes push equity returns higher, it can often pull returns down—and these fluctuations are typically a source of uncertainty.
 

Currency hedging is a strategy designed to mitigate the impact of currency or foreign exchange (FX) risk on international investments returns. Popular methods for hedging currency are forward contracts, spot contracts, and foreign currency options.
 
At WisdomTree, we have been implementing currency-hedging strategies for the last five years—in a way that is likely simpler and more cost-effective1 than many investors expect. The bottom line is that currency hedging allows investors to participate more fully in the local equity returns of international markets.


MECHANICS OF THE CURRENCY HEDGE


Here is how currency hedging typically works at WisdomTree:





 
The WisdomTree Currency Hedged Equity family of Funds implements WisdomTree’s currency-hedging strategies by entering into one-month forward contracts each month and rebalancing at month-end.

WHY HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCIES?
 
Investors allocating to foreign stocks typically assume a secondary risk exposure from currency. This risk is due to the difference between what the foreign currency is worth and what the dollar is worth. This “currency bet,” as some might call it, can help increase total returns during periods when the euro, yen and other foreign currencies are rising versus the dollar.

But it can also help reduce returns when those foreign currencies are falling in value. We believe that investors who do not have strong opinions on the potential direction of a currency should hedge at least a portion of their exposure in that currency.



When it comes to hedging foreign currencies, there are several myths out there. Let’s take a look at some of the most common.
 
MYTH #1


It is expensive to hedge foreign currencies.


Typically, it is only expensive to hedge foreign currencies that have much higher short-term interest rates than the United States, as is the case in Brazil, for example. However, the euro, yen and British pound—which combine to represent almost three-quarters of the weight of the MSCI EAFE Index (a widely followed benchmark composed of companies representative of the developed market structure of 21 developed countries in Europe, Australasia and Japan) —each has a very low cost to hedge, as figure 1 shows. In addition, as U.S. rates rise relative to rates in Europe and Japan, dollar-based investors could be paid to hedge euro and yen exposure. Put another way, it could become “expensive” for investors not to hedge their euro and yen exposure.

MYTH #2


Euro or yen exposure can be a good hedge against a declining U.S. dollar.


The values of the euro and yen, in essence, do not make good hedges against U.S. inflation rates or declining U.S. dollar purchasing power. What does make a potentially good hedge against inflation? We believe that stocks representing claims on real assets and/or those that have historically seen their dividends grow with inflation over time make better hedges against inflation. As figure 2 shows, dividend growth on the S&P 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index kept better pace with—and often outpaced—CPI in periods of high inflation, while currency returns did not.
 

 
MYTH #3


Currency returns are a wash in the long run.


One of the arguments we hear often is that, due to a concept called purchasing power parity (PPP), currencies offer no expected return in the long run and are therefore a wash. Yet currencies tend to move in very long secular trends. Interestingly, international equities actually saw their strongest returns during down currency trends (as shown in figures 3A and 3B). And when the currency is down, that can detract from the returns unless investors hedge their currency exposure.

STRATEGIC & TACTICAL HEDGING
 
The strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies like the euro or the yen can erode international returns if left unhedged. And some countries are pursuing monetary policies that may weaken the value of their currency.



Additionally, currency exposure can offer an added risk with little (or no) positive expected returns—something we’d call a source of “uncompensated risk.” Although this risk has long been seen as a “necessary evil” of international equity investing, it doesn’t have to be.

 
For investors with a negative outlook on a particular currency or more generally, those who believe that the dollar is going to strengthen, currency hedging is an important option, as it can enable them to pursue the international equity market returns without a drag from foreign currency weakness.
STRATEGIC HEDGING FOR THE LONG TERM
When investing for the long term, it may not make sense to simply accept the additional currency risk—unless investors have a deep conviction about the currency in question. In fact, as figure 4 shows, over the short and long term, currency adds a fair amount of volatility to investments. And over the long term shown below, hedging the currency would have lowered the volatility below that of the S&P 500.


TACTICAL HEDGING FOR SHORT-TERM ALLOCATIONS
Currency can make a big difference—even in the short term. In the Abenomics period starting November 30, 2012 and ending September 30, 2016, the MSCI Japan Index returned 44.4%—a decent return until it is compared to the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Index, which achieved a 61.7% return over the same timeframe! The difference? The WisdomTree Index hedges the yen, which lost 18.6% over the same period, while the MSCI index does not.



 
And there were similar results throughout Europe, where the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Index returned 16.1%, while the MSCI EMU Index lost 9.7% and the euro lost 18.2%.





 
WHY HEDGE DYNAMICALLY?
 
Historical data confirms that currency volatility can impact international investments over short- and long-term holding periods. While currency hedging has obvious advantages, some investors may not want the challenge of timing U.S. dollar strength or weakness. Building on our expertise in currency hedging, WisdomTree pioneered dynamic currency hedging, an adaptive strategy suited for long-term investors concerned about the impact of currency fluctuations on international equity holdings.
 
Problem Solving
 

Many leave it to their active manager to make the hedge/no hedge decision, but most of these managers typically specialize in stock selection, not currencies
Dynamic hedging  can solve the challenge of trying to "time" when a currency hedge should be in place and thus could serve as a core, long-run allocation 
Dynamic hedging may lower trading costs and increase tax efficiency when compared to a strategy that rotates between hedged and unhedged solutions

 
How Is It Achieved?
 

WisdomTree partnered with Record Currency Management, a currency manager with over 30 years of experience, to determine hedging signals for the new Index family1
Targeting Profitable Hedges: The strategy targets mid to long-term excess returns by seeking greater exposure to hedges with expected profitability versus hedges that are expected to generate losses
Diversification by Signal Time Horizon: Signals used to determine hedges (interest rates , value, momentum) have diversification in time horizon efficacy

EUROPE & INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY-HEDGED FUNDS

 
International investments should have a place in every portfolio, and now may be an opportune time to add them.
 

Of course, we believe that international equities tend to perform better when the U.S. dollar is strengthening—and if history repeats, we may be on the cusp of a prolonged period with a rising dollar. And if the dollar is rising, other currencies are often weakening. Hedging them can help to reduce volatility.



EUROPE HEDGED EQUITY FAMILY
 
The European Central Bank’s recent monetary easing policies have helped our Europe Hedged Equity family perform well. Not only are many of the world's leading companies—and familiar brands—headquartered in Europe, but these are truly global companies that generate the bulk of their revenue from exporting to countries outside Europe. Our family of European Hedged Equity Funds offers investors a way to more fully access the return potential of European equities while hedging the effects of the currencies.

GERMANY HEDGED EQUITY FUND

Germany is one of the engines of European growth. It has been a resilient force throughout the debt crisis and should benefit if a broader European recovery can take hold. Even so, we think some of the best times to own German stocks have been when Germany’s currency has been declining. WisdomTree Germany Hedged Equity Fund (DXGE) offers investors a way to capitalize on the growth potential of the tremendous German exporters while hedging out the effects of the euro, helping reduce volatility and capturing the performance of these stocks as their revenues potentially increase in a depreciating euro environment.

JAPAN & KOREA CURRENCY-HEDGED FUNDS
 
Asian investments can be a smart addition to a portfolio. And now may be an opportune time to add Japan and Korea, as these countries are both undergoing exciting changes.
 

However, history has shown that in export-driven economies, the equities typically go up when the currency is going down. And this can erode investors’ returns. Hedging the yen and the won can help reduce volatility.



JAPAN HEDGED EQUITY FAMILY
 

The Land of the Rising Sun is home to what we believe are exciting investment opportunities. And as prime minister Shinzo Abe continues to make strides with his economic policies, known a “Abenomics,” we expect that the economy as a whole and many sectors will benefit. Our family of Japan Hedged Equity Funds—which has enjoyed success with the new economic policies—offers a way to access the return potential of Japanese equities while hedging the effects of the yen.

        Last year, one of the most important investment themes was currency hedging, particularly for euro-denominated stocks. Many investors believed the euro was going to weaken on the back of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank (ECB)—and that’s exactly what happened. Versus the U.S. dollar, the euro started 2015 at 1.21 and closed the year at 1.09. With such a big move, many investors are wondering if they missed the boat.    
From our perspective, to the contrary. The case to hedge the euro has gotten stronger by one very important measure: how much you are now being paid to hedge.  
 
An important element of currency-hedged strategies involves the use of forward contracts to neutralize currency exposure. The pricing of these forward contracts is based on relative interest rate   differentials. In some countries like Brazil, short-term interest rates are very high, so it can cost U.S. investors upward of 14% per year to hedge exposure to currencies like the Brazilian real. That creates an incredibly high hurdle for how much the currency has to decline before an investor breaks even on paying that hedge cost.  
 
But the actions the ECB took in December 2015 make hedging the euro different. The ECB took its deposit rate more negative—cutting rates to -30 basis points (bps). The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)   hiked interest rates for the first time in nine years and now has a band on its short-term rate of 25–50 bps; the midpoint of the range would be 37.5 bps. This means currency hedging is not only inexpensive—investors are actually getting paid to hedge the euro. And if/when the Fed increases rates in 2016, that “payment” will increase further.  
 
Historical Cost of Hedging the Euro (1-Month Currency Forward Implied Rates as of 12/31/15)

From a tactical perspective, when we look at what factors can help improve the returns from a purely passive hedging standpoint, interest rate differentials are the most powerful long-run signal. Given that an investor is starting to get paid more than 50 basis points a year from the differential in interest rates, this offers a boost to returns to hedged strategies over unhedged strategies, even if the euro does not move.  
Of course, if the euro appreciates, the hedged strategies will not participate in those gains, but they will be hedged against further losses in the euro if those were to occur.  
 
WisdomTree has three exchange-traded fund (ETF) options to target euro-area stocks with a currency hedge: 
 
1)	WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity ETF (HEDJ): Provides access to the dividend-paying exporters of Europe, which can be positioned to benefit from a decline in the euro with their goods becoming more competitively priced in the global markets. We believe these companies have not fully benefited from the fall in the euro yet, as many of them also have large amounts of business coming from the emerging markets, which have also been weak in the last year. This is our flagship ETF for euro-area-hedging strategies.  
 
2)	WisdomTree Europe Hedged SmallCap Equity ETF (EUSC): Provides access to small-cap companies of the euro area and offers exposure to a more local side of European stocks. This fund can pair nicely with the large-cap multinationals to diversify size exposure and geographic revenue mixes of the companies.  
 
3)	WisdomTree Dynamic Currency Hedged Europe Equity ETF (DDEZ): Provides access to a broad cross-section of dividend payers from the euro area and implies a dynamic currency hedge. For investors who do not want to rotate between hedged and unhedged strategies, but want to have some currency exposure when the environment is supportive of it, this fund can adapt and provide that type of tactical hedging solution.  
 

    




Important Risks Related to this Article
There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. These Funds focus their investments in Europe; the impact of events and developments associated with the region can adversely affect performance.
The securities of small-capitalization companies generally trade in lower volumes and are subject to greater and more unpredictable price changes than larger-capitalization stocks or the stock market as a whole. The Funds use various strategies to attempt to minimize the impact of changes in the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar, and these strategies may not be successful. 
DDEZ invests in derivatives in seeking to obtain a dynamic currency-hedge exposure. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. The Funds invest in the securities included in, or representative of, their Indexes regardless of their investment merit, and the Funds do not attempt to outperform their Indexes or take defensive positions in declining markets.  
Due to the investment strategy of these Funds, they may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs. Please read each Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding each Fund’s risk profile. 
Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment loss.  
Dividends are not guaranteed, and a company’s future ability to pay dividends may be limited. A company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Next Generation of ETF Investing

                Over the last two decades, investors have increasingly turned to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) seeking to benefit from a defined strategy, diversified exposure to stocks, tax efficiency and low costs. Today, we combine the potential benefits of ETFs with the advanced strategies of Goldman Sachs Asset Managment (GSAM).
            









What Are the Potential Benefits of ETFs?





ETFs have grown in popularity due to the many benefits they offer: intraday trading ease, relative transparency and a likelihood of tax efficiency—all typically at lower total cost than most actively managed mutual funds.
 











The Four Ts

We note that ETFs are not riskless investments, so investors can lose money. Please see the ETF Risk Disclosures for additional risk considerations in the end disclosures. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
Goldman Sachs does not provide legal, tax or accounting advice to its clients. All investors are strongly urged to consult with their legal, tax, or accounting advisors regarding any potential transactions or investments. There is no assurance that the tax status or treatment of a proposed transaction or investment will continue in the future.

Developed in the early 1990s with lower cost, transparency and tax efficiency in mind, today there are ETFs representing both broad and narrow sectors of the market, and hundreds of ways to diversify. With $2 trillion in investor assets, it’s safe to say that ETFs are here to stay.

Next Generation of Equity Index Investing

Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs





These ETFs are designed to track an ActiveBeta® Index, a proprietary performance-seeking methodology from Goldman Sachs, which tilts towards stocks based on four well-established drivers of performance, often referred to as factors.








The Four Factors














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ Investing









Opportunity to Outperform the Market




To construct the ActiveBeta® Index, GSAM employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify and emphasize stocks within the market-cap weighted universe, potentially providing greater returns.
 









A Diversified Approach




Individual factors can be cyclical in the short run, which may lead to timing and performance challenges. Combining four complementary smart beta factors equally can potentially result in a more consistent investment experience over time.
 









Lower Cost




Not only are ActiveBeta™ ETFs a fraction of the price of most smart beta ETFs, they are also among the most competitively priced products on the market.2

Next Generation Fixed Income Investing

                GSAM now offers the next generation, smart beta Access ETFs that seek better risk-adjusted returns to help meet the needs of today’s fixed income investor.
            









Access ETFs by Goldman Sachs





GSAM’s Access ETFs can help investors build efficient fixed income portfolios. Going a step further than traditional market-value weighted methodology, a smart beta approach selects bonds based on liquidity and customized fundamentals.














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs Fixed Income Investing









Smarter Access to Bond Markets




The index employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify an investible universe, then eliminates issuers with relative deteriorating fundamentals to offer exposure to existing sector or market beta.
 









Seeks Smoother Performance, Less Volatility




As bond investors look for income and diversification, a smart beta approach seeks liquidity while minimizing exposure to factors historically associated with volatility and underperformance.
 









Lower Cost




Access ETFs are among the most competitively priced ETFs on the market. They also offer transparency and can alleviate some of the challenges of buying bonds in the over-the-counter market.3

Access to Top Insights

                GSAM developed the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which tracks insights from some of the leading thinkers in the hedge fund universe. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF seeks to track this index and provides exposure to hedge fund managers’ most important long equity ideas.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP)





The fund seeks to track the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which is constructed in accordance with a rules-based methodology derived from concepts previously developed by Goldman Sachs’ Global Investment Research division. The Index is designed to measure the performance of fundamentally-driven hedge fund managers' “Very-Important-Positions” — those positions that appear most frequently among their top 10 long equity holdings. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP) seeks to deliver these high-conviction ideas through the ease, transparency and liquidity of an ETF.









The Advantages of Investing in GVIP














The Fund is not a hedge fund and does not invest in hedge funds.
1. ETFs offer many benefits, including intraday trading, relative transparency and tax efficiency potential, all at typically lower expense ratios than most actively-managed mutual funds.

Access to the Treasury Market

                GSAM developed an ETF that provides access to Treasuries with a maturity of less than a year, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government. Investors in the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF can gain easy access to Treasury markets while avoiding the operational and pricing complexities of US Treasury Auctions and over-the-counter market.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL)





The fund seeks to track the Citi US Treasury 0–1 Year Composite Select Index, which is designed to measure the performance of U.S. Treasury Obligations4 with a maximum remaining maturity of one year. The Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0–1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL) provides access to the Treasury market through a lower cost, convenient and transparent ETF. The fund benefits from the experience of the GSAM Liquidity Solutions team, providing trade execution, price negotiation and security selection in the short-term Treasury market.









The Advantages of Investing in GBIL










Any guarantee on U.S Treasury Obligations applies only to the underlying securities of the Fund if held to maturity and not to the value of the Fund’s shares.
Individual shares may only be purchased and sold in secondary market transactions through brokers; shares trade at market prices rather than NAV; shares may trade at a price greater than or less than NAV; and investors may incur commission costs when buying or selling shares.
The Fund is not a money market fund and does not attempt to maintain a stable net asset value.

Class A shares include maximum front-end sales charge of 5.50% (Alternatives), 5.25% (Equity) and 4.25% (Fixed Income).  Class B shares include deferred sales charge of 5.00% which declines to zero after sixth year.  Class C shares include deferred sales charge of 1.00% which declines to zero after first year. Class L shares, Class I, and Class IS shares are not subject to a sales charge.
Where the net expense ratio is lower than the gross expense ratio, certain fees have been waived and/ or expenses reimbursed. These waivers and/or reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of the applicable fund’s current prospectus (unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus) or until such time as the fund's Board of Directors acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the fund's current prospectus. The minimum initial investment is $5,000,000 for Class I shares. 
The Fund has suspended offering Class B and Class L shares to all investors.
The Investment Approach is reflective of changes to the Fund as of December 9, 2016. See prospectus supplement for additional information.
Growth of Investment illustration is based on an initial investment of $10,000 made since fund inception, assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but does not include sales charges and fees. Performance would have been lower if sales charges and fees had been included. Results are hypothetical.
Subject to change daily. Fund information, Portfolio Composition and Characteristics are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security or securities in the region presented. 
Returns are net of fees and assume the reinvestment of all dividends and income. Returns for less than one year are cumulative (not annualized). Performance of other share classes will vary.
Please keep in mind that double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions. 
PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS DEFINITIONS
Price/earnings (P/E) is the price of a stock divided by its earnings per share. Sometimes called the multiple, P/E gives investors an idea of how much they are paying for a company’s earning power. The higher the P/E, the more investors are paying, and therefore the more earnings growth they are expecting. Price/book compares a stock's market value to the book value per share of total assets less total liabilities. This number is used to judge whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued. Earnings per share (EPS) growth is the weighted average of earnings per share growth for all securities in the portfolio projected for the past five fiscal years. Earnings per share for a company is defined as total earnings divided by shares outstanding. Weighted median market capitalization is the point at which half of the market value of a portfolio is invested in stocks with a greater market cap, and consequently the other half is invested in stocks with a lower market cap.
LTM = Last Twelve Months.

The index data displayed under allocations are calculated using MSIM and other third-party methodologies and may differ from data published by the vendor.
RISK/RETURN DEFINITIONS
Alpha is the excess return or value added (positive or negative) of the portfolio’s return relative to the return of the benchmark. Beta is a measure of the relative volatility of a security or portfolio to the market's upward or downward movements. A beta greater than 1.0 identifies an issue or fund that will move more than the market, while a beta less than 1.0 identifies an issue or fund that will move less than the market. The Beta of the Market is always equal to 1. Information ratio is the portfolio’s alpha or excess return per unit of risk, as measured by tracking error, versus the portfolio’s benchmark. R squared measures how well an investment’s returns correlate to an index. An R squared of 100 means the portfolio performance is 100% correlated to the index’s, whereas a low r-squared means that the portfolio performance is less correlated to the index’s. Sharpe ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated as the ratio of excess return to standard deviation. The Sharpe ratio determines reward per unit of risk. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the historical risk-adjusted performance. Standard deviation measures how widely individual performance returns, within a performance series, are dispersed from the average or mean value. Tracking error is the amount by which the performance of the portfolio differs from that of the benchmark.
RISK CONSIDERATIONS
 There is no assurance that a mutual fund will achieve its investment objective. Funds are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the fund will decline and that the value of fund shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this fund. Please be aware that this fund may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Concentrated investments in Europe are more susceptible to such risks affecting European issuers than a fund that holds more geographically diversified investments. Focused Investing. To the extent that the Fund invests in a limited number of issuers, the Fund will be more susceptible to negative events affecting those issuers and a decline in the value of a particular instrument may cause the Fund's overall value to decline to a greater degree than if the Fund were invested more widely.
Morningstar
 Rankings: The percentile rankings are based on the average annual total returns for the periods stated and do not include any sales charges, but do include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains and Rule 12b-1 fees. The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1.
Ratings: The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Ratings do not take into account sales loads.

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.

Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 97 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks to maximize the capital appreciation of its investments.




Strategy



The fund will normally invest at least 80% of its assets in equity securities issued by issuers located in European countries. European countries are defined as countries included in the MSCI Europe Index. The fund invests principally in common stocks and other equity securities. It may, but it is not required to, use derivative instruments for a variety of purposes, including hedging, risk management, portfolio management or to earn income.


Risk



Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets. These risks are particularly significant for funds that focus on a single country or region. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
MSCI Europe Index is a market capitalization-weighted index of equity securities of companies domiciled in various European countries. The Index is designed to represent the performance of developed stock markets in Europe and excludes certain market segments unavailable to U.S. based investors.
The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 07/28/1997.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 06/01/1990, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower. Except for Life of Fund returns, the analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 7/28/1997.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 6/1/1990, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 7/28/1997.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 6/1/1990, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
9. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
11. Expense Cap is a limit that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 5/1/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time.  After the expiration date, the expense cap may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.
12. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 5/1/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 97 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks to maximize the capital appreciation of its investments.




Strategy



The fund will normally invest at least 80% of its assets in equity securities issued by issuers located in European countries. European countries are defined as countries included in the MSCI Europe Index. The fund invests principally in common stocks and other equity securities. It may, but it is not required to, use derivative instruments for a variety of purposes, including hedging, risk management, portfolio management or to earn income.


Risk



Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets. These risks are particularly significant for funds that focus on a single country or region. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
MSCI Europe Index is a market capitalization-weighted index of equity securities of companies domiciled in various European countries. The Index is designed to represent the performance of developed stock markets in Europe and excludes certain market segments unavailable to U.S. based investors.
The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 07/28/1997.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 06/01/1990, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower. Except for Life of Fund returns, the analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 7/28/1997.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 6/1/1990, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 7/28/1997.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 6/1/1990, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
9. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
11. Expense Cap is a limit that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 5/1/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time.  After the expiration date, the expense cap may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.
12. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 5/1/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

WHAT IS CURRENCY HEDGING?


International investing provides many exciting opportunities to investors. But these opportunities come with additional risks—one of which is currency fluctuations. While currency can sometimes push equity returns higher, it can often pull returns down—and these fluctuations are typically a source of uncertainty.
 

Currency hedging is a strategy designed to mitigate the impact of currency or foreign exchange (FX) risk on international investments returns. Popular methods for hedging currency are forward contracts, spot contracts, and foreign currency options.
 
At WisdomTree, we have been implementing currency-hedging strategies for the last five years—in a way that is likely simpler and more cost-effective1 than many investors expect. The bottom line is that currency hedging allows investors to participate more fully in the local equity returns of international markets.


MECHANICS OF THE CURRENCY HEDGE


Here is how currency hedging typically works at WisdomTree:





 
The WisdomTree Currency Hedged Equity family of Funds implements WisdomTree’s currency-hedging strategies by entering into one-month forward contracts each month and rebalancing at month-end.

WHY HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCIES?
 
Investors allocating to foreign stocks typically assume a secondary risk exposure from currency. This risk is due to the difference between what the foreign currency is worth and what the dollar is worth. This “currency bet,” as some might call it, can help increase total returns during periods when the euro, yen and other foreign currencies are rising versus the dollar.

But it can also help reduce returns when those foreign currencies are falling in value. We believe that investors who do not have strong opinions on the potential direction of a currency should hedge at least a portion of their exposure in that currency.



When it comes to hedging foreign currencies, there are several myths out there. Let’s take a look at some of the most common.
 
MYTH #1


It is expensive to hedge foreign currencies.


Typically, it is only expensive to hedge foreign currencies that have much higher short-term interest rates than the United States, as is the case in Brazil, for example. However, the euro, yen and British pound—which combine to represent almost three-quarters of the weight of the MSCI EAFE Index (a widely followed benchmark composed of companies representative of the developed market structure of 21 developed countries in Europe, Australasia and Japan) —each has a very low cost to hedge, as figure 1 shows. In addition, as U.S. rates rise relative to rates in Europe and Japan, dollar-based investors could be paid to hedge euro and yen exposure. Put another way, it could become “expensive” for investors not to hedge their euro and yen exposure.

MYTH #2


Euro or yen exposure can be a good hedge against a declining U.S. dollar.


The values of the euro and yen, in essence, do not make good hedges against U.S. inflation rates or declining U.S. dollar purchasing power. What does make a potentially good hedge against inflation? We believe that stocks representing claims on real assets and/or those that have historically seen their dividends grow with inflation over time make better hedges against inflation. As figure 2 shows, dividend growth on the S&P 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index kept better pace with—and often outpaced—CPI in periods of high inflation, while currency returns did not.
 

 
MYTH #3


Currency returns are a wash in the long run.


One of the arguments we hear often is that, due to a concept called purchasing power parity (PPP), currencies offer no expected return in the long run and are therefore a wash. Yet currencies tend to move in very long secular trends. Interestingly, international equities actually saw their strongest returns during down currency trends (as shown in figures 3A and 3B). And when the currency is down, that can detract from the returns unless investors hedge their currency exposure.

STRATEGIC & TACTICAL HEDGING
 
The strength of the U.S. dollar relative to currencies like the euro or the yen can erode international returns if left unhedged. And some countries are pursuing monetary policies that may weaken the value of their currency.



Additionally, currency exposure can offer an added risk with little (or no) positive expected returns—something we’d call a source of “uncompensated risk.” Although this risk has long been seen as a “necessary evil” of international equity investing, it doesn’t have to be.

 
For investors with a negative outlook on a particular currency or more generally, those who believe that the dollar is going to strengthen, currency hedging is an important option, as it can enable them to pursue the international equity market returns without a drag from foreign currency weakness.
STRATEGIC HEDGING FOR THE LONG TERM
When investing for the long term, it may not make sense to simply accept the additional currency risk—unless investors have a deep conviction about the currency in question. In fact, as figure 4 shows, over the short and long term, currency adds a fair amount of volatility to investments. And over the long term shown below, hedging the currency would have lowered the volatility below that of the S&P 500.


TACTICAL HEDGING FOR SHORT-TERM ALLOCATIONS
Currency can make a big difference—even in the short term. In the Abenomics period starting November 30, 2012 and ending September 30, 2016, the MSCI Japan Index returned 44.4%—a decent return until it is compared to the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Index, which achieved a 61.7% return over the same timeframe! The difference? The WisdomTree Index hedges the yen, which lost 18.6% over the same period, while the MSCI index does not.



 
And there were similar results throughout Europe, where the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Index returned 16.1%, while the MSCI EMU Index lost 9.7% and the euro lost 18.2%.





 
WHY HEDGE DYNAMICALLY?
 
Historical data confirms that currency volatility can impact international investments over short- and long-term holding periods. While currency hedging has obvious advantages, some investors may not want the challenge of timing U.S. dollar strength or weakness. Building on our expertise in currency hedging, WisdomTree pioneered dynamic currency hedging, an adaptive strategy suited for long-term investors concerned about the impact of currency fluctuations on international equity holdings.
 
Problem Solving
 

Many leave it to their active manager to make the hedge/no hedge decision, but most of these managers typically specialize in stock selection, not currencies
Dynamic hedging  can solve the challenge of trying to "time" when a currency hedge should be in place and thus could serve as a core, long-run allocation 
Dynamic hedging may lower trading costs and increase tax efficiency when compared to a strategy that rotates between hedged and unhedged solutions

 
How Is It Achieved?
 

WisdomTree partnered with Record Currency Management, a currency manager with over 30 years of experience, to determine hedging signals for the new Index family1
Targeting Profitable Hedges: The strategy targets mid to long-term excess returns by seeking greater exposure to hedges with expected profitability versus hedges that are expected to generate losses
Diversification by Signal Time Horizon: Signals used to determine hedges (interest rates , value, momentum) have diversification in time horizon efficacy

EUROPE & INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY-HEDGED FUNDS

 
International investments should have a place in every portfolio, and now may be an opportune time to add them.
 

Of course, we believe that international equities tend to perform better when the U.S. dollar is strengthening—and if history repeats, we may be on the cusp of a prolonged period with a rising dollar. And if the dollar is rising, other currencies are often weakening. Hedging them can help to reduce volatility.



EUROPE HEDGED EQUITY FAMILY
 
The European Central Bank’s recent monetary easing policies have helped our Europe Hedged Equity family perform well. Not only are many of the world's leading companies—and familiar brands—headquartered in Europe, but these are truly global companies that generate the bulk of their revenue from exporting to countries outside Europe. Our family of European Hedged Equity Funds offers investors a way to more fully access the return potential of European equities while hedging the effects of the currencies.

JAPAN & KOREA CURRENCY-HEDGED FUNDS
 
Asian investments can be a smart addition to a portfolio. And now may be an opportune time to add Japan and Korea, as these countries are both undergoing exciting changes.
 

However, history has shown that in export-driven economies, the equities typically go up when the currency is going down. And this can erode investors’ returns. Hedging the yen and the won can help reduce volatility.

        Last year, one of the most important investment themes was currency hedging, particularly for euro-denominated stocks. Many investors believed the euro was going to weaken on the back of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank (ECB)—and that’s exactly what happened. Versus the U.S. dollar, the euro started 2015 at 1.21 and closed the year at 1.09. With such a big move, many investors are wondering if they missed the boat.    
From our perspective, to the contrary. The case to hedge the euro has gotten stronger by one very important measure: how much you are now being paid to hedge.  
 
An important element of currency-hedged strategies involves the use of forward contracts to neutralize currency exposure. The pricing of these forward contracts is based on relative interest rate   differentials. In some countries like Brazil, short-term interest rates are very high, so it can cost U.S. investors upward of 14% per year to hedge exposure to currencies like the Brazilian real. That creates an incredibly high hurdle for how much the currency has to decline before an investor breaks even on paying that hedge cost.  
 
But the actions the ECB took in December 2015 make hedging the euro different. The ECB took its deposit rate more negative—cutting rates to -30 basis points (bps). The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)   hiked interest rates for the first time in nine years and now has a band on its short-term rate of 25–50 bps; the midpoint of the range would be 37.5 bps. This means currency hedging is not only inexpensive—investors are actually getting paid to hedge the euro. And if/when the Fed increases rates in 2016, that “payment” will increase further.  
 
Historical Cost of Hedging the Euro (1-Month Currency Forward Implied Rates as of 12/31/15)

From a tactical perspective, when we look at what factors can help improve the returns from a purely passive hedging standpoint, interest rate differentials are the most powerful long-run signal. Given that an investor is starting to get paid more than 50 basis points a year from the differential in interest rates, this offers a boost to returns to hedged strategies over unhedged strategies, even if the euro does not move.  
Of course, if the euro appreciates, the hedged strategies will not participate in those gains, but they will be hedged against further losses in the euro if those were to occur.  
 
WisdomTree has three exchange-traded fund (ETF) options to target euro-area stocks with a currency hedge: 
 
1)	WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity ETF (HEDJ): Provides access to the dividend-paying exporters of Europe, which can be positioned to benefit from a decline in the euro with their goods becoming more competitively priced in the global markets. We believe these companies have not fully benefited from the fall in the euro yet, as many of them also have large amounts of business coming from the emerging markets, which have also been weak in the last year. This is our flagship ETF for euro-area-hedging strategies.  
 
2)	WisdomTree Europe Hedged SmallCap Equity ETF (EUSC): Provides access to small-cap companies of the euro area and offers exposure to a more local side of European stocks. This fund can pair nicely with the large-cap multinationals to diversify size exposure and geographic revenue mixes of the companies.  
 
3)	WisdomTree Dynamic Currency Hedged Europe Equity ETF (DDEZ): Provides access to a broad cross-section of dividend payers from the euro area and implies a dynamic currency hedge. For investors who do not want to rotate between hedged and unhedged strategies, but want to have some currency exposure when the environment is supportive of it, this fund can adapt and provide that type of tactical hedging solution.  
 

    




Important Risks Related to this Article
There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. These Funds focus their investments in Europe; the impact of events and developments associated with the region can adversely affect performance.
The securities of small-capitalization companies generally trade in lower volumes and are subject to greater and more unpredictable price changes than larger-capitalization stocks or the stock market as a whole. The Funds use various strategies to attempt to minimize the impact of changes in the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar, and these strategies may not be successful. 
DDEZ invests in derivatives in seeking to obtain a dynamic currency-hedge exposure. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. The Funds invest in the securities included in, or representative of, their Indexes regardless of their investment merit, and the Funds do not attempt to outperform their Indexes or take defensive positions in declining markets.  
Due to the investment strategy of these Funds, they may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs. Please read each Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding each Fund’s risk profile. 
Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment loss.  
Dividends are not guaranteed, and a company’s future ability to pay dividends may be limited. A company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
