Testimonials




"I think this is a great product (R8 RocknRoller Cart) and looks as though it's going to be a great solution for me, especially with the addition of the 2-tier multimedia shelf. The product itself (R8 Multicart) seems very solid and I look forward to putting it to the test."
Brian H.

Howie A.

"Hi There, Just wanted to recommend Shragy for his help in guiding me through the buying process in acquiring my Escalera motorized stair crawler handtruck . I thought I would have to wait at least a month till I got it but I received it 7 days later. Thanks!!"
Carl M.

The Anderson Dolly has made our job so easy. Now it only take 2 guys to move a larger Refrigration box inside a convenience store where it used to take 5 guys.
Michael Cancel
El Cajon, California

Tom Dullanty
Federal Way, Washington


"Just received the Convertible 2 to 4 wheel hand truck, I can't believe I waited so long to get it. It's a real life saver. I pushed it off for a long time cause I thought it would be like $500, but I found it on your site for less than $250 Including free delivery. The 1000 lb capacity is for real, as a matter of a fact I used it for 1200 pounds and it worked just fine too!" 
Samuel T.
Kansas City, Missouri


"This is a great AV cart! It holds everything while keeping us organized! Not to mention hiding things from sight! I ordered it and had it within 3 days.(H. Wilson Mobile Audio Visual cart with Storage)."
Denise F.
Bethsedea, Maryland


"I own a mom and pop shop where we sell all kinds of appliances. Buying the appliance trucks was always an ordeal that I did not look forward to. That is until I found you guys. Your sales rep Shragy was really helpful over the phone. He knew right away exactly what I wanted and gave me three options in different price ranges. In all my years that I have been shopping for these appliance hand trucks, this was by far my best experience ever!"
Harry R. 
Baltimore, MD


"I am a DJ and have been looking around for the longest time for the perfect musicians cart, particularly I wanted one that came standard with a solid deck so the wires wouldn't fall through the cracks. I was really glad when I located one on your site-The Wesco 270389 Platform Truck With 2 Folding Handles, it was the perfect solution at a great price. Been using it for 6 months now, and it is holding up real well. Thanks!"
Ian B.
Los Angeles, CA


"I started off looking for a used electric pallet jack, but then I came across Handtrucks2go.com. You guys knocked me off my feet with your prices! I was able to buy a new one for the same price as a used unit."
Robert H.
Cedar Rapids, Iowa


Love our PowerPallet convertor kit. The unit went on our manual jack easily and fairly quickly. The driver delivered 18 stops before the battery started showing yellow.
Randy Martin - Dutch Valley Foods
Allentown, Pennsylvania


"Ordered a small hand cart, it was delivered promptly and was easy to assemble; instructions called for 8 washers but only 6 were provided. When I called for more, the service was excellent and the washers came in a day or so. Hand truck seems solid - but pins holding handle tend to work their way loose - not a big problem, though."
William McCutcheon
Milwaukee, Wisconsin


"Was a little nervous at first to design my own custom utility cart, but your site made it pretty easy and clear. Was really happy that I was able to choose my own colors to coordinate with my business office."
Debra H.
Wilmington, Delaware


The guy on the other side of the phone line was very helpful and got me the correct stuff. The price was right and he was very friendly. customer service was outstanding!!!
Steve Baumgarten
McHenry, Illinois


"I own a snack food route. I needed a cart and shopped  for the best price. This site was lowest price AND FREE SHIPPING! The  cart was easy to assemble. I got a fold down front for double stacking  boxes. Works awesome. Thanks for a great product. (Magliner Snack Tuck)>"
John K.
Austin, Texas


Your updated Design Your Own Service Cart was exactly what I needed! I was able to color match the cart with the theme of my office and acually buy it online wthout having to fax in the order. I am pretty sure you are the first website offering this service, I definitely haven't seen it anywhere else. It made for a great shopping experience. I will be telling everyone in my office building about your amazing site.
Coleen J.
Jackson, Mississipi


Love our Glaro Bellman Cart. Feels ultra sturdy and looks real high class. Delay in shipping but customer service was great at getting factory to push cart for sooner delivery date.
ALBERT ROBINSON
Reno , Nevada


"I ordered a convertible hand truck from Handtrucks2go and it arrived just slightly damaged (but was totally usable).  When I called the customer service department they were really friendly and helpful. They gave me the choice of returning it and receiving a new one or to get a substantial discount (which is what I chose)." 
Kevin R.
Chicago, Illinois


"Received the furniture dollie in excellent condition.  Was moving items within 5  minutes of taking it out of the box.  Dollie is excellent for moving  large heavy items around and going in and out of doors and hallways..."
Bruce J.

"Really appreciated your patience in taking the time out to ensure I got the right Piano Dolly."
Bill H.

Anthony N.

"I have had this cart for two weeks and have used it carting 400lbs of  tile amoung othe items. It is well made and very easy to use, locks in  place with no fear of releasing from its position. No plastic parts  here. Needless to say I am very happy with this Wesco converible hand truck."
Bill Perine
Colorado Spring, CO


"Was an easy process to Build Your Own Magliner Hand Truck. I like being  able to customize my hand truck based on my needs.Was easy to  assemble.... Would recommend this site..."

Ben H.

Best deal on the market. Love the free shipping. Very little to put together. Definitely would recommend to anyone who needs a hand truck that is convertible.Corey BellLakeland, Florida
I can't thank handtrucks2go enough. EXCELLENT SERVICE AND GREAT PRICING!! You can't go wrong with handtrucks2go!!

"The rolling file cart dollie was extremely lightweight but still nice and durable. Just like you said it would be!"
Mary A.
Minneapolis, Minnesota


"I'm not sure this is the right place to give a review of your service for my recent order of grand piano dollies, but I wish to give an outstanding review of your service, your product, your staff member who took my order, and the delivery. Everything was as expected. I have a very high opinion of your products and service. Thanks so much!"
Mark Hurst - LBS Church
Salt Lake City, Utah


"I represented South Pasadena High School, California Tiger Bingo in the  purchase of two stack-able chair hand trucks from Handtrucks2GO.  I  received excellent service and the order clerk was very courteous.  I  would recommend Handtrucks2GO to anyone; and, hope to have the  opportunity to do business with them in the future."
Steve Stellar
South Pasadena, California


"We are always on the lookout to save money for our delivery business, especially in these tough economic times. One expense that we keep on coming across is the replacements of our fleet of Magliner hand trucks, and as hard as I looked I couldn't find any discount retailers. I was really happy when I finally found Handtrucks2go, they were way cheaper than anyone else, and their build your own hand truck option was especially useful."
George P.
New York City, NY


"Feels like very high quality, easy to operate, quality built – what more can I say? This is a great product and really increases productivity, prevents back injury and its easy rolling design protects even the most fragile items. Fantastic product! (Motorized Stair Climber With Winch Lift)."
Tom Bofferet
Downers Grove, Illinois 


"This is a very heavy duty sturdy hand truck the way I built it. It is rated  for 500 lbs and will do that w/o a problem. It is slightly heavier than a  traditional cart, but it can move 3 x's the weight. I got the 10 inch  balloon tires because on previous carts we have had air filled that are a  problem; always adding air if not checked frequently and don't hold as  much weight w/o failing. I would buy another one of these when I need  one."
Joe N.
Krout, Oregon 


"I used these to replace the inflatable wheels on my  Wesco Spartan Sr. The inflatable tires had worn out after light use in  just a few years.  So far, these solid rubber wheels appear likely to  last as long as the hand truck."
Ted Boggs
Raleigh , North Carolina


"Hey, Just got the Bell Man Carts matches the hotel decor perfectly! The customized logo is really cool and gives our lobby a real upscale feeling!"
Jim U.
Tulsa, Oklahoma


The Multi-Mover all terrain hand truck is amazing it greatly decreases the work load on the person moving the equipment.
Jake R.
Saint Paul, Minnesota


Easy to assemble.  Easy to adjust.  Solid frame.  Well built.  Will probably order another.
(Digital Piano Dolly)
Steve Johansson
Hainesport, New Jersey


"Easy to set up ! Very sturdy, just the right size for my car, carries a whole lot of weight."
Erica K.
Springfield, Massachusetts


"Looked around for a while for the rock n roller carts, but had a hard time finding it with the  new no flat tires. Could be that is what the other sites were selling too, but they did not make any clear mention of it. When I hit your site, I was real happy to see a nice big picture explaining that these were the ones with the updated flat-free wheels. The onpage accessories you offered was a plus, and made the shopping experience a real pleasure."
Mike H.
San Diego, California


"The Rough Terrain Dolly from Handtrucks2Go is by far a superior heavy duty dolly when compared to other dollies on the internet. By far you get what you pay for and this IS a heavy duty handtruck, that beats all other hand trucks on the Internet. I know because I use this dolly in my business all the time."
Frank Fuller
Las Vegas,  Nevada


Thanks on the great deal on the Magliner Beer Keg Lifter is a great tool for the brewery. It's a real back saver when loading kegs 3 high.
Todd Tisdell
Santa Clarita, California


Best deal on the market. Love the free shipping. Very little to put together. Definitely would recommend to anyone who needs a hand truck that is convertible. The Magliner senior does everything I need it to to get the job done. It is worth it's weight in gold. It is just compact enough to fit in my suv.
Corey Bell
Lakeland, Florida


Had a great shopping experience with handtrucks2go.com! The  "Rock-n-Roller R2 No Flat Wheels" is a wonderful cart for musicians.  Loads easily, breaks down & stores readily, drives like a dream. The  ties work well with the cart, and the cart is sturdy without being  heavy. Thanks so much!
Suze Scott
Sioux Falls, South Dakota


"Just got the Jansen all-terrain dolly yesterday, of all the different dollies that I was looking at this one was the perfect one for moving my piano across the rough surfaces. Those big tires really did the trick for me. Thanks for leading me to the right one. Best deal especially with the Free Shipping."
Tom W.
New Orleans, Louisiana


"We needed a new dolly that would stay under the piano and organs we  deliver while moving thru doorways and up a few steps, this Jansen Piano dolly does  the job perfectly. The rubber pads keep the dolly in place under the  item and the placement of the four wheels lets the dolly angle up onto  the step or over crack in the sidewalk. Great design! Yesterday we moved  a 1000lb 7ft Baldwin Grand with ease using our new Jansen Piano Dolly.  Also thanks for your fast service, the new dolly arrived in two just  days!!"
Jeff K.
Kirk, West Virginia


I can't believe how easy the Anderson Dolly makes moving appliances. We have 150 apartments that are very small. No more tilting and trying not to hit the walls and doors. One person moving made simple and fast.
Todd Hardy
Sterling Heights, Michigan


"Instead of leaving a lengthy testimonial, I"ll just quickly say that this is my third time ordering form Hand Trucks 2Go. Their prices on folding hand trucks are simply the best and the customer service is outstanding!"
 John B.
Omaha, Nebraska


"Thanks for informing me over the phone about the Build Your Own Wesco Hand Truck, I really needed the 600lb capacity that they offered. The selection process to build the hand truck could not have been easier."
Bruce W.

Development[edit]
Raymond Weil Genève first developed in Europe in the UK, before developing its distribution network worldwide, first starting with the United Arab Emirates and then the United States and India in the early 1980s.

The brand opened in 2009 its own subsidiary in the United States – RW USA Corp., thus ending its collaboration with its historic distributor. It also created RW India Pvt.

In September 2007 RAYMOND WEIL also became the first luxury watchmaker to create its island on Second Life. The Brand's presence on Second Life and other social media channels is part of a strategic choice to adopt new channels of communication so as to be closer to clients and convey the Brand's values.[31][32][33]

Development[edit]
Raymond Weil Genève first developed in Europe in the UK, before developing its distribution network worldwide, first starting with the United Arab Emirates and then the United States and India in the early 1980s. Olivier Bernheim created the Research and Development department in 1999 with the full control of the watch-design process as an objective. The R&D department is responsible for: the complication for the GMT function of the Don Giovanni Così Grande two time zones, the patented interchangeable bracelet system for the Shine collection, the moon phase complication on automatic movement of the Maestro collection.[25]
The brand opened in 2009 its own subsidiary in the United States – RW USA Corp., thus ending its collaboration with its historic distributor. It also created RW India Pvt.

The brand was also the first in the luxury watchmaking industry on location-based social media Foursquare and the first to use Fcommerce (Facebook commerce). In September 2007 RAYMOND WEIL also became the first luxury watchmaker to create its island on Second Life. The Brand's presence on Second Life and other social media channels is part of a strategic choice to adopt new channels of communication so as to be closer to clients and convey the Brand's values.[31][32][33]

Advertising[edit]




Freelancer 2710-st-20021 – Automatic open balance wheel – Steel on steel black dial 42mm


The brand marked its first association with the arts in 1983 when it launched its Amadeus advertising campaign in conjunction with Milos Foreman’s motion picture of the same name. From that moment, almost all collection names were to be music-inspired.[7]
In 1989, the brand shots its Eternity advertising campaign in Iceland and associated a new slogan to it: ‘When time is creation’. The campaign displayed watches through water, earth, wind and fire.[7]
The Precision Movements campaign shot in 1994 is probably one of the most popular as it was directed by John Booth and shot by acclaimed photographer Lois Greenfield. It portrayed dancers in mid-air symbolising the essence of the campaign. This campaign was awarded the 1995 London International Advertising Award. It consolidated RAYMOND WEIL's image as a Brand committed to the arts.[7][35]
The Celebrate the Moment advertising campaign is launched in 1998 and emphasised Raymond Weil Genève’s attachment to music, art and culture.
The Time to Celebrate campaign was launched in 2003. It focused on the timepieces and placed them against black backgrounds and hard shadows.
2005 saw the partnership between Raymond Weil Genève and actress Charlize Theron who became the ambassador of the brand for a few months.
The new Nabucco campaign and slogan Independence is a State of Mind were released in 2007. The campaign reveals the determination of the Nabucco man in his choice of independence and freedom.
Precision is my inspiration (2011) depicts a man and a woman in a rich musical universe. It was shot at the Victoria Hall in Geneva. The brand abandoned its Independence is a State of Mind slogan in favour of a new one: Precision is My Inspiration.[36][37][38][39][40]
In 2013, a corporate film of the same name was launched in conjunction with a dedicated microsite to advertise the brand’s attachment to music. The film draws a parallel between the creation of a watch and that of a musical piece. The microsite received several awards.[41][42]
Charity actions[edit]
Fight against cancer : the brand has been involved with several charities – mainly charities fighting against cancer, and has taken part and organised several online sales of limited edition timepieces to support them over the years. Charities that benefited from these donations include the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), Komen for the Cure, the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, the Singapore Cancer Society and the Onco-hematology unit of the Geneva University Hospital (HUG).[43][44][45][46][47][48]
The Onco-hematology unit of the Geneva University Hospital (HUG) : Additional actions to the online sale were undertaken to support the Onco-hematology unit of the Geneva University Hospital. In conjunction with the 2012 BASELWORLD fair, Raymond Weil Genève put up for sale on its Facebook page a Maestro watch limited to 5 pieces and engraved with the mention “maestro Mouvement d’Espoir – Edition Spéciale 2012”. The proceeds from the sale were doubled by Raymond Weil Genève and donated to the Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Unit of Geneva University Hospital.[49]
VH1 Save The Music Foundation  : Raymond Weil Genève started collaborating in 2011 with VH1 Save The Music Foundation, a charity working to restore music education programs in the United States of America. This collaboration started with an application on the brand’s official Facebook page in 2011. Fans could click a button to add 1 dollar to a counter. The counter was updated with each new click of the button to display the amount of the donation Raymond Weil Genève would make to the charity. The Swiss watchmaker also partnered with Elle Women in Music organised by VH1 Save The Music Foundation, and auctioned a watch signed by celebrities (including Jessie J, Ellie Goulding, Nicole Scherzinger and Oh Land) on the occasion of the Elle Women in Music event in Hollywood in April 2012. The proceeds from this auction sale were donated to VH1 Save The Music Foundation.[50][51][52][53][54][55]

The brand marked its first association with the arts in 1983 when it launched its Amadeus advertising campaign in conjunction with Milos Foreman’s motion picture of the same name. From that moment, almost all collection names were to be music-inspired.[7]
In 1989, the brand shots its Eternity advertising campaign in Iceland and associated a new slogan to it: ‘When time is creation’. The campaign displayed watches through water, earth, wind and fire.[7]
The Precision Movements campaign shot in 1994 is probably one of the most popular as it was directed by John Booth and shot by acclaimed photographer Lois Greenfield. It portrayed dancers in mid-air symbolising the essence of the campaign. This campaign was awarded the 1995 London International Advertising Award. It consolidated RAYMOND WEIL's image as a Brand committed to the arts.[7][35]
The Celebrate the Moment advertising campaign is launched in 1998 and emphasised Raymond Weil Genève’s attachment to music, art and culture.
The Time to Celebrate campaign was launched in 2003. It focused on the timepieces and placed them against black backgrounds and hard shadows.
2005 saw the partnership between Raymond Weil Genève and actress Charlize Theron who became the ambassador of the brand for a few months.
The new Nabucco campaign and slogan Independence is a State of Mind were released in 2007. The campaign reveals the determination of the Nabucco man in his choice of independence and freedom.
Precision is my inspiration (2011) depicts a man and a woman in a rich musical universe. It was shot at the Victoria Hall in Geneva. The brand abandoned its Independence is a State of Mind slogan in favour of a new one: Precision is My Inspiration.[36][37][38][39][40]
In 2013, a corporate film of the same name was launched in conjunction with a dedicated microsite to advertise the brand’s attachment to music. The film draws a parallel between the creation of a watch and that of a musical piece. The microsite received several awards.[41][42]
Charity actions[edit]

This collaboration started with an application on the brand’s official Facebook page in 2011. Fans could click a button to add 1 dollar to a counter. The counter was updated with each new click of the button to display the amount of the donation Raymond Weil Genève would make to the charity. The Swiss watchmaker also partnered with Elle Women in Music organised by VH1 Save The Music Foundation, and auctioned a watch signed by celebrities (including Jessie J, Ellie Goulding, Nicole Scherzinger and Oh Land) on the occasion of the Elle Women in Music event in Hollywood in April 2012.

Development[edit]
Raymond Weil Genève first developed in Europe in the UK, before developing its distribution network worldwide, first starting with the United Arab Emirates and then the United States and India in the early 1980s.

The Brand's presence on Second Life and other social media channels is part of a strategic choice to adopt new channels of communication so as to be closer to clients and convey the Brand's values.[31][32][33]

Raymond Weil occupied several high positions in various professional organisations: he was President of the Geneva Watchmaker Union, Vice-President of the Watchmaking Industry Training Centre (CFH), and member of the Watchmaking Federation (FH) and other employers’ associations. Until 1995, he was also President of the Exhibitors Committee of the Basel International Watch and Jewellery Fair.

His mission was to restructure, develop and consolidate the image and international presence of the brand, without it losing its family identity. Olivier Bernheim shares Mr Weil's interest in music and art and has oriented the brand universe in that direction. He founded the research and development department in 1999.
Olivier Bernheim is both Swiss and French and is married to Mr Weil’s elder daughter Diana, a professional pianist. They have three children together: Elie, Pierre and Noémi.[31]
Elie Bernheim (CEO) is Olivier Bernheim’s elder son. After graduating from the prestigious Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne and creating his own import-export textile company, Elie joined the family company in 2006. His mission is to plan the brand’s strategic development. Just like his father and grandfather, he enjoys music and owns a professional diploma in cello. Among his various projects and developments, one can count the renewal of the collections, change of Raymond Weil Genève’s corporate identity, creation of new male and female advertising campaigns with famous Swiss photographer Joël von Allmen and the Nabucco advertising.[31] Ellie Bernheim became CEO of the company in April 2014.[21][22]
Pierre Bernheim (Director) is Mr Weil’s grandson and the second son of Olivier Bernheim and joined the company in 2006. Already graduated in accounts, Pierre graduated in International Business and Administration from La Haute Ecole de Gestion in Geneva. Interested in finance, he worked in Institutional Asset Management for Mirabaud Bank, one of the most famous Swiss private banks. He is passionate about aviation and owns several flying certificates: a flying licence, a high aerobatic flying licence and a seaplane licence.[24][31]

In 1989, the brand shots its Eternity advertising campaign in Iceland and associated a new slogan to it: ‘When time is creation’. The campaign displayed watches through water, earth, wind and fire.[7]
The Precision Movements campaign shot in 1994 is probably one of the most popular as it was directed by John Booth and shot by acclaimed photographer Lois Greenfield.

It consolidated RAYMOND WEIL's image as a Brand committed to the arts.[7][35]

Dr. Raymond Sackler, a pioneer in psychopharmacology, a medicinal products entrepreneur and a leading philanthropist whose family made a fortune from the opioid painkiller OxyContin, died on Monday in Greenwich, Conn. He was 97.His death was confirmed by his wife, Beverly.Dr. Sackler was the last survivor among three brothers — all psychiatrist sons of Brooklyn grocers — whose scientific and marketing skills transformed a tiny Greenwich Village company founded in the 19th century into a global pharmaceutical giant known as Purdue Pharma, now headquartered in Stamford, Conn.Last year, the Sacklers were ranked 19th among “America’s richest families” by Forbes magazine, with assets estimated at $18 billion.They were major benefactors who helped finance the Sackler Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (home to the Temple of Dendur), the Freer and Sackler Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, British cultural institutions, schools in Israel and scores of scientific, academic and cultural programs.

In 1971, one of thousands of minor planets discovered by the Palomar-Leiden Survey, an American and Dutch joint effort, was named for Beverly and Raymond Sackler to celebrate their commitment to astronomical research. Dr. Sackler was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1995 for his contributions to science and the arts. Continue reading the main story

Raymond was the middle brother and was regarded as the most retiring. Arthur, the eldest, died in 1987, Mortimer in 2010.“Raymond was a tremendous supporter of basic science and of young people doing research in basic science,” Dr. Phillip A. Sharp, a Nobel Prize-winning professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an email. “His main interest was the intersection of mathematical, engineering and physical sciences with biomedical science” — an emerging field known as convergence science.OxyContin, introduced in 1995, was Purdue Pharma’s breakthrough palliative for chronic pain. Under a marketing strategy that Arthur Sackler had pioneered decades earlier, the company aggressively pressed doctors to prescribe the drug, wooing them with free trips to pain-management seminars and paid speaking engagements. Sales soared.By 2001, prescriptions for OxyContin were generating more than $1.5 billion a year — surpassing sales of Viagra — and accounted for some 80 percent of the company’s revenue.OxyContin, made with a synthetic version of morphine, was said to be nonaddictive because in the form of long-acting tablets, it released its active ingredient slowly.But the time-release effect could be defeated by crushing the tablets and snorting the powder, or by smoking it, or by adding water and injecting it — all for an immediate, sometimes heroinlike, high.Federal regulators accused Purdue Pharma of misleading consumers when it asserted that OxyContin was less likely than traditional narcotics to be abused.

In 2007, the company agreed to pay $600 million to resolve the federal charges, although its executives insisted that they had adequately informed doctors and consumers about the potential for drug abuse and had responded quickly to reports of overdose deaths.They also said they had contributed to independent research on pain to guard against rampant overprescribing.

“During the past six years, we have implemented changes to our internal training, compliance and monitoring systems that seek to assure that similar events do not occur again,” the company said at the time of the settlement.Several company officials pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of misbranding and were fined more than $34 million. The Sacklers personally were never formally accused of wrongdoing.Raymond Raphael Sackler was born on Feb. 16, 1920, in Brooklyn to Isaac Sackler and the former Sophie Ziesel, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who ran a grocery store.After graduating from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, he earned a bachelor of science degree from New York University in 1938.At a time when medical schools in New York imposed quotas on the number of Jewish students they would admit, Raymond Sackler pursued his medical degree at Anderson College of Medicine in Glasgow, where he also joined the British Home Guard and served as a plane spotter during World War II. He graduated from Middlesex University Medical School in Waltham, Mass. (It closed later in the 1940s.)In 1944, Dr. Sackler married the former Beverly Feldman, who survives him. Survivors also include their two sons, Richard and Jonathan.The brothers founded the Creedmoor Institute of Psychobiological Studies at the state hospital in Queens Village, N.Y. (Raymond and Mortimer, who were studying skin burns for the Atomic Energy Commission there, were dismissed in 1953 when they refused to sign an Army loyalty oath requiring them to report participants who engaged in conversations deemed subversive.)

Early on, the three brothers “helped pioneer research of the biology of psychiatric illnesses,” BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal) wrote in 2011, “research that helped open the door decades later toward drug treatments.”It was Arthur Sackler, a trailblazer in medical advertising, who financed the purchase of a small Greenwich Village drug manufacturer, the Purdue Frederick Company, in 1952, according to the book “Pain Killer: A ‘Wonder’ Drug’s Trail of Addiction and Death” (2003), by Barry Meier, a reporter for The New York Times. Raymond and Mortimer became co-chairmen.The company’s products included an ear wax remover, a laxative, a “metabolic cerebral tonic” called Gray’s Glycerine (its formula was 11 percent alcohol) and the antiseptic Betadine, the familiar orange disinfectant smeared on patients’ skin before surgery. (In 1969, the astronaut Neil Armstrong decontaminated the Apollo landing module with Betadine after his moon walk.)The company began experimenting with generic oxycodone, which was invented in Germany during World War I, to create a time-release formula that would spread the analgesic narcotic’s effects over 12 hours and, among other things, allow pain sufferers to sleep through the night.Before developing OxyContin, the company, in 1984, created MS Contin, an extended-release, morphine-based drug to relieve cancer pain.The Sacklers were benefactors of, among other institutions, the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts University, the Mortimer and Raymond Sackler Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Tel Aviv, the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Gallery for Assyrian Art at the Metropolitan Museum, Leiden University in the Netherlands, Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, the British Museum, and the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Medical Research Center at the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine.
