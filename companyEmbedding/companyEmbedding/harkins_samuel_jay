(  OTCQB :  ESDI ), a producer of award-winning master-crafted spirits, has elected Michael M. Fleming (Mick), Trent D. Davis, Lawrence Hirson and Samuel Jay Harkins (Jay) to its board of directors. Martin Kunkel and Eastside co-founder Lenny Gotter have retired from the board.Mr. Kunkel will continue to serve as the company's chief marketing officer and Mr. Gotter will serve in a consultative role. Following these changes, the Eastside board is now comprised of six directors, of which four are "independent" as defined by NASDAQ and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules."We welcome the addition of these four outstanding new board members," said Eastside president and CEO, Steven Earles. "Collectively, these new directors contribute valuable experience, knowledge and expertise in business development and the capital markets as well as with the spirits industry, which we believe will support our efforts to grow Eastside into a significant national supplier of craft spirits."Eastside's chairman of the board, Grover Wickersham, said "I would like to first thank Steven Earles for his leadership in strengthening the Eastside board which prepares the company for growth both as a business and as a public company. This shows great vision on his part. I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of Lenny Gotter, co-founder of Eastside, who is leaving the board, but will remain as a consultant.""In our view," Mr. Wickersham continued, "having the majority of our board be independent directors, especially directors who, in this case, are mostly also shareholders themselves, is a 'best practice' from a corporate governance perspective. Adding this strong group of directors and establishing a majority of independent directors satisfies Nasdaq's corporate governance requirements. This is an important first step towards achieving our goal to 'uplist' our common stock to a national securities market, such as Nasdaq, in the future. Eastside is already a fully compliant SEC reporting company and strengthening our board represents another positive step towards our goal of increasing value for our shareholders."For additional information, please refer to the company's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on the SEC website on each of September 6, 2016 and September 14, 2016. These Reports can also be accessed in the Investor Relations section of the company's website (www.eastsidedistilling.com).Michael M.
