July 23--HIGH POINT -- The financial institution that acquired Bank of North Carolina last month has been on a rapid growth trajectory that is based on taking market share from larger peers.
Pinnacle Financial Partners President and CEO Terry Turner said the Nashville, Tennessee-based bank increased the amount of loans on its books by $668 million during the second quarter, which ended June 30.
The footprint of High Point-based BNC accounted for $190 million of the increase.
In addition, rising interest rates, which allow banks to charge borrowers more when they take out loans, helped drive up profits.
Pinnacle reported that its income for the quarter solely from interest on its loans was $106.6 million, compared to $88.8 million for the first quarter of 2017.
"The principle thing we do is try to hire the best bankers in these markets," Turner said in an interview last week while in High Point for an orientation session with BNC employees making the transition to Pinnacle.
"Many of the folks we hire work in these large regional banks or national banks, and I guess that experience is generally not great," he said. "If you're in one of these big companies, it's hard to know what's going on. The decision-makers are remote, and it's a slow, bureaucratic process. So, if you're a client-facing person who loves looking after clients, that's a big irritant to you."
Pinnacle is hiring in its new territory: the Carolinas and Virginia, which are the markets where BNC has had a presence.
"We try to hire based on the appeal of being in a less bureaucratic organization where you're freed up to make a $10 million loan decision," said Turner.
The types of positions Pinnacle has been filling provides insight into how banks make money.
"Our term is 'revenue producers,'" said Turner. "That includes relationship managers. Some call those lenders. To us, it means looking after all of the client relationship. You've also got mortgage originators, securities brokers, investment brokers, insurance agents, trust administrators -- people that are able to manage client relations."
Net gains from the sale of residential mortgage loans were $4.7 million last quarter.
"We're retaining all of BNC's mortgage originators and I think we'll continue to hire more," said Turner.
HPB Insurance on E. Hartley Drive will retain its name and continue operating as a separate agency, he said.
Insurance services were part of the $6.2 million in Pinnacle's wealth management revenue for the quarter, which is also comprised of trust and investment businesses.
Turner said the bank does not have its own securities trading floor, but has a partnership with financial services firm Raymond James.
"Our brokers are dual employees of Raymond James and Pinnacle," he said. "We've got $2.5 billion in brokerage assets, which are separate from $21 billion in bank assets."
Pinnacle is still sorting out how many BNC employees will work in the newly merged bank. So far, the decision has been made to house a call center in the HPB Insurance building instead of shifting it to Tennessee as originally planned.
"Whatever the impact is in the short-run, our belief is, we'll continue to hire a lot more client-facing people and maybe less back-office support," said Turner.
Pinnacle and BNC leaders have pledged that BNC customers won't have to change their account numbers because Pinnacle is converting to BNC's software system.
"We really felt like it was an important thing to do," said Turner. "There's so much change going on here, with BNC having acquired lots of companies. So the idea was, we hate to overburden BNC clients here."

Of course we have standard products and services, but we don't sacrifice your individuality for standardization. We hear you out. We help sort out what's best for your specific situation and will even build something new to fit your needs.

Services that go beyond online and mobile banking
Protect Yourself from Cyber Criminals. Pinnacle has teamed with IBM to offer Trusteer Rapport—a service delivers an extra layer of protection so cyber criminals can’t access your login information. Learn more at www.pnfp.com/trusteer.
Manage your debit card. CardValet™ offers real-time control over your debit card from your smartphone. Turn it off if you’ve misplaced it, set spending limits or get alerts when the card is used. Learn more at www.pnfp.com/cardvalet or search CardValet™ in your app store.
Mobile PFM. If you already use PFM in our online banking system, you can download the MoneyMobile App from Money Desktop and sync all your budgets, transactions and goals to your mobile or tablet device.  



Online Banking
At Pinnacle, we see convenience as an integral part of distinctive service. We are committed to offering efficient, effective and secure ways of delivering your financial information. Below are just a few ways we make your life more convenient.
Real-time. Any time. Your financial records are up-to-date 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Check balances, review account activity and see pending transactions from anywhere.
Manage your bills. Not only can you pay virtually any business or individual with our free online bill pay services – but you can also view history, set up auto payments and receive email reminders when a bill is due. We also offer same-day or overnight payment capabilities for a nominal fee. Read answers to frequently asked questions about expedited payments here.
Pay other people. With Popmoney, you can easily pay individuals using only their email address or mobile phone number for a small fee. Read answers to frequently asked questions about Popmoney here.
View history. We offer up to 24 months of account history starting once you enroll in online banking. You can research transactions and produce reports based on criteria such as check number, date or amount.
View and print check images. You'll see the front and back of your cleared checks online.
Transfer funds. Set up a one-time transfer or have it happen every week – it's up to you.
Stay alert. Track your account balances and transactions with a variety of email alerts. Need to know if your balance is low, when a large check has cleared or if your pay has been deposited? We'll send you an email.
Go paperless. Sign up for eStatements on all your accounts. We'll send you an email when your statement is available.
Pinnacle recommends that you use the latest 128-bit encrypted browsers for increased security:
     



Mobile Banking
Access your accounts anytime, anywhere with Pinnacle’s free and secure mobile banking services.

Text. Web. App. Once enrolled, you can text us using these quick texts, visit www.pnfp.com/mobile to access a streamlined version of online banking or download our Android/iPhone apps.
Mange your finances. Check your current account balance and search recent transactions by date, amount or check number. Easily transfer cash between your accounts.
Pay your bills. Make payments and view recent scheduled payments with online BillPay for mobile devices.
We also have a custom iPad application that allow you much of the same functionality you get in online banking in an app built specifically for the iPad, making your experience more user-friendly on your tablet.
Still have questions? View our FAQ. 

NOTE: Pinnacle offers mobile banking as a free service. Your wireless provider may charge for data usage. Please consult with your provider to determine what these charges will be. The "Enroll Now" and "Demo" buttons below are for Pinnacle's online banking service, not for mobile banking.





Make Payments
Our free BillPay services allow you to schedule one-time, occasional or recurring payments. With our service you can:
Pay virtually any bill – from your cable to the guy who mows your lawn – in one easy, secure location. 
Never be late again. Enter the date your bill is due and we'll make sure it gets there on time. We'll debit your account on the due date. You can even set up bill reminders and payment confirmations that are emailed to you.
Expedite payments. When needed, you can also make same-day payments or send overnight checks for a nominal fee to ensure bills are paid on time.
Pay other people. In the "Popmoney" tab, you can pay individuals using only their email address or mobile phone number for a small fee.
Go paperless. Sign up for e-Bills on many services – such as Comcast Cable – so you can receive the bill directly in online banking. 



Personal Financial Manager (PFM)
With PFM, you can track all of your accounts--savings, checking, mortgage, investments and even those outside of Pinnacle--in one place. We even offer a MoneyMobile app so you can see everything from your phone or tablet. 

PFM is fully integrated into Pinnacle's Online Banking, so you know your information is secure.
It's easy to enroll--just log into Online Banking, click the "PFM" tab and follow the steps to get started. If you are not an online banking user, you can find a demo and enrollment instructions below.
To begin using the MoneyMobile capabilities, download the MoneyMobile app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play store. The app will prompt you to get an activation code within PFM. Simply click the setting icon, go to the Mobile Devices tab and generate an access code.   



Security
From account information to personal data, the internet has become a key place for criminals to get information. The good news is there are simple ways you can safeguard your online accounts and personal computers. See our online library of resources on how to protect yourself from fraud. Pinnacle's online banking program carries several levels of security.
Secure connection. Your data is scrambled as it travels from our computer to your computer. All online banking pages use the highest standard of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption available to prevent thieves from accessing your banking data.
Password protected. The importance of picking a good, secure password can't be emphasized enough. The objective when creating a password is to make it as difficult as possible for anyone to make an educated guess about what you have selected. Here are some tips for creating a strong password:

Make it lengthy. Each character you add increases the protection.
Combine letters, numbers and symbols. The greater variety of characters you have, the harder it is to guess.
Avoid sequences or repeated characters. 12345678, 222222, abcdefg, or adjacent letters on your keyboard.

Security questions. We'll recognize the computers you use frequently. If we don't recognize the computer trying to access your accounts – say you've logged in from work or removed cookies from your existing web browser – we'll require a correct answer to your challenge questions before allowing access.
Advance features. Finally, the online banking site is protected by the most advanced firewalls and monitoring tools available on the market today. All of these features make online banking secure and safe.
Added security with Trusteer
We have teamed up with IBM to offer Trusteer Rapport—a leading provider of online fraud protection software. Trusteer Rapport "hardens" your browser and delivers an extra layer of security while you are signed into our site so cyber criminals can't read the pieces of information you type when you log in. Click here to download.

Associate Q & A
Pinnacle/Mid-America Announcement
August 15, 2007

Below are questions and answers addressing many of the issues that are no doubt important to
you. The first eight generally apply to both Pinnacle and Mid-America associates, questions 9-18
are primarily focused on issues for Pinnacle associates and questions 19-32 are primarily focused
on issues impacting Mid-America associates.

All Associates

1) What is the rationale for combining the two firms?




A.
 
There are 2 primary reasons to combine our two firms.






 
1.
 
The merger should create immediate value as well as significant long-term upside for
shareholders, clients and associates of both firms.



For Shareholders:



 

 
The transaction will be accretive to Pinnacles earnings per share in the
first 12 months of operation.


 

 

 
The potential income synergies are dramatic given that Mid-America is the
holding company of PrimeTrust Bank and Bank of the South, which have not yet
consolidated operations following Mid-Americas formation in 2006. In most mergers,
many synergies exist as a result of combining two operations into one. In this case,
Pinnacle has the opportunity to combine three operations into one, thereby eliminating
greater operational expenses than normal.


 

 

 
In addition to the increased market capitalization, the combined firm is
expected to experience increased public float and liquidity for the combined companys shares.



For Clients:



 

 
Clients will benefit from an expanded service delivery system and an
expanded portfolio of products and services.






 
>
 
All clients will benefit from a substantially expanded office
distribution system. Most of our 30 combined offices will be some of the most
modern and up-to-date offices located in the most attractive trade areas of Middle
Tennessee.


 

 
>
 
The combination also substantially increases our capacity to make larger
loans and better serve our larger borrowers.


 

 
>
 
PrimeTrust and Bank of the South clients will gain access to a more
robust suite of treasury management products, insurance, trust and financial
planning services.



 



 




For Pinnacle and Mid-America Bank Associates Only
DO NOT DUPLICATE OR DISTRIBUTE


For Associates:



 

 
All of PrimeTrust and Bank of the Souths non-commissioned paid associates
that are retained by Pinnacle will ultimately participate in Pinnacles annual and
long-term incentive plans, key drivers of the strong teamwork that has led to
Pinnacles rapid growth and success. During 2008, all of Mid-Americas associates will
be on a separate compensation plan to encourage retention and will ultimately migrate
to the standard Pinnacle compensation plans in 2009. Most PrimeTrust and Bank of the
South associates should be eligible to earn greater total compensation under Pinnacles
compensation plan than their current cash compensation plans.


 

 

 
As Pinnacle did in its recent merger with Cavalry, Pinnacle will attempt
to fill many of the new positions in its 2008 growth plan with Mid-America associates.
This should minimize the number of associates that will be eliminated.






 
2.
 
The combined institution will have a very strong footprint in many of the best markets
for financial services in Middle Tennessee.






 

 
Mid-America currently operates two banks: PrimeTrust and Bank of the
South. Both banks names and identity will be changed to Pinnacle Financial Partners
when a common systems platform is in place (projected as non-simultaneous conversions
in January and February of 2008).


 

 

 
With nearly $4 billion in assets projected at closing, Pinnacle will be
the 2nd largest bank holding company headquartered in Tennessee and have the
fourth largest market share in the Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro MSA (only behind
Regions, SunTrust and Bank of America and ahead of First Tennessee, Fifth Third and US
Bank).


 

 

 
PrimeTrust locations in Green Hills and Bellevue enhance our already
strong position in Davidson county, the MSAs core county. Additionally, PrimeTrusts
Brentwood, Cool Springs and Franklin locations enhance our position in Williamson
County, one of the fastest growing and wealthiest counties in the nation.


 

 

 
Bank of the Souths client base in Smyrna and Murfreesboro enhance our
number one position in Rutherford county, one of the fastest growing counties in the
nation.


 

 

 
Wilson, Cheatham and Dickson counties are all high-growth counties, well
above the state and national averages. Wilson County has the second highest average
household income in Tennessee. This merger gives Pinnacle a number two market
share position in both Wilson and Cheatham counties.



2) How will the firms leadership be impacted by the merger?




A.
 
Three Mid-America board members will become directors of Pinnacles board. Key
Mid-America leadership will have roles at Pinnacle Financial Partners:






 

 
Gary Scott will be Pinnacles area chairman and will retain broad
oversight responsibilities for Dickson, Cheatham and part of Williamson counties.


 

 

 
David Major will be Pinnacles area chairman and will retain broad
oversight responsibilities for Wilson County.


 
Jason West, president and COO of PrimeTrust Bank, will become Pinnacles
area executive for Dickson, Cheatham and part of Williamson County and a member of
Pinnacles Leadership Team.


 

 

 
Sam Short, president and COO of Bank of the South, will become Pinnacles
area executive for Wilson County and a member of Pinnacles Leadership Team.



(See the attached organization chart.)
3) Will there be any office closures?




A.
 
Yes. While we will continue to analyze, initial plans are to close three offices. Given
the extremely close proximity of locations in Franklin, Smyrna and Murfreesboro, we currently
plan to close the following offices:






 

 
PrimeTrusts Franklin Office on Highway 96 near Royal Oaks Boulevard


 

 

 
Bank of the Souths Office in Smyrna on 69 S. Lowry Street


 

 

 
Bank of the Souths Office in Murfreesboro on 802 Memorial Boulevard



In general, office closures are anticipated during the second quarter of 2008. The current
teams at the Mid-America branch locations are expected to remain in place after the merger
except for the three offices being consolidated. Those associates will have the opportunity to
move to nearby Pinnacle offices in order to continue serving their clients.
4) Will we convert Mid-Americas operations to Pinnacles systems?




A.
 
Yes. We will run one integrated operating environment for the
entire firm. ITI-Fiserv, Pinnacles core banking platform (e.g.
deposit and loan systems) will best serve the combined firms
needs. Consequently, we intend to convert Mid-Americas accounts
to that platform.


 

 
 
Mid-America has not yet had the opportunity to consolidate
the operations of PrimeTrust and Bank of the South. Of note, they
were planning a system conversion for all of their clients in 2007
and ITI-Fiserv was on the short list of potential software
solutions.


 

 
 
Fortunately, both PrimeTrust and Bank of the South are currently being processed on other Fiserv
systems. With all three institutions utilizing products from the same technology provider, the
likelihood of a timely and accurate conversion should be improved.



5) Will Mid-America have the same credit discipline Pinnacle has?




A.
 
Yes.

Both PrimeTrust and Bank of the Souths credit experience has been exceptional versus any
benchmarks. Net charge off comparisons between Mid-America and Pinnacle are listed below as of
June 30, 2007:

Because of Mid-Americas strong commitment to credit quality, we expect the integration of the
two credit cultures to be relatively smooth. Undoubtedly, the process of converting to one
operating standard will require some changes for PrimeTrust and Bank of the Souths associates.
Examples of changes that will be required for PrimeTrust and Bank of the Souths associates
include adopting Pinnacles signature approval system (i.e., no credit committee), file
documentation standards, credit authorization forms, cash flow calculations, loan grading
system, etc. These sorts of process changes are required in virtually any merger. Importantly,
PrimeTrust and Bank of the Souths lenders should experience no slow down in credit decisions
and are likely to experience some improvement.
In
general, we will continue Pinnacles approach to loan approval,
the basic tenets of which are:



 

 
Signature system (personal accountabilities; no credit committee)


 

 

 
Limited individual authorities


 

 

 
An ability to get relatively large deals done quickly with local market lenders


 

 

 
Additional credit administration signature approval on larger deals


 

 

 
Speedy response to clients with up to 30 days to finalize credit documentation after
the approval



6) How will Mid-America fit into Pinnacles organizational structure?




A.
 
See the attached organization chart.






7)
 
What does this merger do to the Pinnacle model of hiring only experienced bankers and
brokers and focusing on small businesses and their owners?






A.
 
We are not aware of any other financial institution that has utilized the philosophy of
hiring only people with at least 10 years of financial services experience in the local
market. Nevertheless, while less formal, both PrimeTrust and Bank of the South have focused
primarily on extremely experienced bankers with large client followings. As you know, this is
an integral part of Pinnacles approach to giving distinctive service and effective advice.
Experienced associates are best prepared to deliver on those two promises. This philosophy has
also contributed to the fact that the average bank our size has substantially more people
per million dollars in assets.

We continued this approach during the Cavalry merger. No one employed by Cavalry with less than
10 years experience was negatively impacted; however, all new hires now meet the Pinnacle
experience criteria. This approach has resulted in improving the associate retention rate in the
former Cavalry footprint from 66% to 85% over the last year, and we believe it will ultimately
enable us to hit our targeted associate retention rate of 95%. Given its proven success, we will
generally want to continue this philosophy going forward for future hiring, but with no impact
to any Mid-America associates who do not yet have at least 10 years of experience.
8) How much internal focus will integration require?




A.
 
This is an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate growth, capabilities and the earnings
capacity of the combined firm.


 

 
 
Hugh Queener, who has led a number of integrations larger in scope than this one, will lead an implementation
team in the complete planning and execution of this project. He will be naming a cross-functional group of Pinnacle
associates to participate on that team.


 

 
 
Hugh will work with Mid-America leadership to select additional team members from Mid-America to participate on
the team based on expertise and need.


 

 
 
While this will be a monumental undertaking for our operating staff, it is expected to have only modest impact
on our client contact associates, enabling the continued rapid growth of our companies.



Pinnacle Associates




9)
 
How will this change our 2007-2009 strategic plan and positioning?


 

A.
 
Pinnacle is positioned as an urban-community bank, which simply means that we offer the sophisticated products and
advice typically available at large regional banks with the hands-on, friendly, personal service typically available
at a small community bank.


 

 
 
Pinnacles brand consists of two distinguishing impacts on clients:



1. Distinctive service
2. Effective advice
This transaction is not intended to modify either the urban-community bank positioning or the
service and advice brand that Pinnacle has established.
As you recall, from its inception, one of Pinnacles strategies was to focus the firm on small
businesses and affluent consumers. Our merger with Cavalry enabled us to broaden our focus to
include real estate professionals and all consumers that desire a deep relationship with
their bank. Our 2007-2009 plan contemplated a continuation of essentially the same five
strategies that we have been executing since we founded the firm in 2000, but with this broader
focus including mass market consumers and real estate professionals:



 
1.
 
Focus on small businesses, real estate professionals and consumers who desire a
deep relationship with their financial institution

For Pinnacle and Mid-America Bank Associates Only

2. Hire and retain Tennessees most experienced bankers and brokers
3. Give distinctive service
4. Provide effective financial advice
5. Offer convenient access
Obviously, this merger significantly enhances convenient access, one of our five core
strategies.
The subtle modifications that we had already made to our targeted clients are advantageous to us
in this transaction since both PrimeTrust and Bank of the South have been active with both mass
market consumers and real estate professionals in addition to small businesses and affluent
households.
The plan and merger should result in the continued rapid growth of the firm, approximately
$500-$600 million in assets each year.
Mid-America is a newly formed holding company for two high-growth, urban-community banks:
PrimeTrust Bank and Bank of the South. Bank of the South has primarily focused on the eastern
portion of the Nashville MSA (Wilson and Rutherford counties) with a tradition of and commitment
to excellent client service. PrimeTrust has been focused primarily on portions of the MSA West
of I-65 (Bellevue and Green Hills in Davidson county, as well as Cheatham, Dickson, and
Williamson counties) and is very similar to Pinnacle in its targeted market segments. In fact,
Entrepreneur Magazine ranked PrimeTrust second on its list of Best Banks for Entrepreneurs in
Tennessee.
Like Pinnacle, Mid-America had also planned very rapid growth with approximately $150 million in
asset growth each year for their combined organizations (PrimeTrust and Bank of the South).
Pinnacle has received much recognition for its rapid growth, being the largest of the 186 banks
chartered in the U.S. during 2000. Similarly, PrimeTrust and Bank of the South are the
8th and 10th largest in the U.S. of all banks formed in 2001.
This almost hand-and-glove fit of the distribution systems (see map) and all three institutions
commitment to and capability to rapidly penetrate these high growth markets should make for a
strong strategic integration.
We intend to aggressively market our state-of-the-art treasury management services as well as
trust and insurance offerings in these new markets.
10) What does this do to our 2007 BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal)?




A.
 
This transaction is not expected to close until fourth quarter of 2007 or first quarter of
2008. Pinnacle will incur one-time costs associated with this transaction during 2007. Any
such costs would be excluded from measurement against the BHAG or any incentive compensation
calculations for 2007.

11)
 
Will we add any of Mid-Americas products or services to Pinnacles offerings?






A.
 
At this point, Mid-Americas product offerings appear very compatible with those of Pinnacle. In general, existing
Pinnacle clients should not expect any major product additions or modifications.



12) Has Mid-America surveyed associate satisfaction? If so, what did it say?




A.
 
No. Nevertheless, as smaller dynamic banks, associate engagement is clearly high. In fact,
PrimeTrust has consistently been a finalist in the Nashville Business Journals Best Place to
Work awards.


 

 
 
While the base pay and incentive compensation plans at all three institutions are different, we
are hopeful that our commitment to including everyone in annual cash incentives and equity-based
compensation will help continue the high level of engagement that currently exists.


 

 
 
We will continue our commitment to being the best financial services firm and the best place
to work in Tennessee. Following integration, we will utilize our work environment survey to
ensure a very high level of associate engagement throughout the combined firm.






13)
 
When will we start including PrimeTrust and Bank of the Souths clients in Pinnacles
client surveys?






A.
 
We will begin including PrimeTrust and Bank of the Souths clients in our client surveys
shortly after the systems conversions which are currently planned for January (PrimeTrust) and
February (Bank of the South) 2008.


 

 
 
We will likely ask PrimeTrust and Bank of the South to conduct service quality surveys of their
clients in the fourth quarter of 2007 in order to establish a baseline.






14)
 
We have been constrained for space in Downtown Nashville as we have grown and expanded.
Does this combination provide any relief for additional space?






A.
 
We will not have the perfect solution to our downtown space requirements until The Pinnacle
at Symphony Place is ready for occupancy in 2010. Until that time, we will have to house a
number of consolidated operational units in various temporary quarters as we do now at One
Nashville Place. We have not yet finalized the space plan for the combined firm.






15)
 
What are Pinnacles plans for adding infrastructure to support this rapid growth in staff?






A.
 
Our plan currently calls for additional staff in 2008 and 2009 to grow in all aspects of
the support infrastructure including Human Resources, Finance, Credit and Compliance as well
as all of the operations and technology areas. As part of our analysis of the Mid-America
merger we utilized the same metrics in determining the number of associates we would need in
each of these areas and have planned accordingly.

16)
 
As we get bigger and more spread out, will we have to stop doing some of the things that
have become Pinnacle traditions  like the summer picnic or the anniversary party?






A.
 
No. We have every intention of continuing the fun Pinnacle traditions like the summer
picnic and the anniversary party. We remain committed to being the best place to work in
Tennessee and consequently, we remain committed to the fun and celebratory environment that we
have built since early in our existence. The Gallup Organization has studied workplace
friendships and says that those who have friends at work with whom they socialize both in and
out of the office, are more engaged than those who dont. Obviously, the only way to develop
those sorts of friendships is to enable associates to spend time together.



17) Will any Pinnacle associates be eliminated due to consolidation?




A.
 
No.



18) Will this result in any changes in Pinnacles compensation, incentive or benefits plans?




A.
 
The Mid-America merger will have no impact on Pinnacles compensation or incentive plans,
and the costs associated with this merger will be excluded from any calculations related to
incentive pay in 2007 and 2008.


 

 
 
We periodically review our benefit plans (e.g., health insurance, disability plans, etc.) and
will include Mid-America in this review which is already under way. It is likely that there may
be modest changes to other benefit plans as we seek to find the best solutions possible for the
whole firm; however, you should not expect any degradation or major changes to your existing
benefit plans.


 

 
 
As always, we will conduct an open enrollment in November, when you will be notified of the
coming years plan and have an opportunity to select the benefit plans best suited to your
needs.



Mid-America Associates




19)
 
Whats in this for me?






A.
 
With this merger, Pinnacle is still headquartered in Middle Tennessee and decisions will
continue to be made in Middle Tennessee. It gives associates from PrimeTrust and Bank of the
South a chance to be a part of a firm that is also a values-driven company with a recognized
commitment to distinctive service for clients and an invigorating, engaging work environment
for associates. Pinnacle has been recognized by the Nashville Business Journal as the Best
Place to Work in Middle Tennessee for the last four years.


 

 
 
Feel free to go to Pinnacles website at www.pnfp.com to explore the mission, vision and
values of the firm.

For Pinnacle and Mid-America Bank Associates Only

Obviously, Mid-America leadership could have chosen to be a very small part of a large, unwieldy
regional bank or a large part of a smaller, high performing Nashville-headquartered company.
Mid-America leadership chose the latter.



20)
 
In addition to the branch closures, what other areas are likely to be impacted?






A.
 
Mid-Americas operational, technology, finance, human resources and risk management areas
will have the most change. All deposit operations, loan operations, credit support and
compliance will be consolidated into Pinnacles existing infrastructure. Also, the management
of human resources and accounting will be consolidated.






21)
 
When will we know which jobs will be eliminated?






A.
 
Pinnacle plans to notify, no later than October 31, 2007, any Mid-America associate whose
position will be eliminated. It is not anticipated that any positions will be eliminated until
after the merger is closed in fourth quarter 2007 or first quarter 2008. In fact, most
position eliminations will not occur until systems conversions have taken place and
stabilized. Pinnacle currently plans to conduct the PrimeTrust conversion in January of 2008
and the Bank of the South conversion in February.






22)
 
How many positions will be eliminated?






A.
 
The number of associates in the current Mid-America workforce that will no longer be
needed after the merger and integration is complete is approximately 30-40.


 

 
 
Approximately 90 positions, including 5 currently vacant, will be eliminated. The majority of
these positions will be impacted after the systems conversions and operational consolidations
planned for the first quarter of 2008. However, this number will be reduced by (1) adding 25-30
new jobs in the operational areas next year; (2) hiring 20-30 impacted Mid-America associates
for other new positions already projected for Pinnacles 2008 growth; and (3) several
retirements occurring at different times in 2008.






23)
 
What is the process for Mid-America associates to be considered for positions in the
combined firm?






A.
 
Once the target eliminations are communicated, we will have all the new positions defined
and allow all displaced associates the opportunity to apply for those jobs. Obviously, any
existing associate of Mid-America will be given priority consideration assuming they are
qualified for the job in which they are interested.






24)
 
Will there be severance packages available for those who wont be staying?






A.
 
At this time, severance/retention plans have not been finalized. However, 100% of
Mid-America associates will be offered retention bonuses. For positions that are eliminated,



9



 




For Pinnacle and Mid-America Bank Associates Only
DO NOT DUPLICATE OR DISTRIBUTE


retention bonuses will be generous and will be paid when the position is eliminated. These
bonuses will serve as a severance benefit to assist during a job transition period.
Associates whose positions are not eliminated will receive their retention bonus on the one-year
anniversary of the merger closing date.
Each associate will receive a communication regarding their specific retention amount no later
than September 14.
All
of Mid-Americas outstanding stock options and stock
appreciation rights will vest as a result of the merger.



25)
 
How does this affect my healthcare benefits?






A.
 
A quality benefit program for associates of both institutions is a priority. We know that
your healthcare plan is very important to you. There almost certainly will be some changes in
the healthcare plan. Your expectation should be that you will continue to have a program that
provides access to quality physicians and hospitals at a fair and affordable price for you. At
this time we dont know all the options that may be available in the marketplace with our
larger group of associates or the timeframe in which changes will be implemented. We expect to
update you at least monthly on decisions such as these in order to keep you informed of any
decisions that are being made. More than likely we will consolidate all of our benefit plans
during 2008.






26)
 
What is the difference in the pay at Mid-America and at Pinnacle?






A.
 
We have not completed a detailed analysis of the two compensation plans, although base
salaries appear very comparable.


 

 
 
Your expectation should be that you will have the opportunity to earn at least as much in cash
compensation (salary plus bonus) under Pinnacles compensation plan as you would have had under
Mid-Americas plan.


 

 
 
Nevertheless, some important compensation philosophies will guide any modifications to
compensation plans for Mid-Americas associates.






 

 
All non-commissioned Mid-America associates will ultimately be included in
Pinnacles annual cash incentive plan. All Mid-America associates will participate in a
separate compensation plan based on retention bonuses during 2008 to encourage staying
with Pinnacle during the transition and will migrate to Pinnacles standard annual cash
incentive plan in 2009. For most associates, this should result in increased cash
compensation compared to existing pay plans.


 

 

 
All associates will be included in Pinnacles equity based compensation plan
beginning in 2009. In Pinnacles first six years, approximately $28 million in value has
been created for Pinnacles associates as a result of the firms stock option plan.


 

 

 
Our commitment is to provide a salary administration program built on fairness.


 

 

 
The primary focus is to make sure what we pay associates is fair in relationship to
job responsibilities, market comparisons and performance (or results).


 

 

 
Motivation to achieve superior results comes by linking an associates pay to their
performance.



10



 




For Pinnacle and Mid-America Bank Associates Only
DO NOT DUPLICATE OR DISTRIBUTE


For the most part, given the inclusion of all associates in Pinnacles annual cash incentive
plan and equity based incentive plan, most associates are expected to have the opportunity for
increased total compensation under the Pinnacle plan.



27)
 
How does Pinnacles incentive plan work? When will we change to it?






A.
 
Pinnacle has worked hard to build a principle-centered firm. Three very important values
that influence all decisions, but that are particularly important in shaping Pinnacles
incentive plan are:






 

 
Results  Pinnacle achieves superior results and outperforms competitors. The firm
makes a recognizable difference to their clients and their community. The firms
associates fulfill their commitments.


 

 

 
Partnership  Pinnacles associates nurture mutually beneficial relationships
characterized by trust, respect and responsibility.


 

 

 
Fairness  Associates at Pinnacle treat clients, shareholders, business partners and
each other the way they want to be treated. They pursue solutions that are fair to
everyone concerned. In short, they do the right thing.



Heres how the plan works:



 

 
Every non-commissioned associate is included in the incentive plan.


 

 

 
Each associate is assigned to a 10% or 20% tier, which simply means that the
target incentive award will be 10% of base pay or 20% of base pay.


 

 

 
If the criticized and classified asset to capital ratio for the firm is less than a
predetermined target, then all associates who have been rated meets expectations are
eligible to receive incentive compensation. This ratio is utilized as the best predictor
of whether poor loans are being booked that escalate current earnings but that may
jeopardize the future earnings of the firm. We simply cannot afford poor loan quality.






 
>
 
If the firm hits its predetermined earnings per share (EPS) target, all
associates would receive their target award (e.g., 10% of base pay or 20% of base
pay)


 

 
>
 
If the firm exceeds the EPS targets, all associates would receive more than
their target awards (e.g., 10% tier associates might receive 12%, 20% tier associates
might receive 24%, etc.)


 

 
>
 
If the firm falls short of the EPS targets, all associates would receive
less than target awards (e.g., 10% tier associates might receive 8%, 20% tier
associates might receive 16%, etc.)



This incentive approach creates:



 

 
Results. Incentives are only paid if the firm achieves the desired results
expressed as loan quality and earnings per share.


 

 

 
Partnership. There is no arguing about whose client it is. There is no
arguing about who should get the commission. There is no arguing about who should take
the charge-off. Client service specialists (tellers) cannot let clients close accounts
and leave which would reduce revenues. Everyone needs to get the fees and service charges
collected. No one gets paid unless everyone gets paid.



11



 




For Pinnacle and Mid-America Bank Associates Only
DO NOT DUPLICATE OR DISTRIBUTE





 

 
Fairness. We will only hit the very aggressive performance targets we set for
ourselves if everyone gives 100%. Therefore, what could be more fair than
including everyone in the incentive payout?






28)
 
What about my 401(k) plan?






A.
 
Pinnacles associates broadly participate in Pinnacles 401(k) plan, which today is
structured such that the employer matches 100% of the first 4% contributed by the associate.
The employer contribution is matched each pay period and is immediately 100% vested.


 

 
 
Certainly a 401(k) plan will continue to be available to all Mid-America associates
following the merger with Pinnacle.


 

 
 
We will update you at least monthly on when your plan is to be merged into Pinnacles
401(k). We will merge the plans as soon as is practical following the merger.






29)
 
Will any of our titles change?






A.
 
There will be no change to officer titles (e.g. Senior Vice President, Vice President,
etc.). From the list below you will see that functional titles will probably change.


 

 
 
Pinnacle had the advantage of starting with a clean sheet of paper when the firm was formed in
2000. The founders set out to build a different kind of financial services experience.
Consequently, you will find many new and different things as a part of the Pinnacle culture than
you might find in a traditional bank. One of those differences is that there is very little
emphasis on officer titles. For client contact personnel who are involved in business
development, Pinnacle tends to err on the side of granting more senior titles so clients can
know they are dealing with decision makers.


 

 
 
Pinnacle places much more emphasis on functional titles than officer titles, and those titles
are intended to be descriptive of their client focus. A few examples you will soon encounter
include:







 
 
 


Traditional Title
 
Pinnacle Title




Lender/Loan Officer

 
Financial Advisor


Relationship Manager

 
Financial Advisor


CSR

 
Client Service Specialist


Teller

 
Service Specialist


Broker

 
Financial Consultant


Branch Manager

 
Office Manager


Executive Management

 
Leadership Team


Mortgage Originator

 
Home Loan Advisor







30)
 
Who from Mid-America will be involved in the integration planning?






A.
 
We will rely primarily on Gary Scott and Jason West from PrimeTrust along with David Major
and Sam Short from Bank of the South during the planning stages. Obviously, we must



12



 




For Pinnacle and Mid-America Bank Associates Only
DO NOT DUPLICATE OR DISTRIBUTE


involve
several other Mid-America associates along with the integration team members from Pinnacle
once the execution phase of the process begins.



31)
 
How do we respond to people in the community who are disappointed that we will no longer
be PrimeTrust or Bank of the South?



A.




 

 
We will still be part of a firm headquartered in Middle Tennessee and one with credit
decisions made right here in Middle Tennessee, which is substantially better than being a
part of an out-of-state bank with decisions being made elsewhere.


 

 

 
The combined company will have a presence in eight key Middle Tennessee counties,
including three new to the Pinnacle footprint (Cheatham, Dickson and Wilson).
Obviously, Mid-America leadership could have chosen to be a very small part of a large,
unwieldy regional bank or a large part of a smaller, high performing
Nashville-based company. Mid-America
leadership chose the latter.


 

 

 
Mid-America leadership has been looking for the right fit that would give Mid-America
the desired growth potential for its stock. Pinnacles stock, which Mid-America
shareholders will now hold, has been one of the highest performing bank stocks in the
nation  up over 400% since its initial public offering in 2000. In fact, nearly 30
percent of the combined firm will be owned by Mid-America shareholders.






32)
 
What will happen to the financial support that PrimeTrust and Bank of the South give our
communities?






 
 
A. Each year Pinnacle budgets 1% of its pretax
profit for community contributions which are pro
rated by markets based on asset size. The
increased size of our merged Middle Tennessee
footprint will mean that our overall
contributions here will increase in 2008. Part
of the integration process will be to look at
what Mid-America is currently doing in community
contributions. Pinnacles decision process
starts with asking financial advisors and other
associates to request contributions for causes
they are involved in and support. These requests
get priority consideration. In our overall
giving, Pinnacle supports four major categories:



> Education

> Health & Human Services

> Arts

> Economic Development

Pinnacle Financial Partners is a bank headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee operating in middle and East Tennessee.[1]
History[edit]
The company was founded on February 20, 2000 by twelve Nashville businessmen who wished to create a locally-owned financial firm. In May 2002 the company went public on the NASDAQ with the symbol PNFP. Pinnacle gained naming rights for a new skyscraper in Downtown Nashville, The Pinnacle at Symphony Place, and the company leased 65,000 square feet (6,000 m2) in the building.[2]
Pinnacle Financial Partners currently has approximately US$11 billion in assets and has 45 offices.
On January 22, 2017, Pinnacle announced it was acquiring BNC Bank of High Point, North Carolina, which has branches in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. The deal, worth $1.9 billion and completed June 16, 2017, gives Pinnacle operations in four states.[3][4]

Pinnacle Financial Partners currently has approximately US$11 billion in assets and has 45 offices.
On January 22, 2017, Pinnacle announced it was acquiring BNC Bank of High Point, North Carolina, which has branches in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. The deal, worth $1.9 billion and completed June 16, 2017, gives Pinnacle operations in four states.[3][4]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
