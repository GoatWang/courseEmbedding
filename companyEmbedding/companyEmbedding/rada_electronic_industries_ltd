History[edit]
RADA Electronic Industries was founded in 1970 by Haim Niessenson.[2][3] In 1998, owing to pressure from Boeing, Niessenson retired from his position as CEO of the company. Herzl Boedinger, who was RADA's international marketing manager and president of the U.S.-based subsidiary, and who had earlier served as commander of the Israeli Air Force, became president and CEO of RADA.[4] In 2007, Zvi Alon, who was vice president of marketing and sales and had in the 1980s been involved in the Lavi Project, took on the role of CEO.[5][6]

History[edit]
RADA Electronic Industries was founded in 1970 by Haim Niessenson.[2][3] In 1998, owing to pressure from Boeing, Niessenson retired from his position as CEO of the company. Herzl Boedinger, who was RADA's international marketing manager and president of the U.S.-based subsidiary, and who had earlier served as commander of the Israeli Air Force, became president and CEO of RADA.[4] In 2007, Zvi Alon, who was vice president of marketing and sales and had in the 1980s been involved in the Lavi Project, took on the role of CEO.[5][6]

History[edit]
RADA Electronic Industries was founded in 1970 by Haim Niessenson.[2][3] In 1998, owing to pressure from Boeing, Niessenson retired from his position as CEO of the company. Herzl Boedinger, who was RADA's international marketing manager and president of the U.S.-based subsidiary, and who had earlier served as commander of the Israeli Air Force, became president and CEO of RADA.[4] In 2007, Zvi Alon, who was vice president of marketing and sales and had in the 1980s been involved in the Lavi Project, took on the role of CEO.[5][6]

History[edit]
RADA Electronic Industries was founded in 1970 by Haim Niessenson.[2][3] In 1998, owing to pressure from Boeing, Niessenson retired from his position as CEO of the company. Herzl Boedinger, who was RADA's international marketing manager and president of the U.S.-based subsidiary, and who had earlier served as commander of the Israeli Air Force, became president and CEO of RADA.[4] In 2007, Zvi Alon, who was vice president of marketing and sales and had in the 1980s been involved in the Lavi Project, took on the role of CEO.[5][6]
Products[edit]

Ground debriefing systems for airborne digital video recordings
Active electronically scanned array radars[7]
