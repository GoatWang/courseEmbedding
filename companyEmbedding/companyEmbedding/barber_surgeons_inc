        Modern take on men’s grooming and maintenance that brings high quality styling and advanced medical science to the $21 billion men's grooming industry.About Barber Surgeons, Inc.Barber Surgeons Guild provides high quality products and services for men’s grooming and maintenance.During the Middle Ages, the barber surgeon was one of the most common medical practitioners of medieval Europe, tending to soldiers during battle. They were a coalition of tradesmen essential to the order of society that were expected to do everything from cutting hair to surgery.We created Barber Surgeons Guild in honor of this tradition with a commitment to providing men the full spectrum of products, services and science to look and feel their best.Barber Surgeons Guild is the only company that offers men’s grooming services and products alongside the most advance medical therapies for hair maintenance in-store and online.The CompanyBarber Surgeons Guild locations will be highly curated environments offering men the best in grooming and maintenance.

The first line of products will include shampoo, conditioner, pomade, clarifier and styling cream. BSG products will be available exclusively through BSG locations, BSG e-commerce store, BSG subscription service, and select retailers.The CommunityPaying homage to our predecessors from the middle ages, we are creating a 21st century Barber Surgeons Guild to empower and engage the leading experts in the field of men’s grooming. The highly selective affiliate network, the Barber Surgeons Guild, will be a collection of the top barbers, stylists, and influencers across the country. Members will be featured in our content, share advice with our community, have the opportunity promote our brand and share our products with their clients and audiences..The EvolutionOur hair restoration practice is essential to our business model, and we believe it will be a key differentiator in the market. Co-founder Dr. Justin Rome is an expert in hair regeneration and will oversee the clinical services and therapies we offer. We built Barber Surgeons Guild for the 80 million people in the US suffering from hair thinning and loss, who want innovative, proven, and trustworthy products and techniques to enhance their style.Why Crowdfunding? The SeedInvest platform provides the opportunity to create a large diverse investor base that can collectively add exponential value to the company. A strategic collection of early investors can promote the company through exclusive networks helping us quickly reach influential and affluent men in major cities. We believe the combination of investors who are brand champions in this category is very powerful and provides the company with a significant competitive advantage.Investor RoadshowIf you're interested in connecting with the founders, they will be in NYC.

Our products are being produced by a leading factory using the highest quality and most advanced ingredients. Our goal is to have our products become the essentials that every man will need in his grooming routine.Hair Restoration / Clinical ServicesBy incorporating advanced medical therapies to regrow hair including micro-surgical robotics and regenerative medicine techniques with growth factors, stem cells, and lasers in the setting of a high-end men's grooming and retail experience, we plan to change the hair regeneration space and become the leading authority in men’s grooming. Current advances in hair restoration over the past few years have been significant, yielding natural and scarless results once thought impossible, yet 50% of the 100,000 procedures in the US performed annually are still the 30 year old "strip" scarring method being promoted by a large chain who runs infomercials.LocationsOur first location will open in Los Angeles in West Hollywood in Q1 2017. This will include our curated retail; barbershop and clinical practice setting the template for future rollouts in the coming year. Our plan is to follow our location in Los Angeles with locations in New York City, Miami, San Francisco, and other major cities. The successful hair regeneration practice of co-founder Dr. Justin Rome generated $1,000,000+ in revenue in 2016 and drove $180,000+ in revenue in November, and will be rolled into this first location providing a foundation for the company to quickly scale.Online and E-CommerceIn addition to our physical locations, Barber Surgeons Guild will have a significant digital presence focused on providing our customers with access to our products and the latest trends on men’s grooming. Our e-commerce destination, like our stores, will feature Barber Surgeons Guild products alongside our other favorites, all of which will be highlighted through the content we create.Prior to the creation of Barber Surgeons Guild, the website of Dr. Rome’s practice received less than 1,000 uniques a month, with zero social media presence, yet still generated revenue of more than $1 million in 2016. We believe the creation of an immersive digital experience providing industry leading content, alongside the introduction of new revenue streams and scalable affiliate network, will position the company for success. MilestonesIn the upcoming year, our plan is to add the following: 50,000 unique visitors per month to our website 10,000 social followers15,000 emails to our databaseA Barber Surgeons Guild product line (with a subscription box service)Locations in LA and NYCE-commerce and mobile appAn affiliate network of grooming experts across the country that are members of the guild ____Invitation to Event on January 11th - January 12th: https://bsgnyc.splashthat.com/Team StoryOur founders met when Ari S.

In the future we hope to exponentially increase our customer deal flow from the internet as well as from the consulting members of our affiliate Guild of Barber Surgeons network, which we believe will allow us to achieve procedure saturation (1 case per day 5 days per week) in a matter of months from opening. We also plan to launch a subscription based e-commerce revenue stream which we will utilize to market and sell private labeled and 3rd party products to our databaseRegarding Justin's current practice, can you tell me what the two revenue lines consist of?(1) Patient fees: accounts for all hair restoration procedures services. 
(2) Consulting: occasionally I train other doctors on hair restoration and I receive a consulting fee in return. This is a very small additional revenue stream and is not part of our financial model.Can you break out what is under Medical Supplies / Equipment, Accounts Receivable and Outside Services?Medical supplies are what's needed to perform procedures. Also there are usage fees associated with the hair robot which is classified as medical supplies. Accounts receivable is where all funds are received for patient fees. Outside services are my 1099 employees which is most of my staff as they assist for procedures as scheduled. Payroll may seem low since I currently only have one W2 employee; the rest are 1099 employees who work as needed for me and are classified under "Outside Services".Regarding Justin's current practice, can you tell me what Distributions are?I don't take a salary so I occasionally take primary distributions to myself though this business. This will change with the reorganization to BSG.What is your projected model based on?Model is built mainly on services; does not account for e-commerce and in store products.Investor PerksInvest $5,000: three month free subscription box (~$300 value) beginning  Spring 2017 (currently in development)Invest $10,000: $3,500 credit to the first procedure (average procedure is $14,500)Invest $50,000: First procedure free, plus years worth of subscriptionIt is advised that you consult a tax professional to fully understand any potential tax implications of receiving investor perks before making an investment.Frequently Asked QuestionsAbout Side by Side OfferingsWhat is Side by Side?A Side by Side offering refers to a deal that is raising capital under two offering types. This Side by Side offering is raising under Regulation CF and Rule 506(c) of Regulation D.What is a Form C?The Form C is a document the company must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) which includes basic information about the company and its offering and is a condition to making a Reg CF offering available to investors. It is important to note that the SEC does not review the Form C, and therefore is not recommending and/or approving any of the securities being offered.Before making any investment decision, it is highly recommended that prospective investors review the Form C filed with the SEC (included in the company's profile) before making any investment decision.What is Rule 506(c) under Regulation D?Rule 506(c) under Regulation D is a type of offering with no limits on how much a company may raise. The company may generally solicit their offering, but the company must verify each investor’s status as an accredited investor prior to closing and accepting funds. To learn more about Rule 506(c) under Regulation D and other offering types check out our blog and academy.What is Reg CF?Title III of the JOBS Act outlines Reg CF, a type of offering allowing private companies to raise up to $1 million from all Americans. Prior capital raising options limited private companies to raising money only from accredited investors, historically the wealthiest ~2% of Americans. Like a Kickstarter campaign, Reg CF allows companies to raise funds online from their early adopters and the crowd. However, instead of providing investors a reward such as a t-shirt or a card, investors receive shares, typically equity, in the startups they back. To learn more about Reg CF and other offering types check out our blog and academy.Making an Investment in Barber Surgeons, Inc.How does investing work?When you complete your investment on SeedInvest, your money will be transferred to an escrow account where an independent escrow agent will watch over your investment until it is accepted by Barber Surgeons, Inc.. Once Barber Surgeons, Inc. accepts your investment, and certain regulatory procedures are completed, your money will be transferred from the escrow account to Barber Surgeons, Inc. in exchange for your shares. At that point, you will be a proud owner in Barber Surgeons, Inc..What will I need to complete my investment?To make an investment, you will need the following information readily available:Personal information such as your current address and phone numberEmployment and employer informationNet worth and income informationSocial Security Number or government-issued identificationABA bank routing number and checking account number (typically found on a personal check or bank statement)If you are investing under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D, your status as an Accredited Investor will also need to be verified and you will be asked to provide documentation supporting your income, net worth, revenue, or net assets or a letter from a qualified advisor such as a Registered Investment Advisor, Registered Broker Dealer, Lawyer, or CPA.How much can I invest?An investor is limited in the amount that he or she may invest in a Reg CF offering during any 12-month period:If either the annual income or the net worth of the investor is less than $100,000, the investor is limited to the greater of $2,000 or 5% of the lesser of his or her annual income or net worth.If the annual income and net worth of the investor are both greater than $100,000, the investor is limited to 10% of the lesser of his or her annual income or net worth, to a maximum of $100,000.Separately, Barber Surgeons, Inc. has set a minimum investment amount of US $0.Accredited investors investing $20,000 or over do not have investment limits.After My InvestmentWhat is my ongoing relationship with the Issuer?You are a partial owner of the company, you do own shares after all! But more importantly, companies which have raised money via Regulation CF must file information with the SEC and post it on their websites on an annual basis. Receiving regular company updates is important to keep shareholders educated and informed about the progress of the company and their investment. This annual report includes information similar to a company’s initial Reg CF filing and key information that a company will want to share with its investors to foster a dynamic and healthy relationship.In certain circumstances a company may terminate its ongoing reporting requirement if:The company becomes a fully-reporting registrant with the SECThe company has filed at least one annual report, but has no more than 300 shareholders of recordThe company has filed at least three annual reports, and has no more than $10 million in assetsThe company or another party purchases or repurchases all the securities sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6)The company ceases to do businessHowever, regardless of whether a company has terminated its ongoing reporting requirement per SEC rules, SeedInvest works with all companies on its platform to ensure that investors are provided quarterly updates. These quarterly reports will include information such as: (i) quarterly net sales, (ii) quarterly change in cash and cash on hand, (iii) material updates on the business, (iv) fundraising updates (any plans for next round, current round status, etc.), and (v) any notable press and news.How can I sell my shares in the future?Currently there is no market or liquidity for these shares. Right now Barber Surgeons, Inc. does not plan to list these shares on a national exchange or another secondary market. At some point Barber Surgeons, Inc. may choose to do so, but until then you should plan to hold your investment for a significant period of time before a “liquidation event” occurs. A “liquidation event” is when Barber Surgeons, Inc. either lists their shares on an exchange, is acquired, or goes bankrupt.How do I keep track of this investment?You can return to SeedInvest at any time to view your portfolio of investments and obtain a summary statement. If invested under Regulation CF you may also receive periodic updates from the company about their business, in addition to monthly account statements.Other General QuestionsWhat is this page about?This is Barber Surgeons, Inc.'s fundraising profile page, where you can find information that may be helpful for you to make an investment decision in their company.

Franz Anton Maulbertsch's The Quack (c. 1785) shows barber surgeons at work.






Bloodletting set of a barber surgeon, beginning of 19th century, Märkisches Museum Berlin


The barber surgeon is one of the most common European medical practitioners of the Middle Ages — generally charged with looking after soldiers during or after a battle. In this era, surgery was not generally conducted by physicians but by barbers (who had a sharp-bladed razor as an indispensable tool of their profession). In the Middle Ages in Europe barbers would be expected to do anything from cutting hair to amputating limbs. Mortality of surgery at the time was quite high due to loss of blood and infection. Doctors of the Middle Ages thought that taking blood would help cure the patient of sickness so the barber would apply leeches to the patient. Physicians tended to be academics, working in universities, and mostly dealt with patients as an observer or a consultant. They considered surgery to be beneath them.[1]
They often took up residence in castles where they also provided medical assistance to the wealthy.

Middle Ages in Europe[edit]
Due to religious and sanitary monastic regulations, monks had to maintain their tonsure (the traditional baldness on the top of the head of Catholic monks) and be bled regularly. This created a market for barbers, because each monastery had to train or hire a barber. They would perform bloodletting and other minor surgeries like pulling teeth or creating ointments. The first barber surgeons to be recognized as such worked in monasteries around 1000 A.D.[1]
Because physicians performed surgery so rarely, the Middle Ages saw a proliferation of barbers, among other medical "paraprofessionals", including cataract couchers, herniotomists, lithotomists, midwives, and pig gelders. In 1254, Bruno di Longoburgo, a physician who wrote on surgery, was concerned about barbers performing phlebotomies and scarifications.[1]
Barbers in Paris and Italy[edit]
In Paris, disputes between doctors led to the widespread patronage of barbers. The College of St. Cosme had two levels of student doctors: doctors who were given a long academic robe were permitted to perform surgeries and doctors who were given a short robe and had to pass a special examination before being given that license. The short-robed doctors were bitter because the long-robed physicians behaved pretentiously.
The short-robed doctors of St. Cosme entered into an agreement with the barber surgeons of Paris that they would offer the barber surgeons secret lessons on human anatomy as long as they swore to be dependents and supporters of the short-robed physicians. This secret deal existed from around the time of the founding of St. Cosme in 1210 until 1499, when the group of surgeon barbers asked for their own cadaver to perform their anatomical demonstrations. In 1660, the barber surgeons eventually recognized the physicians' dominance.[1]
In Italy, barbers were not as common. The Salerno medical school trained physicians to be competent surgeons, as did the schools in Bologna and Padua. In Florence, physicians and surgeons were separated, but the Florentine Statute concerning the Art of Physicians and Pharmacists in 1349 gave barbers an inferior legal status compared to surgeons.[1]
Barbers in the British Isles in the Middle Ages[edit]




Master John Banister's Anatomical Tables, with Figures. The paintings comprise a portrait of Banister delivering a visceral lecture at the Barber-Surgeons' Hall, Monkwell Street, London. c. 1580


Formal recognition of their skills (in England at least) goes back to 1540,[2] when the Fellowship of Surgeons (who existed as a distinct profession but were not "Doctors/Physicians" for reasons including that, as a trade, they were trained by apprenticeship rather than academically) merged with the Company of Barbers, a London livery company, to form the Company of Barber-Surgeons. However, the trade was gradually put under pressure by the medical profession and in 1745, the surgeons split from the Barbers' Company (which still exists) to form the Company of Surgeons. In 1800 a Royal Charter was granted to this company and the Royal College of Surgeons in London came into being (later it was renamed to cover all of England — equivalent colleges exist for Scotland and Ireland as well as many of the old UK colonies, e.g., Canada).[3]
Few traces of barbers' links with the surgical side of the medical profession remain. One is the traditional red and white barber's pole, or a modified instrument from a blacksmith, which is said to represent the blood and bandages associated with their older role. Another link is the British use of the title "Mr" rather than "Dr" by surgeons (when they become qualified as surgeons by, e.g., the award of an MRCS or FRCS diploma). This dates back to the days when surgeons did not have a university education (let alone a doctorate); this link with the past is retained despite the fact that all surgeons now have to gain a basic medical degree and doctorate (as well as undergoing several more years training in surgery). They no longer perform haircuts, a task the barbers have retained.
In fiction[edit]

The TV series Children of the Stones featured an enigmatic character described as a barber surgeon (portrayed by Freddie Jones), who had been mysteriously crushed by a fallen stone in the fictional Milbury stone circle.
In the animated series The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, a recurring character named Dr. Barber commonly offers surgery (usually along the lines of amputation) with his barber services and vice versa.
In the musical Man of La Mancha, Don Quixote and his assistant Sancho Panza encounter a barber surgeon, who boasts of his abilities to give a good shave and bandage up any mishaps his straight razor might inflict.
The Turkish/Kurdish film Yol (1982) depicts a contemporary rural barber performing an emergency dental operation.
The TV series Saturday Night Live, episode 18 of season 3 featured a skit titled 'Theodoric of York, Medieval Barber' with comedian/actor Steve Martin as the title character. Theodoric performs bloodlettings and other procedures that produce less-than-ideal results leading him to question his practice: "Wait a minute. Perhaps she's right. Perhaps I've been wrong to blindly follow the medical traditions and superstitions of past centuries. Maybe we barbers should test these assumptions analytically, through experimentation and a 'scientific method'. Maybe this scientific method could be extended to other fields of learning: the natural sciences, art, architecture, navigation. Perhaps I could lead the way to a new age, an age of rebirth, a Renaissance! [ thinks for a minute ] Naaaaaahhh!"
In the movie Gangs of New York, bloodletting is listed as a service of the barbershop owned by the character Walter "Monk" McGinn.[4]
History[edit]
A barber surgeon was a person who could perform minor surgical procedures such as bloodletting, cupping therapy or pulling teeth. Barbers could also bathe, cut hair, shave or trim facial hair, and give enemas. The surgeon came with the army at war but could be used by individuals in peacetime.[5]
The surname 'Bader' comes from German and Jewish (Ashkenazic) origins and refers to the occupation of barber surgeon, barber, or one who tends a bath house.[6][7] The German verb 'baden' means to bathe, but when capitalized the surname 'Baden' is a geographical surname referring to the region of Baden-Württemberg in Germany.[8][9]

This created a market for barbers, because each monastery had to train or hire a barber. They would perform bloodletting and other minor surgeries like pulling teeth or creating ointments. The first barber surgeons to be recognized as such worked in monasteries around 1000 A.D.[1]
Because physicians performed surgery so rarely, the Middle Ages saw a proliferation of barbers, among other medical "paraprofessionals", including cataract couchers, herniotomists, lithotomists, midwives, and pig gelders. In 1254, Bruno di Longoburgo, a physician who wrote on surgery, was concerned about barbers performing phlebotomies and scarifications.[1]
Barbers in Paris and Italy[edit]
In Paris, disputes between doctors led to the widespread patronage of barbers. The College of St. Cosme had two levels of student doctors: doctors who were given a long academic robe were permitted to perform surgeries and doctors who were given a short robe and had to pass a special examination before being given that license. The short-robed doctors were bitter because the long-robed physicians behaved pretentiously.
The short-robed doctors of St. Cosme entered into an agreement with the barber surgeons of Paris that they would offer the barber surgeons secret lessons on human anatomy as long as they swore to be dependents and supporters of the short-robed physicians. This secret deal existed from around the time of the founding of St. Cosme in 1210 until 1499, when the group of surgeon barbers asked for their own cadaver to perform their anatomical demonstrations. In 1660, the barber surgeons eventually recognized the physicians' dominance.[1]
In Italy, barbers were not as common. The Salerno medical school trained physicians to be competent surgeons, as did the schools in Bologna and Padua. In Florence, physicians and surgeons were separated, but the Florentine Statute concerning the Art of Physicians and Pharmacists in 1349 gave barbers an inferior legal status compared to surgeons.[1]
Barbers in the British Isles in the Middle Ages[edit]




Master John Banister's Anatomical Tables, with Figures. The paintings comprise a portrait of Banister delivering a visceral lecture at the Barber-Surgeons' Hall, Monkwell Street, London. c. 1580


Formal recognition of their skills (in England at least) goes back to 1540,[2] when the Fellowship of Surgeons (who existed as a distinct profession but were not "Doctors/Physicians" for reasons including that, as a trade, they were trained by apprenticeship rather than academically) merged with the Company of Barbers, a London livery company, to form the Company of Barber-Surgeons. However, the trade was gradually put under pressure by the medical profession and in 1745, the surgeons split from the Barbers' Company (which still exists) to form the Company of Surgeons. In 1800 a Royal Charter was granted to this company and the Royal College of Surgeons in London came into being (later it was renamed to cover all of England — equivalent colleges exist for Scotland and Ireland as well as many of the old UK colonies, e.g., Canada).[3]
Few traces of barbers' links with the surgical side of the medical profession remain. One is the traditional red and white barber's pole, or a modified instrument from a blacksmith, which is said to represent the blood and bandages associated with their older role. Another link is the British use of the title "Mr" rather than "Dr" by surgeons (when they become qualified as surgeons by, e.g., the award of an MRCS or FRCS diploma). This dates back to the days when surgeons did not have a university education (let alone a doctorate); this link with the past is retained despite the fact that all surgeons now have to gain a basic medical degree and doctorate (as well as undergoing several more years training in surgery). They no longer perform haircuts, a task the barbers have retained.
In fiction[edit]

The TV series Saturday Night Live, episode 18 of season 3 featured a skit titled 'Theodoric of York, Medieval Barber' with comedian/actor Steve Martin as the title character. Theodoric performs bloodlettings and other procedures that produce less-than-ideal results leading him to question his practice: "Wait a minute. Perhaps she's right. Perhaps I've been wrong to blindly follow the medical traditions and superstitions of past centuries. Maybe we barbers should test these assumptions analytically, through experimentation and a 'scientific method'. Maybe this scientific method could be extended to other fields of learning: the natural sciences, art, architecture, navigation. Perhaps I could lead the way to a new age, an age of rebirth, a Renaissance! [ thinks for a minute ] Naaaaaahhh!"
In the movie Gangs of New York, bloodletting is listed as a service of the barbershop owned by the character Walter "Monk" McGinn.[4]
History[edit]
A barber surgeon was a person who could perform minor surgical procedures such as bloodletting, cupping therapy or pulling teeth. Barbers could also bathe, cut hair, shave or trim facial hair, and give enemas. The surgeon came with the army at war but could be used by individuals in peacetime.[5]
The surname 'Bader' comes from German and Jewish (Ashkenazic) origins and refers to the occupation of barber surgeon, barber, or one who tends a bath house.[6][7] The German verb 'baden' means to bathe, but when capitalized the surname 'Baden' is a geographical surname referring to the region of Baden-Württemberg in Germany.[8][9]

The barber surgeon is one of the most common European medical practitioners of the Middle Ages — generally charged with looking after soldiers during or after a battle. In this era, surgery was not generally conducted by physicians but by barbers (who had a sharp-bladed razor as an indispensable tool of their profession). In the Middle Ages in Europe barbers would be expected to do anything from cutting hair to amputating limbs. Mortality of surgery at the time was quite high due to loss of blood and infection. Doctors of the Middle Ages thought that taking blood would help cure the patient of sickness so the barber would apply leeches to the patient. Physicians tended to be academics, working in universities, and mostly dealt with patients as an observer or a consultant. They considered surgery to be beneath them.[1]
They often took up residence in castles where they also provided medical assistance to the wealthy.
