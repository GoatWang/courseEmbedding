There is no shortage of sales advertisements from retailers who would like your business: they're using preferred customer special offers, early parrot sales, midnight madness occasions, coupon savings times, and pre- AND post-holiday sales. Precisely how do you select if their offers are real?
The Federal government Trade Commission, the country's consumer protection company, has some tips to obtain the most for your cash.
Check around. A "sale" price isn't always the "best" price. Some merchants may give you a sale price on an item for a limited time; others may discount the purchase price on a single item everyday. Having an item's manufacturer, model number, and other identifying information can help you to get the best price for that you want.Read sale advertising carefully. Some may say "quantities limited," "no rainfall inspections," or "unavailable whatsoever stores." Before you come out the door, call ahead to be sure the merchant has the item in stock. If you're searching for a favorite or hard-to-find item, ask the merchant if he'd be willing to carry that until you can reach the store.Devote some time and travel costs under consideration. If something is for sale, but it's way anywhere, how much are you truly saving once you element in your time, your transportation, and parking?

Who doesn't need to get the best offer for their buck -- especially of these tough economical times? There is no shortage of sales advertisements from retailers who would like your business: they're using preferred customer special offers, early parrot sales, midnight madness situations, coupon savings times, and pre- AND post-holiday sales. Precisely how do you select if their offers are real?
The Federal government Trade Commission, the country's consumer protection company, has some tips to obtain the most for your cash.
Check around. A "sale" price isn't always the "best" price. Some merchants may give you a sale price on an item for a limited time; others may discount the purchase price on a single item everyday. Having an item's manufacturer, model number, and other identifying information can help you to get the best price for that you want.Read sale advertising carefully. Some may say "quantities limited," "no rainfall inspections," or "unavailable whatsoever stores." Before you come out the door, call ahead to be sure the merchant has the item in stock. If you're searching for a favorite or hard-to-find item, ask the merchant if he'd be willing to carry that until you can reach the store.Devote some time and travel costs under consideration. If something is available for sale, but it's way anywhere, how much are you truly saving once you element in your time, your transportation, and parking?

Purchase museum-quality metal prints from the world's greatest living artists and photographers or upload your own photos and transform them into personal works of art.   Each metal print is hand-crafted at one of our global production facilities using 1/16" thick aluminum.





Sizes
Choose from 15 different print sizes starting a 6" x 6" and going all the way up to 50" x 108".
Square, rectangular, panoramic - we have them all.
Metal prints are extremely durable.   They're lightweight.   They won't bend, and they're water resistant.






Craftsmanship
Fine Art America is the largest metal print manufacturer in the world.   We have 14 fulfillment centers located in five different countries and produce museum-quality metal prints for hundreds of thousands of artists, photographers, and iconic brands.
Our expert staff creates each metal print using archival inks which are designed to last for 75 years without fading.   Your image gets printed directly onto a sheet of 1/16" thick aluminum, and the aluminum sheet is offset from the wall by a 3/4" thick wooden frame which is attached to the back.
Your metal print will be ready to ship within 2 - 3 days after you place your order, and you can ship it to any destination in the world.
Every print includes a 30-day money-back guarantee.   If you're not happy with your purchase, for any reason, you can send it back for a refund.   Don't worry - you're going to love it!






Mounting
Your metal print will arrive with everything that you need to mount it on your wall.
The wooden frame on the back of the print includes a hanging wire for easy mounting, and you'll also receive a small plastic bag containing mounting hooks and nails.






Quality & Care
Our metal prints are produced using archival inks which are designed to last 75 years without fading or loss of color.
As long as you don't place your print outdoors where it will be subjected to high humidity, extreme temperatures, and/or direct rain, your print will last a lifetime!

Canvas Prints
Canvas prints are one of the most popular styles of wall art due to their simplicity, lightweight, and relatively low cost.   In order to manufacturer canvas prints, high-resolution artwork images get printed onto tightly woven cotton canvases, and then the canvases get stretched around rectangular frames of durable, wooden stretcher bars.   Mounting hooks or hanging wires get attached to the back, and that's it!   You get a simple, elegant, museum-quality masterpiece which is ready to hang on your wall.   You can customize your canvas print by specifying the print dimensions, the canvas type (glossy or matte), and the color of the side wrap (black, white, or mirrored).   For an upscale appearance, you can also add a floater frame which surrounds your print and offsets it slightly from the wall.   We have hundreds of floater frames to choose from.


Art Prints
An art print is simply a piece of artwork (e.g. a painting, illustration, or photograph) which gets digitized and then printed onto a museum-quality grade of paper.   We offer seven different paper types which are designed for specific styles of images: archival matte paper, glossy photo paper, luster photo paper, semi-matte photo paper, picture rag, somerset velvet, watercolor paper, and metallic paper.   No matter which paper you select, your art print gets produced using archival inks which are designed to last for 75+ years without fading or loss of color.   In order to transform your art print into wall art, you'll need to select a frame and/or mat so that your print can be easily mounted on your wall.   We have hundreds of different frames and mats to choose from.


Posters
Posters are one of the first types of wall art that we all encounter / own in life.   As a young child, you probably had posters of your favorite athletes, musicians, and actors hanging on your walls.   Posters are simply "art prints" which are produced on a lower cost papers.   They're very thin and are designed to be hung on your walls using tape or another sticky adhesive, but they can also be framed and matted, if desired.


Framed Prints
Select an art print (see above)... add a mat... add a frame... and you're got a framed print.   Frame prints are a universal type of wall art which work perfectly in all settings.   You can hang them in any house style (e.g. modern, southwest, etc.) and in any room, and they'll instantly transform the mood based on your selected images and frames.   We have hundreds of different frames to choose from ranging from low-cost, metallic black frames up to highly-ornate, wooden frames embelished with gold accents.   All of our framed prints are hand-crafted in 3 - 4 business days by our expert staff of custom framers and delivered to you ready-to-hang with mounting hooks, hanging wire, and nails.   The right frame can transform almost any image into high-end work of art, and the right frame plus the right image can create a truly spectacular addition to the wall art in your home or office.


Metal Prints
Metal prints are a relatively new style of wall art which get produced by printing images directly onto 1/8" thick sheets of polished aluminum.   The results are sleek, modern, and visually stunning.   Metal prints are a favorite among photographers and photo-enthusiasts because they make photographic images really pop, but having said that, you'll often see paintings and illustrations printing on metal, as well.   Part of the beauty of a metal print is its simplicity.   It's just the image... printed on sheet of metal... with a hanging wire on the back.   Metal prints can be found extensively through commercial office spaces, airports, hospitals, and other public settings, and you'll find them in many modern-style homes, as well.


Wood Prints
Wood prints are perfect for adding a rustic feel to any image.   They're produced by printing images directly onto 3/4" sheets of maple wood, and the printing technique allows the subtle grain and texture of the wood to slightly show through and accent the image.   The results are warm, Earthy, and vintage inspired.   Due to the natural association with "nature", you'll find wood prints used extensively as wall art in rustic environments such as cabins, vacation homes, home offices, travel agencies, and more... but this is one the most under-utilized type of wall art that we offer - wood prints look absolutely incredible in any environment.   We use them throughout our own "startup office space" here in Southern California which is filled with towering white wall, lots of natural sunlight, and views of the Pacific Ocean.   You don't have to be out in the woods to appreciate the beauty of these wood prints.


Painted Portaits (Photos-to-Art)
Transform your personal photos into originals work of art - digitally hand-painted with care by a master artist.   No Photoshop filters.   No simulated brush strokes.   Your photo becomes a one-of-a-kind masterpiece signed by the artist.   All you have to do is upload your image, select our "Painted Portrait" option on the upload screen, customize your photo with a frame and/or mat, and you're done.   A master artist will transform your photo into a digitally hand-painted work of art, and your framed masterpiece will be on its way back to you within 4 - 5 business days.   This is an incredibly easy, visually-stunning way to transform your personal photos and wall art for your home.
