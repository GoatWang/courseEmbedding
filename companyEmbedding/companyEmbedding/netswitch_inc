OUR TECHNICAL APPROACH
In addition to our advanced
web application protection
we use automated contextual
analytics and patented
behavior detection technology
combined with evidence-based
risk analysis to continuously
monitor post-infection,
pre-breach behaviors to provide
the last line of defense.

We correlate these threat
behaviors against a multitude
of data sources, including
vulnerabilities, external IP
reputation, and other risk
indicators to quickly detect,
contain and respond before
the breach.


WHAT OUR CLIENTS SAY"We contracted with Netswitch to provide managed services for our global IT operations beginning in 2006 and continuing through today on a long term contract. Netswitch provides OMNi with security protection, technical support for application maintenance and IT infrastructure support for hardware, software and operations management. Their Integrated Security platform is fantastic - these guys really understand data security. They put the whole structure in place to make it integrative with our overseas operations, and it has been seamless. They have been instrumental in our ability to grow and expand our business without having to worry about IT or data security and I recommend them highly.”

Managed Security Services

												


Our Securli® Integrated Security Platform is in use in over 3,500 client sites around the world providing intrusion detection and prevention, monitored and managed web firewalls and gateways, mobile device management, security information and event management, managed vulnerability, network mapping and performance monitoring and complete audit-ready regulatory compliance.

SOC (Security Operations Center)
Our Security Operations Center (SOC) subscription service logs, monitors and analyzes your organization’s security events 24x7x365. The SOC is staffed by security experts and uses industry leading SIEM protocols deployed over a cloud-based infrastructure to continually monitor and defend your entire security landscape.
Incident Response and Remediation
Our Incident Response and Remediation Management (IRRM) service guarantees that any cyber-attack will be responded to within a 15 minute window and the complex process involved in containment and remediation will begin immediately. Our IRRM service is based on a set of specific protocols developed together with our customers in planning the critical events immediately following a breach so that our processes are completely integrated with our customers’ internal IT and remediation teams for maximum effectiveness.
Integrated Service Level Management
Our integrated service level management platform provides our clients with a broad over-view of our IRRM service delivery performance in real-time, allowing the detailed tracking of security alerts and their resolution and on-going visibility into and reporting of our performance to our service level agreements.
The service level management dashboard allows our customers to see exactly what is transpiring with every security event we’re monitoring from initial alert all the way through to remediation and final resolution. Our ISLM platform is ITIL-certified and is included in every one of our Managed Security Services engagements.
Next Generation Security Technology
We use only the best-in-class security solutions with a concentration on behavioral analytics and data assets as a supplement to perimeter defenses. While our incident detection and prevention software is the best on the planet, we focus additionally on preemptive breach detection by using technology that works inside the perimeter defenses monitoring pre-breach, post-infection network and endpoint behaviors. Our emphasis is on establishing a last line of defense against staging, reconnaissance, propagation, data acquisition, and exfiltration.
This new approach of analyzing contextual behavior and information flows provides a larger protective surface where potential data loss or incursions from advanced persistent threats can be identified and stopped before damage is done.
Regulatory Compliance Requirements
Government penalties for regulatory non-compliance, along with increasingly dangerous liability lawsuits have made compliance a serious management requirement. Securli® provides over 100 standardized and audit-ready compliance reporting and automatic log retention capabilities for a wide range of regulations, industry mandates and control frameworks including: PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOX, FFIEC, GLBA, FISMA, NERC CIP as well as all new and developed requirements as they are implemented.
Peace of Mind.

The Hole in your Data Security Strategy
by Allan Martin, CTO of ABMartin LLC, is an expert in data privacy and security


SecurliCON 2017 – The Hole in your Data Security Strategy by Allan Martin from Netswitch Technology Management on Vimeo.
In today’s marketplace, IT leaders spend a significant amount of time and money ensuring that their company’s data is secure. Even so, breaches are commonplace. In 2015 alone, the Identity Theft Resource Center reported that in the U.S. there were 781 large-scale data breaches.
The biggest reason? Access to data in non-production test environments. Test data is necessary to support application development, quality assurance, and other mission-critical activities. If this data is not secured internally and from external partners, it poses a huge security and compliance risk, not to mention significant costs.
In this discussion we will outline the essential steps that corporations should include within their overall security strategy to ensure all data; structured and unstructured, is protected.
THIS WEEK’S PRESENTATION by:
Allan Martin, CTO of ABMartin LLC, is an expert in data privacy and security. Over 20 years’ experience working with IBM architecting and delivering successful data privacy and test data management solutions within several Fortune 500 organizations.
A long time member of INCOSE (International Council Of System Engineers), Allan has helped to establish competitive, scalable and professional standards in the practice of systems engineering. He has provided vision and leadership for key technologies, including database management systems, grid computing, data privacy and encryption processes.
During the 90’s Allan joined IBM to lead a team in developing software and solutions to manage heterogeneous environments by combining disparate sources like DB2, Oracle, XML, flat files into a single virtual view. Allan has successfully designed and implemented archiving and decommissioning strategies for numerous fortune 100 companies, including IBM.
In 2009 Allan formed a SWAT team in consulting for government and commercial companies, leveraging skills in database design and access, developed processes for Data Privacy/Obfuscation across federated environments establishing a practice to protect companies’ classified sensitive data.

Management Team

												

Stanley Li

Stanley Li 
CEO and President
Global vision and diversification started at early age for Stanley; living in three major continents before the age of 18 has given him a unique insight into inclusion leadership and global strategy development. He began his career as a humble cable puller and from that perspective, was able to see the entire spectrum of end-to-end business processes in managing information technologies, from the trenches up through broad IT management responsibilities. It has served to inform his view of customer service being the most important attribute of a professional service IT consulting firm.
Progressing through a variety of large companies and a host of technical certifications as an engineer and consultant before founding Netswitch, Stanley never lost sight of the importance of interpersonal relationships and service. Stanley has consistently placed client satisfaction above profitability and the result is an enormously successful IT consulting firm that enjoys long-term relationships with most of its clients, both in the US and abroad. Netswitch as a company reflects Stanley’s personal attributes and client service philosophy. It is the reason why Netswitch consistently ranks among the leaders in global Managed Service and Cloud Service Providers.
Stanley earned his Masters of Science degree in Telecommunications Management from Golden Gate University and his Bachelor’s degree in Finance & Real Estate, from San Francisco State University.

The Next Big Attack: WannaCry is Just the BeginningJune 6, 2017Virtual Rehab Partners With Securli To Protect Sensitive Patient DataMay 30, 2017KBQuest Partners With Netswitch To Provide Advanced Cybersecurity ServicesApril 20, 2017


OUR TECHNICAL APPROACH
In addition to our advanced

risk analysis to continuously
monitor post-infection,
pre-breach behaviors to provide
the last line of defense.

We correlate these threat
behaviors against a multitude
of data sources, including
vulnerabilities, external IP
reputation, and other risk
indicators to quickly detect,
contain and respond before
the breach.

Netswitch provides OMNi with security protection, technical support for application maintenance and IT infrastructure support for hardware, software and operations management.

They put the whole structure in place to make it integrative with our overseas operations, and it has been seamless.
