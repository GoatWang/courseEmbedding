Compound Indication(s) Dose
Acetic Acid Parasiticide for fish 1000-2000 ppm dip for 1-10 minutes
Calcium chloride Used to aid in egg hardening 10-20 ppm CaCO3 (eggs)
Used to aid in maintaining osmotic balance during fish

Calcium oxide External protozoacide for fish 2000 ppm dip for 5 sec
Carbon dioxide gas Anesthetic for fish
Fuller’s Earth Used to reduce the adhesiveness of fish eggs
Garlic (whole form) To control helminth and sea lice infestations of marine
salmonids at all life stages
Ice Used to reduce the metabolic rate of fish during transport
Magnesium sulfate Used to treat external monogenic trematode infestations 30,000 ppm MgSO4 + 7000 ppm NaCl dip for
in fish 5-10 min
Onion (whole form) Used to treat external crustacean parasites infestations
of salmonids
Used to deter sea lice from infesting external surface of salmonids
Povidone iodine Egg surface disinfectant 100 ppm for 10 min during or after water
hardening

    Challenge
Intensive production = potential for rapid spread of disease
Lack of effective vaccines or treatments
Frequently poor management and biosecurity in developing regions
Delivery of potential preventatives or treatments
Opportunity
Improved management and biosecurity
Improved genetics including genome “editing”
Novel vaccines and therapeutics
Novel delivery systems
 
  


        16.
      
    Why Aquaculture Biotechnology?
• Fish is a healthy food and an efficient source of high quality
protein
• Many of world’s fisheries are maximally exploited
• Aquaculture must at least triple by 2030 to hold per capita
fish supply constant (FAO)
• Genetics and husbandry practices generally primitive
• Biotechnology can improve efficiency and sustainability
 
  


        17.
      
    The use of si-RNA technology
may represent an opportunity
for specific therapeutic
solutions for many of the most
damaging viral diseases of
shrimp and fish.
 
  


        18.
      
    Seafood is healthy, nutritious, and desirable
Fish are efficient converters of feed to human food
Capture fisheries have been at maximum production levels for twenty years
Aquaculture is an environmentally sustainable alternative production system
Current aquaculture management relies on biosecurity
There are few approved drugs or biologicals
Many diseases of aquatic organisms are poorly understood
Outbreak of a disease like EMS, TSV, WSD, ISAV can destroy a geographic industry
Opportunities for novel approaches to reduce susceptibility, treat or
block infection and disease.

U.S. Senate Letter to FDA Asking Commissioner Hamburg to Halt Approval Process of AquAdvantage Salmon Ignores 15 Years of Scientific Study by the FDA
WALTHAM, Mass., July 20, 2011 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Background: On July 15, 2011, a letter to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Margaret Hamburg signed by eight United States Senators, including Senators Mark Begich (D-AK) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), asked the agency to cease the approval process for AquaBounty Technologies' AquAdvantage Salmon. 
The U.S. FDA has conducted a rigorous 15-year review of thousands of pages of data and has concluded that these fish are exactly the same as any other Atlantic salmon and, therefore, are safe for consumption. In addition, the fish will be sterile and required to be grown in self-contained inland tanks, posing no threat to the environment. Finally, the United Nations reports that the wild caught fisheries are severely stressed, with major food species potentially extinct by 2050, yet the demand for fish protein is exploding worldwide. America currently imports more than 97% of the Atlantic salmon consumed here, while a handful of Senators willfully ignore science-based research widely available to the public. Oddly, several of the signers have previously criticized the agency for playing politics with science when the contraceptive Plan B was under review.
Statement:
"We remain confident that the more deliberative body of the Senate will refrain from interfering in the 15-year scientific review by the U.S. FDA. The facts about the safety and the environmental benefits of the fish have been made fully public by the FDA. It would be a dangerous precedent to react to a handful of legislators' misinformed paranoia. The real waste of tax-payer dollars would be to abandon the important American principle of science-based regulation, responding instead to economic protectionist fears or subjective and emotional judgments. This is an issue greater than our application, an issue of American leadership in technology, innovation, and science based regulation."
