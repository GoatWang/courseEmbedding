Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to American Credit Acceptance Receivables Trust 2016-4


 Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) assigns preliminary ratings to five 
 classes of American Credit Acceptance Receivables Trust 2016-4 ("ACAR 
 2016-4"), an auto loan ABS (News - Alert) transaction.
 

 America Credit Acceptance Receivables Trust 2016-4 ("ACAR 2016-4" or the 
 "Issuer") will issue five classes of notes totaling $211.25 million that 
 are collateralized by a pool of retail automobile contracts, made to 
 subprime obligors and secured by new and used automobiles and 
 motorcycles.
 

 The structure for ACAR 2016-4 includes a prefunding account that will be 
 used to purchase up to 22% of the initial cutoff date pool balance and 
 expected balance of the subsequent receivables for up to 3 months after 
 closing. The transaction has initial credit enhancement levels of 62.75% 
 for the Class A Notes, 52.00% for the Class B Notes, 34.75% for the 
 Class C Notes, 19.75% for the Class D Notes and 17.00% for the Class E 
 Notes. Credit enhancement consists of excess spread, 
 overcollateralization, subordination and a reserve account funded at 
 closing.
 

 American Credit Acceptance, LLC ("ACA" or the "Company") issued its 
 first securitization in October 2011 and since then has issued fourteen 
 additional transactions in the total amount of approximately $3.1 
 billion. ACA is a subprime auto finance company that has been under 
 current ownership since 2007.
 

 KBRA applied its U.S. Auto Loan ABS methodology as part of its analysis 
 of the transaction's underlying collateral pool, the proposed capital 
 structure and ACA's historical static pool data. KBRA also conducted an 
 operational assessment on the originator and servicer, as well as a 
 review of the transaction's legal structure and transaction documents. 
 KBRA will also review the operative agreements and legal opinions for 
 the transaction prior to closing.
 

 For complete details on the analysis, please see KBRA's Pre-Sale Report, American 
 Credit Acceptance Receivables Trust 2016-4 Pre-Sale Report, which 
 was published today at www.kbra.com.

                              “I sometimes feel out of my depth when I talk to 
                              people about cars. But the whole process was 
                              smooth and simple here, and they really paid 
                              attention to my wishes.”






                              “The finance people helped me understand my budget 
                              and get the payments in order. I was able to 
                              invest in the vehicle I needed and I didn’t 
                              overstretch myself financially either. I would 
                              certainly recommend you!”










Bad Credit & No Credit

If you've got bad credit and you're looking to buy a new or used car, you're in the right place. Just click below to start the bad credit application!





Auto Financing for Everyone
We know you don’t have “perfect credit”, that’s why you’re here!  We approve ALL TYPES of credit, including consumers with fair credit, okay credit and even BAD CREDIT.

All we need is 60 seconds of your time for an instant evaluation.  We think you’ll be pleasantly surprised with the results.

The truth is, a lot of bad credit consumers just need a second chance and that's what we can offer you.  If you want to finance a car (new or used) then you’ve come to the right place.  In just seconds, we can get you financing regardless of credit history.

When you work with us you can be assured of fair contracts and interest rates, multiple offers (let them compete for you) as well as refinancing options.  We even work with divorces, repossessions and foreclosure profiles and have a great track record finding hard to get financing.

Our job is not only to offer you the lowest local interest rate financing but also to give you a low monthly cost that makes sense. Let our approval center work for you. There's no risk, no obligation and no lengthy waiting time.

Apply with Auto Approval Center and we'll send you regular status updates, the best offers and advice.

We’re so confident that we can help you out of a jam that we’re willing to bet we can offer a LOWER rate than all of our competitors.  Our huge financing volume puts us into a position where we can afford to take more risks than the average lender.

So what’s the hold up?  You can get an approval TODAY!


Auto Approval Center is a lead provider to lenders around the US. Average APR rates range from 3.2% to 24% depending on credit. Some dealers/lenders may have implications for non-payment or late payments, please see your specific terms for more information. By applying with Auto Approval Center, you agree to have your credit pulled for lending purposes and this could have an impact to your credit score. Thank You for your business!
