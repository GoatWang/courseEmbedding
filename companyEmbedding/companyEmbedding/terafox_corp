Our offering is being made on a  self-underwritten  basis:  no minimum number of
shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per
share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the
sale of 33%, 66% and 100% respectively of the securities offered for sale by the

anticipated.

(1) We do not intend to use any of the proceeds from the offering to pay for 
    the cost of the offering. The cost of the offering shall be loaned to us 
    from our officer and director, Aleksey Gagauz.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. We will establish a separate 
bank account and all proceeds will be deposited into that account. Aleksey 
Gagauz, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the company 
funds to complete the registration process. Also, these loans would be 
necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to 
implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the 
OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. Mr. Gagauz will not be repaid from the proceeds 
of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced 
by Mr. Gagauz. Our director will be repaid from revenues of operations if and 
when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.


Competition at the chosen market of printed products is relatively high. There 
exist many large companies offering various ranges of similar products in every 
geographic market we have picked for operation and expansion. Such companies 
will make it difficult for us to develop easily, as they will be our direct 
competitors. Many of such companies are large enough to provide clients with a 
well-known and preferred product assortment at possibly lower price, besides 
they already have best practice in client attraction. We may probably lose our 
business while competing with companies like that.

Terafox Corp has not yet entered the market, but we have already signed contract
with Keybievent as of September 17, 2014 and have several more companies ready 
for cooperation. As soon as we start operations, we'll become one of many 
participants of this business direction. Some of the competing companies have 
more finance, experience and management skills. Therefore, we appear in 
competitively unfavorable position as soon as we enter the market with our 
product, which makes it more complicated for us to achieve success in printed 
products market. Due to that, Terafox Corp may possibly not make its place at 
the market.


Company Description
Our company Terafox Corp was incorporated on February 26, 2014 in the State of 
Nevada United States of America, with an established end of fiscal year of 
September 30. Director of our company Aleksey Gagauz was born in Bulgaria and 
for the last 7 years has been working in company specialized in


 image printing 
on various surfaces in the position of senior manager. He no longer works for 
that business. As of today our company does not have any revenues, we possess 
minimal assets and have already incurred losses since incorporation. We are a 
development-stage company created for production of flyers, posters and 
printing images on multiple surfaces, such as glass, leather, plastic, etc. 
using automated industrial flatbed printing machine. Terafox Corp will position 
themselves as high-quality manufacturer of printed products and specialist in 
color image printing on various surfaces.

We have developed 12 months business plan, purchased and set up our first 
printing machine and signed a lease agreement for a 3 year term as of July 01, 
2014 with Sergey Pelovski, Sofia, Bulgaria. To the date we have set up our 
first printing machine, tested its operation and plan to produce a range of 
demonstration samples once we start manufacture process to attract potential 
business partners. In the beginning we may not be able to provide enough 
revenue to cover expenses for company presentation during first 12 months. We 
plan to purchase one more printing machine if we sell 33% of the shares, and 
purchase two or three more, if we sell 66% and 100% of the shares respectively. 
Our director will provide for covering initial administrative expenses using 
his personal assets.

Total estimated amount of assets necessary for our business start-up is $30,000.
We need assets to purchase and deliver printing machine, to cover general 
running and administrative expenses, for business development and marketing, 
auxiliary materials, to cover expenses connected with company public 
presentation, payment of salaries and purchase of raw materials.

Depending on the amount of finance attracted, our company will consider 
possibility of expansion to major Bulgarian cities.

PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS



THE  INFORMATION  IN THIS  PROSPECTUS IS NOT COMPLETE AND MAY BE CHANGED.  THESE
SECURITIES  MAY NOT BE SOLD  UNTIL THE  REGISTRATION  STATEMENT  FILED  WITH THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS EFFECTIVE. THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT AN OFFER
TO  SELL  THESE  SECURITIES  AND IT IS NOT  SOLICITING  AN  OFFER  TO BUY  THESE
SECURITIES  IN ANY STATE WHERE THE OFFER OR SALE IS NOT  PERMITTED.  THERE IS NO
MINIMUM PURCHASE REQUIREMENT FOR THE OFFERING TO PROCEED.



TERAFOX CORP.




9,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK



This is the initial  offering  of common  stock of Terafox  Corp.  and no public
market currently  exists for the securities  being offered.  We are offering for
sale a total of  9,000,000  shares of common stock at a fixed price of $0.01 per
share.  There is no  minimum  number of  shares  that must be sold by us for the
offering to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the
offered  shares.  The offering is being conducted on a  self-underwritten,  best
efforts basis, which means our President,  Aleksey Gagauz,  will attempt to sell
the  shares.  This  Prospectus  will  permit  our  President  to sell the shares
directly to the public, with no commission or other remuneration  payable to him
for any shares he may sell. In offering the  securities  on our behalf,  he will
rely on the safe harbor from  broker-dealer  registration  set out in Rule 3a4-1
under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.




THE SHARES  WILL BE OFFERED AT A FIXED  PRICE OF $0.01 PER SHARE FOR A PERIOD OF
240 DAYS FROM THE EFFECTIVE  DATE OF THIS  PROSPECTUS.  THE COMPANY MAY ELECT TO
EXTEND  THIS  INITIAL  OFFERING  FOR A PERIOD OF 360 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THIS
PROSPECTUS.

Terafox Corp. is a development stage company and has limited operations. To date
we have been involved  primarily in  organizational  activities.  We do not have
sufficient  capital  for  operations,  although  we have  purchased  an  initial
shipment of the products,  which are supplied from China.  Any investment in the
shares offered  herein  involves a high degree of risk. You should only purchase
shares if you can afford a loss of your investment.  Our independent  registered
public accountant has issued an audit opinion for Terafox Corp. which includes a
statement expressing  substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going
concern.


There  has been no  market  for our  securities  and a public  market  may never
develop,  or, if any market does develop,  it may not be  sustained.  Our common
stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. After the
effective date of the registration  statement  relating to this  prospectus,  we
hope to have a market  maker file an  application  with the  Financial  Industry
Regulatory  Authority  ("FINRA") for our common stock to be eligible for trading
on the  Over-the-Counter  Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation,  issuers
must remain  current in their  quarterly and annual  filings with the SEC. If we
are not able to pay the expenses  associated  with our reporting  obligations we
will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. We do not yet
have a market  maker who has  agreed to file such  application.  There can be no
assurance  that our common  stock will ever be quoted on a stock  exchange  or a
quotation service or that any market for our stock will develop.

PROSPECTUS SUMMARY



AS USED IN THIS PROSPECTUS,  UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES,  "WE," "US,"
"OUR," AND "TERAFOX  CORP." REFERS TO TERAFOX CORP.  THE FOLLOWING  SUMMARY DOES
NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ
THE ENTIRE  PROSPECTUS  BEFORE  MAKING AN  INVESTMENT  DECISION TO PURCHASE  OUR
COMMON STOCK.



TERAFOX CORP.



We  are a  development  stage  company  and  our  business  is  manufacture  and
distribution  of printed  products.  Terafox Corp was  incorporated in Nevada on
February  26,  2014.  We intend to use the net  proceeds  from this  offering to
develop our business  operations  (See  "Description  of  Business"  and "Use of
Proceeds").  To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum of $30,000
for the next  twelve  months as  described  in our Plan of  Operations.  Being a
development stage company, we have very limited operating history.  After twelve
months  period  we may need  additional  financing.  If we do not  generate  any
revenue  we may need a minimum  of  $15,000  of  additional  funding  to pay for
ongoing advertising  expenses and SEC filing  requirements.  We do not currently
have any arrangements for additional financing.  Our principal executive offices
are  located  at str.  Lege,  6,  Sofia,  Bulgaria,  1000.  Our phone  number is

+17027518466.


From inception until the date of this filing, we have had very limited operating
activities.  Our financial statements from inception (February 26, 2014) through
September  30,  2014,  reports  no  revenues  and  a net  loss  of  $(676).  Our
independent  registered  public  accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for
Terafox Corp which includes a statement  expressing  substantial doubt as to our
ability to continue  as a going  concern.  To the date,  we have  developed  our
business  plan,  purchased  one  unit of  equipment  from  "Eagle  Key  Holdings
Limited", which agreed to supply us with industrial flatbed printing machines.


As of the date of this  prospectus,  there is no public  trading  market for our
common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever
develop.


We are a "shell company" within the meaning of Rule 405, promulgated pursuant to
Securities Act, because we have nominal assets and nominal  operations.  Because
we are a shell company, the Rule 144 safe harbor is not available for the resale
of  any  restricted  securities  issued  by us in  any  subsequent  unregistered
offering.  This will likely make it more difficult for us to attract  additional
capital  through  subsequent   unregistered   offerings  because  purchasers  of
securities  in such  unregistered  offerings  will not be able to  resell  their
securities in reliance on Rule 144, a safe harbor on which holders of restricted
securities usually rely to resell securities.


We are an "emerging  growth  company" as defined in the  Jumpstart  our Business
Startups Act of 2012. For as long as we are an emerging growth company,  we will
not be required to comply with the  requirements  that are  applicable  to other
public companies that are not "emerging  growth  companies"  including,  but not
limited  to,  not  being  required  to  comply  with  the  auditor   attestation


3





requirements of Section 404 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act, the reduced  disclosure
obligations  regarding executive  compensation in our periodic reports and proxy
statements  and the  exemptions  from the  requirements  of holding a nonbinding
advisory vote on executive  compensation and shareholder  approval of any golden
parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these
reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.


We have no plans or intentions to be acquired by an operating  company nor do we
have plans to enter into a change of control or similar transaction or to change
our management.

RISK FACTORS



An  investment  in our common stock  involves a high degree of risk.  You should
carefully  consider the risks described below and the other  information in this
prospectus  before  investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks
occur,  our  business,  operating  results  and  financial  condition  could  be
seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock, when and if we trade at
a later date,  could decline due to any of these risks,  and you may lose all or
part of your investment.



RISKS ASSOCIATED TO OUR BUSINESS



WE ARE SOLELY  DEPENDENT  UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED IN THIS  OFFERING TO START
OUR BUSINESS,  THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE REVENUES AND
PROFITABLE OPERATIONS.  WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT
BE AVAILABLE.


Our current  operating  funds are less than  necessary  to complete our intended
operations in the  advertising of products and sales.  We need the proceeds from
this  offering  to  commence  activities  that  will  allow us to begin  seeking
financing of our business  plan.  As of September  30, 2014,  we had cash in the
amount of $7,694  and  liabilities  of  $14,325.  As of this  date,  we have had
limited  operations  and no income.  The  proceeds of this  offering  may not be
sufficient  for us to achieve  revenues and profitable  operations.  We may need
additional funds to achieve a sustainable  sales level where ongoing  operations
can be  funded  out of  revenues.  There is no  assurance  that  any  additional
financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to
us.

MANY OF THE  EXISTING  COPMANIES  THAT  ENGAGE IN THE SALE OF  PRINTED  PRODUCTS







BUSINESS HAVE A GREATER, MORE ESTABLIHED DATABASE THAN US



There are few  barriers of entry in the sale of printed  products  business  and
level of  competition  is  extremely  high.  There are many  domestic  companies
offering the same products.  We will be in direct  competition  with them.  Many
large companies have greater financial  capabilities than us and will be able to
provide  more  favorable  services  to the  potential  customers.  Many of these
companies may have a greater, more established customer base than us.


BECAUSE WE WILL PURCHASE OUR RAW MATERIALS  FROM  OVERSEAS,  A DISRUPTION IN THE
DELIVERY  OF  IMPORTED  SUPPLIES  MAY HAVE A  GREATER  EFFECT  ON US THAN ON OUR
COMPETITORS.


We will import raw  materials  for our  supplier  from China.  Because we keep a
minimum  stock of raw  materials  at our shop,  we believe that  disruptions  in
shipping deliveries may have a greater effect on us than on competitors who keep
a greater  stock of raw  materials  and/or  warehouse  supplies  in the  Europe.
Deliveries of our raw materials may be disrupted through factors such as:


(1)  raw material shortages, work stoppages, strikes and political unrest;


(2)  problems with ocean  shipping,  including  work stoppages and shipping
container shortages;


(3)  increased  inspections  of import  shipments or other factors  causing
delays in shipments; and


(4)  economic crises, international disputes and wars.


Most of our competitors  warehouse large quantities of raw materials they import
from overseas,  which allows them to continue  delivering their products for the
near term, despite overseas shipping disruptions. If our competitors are able to
deliver  products when we cannot,  our reputation may be damaged and we may lose
customers to our competitors.


WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE COMMENCED LIMITED  OPERATIONS IN OUR
BUSINESS.  WE EXPECT TO INCUR  SIGNIFICANT  OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE
FUTURE.


We were  incorporated  on  February  26,  2014 and to date  have  been  involved
primarily in  organizational  activities.  We have  commenced  limited  business
operations.  Accordingly,  we have no way to evaluate  the  likelihood  that our
business  will  be  successful.  Potential  investors  should  be  aware  of the
difficulties  normally  encountered by new  distribution  companies and the high
rate  of  failure  of  such  enterprises.  The  likelihood  of  success  must be
considered in light of the problems, expenses,  difficulties,  complications and
delays  encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake.
These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems


7





relating  to the  ability  to  generate  sufficient  cash  flow to  operate  our
business,  and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current  estimates.
Prior to  production  of  printed  products,  we  anticipate  that we will incur
increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues.  We expect to incur
significant  losses  into  the  foreseeable  future.  We  recognize  that if the
effectiveness  of our business plan is not  forthcoming,  we will not be able to
continue  business  operations.  There  is no  history  upon  which  to base any
assumption  as to the  likelihood  that  we  will  prove  successful,  and it is
doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable
operations.  If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will
most likely fail.


WE HAVE YET TO EARN  REVENUE  AND OUR  ABILITY  TO  SUSTAIN  OUR  OPERATIONS  IS
DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE FINANCING.  OUR INDEPENDENT  REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANT  HAS EXPRESSED  SUBSTANTIAL  DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A
GOING CONCERN.


We have accrued net losses of $676 for the period from our inception on February
26, 2014 to September 30, 2014, and have no revenues as of this date. Our future
is dependent  upon our ability to obtain  financing  and upon future  profitable
operations in the manufacturing  and distribution of printed products.  Further,
the finances  required to fully  develop our plan cannot be  predicted  with any
certainty and may exceed any estimates we set forth. We do, however,  anticipate
that we will  require  $30,000  over the  next 12  months  in order to  continue
operations.  These  factors  raise  substantial  doubt  that  we will be able to
continue as a going  concern.  Harris & Gillespie  CPA's,  PLLC our  independent
registered  public  accounting firm, has expressed  substantial  doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern.  This opinion could materially limit our
ability to raise  additional  funds by issuing new debt or equity  securities or
otherwise.  If we fail to raise sufficient  capital when needed,  we will not be
able to complete our  business  plan.  As a result we may have to liquidate  our
business and you may lose your  investment.  You should consider our independent
registered  public  accountant's  comments when  determining if an investment in
Terafox Corp. is suitable.


We require  minimum  funding of  approximately  $30,000 to conduct our  proposed
operations for a period of one year. If we are not able to raise this amount, or
if we  experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from
Aleksey  Gagauz,  our officer and director,  who has verbally  agreed to advance
funds  to allow us to pay for  professional  fees,  including  fees  payable  in
connection  with  the  filing  of  this  registration  statement  and  operation
expenses. This agreement is filed as an exhibit 10.1. After one year we may need
additional  financing.  We do not currently have any arrangements for additional
financing.


If we are  successful  in  raising  the  funds  from this  offering,  we plan to
commence  activities to start our operations.  We cannot provide  investors with
any  assurance  that we will be able to raise  sufficient  funds  to  start  our
operations.



THE EFFECT OF THE RECENT  ECONOMIC  CRISIS  MAY IMPACT OUR  BUSINESS,  OPERATING
RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITIONS.



8





The recent global crisis has caused disruption and extreme  volatility in global
financial  markets  and  increased  rates of  default  and  bankruptcy,  and has
impacted  levels of consumer  spending.  These  macroeconomic  developments  may
affect our  business,  operating  results or financial  condition in a number of
ways. For example, our potential customers may never start spending with us, may
have difficulty paying us or may delay paying us for p. A slow or uneven pace of
economic  recovery would negatively  affect our ability to start our manufacture
and  distribution  business  and obtain  financing.  Further,  our  products are
currently procured from a province of China and, should there be an interruption
in our supply of products, we might be unable to continue our operations.


WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT,  AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE
WITH OUR COMPETITORS,  OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,
CASH FLOWS AND PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.


We operate in a highly competitive environment.  Our competition includes large,
small and midsized  companies,  and many of them may distribute similar products
in our markets at  competitive  prices.  Highly  competitive  environment  could
materially  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  results of
operations, cash flows and prospects.


BECAUSE OUR SOLE  OFFICER AND DIRECTOR  WILL OWN 31% OR MORE OF OUR  OUTSTANDING
COMMON STOCK,  IF MAXIMUM  OFFERING  SHARES ARE SOLD, THEY WILL MAKE AND CONTROL
CORPORATE DECISIONS THAT MAY BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS.


If maximum  offering shares will be sold,  Aleksey Gagauz,  our sole officer and
director,  will  own  31 % of  the  outstanding  shares  of  our  common  stock.
Accordingly,  he will have  significant  influence in determining the outcome of
all  corporate  transactions  or  other  matters,   including  the  election  of
directors,  mergers,  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of
our  assets,  and also the power to  prevent or cause a change in  control.  The
interests  of  Aleksey  Gagauz  may  differ  from  the  interests  of the  other
stockholders and may result in corporate  decisions that are  disadvantageous to
other shareholders.


BECAUSE OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT HAS OTHER INTERESTS, HE MAY NOT BE ABLE OR WILLING
TO DEVOTE A SUFFICIENT  AMOUNT OF TIME TO OUR BUSINESS  OPERATIONS,  CAUSING OUR
BUSINESS TO FAIL.


Aleksey Gagauz, our President,  currently devotes approximately twenty hours per
week providing  management services to us. While he presently possesses adequate
time to attend to our  interest,  it is  possible  that the  demands on his from
other  obligations  could  increase,  with the result that he would no longer be
able to devote  sufficient  time to the management of our business.  The loss of
Aleksey Gagauz to our company could negatively impact our business development.


9





IF ALEKSEY GAGAUZ, OUR PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR, SHOULD RESIGN OR DIE, WE WILL NOT
HAVE A CHIEF EXECUTIVE  OFFICER THAT COULD RESULT IN OUR OPERATIONS  SUSPENDING.
IF THAT SHOULD OCCUR, YOU COULD LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT.


We  extremely  depend on the services of our  president  and  director,  Aleksey
Gagauz,  for the future  success of our  business.  The loss of the  services of
Aleksey Gagauz could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of  operations.  If he should resign or die we will not have a chief
executive officer.  If that should occur, until we find another person to act as
our chief executive officer, our operations could be suspended. In that event it
is possible you could lose your entire investment.


BECAUSE COMPANY'S  HEADQUARTER AND ASSETS ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES,
U.S.  INVESTORS MAY EXPERIENCE  DIFFICULTIES  IN ATTEMPTING TO EFFECT SERVICE OF
PROCESS AND TO ENFORCE JUDGMENTS BASED UPON U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AGAINST
THE COMPANY AND ITS NON-U.S. RESIDENT SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR.


While we are organized  under the laws of State of Nevada,  our sole officer and
Director  are  non-U.S.  resident  and our  headquarters  and assets are located
outside the United  States.  Consequently,  it may be difficult for investors to
affect  service of  process  on them in the United  States and to enforce in the
United States  judgments  obtained in United States courts against them based on
the civil liability  provisions of the United States  securities laws. Since all
our assets will be located  outside U.S. it may be difficult or  impossible  for
U.S. investors to collect a judgment against us.



ANY  ADDITIONAL  FUNDING WE ARRANGE  THROUGH  THE SALE OF OUR COMMON  STOCK WILL
RESULT IN DILUTION TO EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS.



We must raise additional capital in order for our business plan to succeed.  Our
most likely source of additional  capital will be through the sale of additional
shares of common stock. Such stock issuances will cause stockholders'  interests
in our company to be diluted.  Such dilution will negatively affect the value of
an investor's shares.


BECAUSE WE HAVE  ELECTED  TO DEFER  COMPLIANCE  WITH NEW OR  REVISED  ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS,  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENT  DISCLOSURE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR
COMPANIES.


We have elected to use the extended  transition period for complying with new or
revised  accounting  standards  under  Section  102(b)(1) of the  Jumpstart  Our
Business  Startups  Act.  This allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised
accounting  standards that have different effective dates for public and private
companies until those standards apply to private  companies.  As a result of our
election,  our financial  statements  may not be  comparable  to companies  that
comply with public company effective dates.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING



OUR PRESIDENT,  ALEKSEY GAGAUZ DOES NOT HAVE ANY PRIOR  EXPERIENCE  CONDUCTING A
BEST-EFFORT  OFFERING,  AND OUR BEST EFFORT  OFFERING DOES NOT REQUIRE A MIMIMUM
AMOUNT  TO BE  RAISED.  AS A RESULT  OF THIS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE  ENOUGH
FUNDS TO COMMENCE AND SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS AND  INVESTORS  MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE
INVESTMENT.


Aleksey Gagauz does not have any experience  conducting a best-effort  offering.
Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds successfully. Also, the best
effort  offering does not require a minimum  amount to be raised.  If we are not
able to raise  sufficient  funds,  we may not be able to fund our  operations as
planned,  and our business  will suffer and your  investment  may be  materially
adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a best-effort offering
could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us.



THE TRADING IN OUR SHARES  WILL BE  REGULATED  BY THE  SECURITIES  AND  EXCHANGE
COMMISSION RULE 15G-9 WHICH ESTABLISHED THE DEFINITION OF A "PENNY STOCK."



The shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the  Securities  and
Exchange  Act of  1934,  as  amended  (the  "Exchange  Act"),  and  rules of the
Commission.  The  Exchange  Act and such  penny  stock  rules  generally  impose
additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell
our  securities  to persons  other than certain  accredited  investors  who are,
generally,  institutions with assets in excess of $3,000,000 or individuals with
net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding  $200,000 ($300,000
jointly with spouse),  or in transactions not recommended by the  broker-dealer.
For  transactions  covered by the penny stock rules,  a broker  dealer must make
certain mandated  disclosures in penny stock transactions,  including the actual
sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations,  the compensation to
be received by the broker-dealer  and certain  associated  persons,  and deliver
certain disclosures  required by the Commission.  Consequently,  the penny stock
rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at
all.



BECAUSE WE ARE A SHELL  COMPANY,  IT WILL LIKELY BE  DIFFICULT  FOR US TO OBTAIN
ADDITIONAL FINANCING BY WAY OF PRIVATE OFFERINGS OF OUR SECURITIES.



We are a "shell company" within the meaning of Rule 405, promulgated pursuant to
Securities  Act,  because  we  have  nominal  assets  and  nominal   operations.
Accordingly,  the holders of  securities  purchased in private  offerings of our
securities we make to investors will not be able to rely on the safe harbor from
being  deemed  an  underwriter  under  SEC Rule 144 in  order  to  resell  their
securities. This will likely make it more difficult for us to attract additional
capital  through  subsequent   unregistered   offerings  because  purchasers  of
securities  in such  unregistered  offerings  will not be able to  resell  their
securities in reliance on Rule 144, a safe harbor on which holders of restricted
securities usually rely to resell securities.


11






WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING  WITHOUT AN  UNDERWRITER  AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL
ANY SHARES.



This  offering  is  self-underwritten,  that is, we are not going to engage  the
services  of an  underwriter  to sell the  shares;  we intend to sell our shares
through our President,  who will receive no  commissions.  There is no guarantee
that he will be able to sell  any of the  shares.  Unless  he is  successful  in
selling all of the shares and we receive the proceeds from this offering, we may
have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan.



DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES,  YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY
SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS  OFFERING.



We are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently
no demand for our common stock and no public  market exists for the shares being
offered  in this  prospectus.  We plan to  contact  a market  maker  immediately
following the  completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on
the  Over-the-Counter  Bulletin  Board  ("OTCBB").  The  OTCBB  is  a  regulated
quotation service that displays  real-time  quotes,  last sale prices and volume
information in over-the-counter  securities.  The OTCBB is not an issuer listing
service,  market  or  exchange.  Although  the OTCBB  does not have any  listing
requirements  per se, to be eligible for  quotation  on the OTCBB,  issuers must
remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority.
If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations
we will not be able to apply for  quotation  on the OTC Bulletin  Board.  Market
makers are not permitted to begin  quotation of a security whose issuer does not
meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become
delinquent in their  required  filings will be removed  following a 30 to 60 day
grace  period if they do not make their  required  filing  during that time.  We
cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock
listed and quoted for sale.  As of the date of this  filing,  there have been no
discussions  or  understandings  between  Terafox Corp. and anyone acting on our
behalf, with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market
for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will
be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a
case,  you may find  that you are  unable  to  achieve  any  benefit  from  your
investment or liquidate your shares without  considerable  delay,  if at all. In
addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market,
your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if
not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize
any value from your investment.


WE WILL INCUR  ONGOING  COSTS AND EXPENSES  FOR SEC  REPORTING  AND  COMPLIANCE.
WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE,  MAKING IT DIFFICULT
FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL.


The estimated  cost of this  registration  statement is $8,000.  We will have to
utilize funds from Aleksey  Gagauz,  our officer and director,  who has verbally
agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. After the
effective date of this prospectus, we will be required to file annual, quarterly
and  current  reports,  or other  information  with the SEC as  provided  by the
Securities Exchange Act. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following


12





the  close  of the  offering  and  apply to have the  shares  quoted  on the OTC
Electronic  Bulletin  Board.  To be eligible for quotation,  issuers must remain
current in their  filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in  compliance
we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings,  which could
comprise  a  substantial  portion of our  available  cash  resources.  The costs
associated  with being a publicly  traded  company in the next 12 months will be
approximately $8,000. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain
in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase,
if at all.  Also,  if we are not able to pay the  expenses  associated  with our
reporting  obligations  we will not be able to apply  for  quotation  on the OTC
Bulletin Board.


OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAVE NO EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH
IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN  DISCLOSURE  CONTROLS AND  PROCEDURES  AND
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.


We have never operated as a public company. Aleksey Gagauz, our sole officer and
director,  has no  experience  managing a public  company  which is  required to
establish and maintain  disclosure  controls and procedures and internal control
over  financial  reporting.  As  a  result,  we  may  not  be  able  to  operate
successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan
to comply with all of the various rules and regulations,  which are required for
a  public  company.  However,  if we  cannot  operate  successfully  as a public
company, your investment may be materially adversely affected.  Our inability to
operate  as a public  company  could be the  basis of your  losing  your  entire
investment in us.



AS AN "EMERGING  GROWTH COMPANY" UNDER THE JOBS ACT, WE ARE PERMITTED TO RELY ON
EXEMPTIONS FROM CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.



We qualify as an "emerging  growth company" under the JOBS Act. As a result,  we
are  permitted  to, and intend to, rely on  exemptions  from certain  disclosure
requirements.  For so long as we are an emerging growth company,  we will not be
required to:


*    have  an  auditor  report  on our  internal  controls  over  financial
reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;


*    comply with any requirement  that may be adopted by the Public Company
Accounting  Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or
a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional  information
about  the  audit  and the  financial  statements  (i.e.,  an  auditor
discussion and analysis);


*    submit certain executive  compensation matters to shareholder advisory
votes, such as "say-on-pay" and "say-on-frequency;" and


*    disclose  certain  executive  compensation  related  items such as the
correlation   between  executive   compensation  and  performance  and
comparisons of the Chief  Executive's  compensation to median employee
compensation.


13





In addition,  Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging  growth
company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section
7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities  Act for complying  with new or revised  accounting
standards.  In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of
certain  accounting  standards  until those  standards  would otherwise apply to
private  companies.  We have  elected to take  advantage of the benefits of this
extended  transition  period.  Our  financial  statements  may  therefore not be
comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting
standards.


We will remain an "emerging  growth  company" for up to five years, or until the
earliest of (i) the last day of the first  fiscal year in which our total annual
gross  revenues  exceed  $1  billion,  (ii)  the  date  that we  become a "large
accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934,  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held
by  non-affiliates  exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most
recently  completed  second  fiscal  quarter  or (iii) the date on which we have
issued more than $1 billion in  non-convertible  debt during the preceding three
year period.


Until such time,  however,  we cannot  predict if investors will find our common
stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors
find our common stock less  attractive  as a result,  there may be a less active
trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.



INVESTORS THAT NEED TO RELY ON DIVIDEND INCOME OR LIQUIDITY  SHOULD NOT PURCHASE
SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.



We have not  declared  or paid any  dividends  on our  common  stock  since  our
inception,  and  we  do  not  anticipate  paying  any  such  dividends  for  the
foreseeable  future.  Investors that need to rely on dividend  income should not
invest in our common  stock,  as any income would only come from any rise in the
market  price  of our  common  stock,  which  is  uncertain  and  unpredictable.
Investors  that require  liquidity  should also not invest in our common  stock.
There is no established trading market and should one develop, it will likely be
volatile and subject to minimal trading volumes.



ANTI-TAKEOVER  EFFECTS  OF  CERTAIN  PROVISIONS  OF NEVADA  STATE  LAW  HINDER A
POTENTIAL TAKEOVER OF US.



Though not now, in the future we may become  subject to Nevada's  control  share
law. A corporation is subject to Nevada's  control share law if it has more than
200 stockholders,  at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents
of Nevada, and it does business in Nevada or through an affiliated  corporation.
The law focuses on the  acquisition of a "controlling  interest" which means the
ownership of  outstanding  voting shares  sufficient,  but for the control share
law, to enable the acquiring person to exercise the following proportions of the
voting power of the  corporation in the election of directors:  (i) one-fifth or
more but less than  one-third,  (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority,
or (iii) a majority or more.  The ability to exercise  such voting  power may be
direct or indirect, as well as individual or in association with others.


14





The effect of the  control  share law is that the  acquiring  person,  and those
acting in  association  with it,  obtains only such voting rights in the control
shares as are conferred by a resolution of the  stockholders of the corporation,
approved at a special or annual meeting of  stockholders.  The control share law
contemplates  that  voting  rights  will be  considered  only  once by the other
stockholders.  Thus,  there is no  authority  to strip  voting  rights  from the
control shares of an acquiring  person once those rights have been approved.  If
the stockholders do not grant voting rights to the control shares acquired by an
acquiring person,  those shares do not become permanent  non-voting  shares. The
acquiring  person is free to sell its shares to  others.  If the buyers of those
shares  themselves  do not acquire a controlling  interest,  their shares do not
become governed by the control share law.


If control  shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring  person has
acquired  control  shares  with a  majority  or more of the  voting  power,  any
stockholder  of record,  other than an  acquiring  person,  who has not voted in
favor of  approval  of voting  rights is  entitled to demand fair value for such
stockholder's shares.


Nevada's control share law may have the effect of discouraging  takeovers of the
corporation.


In addition  to the control  share law,  Nevada has a business  combination  law
which prohibits certain business  combinations  between Nevada  corporations and
"interested  stockholders"  for three years after the  "interested  stockholder"
first becomes an "interested  stockholder,"  unless the  corporation's  board of
directors  approves the  combination in advance.  For purposes of Nevada law, an
"interested stockholder" is any person who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly
or  indirectly,  of ten percent or more of the voting  power of the  outstanding
voting  shares of the  corporation,  or (ii) an  affiliate  or  associate of the
corporation  and at any time within the three  previous years was the beneficial
owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of the
then outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term "business
combination"  is  sufficiently  broad to cover virtually any kind of transaction
that would allow a potential acquirer to use the corporation's assets to finance
the  acquisition  or  otherwise  to benefit  its own  interests  rather than the
interests of the corporation and its other stockholders.


The effect of Nevada's  business  combination  law is to potentially  discourage
parties interested in taking control of us from doing so if it cannot obtain the
approval of our board of directors.






FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS



This  prospectus  contains  forward-looking  statements  that  involve  risk and
uncertainties.  We use words such as "anticipate",  "believe", "plan", "expect",
"future",  "intend",  and similar  expressions to identify such  forward-looking
statements.  Investors  should  be  aware  that all  forward-looking  statements
contained  within this filing are good faith  estimates of  management as of the
date of this  filing.  Our actual  results  could differ  materially  from those
anticipated in these forward-looking  statements for many reasons, including the
risks faced by us as described in the "Risk  Factors"  section and  elsewhere in
this prospectus.

USE OF PROCEEDS



Our offering is being made on a  self-underwritten  basis:  no minimum number of
shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per
share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the
sale of 33%, 66% and 100% respectively of the securities offered for sale by the
Company.  There  is no  assurance  that  we  will  raise  the  full  $90,000  as
anticipated.

The above figures  represent only estimated  costs. We will establish a separate
bank account and all proceeds will be deposited into that account. If necessary,
Aleksey  Gagauz,  our president and  director,  has verbally  agreed to loan the
company funds to complete the registration  process.  Also, these loans would be
necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement
our  business  plan and  maintain  reporting  status  and  quotation  on the OTC
Electronic  Bulletin  Board.  Mr. Gagauz will not be repaid from the proceeds of
this  offering.  There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by
Mr. Gagauz.  Our director will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when
we generate revenues to pay the obligation.



DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE



The  offering  price of the shares has been  determined  arbitrarily  by us. The
price does not bear any  relationship to our assets,  book value,  earnings,  or
other established  criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining
the  number  of  shares  to be  offered  and the  offering  price,  we took into
consideration  our  cash on hand  and the  amount  of  money  we  would  need to
implement  our business  plan.  Accordingly,  the  offering  price should not be
considered an indication of the actual value of the securities.

DILUTION



The price of the  current  offering  is fixed at $0.01 per share.  This price is
significantly  higher  than the price paid by the  Company's  officer for common
equity since the Company's  inception on February 26, 2014.  Aleksey Gagauz, the
Company's president and director, paid $0.001 per share for the 4,000,000 shares
of common stock he purchased from the Company.


As of September 30, 2014,  the  historical net tangible book value was $3,324 or
approximately $0.001 per share.  Historical net tangible book value per share of
common  stock is equal to our total  tangible  assets  less  total  liabilities,
divided by the number of shares of common stock  outstanding as of September 30,
2014.


Assuming the  completion of the sale of all 9,000,000  shares of common stock in
this offering, there will be 13,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding.


The following  table  illustrates per share of common stock dilution that may be
experienced by investors at various funding levels:








Funding Level                           100%           66%              33%

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION



Our cash balance is $7,649 as of September 30, 2014. We believe our cash balance
is not  sufficient to fund our limited  levels of  operations  for any period of
time.  We have been  utilizing  and may  continue to utilize  funds from Aleksey
Gagauz,  our Chairman and President,  who has informally agreed to advance funds
to allow us to pay for offering costs,  filing fees, and professional  fees. Mr.
Gagauz,  however,  has no formal commitment,  arrangement or legal obligation to
advance  or loan  funds  to the  company.  In  order  to  implement  our plan of
operations for the next twelve month period, we require approximately $30,000 of
additional capital, as previously disclosed.  Being a development stage company,
we have very limited operating  history.  After twelve months period we may need
additional  financing.  We do not currently have any arrangements for additional


17





financing.  Our principal  executive offices are located at str. Lege, 6, Sofia,
Bulgaria, 1000. Our phone number is +17027518466.


We are a development  stage  company and have  generated no revenue to the date.
Long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering will be
required to fully  implement our business plan. The exact amount of funding will
depend on the scale of our  expansion.  We have not  decided yet on the scale of
our expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing.
If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $15,000 of additional
funding to run out business  while we reassess our  situation  and decide on the
scale of our future expansion if any.


Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion.
This means that there is  substantial  doubt that we can continue as an on-going
business for the next twelve months unless we obtain  additional  capital to pay
our bills.  This is because we have not  generated  revenues and no revenues are
anticipated  until we complete  our initial  business  development.  There is no
assurance we will ever reach that stage.


To meet our need for cash we are  attempting to raise money from this  offering.
We believe that we will be able to raise enough money  through this  offering to
start  our  proposed  operations  but we  cannot  guarantee  that  once we start
operations  we will  stay in  business  after  doing  so.  If we are  unable  to
successfully  find  customers  we may  quickly  use up the  proceeds  from  this
offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have
not made any  arrangements  to raise  additional  cash,  other than through this
offering.


If we need  additional  cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend
operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely.  Even if we
raise $90,000 from this  offering,  it will last one year,  but we may need more
funds for business  operations  in the next year,  and we will have to revert to
obtaining additional money.


Because we generated less than $1 billion in total annual gross revenues  during
our most  recently  completed  fiscal year,  we qualify as an  "emerging  growth
company" under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups ("JOBS") Act.


We will lose our emerging  growth company  status on the earliest  occurrence of
any of the following events:


1.   on the  last  day of any  fiscal  year in  which  we earn at  least $1
billion in total annual gross  revenues,  which amount is adjusted for
inflation every five years;


2.   on the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer  following  the fifth
anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity  securities
pursuant to an effective registration statement;


3.   on the date on  which we have,  during  the  previous  3-year  period,
issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or


18





4.   the date on which  such  issuer is  deemed to be a `large  accelerated
filer',  as defined in section  240.12b-2 of title 17, Code of Federal
Regulations, or any successor thereto."


A "large  accelerated  filer" is an issuer that,  at the end of its fiscal year,
meets the following conditions:


1.   it  has  an  aggregate  worldwide  market  value  of  the  voting  and
non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of $700 million or
more  as of  the  last  business  day of the  issuer's  most  recently
completed second fiscal quarter;


2.   It has been subject to the  requirements  of section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Act for a period of at least twelve calendar months; and


3.   It has filed at least one annual  report  pursuant to section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Act.


As an emerging  growth  company,  exemptions  from the following  provisions are
available to us:


1.   Section  404(b)  of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002,  which  requires
auditor attestation of internal controls;


2.   Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934,  which
require  companies  to hold  shareholder  advisory  votes on executive
compensation and golden parachute compensation;


3.   Section   14(i)  of  the   Exchange   Act  (which  has  not  yet  been
implemented),  which requires  companies to disclose the  relationship
between  executive   compensation  actually  paid  and  the  financial
performance of the company;


4.   Section  953(b)(1)  of the  Dodd-Frank  Act  (which  has not yet  been
implemented),  which requires  companies to disclose the ratio between
the annual total  compensation of the CEO and the median of the annual
total compensation of all employees of the companies; and


5.   The  requirement  to  provide  certain  other  executive  compensation
disclosure  under Item 402 of  Regulation  S-K.  Instead,  an emerging
growth  company must only comply with the more limited  provisions  of
Item 402 applicable to smaller reporting companies,  regardless of the
issuer's size.


Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, an emerging  growth  company may choose
to forgo such exemption and instead comply with the  requirements  that apply to
an issuer that is not an emerging  growth  company.  We have elected to maintain
our status as an  emerging  growth  company and take  advantage  of the JOBS Act
provisions.

We plan to  implement  our business  plan as soon as funds from public  offering
become  available.  The following  table sets forth our 12-month  budgeted costs
assuming  the sale of 33%,  66% and 100% of  shares,  respectively.  There is no

The above figures represent only estimated costs.


In  summary,  during  1st-4th  month we  should  have  established  our  office,
developed  our website and  purchased  equipment.  After this point we should be
ready to start more significant  operations and generate revenue.  During months
5th-12th we will be executing our marketing campaign. There is no assurance that
we will  generate  any revenue in the first 12 months  after  completion  of our
offering.



OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



We have no off-balance sheet  arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition,  revenues or  expenses,  results of  operations,  liquidity,  capital
expenditures or capital resources.


26






LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL



There is no  historical  financial  information  about us upon  which to base an
evaluation of our performance.  We are in start-up stage operations and have not
generated  any  revenues.  We  cannot  guarantee  we will be  successful  in our
business  operations.   Our  business  is  subject  to  risks  inherent  in  the
establishment of a new business enterprise,  including limited capital resources
and  possible  cost  overruns  due to price and cost  increases  in services and
products.


We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable
terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory  terms, we may be unable to
continue,  develop or expand our  operations.  Equity  financing could result in
additional dilution to existing shareholders.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




FROM INCEPTION ON FEBRUARY 26, 2014 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2014



From inception until the date of this filing, we have had very limited operating
activities.  Our financial statements from inception (February 26, 2014) through
September  30,  2014,  net  loss of  $676.  Our  independent  registered  public
accounting  firm has issued an audit opinion for Terafox Corp.  which includes a
statement expressing  substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going
concern.

Since  inception,  we have sold  4,000,000  shares  of common  stock to our sole
officer and director for net proceeds of $4,000.





LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



As of September 30, 2014, the Company had $7,649 cash and our  liabilities  were
$14,325 of which we owe $14,325 to our president  Aleksey Gagauz.  The available
capital  reserves of the Company  are not  sufficient  for the Company to remain
operational.


Since  inception,  we have sold  4,000,000  shares of common  stocks to our sole
officer and director,  at a price of $0.001 per share, for aggregate proceeds of
$4,000.


We are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operation.  We will
have to utilize funds from Aleksey  Gagauz,  our officer and  director,  who has
verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration  process.
This  agreement  filed as Exhibit 10.1. Our current cash on hand will be used to
pay the fees and  expenses  of this  offering.  To proceed  with our  operations
within 12 months,  we need a minimum of $30,000.We cannot guarantee that we will
be able to sell all the  shares  required  to  satisfy  our 12 months  financial
requirement. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items
set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus.  We will attempt to
raise  at  least  the  minimum  funds  necessary  to  proceed  with  our plan of
operation.


27





Our  auditors  have  issued a "going  concern"  opinion,  meaning  that there is
substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve
months  unless  we  obtain  additional  capital.  No  substantial  revenues  are
anticipated  until we have  completed  the  financing  from  this  offering  and
implemented  our plan of  operations.  The other  source of cash would be a loan
from our President and Director, Aleksey Gagauz, with whom we have a verbal loan
agreement,  filed as an exhibit  10.1, or we will  consider  selling  additional
common  stock.  We  currently do not have any such  agreement in place.  We must
raise cash to implement  our  strategy  and stay in business.  The amount of the
offering  will  likely  allow us to  operate  for at least one year and have the
capital resources  required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly
reporting.  The company  anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a
reporting public company will be approximately $8,000.


We are highly  dependent upon the success of the private  offerings of equity or
debt  securities,  as described  herein.  Therefore,  the failure  thereof would
result in the need to seek capital from other  resources  such as taking  loans,
which  would  likely not even be  possible  for the  Company.  However,  if such
financing  were  available,  because we are a development  stage company with no
operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with
high risk loans and be subject to an above market  interest  rate.  At such time
these  funds are  required,  management  would  evaluate  the terms of such debt
financing. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds, the Company would be
required to cease business operations.  As a result, investors would lose all of
their investment.



SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




BASIS OF PRESENTATION



The Company reports revenues and expenses using the accrual method of accounting
for financial and tax reporting purposes.


USE OF ESTIMATES



Management uses estimates and assumption in preparing these financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Those estimates and
assumptions  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,   the
disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities,  and the reported revenues and
expenses.







DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND CAPITALIZATION



The Company records  depreciation and amortization  when appropriate  using both
straight-line  and declining  balance methods over the estimated  useful life of
the assets (five to seven years).  Expenditures  for maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred.  Additions, major renewals and replacements that
increase the property's  useful life are capitalized.  Property sold or retired,
together  with  the  related  accumulated   depreciation  is  removed  from  the
appropriated accounts and the resultant gain or loss is included in net income.


28






INCOME TAXES



We account for income taxes as required by the Income Tax Topic of the FASB ASC,
which  requires  recognition  of  deferred  tax  liabilities  and assets for the
expected  future  tax  consequences  of events  that have been  included  in the
financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities
and  assets  are  determined  based  on the  difference  between  the  financial
statement  and tax bases of assets and  liabilities  using  enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.



FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS



Accounting  Standards  Codification Topic 820,  "Disclosures About Fair Value of
Financial  Instruments",  requires  the  Company to  disclose,  when  reasonably
attainable,  the fair  market  values of its  assets and  liabilities  which are
deemed to be financial instruments.  The Company's financial instruments consist
primarily of cash.



PER SHARE INFORMATION



The Company  computes  per share  information  by dividing  the net loss for the
period  presented by the weighted  average number of shares  outstanding  during
such period.



DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS




GENERAL



Our company  Terafox Corp was  incorporated on February 26, 2014 in the State of
Nevada  United  States of  America,  with an  established  end of fiscal year of
September 30.  Director of our company  Aleksey  Gagauz was born in Bulgaria and
for the last 7 years has been working in company  specialized  in image printing
on various  surfaces in the position of senior manager.  As of today our company
does not have any revenues,  we possess minimal assets and have already incurred
losses  since  incorporation.  We are a  development-stage  company  created for
production of flyers, posters and printing images on multiple surfaces,  such as
glass,  leather,  plastic,  etc. using  automated  industrial  flatbed  printing
machine.  Terafox Corp will position themselves as high-quality  manufacturer of
printed products and specialist in color image printing on various surfaces.


We have  developed  12  months  business  plan,  purchased  and set up our first
printing  machine and signed a lease  agreement for a 3 year term as of July 01,
2014 with Sergey Pelovski, Sofia, Bulgaria. To the date we have set up our first
printing  machine,  tested  its  operation  and  plan  to  produce  a  range  of
demonstration  samples once we start  manufacture  process to attract  potential
business partners. In the beginning we may not be able to provide enough revenue
to cover expenses for company  presentation  during first 12 months.  We plan to
purchase one more  printing  machine if we sell 33% of the shares,  and purchase
two or  three  more,  if we sell 66% and 100% of the  shares  respectively.  Our
director will provide for covering  initial  administrative  expenses  using his
personal assets.


29





Total estimated amount of assets necessary for our business start-up is $30,000.
We need  assets to purchase  and  deliver  printing  machine,  to cover  general
running and  administrative  expenses,  for business  development and marketing,
auxiliary   materials,   to  cover   expenses   connected  with  company  public
presentation, payment of salaries and purchase of raw materials.


Depending  on the  amount  of  finance  attracted,  our  company  will  consider
possibility of expansion to major Bulgarian cities.



PRODUCT



Our product can be represented by wide range of goods produced using  industrial
flatbed printing machine we chose. Products include, but not limited to: flyers,

chains,  laptops,  etc.  There  can be as many  items  in the  list of  possible
products as rich client's imagination may be.

favorite hobby printed on.



INDUSTRIAL FLATBED PRINTING MACHINE



We plan to purchase fully automated portable industrial flatbed printing machine
for  printing on most  surfaces.  The  printing  machine  does not require  high
technical skills for product  manufacture.  The set of printing machine includes
the machine  itself and all raw materials  necessary for setting up and testing.
The cost of one machine is $10,000,  which includes  prime cost,  delivery cost,
customs clearance and insurance.

TARGET MARKET



Our  product is unique  enough to get any  market  segments  interested.  We can
determine  two  different  directions  our  product  can cover -  corporate  and
private.


By  corporate  we mean large and small  companies,  which always care much about
image and update company  information,  highlight  upcoming  promotional  events
using printed products,  such as flyers,  booklets,  etc. Corporate style of any
company is often  reflected by printed images on folders,  souvenirs,  notepads,
laptops  and  others.  We are  ready to  provide  image  printing  on any of the
aforesaid products.


By private we mean any private  events,  where  memorable gifts can be suitable.
Weddings,  birthdays,  anniversaries  - any holiday of any scale can become even
more  memorable  with  some  kind of  commemorative  image  on a glass  or metal
souvenir, which can be hanged on the wall, for example.

Terafox Corp is able to offer any type of client the very  printed  product that
can meet their very special requirements.



INDUSTRY ANALYSIS



In any city we plan to  expand  our  operations  to  there  are  multiple  event
agencies,  advertising  agencies and other enterprises that may be interested in
cooperation with our company.  We offer  high-quality  and inexpensive  product,
which can satisfy any client requirements.


Besides  such  kind of  distribution  network  we plan to sign  agreements  with
creative  agencies that can develop  unique  designs for their clients and offer
our services as their subcontractor for high-quality printing on any surfaces.


We are ready to offer up to 30% commission from sales to our potential partners.


We also plan to have a special  section on our  website for  potential  partners
with examples of our products and offers for wholesale clients and partners.



MARKETS



Essentially,  consumer market of Terafox Corp includes any person or any company
willing to emphasize their  personality or image,  promote new product series or
highlight an upcoming event.  By virtue of the abilities of our  multifunctional
printing  machine,  we can overtake market of phone and tablet cases, as well as
laptop  stickers.  Technologies  get  more and  more  developed  each day and it
becomes a will of almost every  individual to have a unique case for his gadget.
This also applies to any company with  well-recognized  brand.  Minimal expenses
for product  manufacture and simplicity of printing  machine usage enables us to
reduce the cost of the offered product,  which subsequently makes it interesting
for many.


As for geography related markets, we start our operations from Sofia,  Bulgaria.
Afterwards,  we will expand our business to other large cities in Bulgaria, such
as Varna, Plovdiv, Burgas, if we sell 66% or more of the shares.



MARKETING



We plan to launch  marketing  campaign 4 months after  completion  of our public
offer.


Our marketing campaign consists of several directions.


First of all we will start out from  straight  marketing,  such as offering  our
product at the fairs and  exhibitions,  handing out  souvenirs and booklets with
description of our product,  which will be a great demonstration of high-quality
and affordability of our product.


Launch of our  e-commerce  ready  web-site,  banners  on  popular  websites  and
advertisements in social networks will be the second step of our campaign.


32





Besides aforesaid we will send our commercial quotations to event,  creative, PR
and  advertising  agencies,  which can raise customer  awareness and attract new
partners. The interest offered will be up to 30% discount.


Upon raising 2/3 and more of intended  amount we shall  advertise our product in
media,  on  radio,  TV and on  billboards.  Such  marketing  action  will  raise
awareness among people and increase wholesale customers trust in our company.


In the  course of our  campaign  we shall  contact PR  departments  of large and
developing companies and offer our services and products.  We are ready to offer
a reasonable  discount for large  orders.  As we are small and  developing-stage
company,  we will be of high interest among such companies with our  competitive
price and high-quality products.


We have developed a discount system for our regular and wholesale customers:


At single order from $1,000 - 5% discount from the total order amount; At single
order from $5,000 - 10% discount; At single order from $10,000 - 15% discount.


Regular  clients  with  small  orders  may  be  provided  a 5%  discount  at the
discretion of our Director.


Distributors and partners get 30% discount.


We also plan to have a discount lottery at fairs and in social networks.


This marketing campaign is designed to attract many clients and develop a strong
reputation of high-quality,  diligent and inexpensive  manufacturer.  Hopefully,
our clients will readily recommend us to others.



STORAGE AND DELIVERY



The product  produced by Terafox Corp doesn't require any storage  facilities as
it will be  manufactured  directly for each order.  The number of  demonstration
samples to be kept is insignificant and doesn't require any special premises for
storage. We are going to sign a contract with delivery company on regular basis.
Term of  delivery  shall be not more than 7 days,  which shall  include  product
manufacture and delivery to the client.


Our  machines  will be located at our leased  premise in Sofia and  manufactured
products will be shipped to other Bulgarian cities from there.



LEASE AGREEMENT



We provide lease agreement summary as follows:


33





Terafox  Corp has signed  lease  agreement  as of  01/07/2014  coming into force
February 01, 2015 with Sergey Pelovski,  Sofia,  Bulgaria,  for 3 year term. The
premise allows us to place 4 industrial flatbed printing machines.  According to
the  agreement  we lease 40 square  meters of premises on the first floor of the
building at 19 Yakubitsa Str.,  Sofia 1164,  Bulgaria.  The agreed annual rental
fee is $6,000  for the first year of lease and will be reduced to $5,400 for the
second and third years of lease. The agreement provides for lease renovation for
additional one year term upon written notice from Terafox Corp.


A copy of the Lease  Agreement  is filed as  exhibit  10.2 to this  registration
statement.



CONTRACTS



Terafox Corp. has signed sales  contract with  Keybievent.  We provide  contract
summary as follows:


Sales  contract #1/1 was signed on September  17, 2014 between  Terafox Corp and
Keybievent.  In the  contract  Keybievent  (the  Buyer) has  agreed to  purchase
printed products produced by Terafox Corp. The Parties have agreed that no Party
has a minimum of goods  required to be sold or  purchased  from  another  Party.
Printed  products will be sold to Keybievent  with 30% discount.  Contract comes
into force on March 01, 2015.


A copy of the Lease  Agreement  is filed as  exhibit  10.3 to this  registration
statement.





COMPETITION



Competition at the chosen market of printed  products is relatively  high. There
exist many large companies  offering various ranges of similar products in every
geographic  market we have picked for operation and  expansion.  Such  companies
will make it  difficult  for us to  develop  easily,  as they will be our direct
competitors.  Many of such companies are large enough to provide  clients with a
well-known and preferred  product  assortment at possibly  lower price,  besides
they already have best practice in client  attraction.  We may probably lose our
business while competing with companies like that.


Terafox Corp has not yet entered the market, but we have already signed contract
with  Keybievent  as of September  17, 2014  (contract  copy is filed as exhibit
10.3) and have several more companies ready for cooperation. As soon as we start
operations,  we'll become one of many  participants of this business  direction.
Some of the competing  companies  have more finance,  experience  and management
skills. Therefore, we appear in competitively unfavorable position as soon as we
enter the market with our  product,  which makes it more  complicated  for us to
achieve  success in  printed  products  market.  Due to that,  TERAFOX  CORP may
possibly not make its place at the market.



INSURANCE



We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain  insurance in the
future.  As we do not have  insurance,  and if we are  made a party of  products
liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation.  In
that case,  judgment could be rendered against us, which could cause us to cease
operations.


34









EMPLOYEES



We are a development  stage company and currently have no employees,  other than
our  Director  -  Aleksey  Gagauz,  who  will  initially  perform  all  works in
production and organization of our business, besides part time workers hired for
temporal and short-term works.



GOVERNMENT REGULATION



We will be required  to comply with all  regulations,  rules and  directives  of
governmental  authorities  and  agencies  applicable  to  our  business  in  any
jurisdiction  which  we  would  conduct  activities.  We  do  not  believe  that
regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.






DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, PROMOTER AND CONTROL PERSONS



The names,  ages and  titles of our  executive  officers  and  directors  are as
follows:






Name and Address of Executive
  Officer and/or Director                 Age             Position
  -----------------------                 ---             --------

Aleksey Gagauz                            32     President, Secretary, Treasurer
str. Lege, 6, Sofia, Bulgaria, 1000              and Director








Aleksey Gagauz has acted as our President, Treasurer and sole Director since our
incorporation on February 26, 2014. Aleksey Gagauz was born on April 26, 1982 in
Moldova.  Aleksey did Masters  Degree in Economy and  Management  in Commerce in
Technical University of Moldova.

officer:








- studied in Technical University of Moldova                  1999 - 2004
- assistant manager in Certitudine SRL, Kishinev              2003 - 2005

Mr. Gagauz had durable  experience in sales. We consider this area to be of high
importance  for our  business.  Skills in sales will  obviously  be reflected in
company politics and negotiations with our potential  clients.  The last company
he worked for had a similar  kind of business our company is going to engage in,
which gives him complete  understanding  of the process and  experience  in this
area of  operations.  As Mr.  Gagauz  has  reached  a  certain  level at his job


35





position  we can  consider  him to be  progressive,  improving  and  hardworking
person. We find such  qualifications to be suitable for a person taking position
of Director.


During the past ten years, Aleksey Gagauz has not been the subject to any of the
following events:


1. Any  bankruptcy  petition  filed by or  against  any  business  of which
Aleksey Gagauz was a general partner or executive  officer either at the time of
the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time.


2. Any  conviction  in a criminal  proceeding or being subject to a pending
criminal proceeding.


3. An order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently  reversed,  suspended or
vacated,  or any court of competent  jurisdiction,  permanently  or  temporarily
enjoining,   barring,   suspending  or  otherwise   limiting   Aleksey  Gagauz's
involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities.


4. Found by a court of  competent  jurisdiction  (in a civil  action),  the
Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Future Trading Commission to
have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment
has not been reversed, suspended or vacated.



TERM OF OFFICE



Each of our directors is appointed to hold office until the next annual  meeting
of our stockholders or until his respective  successor is elected and qualified,
or until he  resigns  or is removed in  accordance  with the  provisions  of the
Nevada Revised Statues. Our officers are appointed by our Board of Directors and
hold office until removed by the Board or until their resignation.



DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE



Our board of directors is currently composed of one member,  Aleksey Gagauz, who
does not qualify as an  independent  director in  accordance  with the published
listing  requirements  of the NASDAQ  Global  Market.  The  NASDAQ  independence
definition  includes a series of objective  tests,  such as that the director is
not, and has not been for at least three years,  one of our  employees  and that
neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types
of business dealings with us. In addition, our board of directors has not made a
subjective  determination as to each director that no relationships exist which,
in the opinion of our board of directors,  would  interfere with the exercise of
independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director,  though
such subjective  determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of
directors made these determinations,  our board of directors would have reviewed
and discussed  information  provided by the directors and us with regard to each
director's business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate
to us and our management.

2014 Aleksey Gagauz advanced us $14,325.  Aleksey Gagauz will not be repaid from
the  proceeds of this  offering.  There is no due date for the  repayment of the
funds advanced by Aleksey Gagauz. Aleksey Gagauz will be repaid from revenues of
operations if and when we generate  revenues to pay the obligation.  There is no
assurance  that  we  will  ever  generate  revenues  from  our  operations.  The
obligation  to  Aleksey  Gagauz  does not  bear  interest.  There is no  written
agreement  evidencing the advancement of funds by Mr. Gagauz or the repayment of
the funds to Mr. Gagauz. The entire transaction was oral.

(1) A  beneficial  owner of a security  includes  any person  who,  directly  or
indirectly, through any contract, arrangement,  understanding,  relationship, or
otherwise has or shares:  (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or
to direct the voting of shares;  and (ii) investment  power,  which includes the
power to dispose  or direct the  disposition  of shares.  Certain  shares may be
deemed  to be  beneficially  owned by more than one  person  (if,  for  example,
persons  share the  power to vote or the power to  dispose  of the  shares).  In
addition,  shares are deemed to be beneficially  owned by a person if the person
has the right to acquire the shares (for  example,  upon  exercise of an option)
within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing
the  percentage  ownership of any person,  the amount of shares  outstanding  is
deemed to include  the amount of shares  beneficially  owned by such person (and
only such person) by reason of these  acquisition  rights.  As of September  30,
2014, there were 4,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.






PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



Terafox Corp. has 4,000,000  shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of
the date of this  prospectus.  The  Company  is  registering  an  additional  of
9,000,000  shares of its common  stock for sale at the price of $0.01 per share.
There is no  arrangement  to address the possible  effect of the offering on the
price of the stock.


38





In connection with the Company's selling efforts in the offering, Aleksey Gagauz
will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Exchange Act,
but  rather  will rely  upon the "safe  harbor"  provisions  of SEC Rule  3a4-1,
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act").   Generally   speaking,   Rule  3a4-1  provides  an  exemption  from  the
broker-dealer   registration  requirements  of  the  Exchange  Act  for  persons
associated  with an issuer  that  participate  in an  offering  of the  issuer's
securities. Aleksey Gagauz is not subject to any statutory disqualification,  as
that term is defined in Section  3(a)(39) of the Exchange  Act.  Aleksey  Gagauz
will not be compensated in connection with his  participation in the offering by
the  payment of  commissions  or other  remuneration  based  either  directly or
indirectly on transactions in our securities.  Aleksey Gagauz is not, nor has he
been within the past 12 months,  a broker or dealer,  and he is not,  nor has he
been within the past 12 months,  an associated  person of a broker or dealer. At
the end of the  offering,  Aleksey  Gagauz will  continue to  primarily  perform
substantial duties for the Company or on its behalf otherwise than in connection
with transactions in securities.  Aleksey Gagauz will not participate in selling
an offering of  securities  for any issuer more than once every 12 months  other
than in reliance on Exchange Act Rule 3a4-1(a)(4)(i) or (iii).


Terafox Corp.  will receive all proceeds  from the sale of the 9,000,000  shares
being  offered.  The price per share is fixed at $0.01 for the  duration of this
offering. Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange or quoted
over-the-counter, we intend to seek to have our shares of common stock quoted on
the Over-the  Counter  Bulletin Board. In order to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin
Board,  a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a
market for our common stock.  There can be no assurance that a market maker will
agree to file the necessary documents with FINRA, nor can there be any assurance
that such an application for quotation will be approved.


The Company's shares may be sold to purchasers from time to time directly by and
subject to the  discretion of the Company.  Further,  the Company will not offer
its  shares for sale  through  underwriters,  dealers,  agents or anyone who may
receive  compensation  in the form of  underwriting  discounts,  concessions  or
commissions  from the Company  and/or the purchasers of the shares for whom they
may act as  agents.  The  shares  of common  stock  sold by the  Company  may be
occasionally  sold in one or more  transactions;  all  shares  sold  under  this
prospectus will be sold at a fixed price of $0.01 per share.


In order to comply with the applicable  securities laws of certain  states,  the
securities will be offered or sold in those only if they have been registered or
qualified  for sale; an exemption  from such  registration  or if  qualification
requirement is available and with which Terafox Corp. has complied.


In addition and without  limiting the foregoing,  the Company will be subject to
applicable provisions,  rules and regulations under the Exchange Act with regard
to  security  transactions  during  the  period of time  when this  Registration
Statement is effective.


Terafox Corp. will pay all expenses incidental to the registration of the shares
(including registration pursuant to the securities laws of certain states) which
we expect to be $8,000.

ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW



Currently,  we have no Nevada  shareholders  and since this offering will not be
made in the State of Nevada,  no shares will be sold to its residents.  Further,
we do not do business in Nevada directly or through an affiliate corporation and
we do not intend to do so.  Accordingly,  there are no anti-takeover  provisions
that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control.



RULE 144



As of the date of this  prospectus,  we have issued 4,000,000  shares.  Our sole
officer and director beneficially owns all 4,000,000 shares of our common stock.
These shares are  currently  restricted  from trading  under Rule 144. They will
only be available for resale,  within the limitations of Rule 144, to the public
if:


(i) We are no longer a shell  company as defined under section 12b-2 of the
Exchange  Act. A "shell  company"  is  defined  as a company  with no or nominal
operations,  and with no or nominal assets or assets  consisting  solely of cash
and cash equivalents;


(ii) We have  filed  all  Exchange  Act  reports  required  for at least 12
consecutive months; and


41





(iii) If  applicable,  at least one year has elapsed  from the time that we
file current Form 10-type of  information  on Form 8-K or other report  changing
our status from a shell company to an entity that is not a shell company.


At present,  we are considered to be a shell company.  If we  subsequently  meet
these  requirements,  our officer and director  would be entitled to sell within
any three  month  period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of:

1% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding,  or the average
weekly  trading  volume of our  common  stock  during the four  calendar  weeks,
preceding  the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale for sales
exceeding 5,000 shares or an aggregate sale price in excess of $50,000. If fewer
shares at lesser value are sold, no Form 144 is required.






DIVIDEND POLICY



We have  never  declared  or paid any cash  dividends  on our common  stock.  We
currently intend to retain future earnings,  if any, to finance the expansion of
our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future.





INDEMNIFICATION



Articles  XII of our  Bylaws  provides  the  following  indemnification  for our
directors,  officers,  employees  and agents:  a) The  Director  shall cause the
Corporation to indemnify a Director or former  Director of the  Corporation  and
the  Directors  may cause the  Corporation  to  indemnify  a director  or former
director of a corporation of which the  Corporation is or was a shareholder  and
the heirs and  personal  representatives  of any such person  against all costs,
charges and expenses,  including an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a
judgment,  actually and  reasonably  incurred by him including an amount paid to
settle an action or  satisfy a  judgment  inactive  criminal  or  administrative
action  or  proceeding  to which he is or they are made a party by reason of him
being or  having  been a  Director  of the  Corporation  or a  director  of such
corporation, including an action brought by the Corporation or corporation. Each
Director of the  Corporation  on being  elected or  appointed  is deemed to have
contracted with the Corporation on the terms of the foregoing indemnity.


b) The Directors may cause the Corporation to indemnify an officer,  employee or
agent of the  Corporation or of a corporation of which the Corporation is or was
a shareholder  (notwithstanding  that he is also a Director),  and his heirs and
personal representatives against all costs, charges and expenses incurred by him
and  resulting  from  his  acting  as an  officer,  employee  or  agent  of  the
Corporation or  corporation.  In addition the  Corporation  shall  indemnify the
Secretary or an  Assistance  Secretary of the  Corporation  (if he is not a full
time  employee  of  the  Corporation  and  notwithstanding  that  he is  also  a
Director), and his respective heirs and legal representatives against all costs,
charges and expenses  incurred by him and arising out of the functions  assigned
to the  Secretary  by the  Corporation  Act or  these  Articles  and  each  such
Secretary  and  Assistant  Secretary,  on  being  appointed  is  deemed  to have
contracted with the Corporation on the terms of the foregoing indemnity.


42





c) The Director may cause the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance for

corporation of which the  Corporation  is or was a shareholder  and his heirs or
personal  representatives  against a  liability  incurred  by him as a Director,
officer, employee or agent.


Insofar as indemnification  for liabilities  arising under the Securities Act of
1933 may be permitted to directors,  officers or persons controlling the Company
pursuant to  provisions  of the State of Nevada,  the Company has been  informed
that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange   Commission,   such
indemnification  is  against  public  policy  as  expressed  in the  Act and is,
therefore, unenforceable.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



To the Board of Directors

Terafox Corp.


We have audited the  accompanying  balance sheet of Terafox Corp. (A Development
Stage  Company)  as  of  September  30,  2014  and  the  related  statements  of
operations,  stockholders'  deficit and cash flows for the period then ended and
for the period from February 26, 2014  (inception) to September 30, 2014.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audit.


We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements  are free of material  misstatement.  The company is not  required to
have,  nor were we engaged to perform,  an audit of its  internal  control  over
financial reporting.  Our audit included  consideration of internal control over
financial  reporting  as  a  basis  for  designing  audit  procedures  that  are
appropriate  in the  circumstances,  but not for the  purpose of  expressing  an
opinion on the  effectiveness  of the company's  internal control over financial
reporting.  Accordingly,  we express  no such  opinion.  An audit also  includes
examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  financial   statements,   assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the financial  position of Terafox Corp. (A Development
Stage  Company) as of September 30, 2014 and the results of its  operations  and
cash flows for the period then ended and for the period from  February  26, 2014
(inception),  to  September  30,  2014 in  conformity  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America.


The accompanying  financial  statements have been prepared  assuming the Company
will  continue as a going  concern.  As  discussed  in Note #2 to the  financial
statements,  the company has had significant operating losses; a working capital
deficiency  and its need for new  capital  raise  substantial  doubt  about  its
ability to continue  as a going  concern.  Management's  plan in regard to these
matters is also  described in Note #2. The  financial  statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


SEPTEMBER 30, 2014



NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS



Terafox Corp. was  incorporated  in the State of Nevada on February 26, 2014. We
are a development-stage  company formed to produce flyers,  posters and printing
images on multiple surfaces,  such as glass, leather,  plastic,  using automated
industrial flatbed printing machine.



NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN



The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been prepared in conformity  with
generally accepted accounting principles,  which contemplate continuation of the
Company as a going concern. However, the Company had no revenues as of September
30,  2014.  The Company  currently  has  limited  working  capital,  and has not
completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to
cover operating costs over an extended period of time.


Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent,  for the near future,
on additional  investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends
to position itself so that it August be able to raise  additional  funds through
the capital markets. In light of management's  efforts,  there are no assurances
that the Company will be  successful  in this or any of its  endeavors or become
financially viable and continue as a going concern.



NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Basis of presentation

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been prepared in accordance  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles in the United States of America,  and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission
(the  "SEC")  and  reflect  all  adjustments,  consisting  of  normal  recurring
adjustments,  which  management  believes are  necessary  to fairly  present the
financial position,  results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the
period ending September 30, 2014


Accounting Basis

The Company  uses the accrual  basis of  accounting  and  accounting  principles
generally  accepted in the United  States of America  ("GAAP"  accounting).  The
Company has adopted a September 30 fiscal year end.


Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities
of three months or less to be cash  equivalents.  The Company had $7,649 of cash
as of September 30, 2014.


Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company's  financial  instruments  consist of cash and cash  equivalents and
amounts due to shareholder.  The carrying amount of these financial  instruments
approximates  fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that
approximate   prevailing  market  rates  unless  otherwise  disclosed  in  these
financial statements.


Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.  Under the asset
and liability method,  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
A valuation  allowance  is provided  for the amount of deferred tax assets that,
based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.


Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and liabilities at the date the financial  statements and the
reported  amount of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

TERAFOX CORP.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


SEPTEMBER 30, 2014



NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)



Revenue Recognition

The Company  recognizes  revenue when  products are fully  delivered or services
have been provided and collection is reasonably assured.


Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based  compensation  is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC
Topic 718. To date,  the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not
granted any stock options.


Depreciation, Amortization, and Capitalization
The Company records  depreciation and amortization  when appropriate  using both
straight-line  and declining  balance methods over the estimated  useful life of
the assets (five to seven years).  Expenditures  for maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred.  Additions, major renewals and replacements that
increase the property's  useful life are capitalized.  Property sold or retired,
together  with  the  related  accumulated   depreciation  is  removed  from  the
appropriated accounts and the resultant gain or loss is included in net income.


Basic Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic income  (loss) per share is  calculated by dividing the Company's net loss
applicable  to common  shareholders  by the  weighted  average  number of common
shares during the period.  Diluted  earnings per share is calculated by dividing
the  Company's  net  income  available  to common  shareholders  by the  diluted
weighted  average  number of shares  outstanding  during the year.  The  diluted
weighted  average number of shares  outstanding is the basic weighted  number of
shares adjusted for any potentially  dilutive debt or equity.  There are no such
common stock equivalents outstanding as of September 30, 2014.


Comprehensive Income

The  Company  has which  established  standards  for  reporting  and  display of
comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances.  When applicable,
the Company would disclose this  information  on its Statement of  Stockholders'
Equity.  Comprehensive  income  comprises  equity  except those  resulting  from
investments by owners and  distributions to owners.  The Company has not had any
significant transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive
income.


Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Terafox  Corp.  does not expect  the  adoption  of  recently  issued  accounting
pronouncements  to  have a  significant  impact  on  the  Company's  results  of
operations, financial position or cash flow.

There  were  4,000,000  shares of common  stock  issued  and  outstanding  as of
September 30, 2014.



NOTE 7 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES



The Company  neither owns nor leases any real or personal  property.  An officer
has provided  office  services  without  charge.  There is no obligation for the
officer to continue this arrangement. Such costs are immaterial to the financial
statements and accordingly are not reflected herein.  The officers and directors
are involved in other business  activities and most likely will become  involved
in other business activities in the future.



NOTE 8 - INCOME TAXES



As of September 30, 2014,  the Company had net operating  loss carry forwards of
approximately  $676 that may be available to reduce future years' taxable income
in varying amounts through 2031. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result
of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their
realization is determined not likely to occur and  accordingly,  the Company has
recorded a valuation  allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax
loss carry-forwards.


The provision for Federal income tax consists of the following:



September 30, 2014

The  cumulative  tax effect at the  expected  rate of 34% of  significant  items
comprising our net deferred tax amount is as follows:



September 30, 2014





Deferred tax asset attributable to:









  Net operating loss carryover                                     $    230
  Less: valuation allowance                                            (230)
                                                                   --------
Net deferred tax asset                                             $      0

Due to the change in  ownership  provisions  of the Tax Reform Act of 1986,  net
operating  loss carry  forwards of  approximately  $676 for  Federal  income tax
reporting  purposes  are  subject  to  annual  limitations.  Should a change  in
ownership  occur net operating  loss carry  forwards may be limited as to use in
future years.

ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTOR AND OFFICERS



Terafox  Corp.'s  Bylaws  allow for the  indemnification  of the officer  and/or
director in regards each such person carrying out the duties of his office.  The
Board of Directors will make determination  regarding the indemnification of the
director, officer or employee as is proper under the circumstances if he has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth under the Nevada Revised Statutes.


As to indemnification  for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, for a director,  officer and/or person controlling Terafox Corp., we
have been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
such indemnification is against public policy and unenforceable.






ITEM 15. RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES



Set forth below is  information  regarding  the issuance and sales of securities
without registration since inception. On June 25, 2014, Terafox Corp offered and
sold  4,000,000  share of common stock to our president  and  director,  Aleksey
Gagauz,  for a  purchase  price of $0.001  per  share,  for  aggregate  offering
proceeds  of $4,000.  Terafox  Corp made the offer and sales in  reliance on the
exemption  from  registration  afforded by Section 4(2) to the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the  "Securities  Act"), on the basis that the securities were
offered and sold in a non-public offering to a "sophisticated  investor" who had
access to  registration-type  information  about the Company.  No commission was
paid in connection with the sale of any securities and no general  solicitations
were made to any person.

ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS



The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:


(a)(1) To file,  during any period in which  offers or sales of  securities
are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement to:


(i)  Include any prospectus  required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities
Act of 1933;


(ii) To reflect in the  prospectus  any facts or events  arising  after the
effective  date of the  registration  statement  (or the  most  recent
post-effective  amendment  thereof)  which,  individually  or  in  the
aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth
in the  registration  statement.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  any
increase  or decrease  in volume of  securities  offered (if the total
dollar  value of  securities  offered  would not exceed that which was
registered)  and  any  deviation  from  the  low  or  high  end of the
estimated  maximum  offering  range  may be  reflected  in the form of
prospectus   filed  with  the  Commission   pursuant  to  Rule  424(b)
(ss.230.424(b)  of this chapter) if, in the aggregate,  the changes in
volume  and price  represent  no more than 20%  change in the  maximum
aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration
Fee" table in the effective registration statement.


(iii)To  include  any  material  information  with  respect  to the plan of
distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or
any material change to such information in the registration statement;


(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities
Act of 1933,  each  such  post-effective  amendment  shall be deemed to be a new
registration  statement  relating to the  securities  offered  therein,  and the
offering of such  securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona
fide offering thereof.


(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective  amendment any
of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the
offering.


II-2





(4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act
of 1933 to any purchaser:


(i)  If the  registrant  is  subject to Rule 430C,  each  prospectus  filed
pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration  statement  relating
to an offering,  other than  registration  statements  relying on Rule
430B or other than prospectuses  filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall
be deemed to be part of and included in the registration  statement as
of the date it is first used after effectiveness.  Provided,  however,
that no statement made in a registration  statement or prospectus that
is  part  of  the  registration   statement  or  made  in  a  document
incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration
statement or  prospectus  that is part of the  registration  statement
will, as to a purchaser  with a time of contract of sale prior to such
first  use,  supersede  or modify any  statement  that was made in the
registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration
statement or made in any such document  immediately prior to such date
of first use.


(5) That, for the purpose of determining  liability of the registrant under
the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial  distribution  of the
securities:  The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of
securities  of  the  undersigned   registrant   pursuant  to  this  registration
statement,  regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to
the purchaser,  if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means
of any of the following  communications,  the  undersigned  registrant will be a
seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such  securities
to such purchaser:


(i)  Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant
relating to the  offering  required to be filed  pursuant to Rule 424;


(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on
behalf of the  undersigned  registrant  or used or  referred to by the
undersigned registrant;


(iii)The  portion  of any other free  writing  prospectus  relating  to the
offering  containing   material   information  about  the  undersigned
registrant  or  our  securities  provided  by  or  on  behalf  of  the
undersigned  registrant;  and (iv) Any other  communication that is an
offer  in the  offering  made  by the  undersigned  registrant  to the
purchaser.


Insofar as indemnification  for liabilities  arising under the Securities Act of
1933 (the "Act") may be permitted  to our  directors,  officers and  controlling
persons  pursuant to the provisions  above,  or otherwise,  we have been advised
that in the opinion of the SEC such  indemnification is against public policy as
expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.


In the event that a claim for  indemnification  against such liabilities,  other
than the  payment by us of expenses  incurred  or paid by one of our  directors,
officers,  or controlling  persons in the successful defense of any action, suit
or  proceeding,  is asserted by one of our directors,  officers,  or controlling
persons in connection with the securities being  registered,  we will, unless in
the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit  to a  court  of  appropriate  jurisdiction  the  question  whether  such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and
we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

of a meeting to, or the  non-receipt  of notice of a meeting  by, a  shareholder
will not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting.


Section 5 - Action Without a Meeting


Unless  otherwise  provided by law, any action required to be taken at a meeting
of the shareholders,  or any other action which may be taken at a meeting of the

registered office of the Corporation or at such other place as is specified
for that purpose in the notice  convening  the meeting.  In addition to any


2





other  method of  depositing  proxies  provided  for in these  Bylaws,  the
Directors may from time to time by resolution make regulations  relating to
the depositing of proxies at a place or places and fixing the time or times

Sundays and holidays)  preceding the meeting or adjourned meeting specified
in the notice calling a meeting of shareholders.



ARTICLE II: BOARD OF DIRECTORS



Section 1 - Number, Term, Election and Qualifications


a)   The first Board of Directors of the Corporation,  and all subsequent Boards
of the  Corporation,  shall  consist  of not less than one (1) and not more
than nine (9)  directors.  The number of Directors may be fixed and changed
from  time  to time  by  ordinary  resolution  of the  shareholders  of the
Corporation.


b)   The first  Board of  Directors  shall hold  office  until the first  annual
meeting of shareholders  and until their  successors have been duly elected
and  qualified  or until  there is a decrease  in the number of  directors.
Thereinafter,   Directors   will  be  elected  at  the  annual  meeting  of
shareholders  and  shall  hold  office  until  the  annual  meeting  of the
shareholders next succeeding his or her election, or until his or her prior
death,  resignation  or removal.  Any  Director may resign at any time upon
written notice of such resignation to the Corporation.


c)   A casual  vacancy  occurring  in the Board  may be filled by the  remaining
Directors.


d)   Between successive annual meetings, the Directors have the power to appoint
one or more  additional  Directors  but not more than 1/2 of the  number of
Directors  fixed at the last  shareholder  meeting at which  Directors were
elected. A Director so appointed holds office only until the next following
annual  meeting of the  Corporation,  but is eligible  for election at that
meeting.  So long as he or she is an  additional  Director,  the  number of
Directors will be increased accordingly.


e)   A  Director  is  not  required  to  hold a  share  in  the  capital  of the
Corporation as qualification for his or her office.


Section 2 - Duties, Powers and Remuneration


a)   The Board of Directors  shall be responsible for the control and management
of the business and affairs, property and interests of the Corporation, and
may  exercise  all  powers of the  Corporation,  except  for  those  powers
conferred  upon or reserved for the  shareholders  or any other  persons as
required   under   Nevada  state  law,   the   Corporation's   Articles  of
Incorporation or by these Bylaws.


b)   The  remuneration  of the  Directors may from time to time be determined by
the Directors or, if the Directors decide, by the shareholders.


Section 3 - Meetings of Directors


a)   The President of the Corporation shall preside as chairman at every meeting
of the  Directors,  or if the President is not present or is willing to act


3





as chairman,  the Directors  present shall choose one of their number to be
chairman of the meeting.


b)   The Directors  may meet together for the dispatch of business,  and adjourn
and otherwise  regulate their meetings as they think fit. Questions arising
at a meeting must be decided by a majority of votes. In case of an equality
of votes the chairman does not have a second or casting  vote.  Meetings of
the Board held at regular  intervals may be held at the place and time upon
the  notice  (if any) as the  Board  may by  resolution  from  time to time
determine.


c)   A Director may  participate  in a meeting of the Board or of a committee of
the  Directors  using   conference   telephones  or  other   communications
facilities  by which all  Directors  participating  in the meeting can hear
each  other  and   provided   that  all  such   Directors   agree  to  such
participation.  A Director  participating  in a meeting in accordance  with
this Bylaw is deemed to be present  at the  meeting  and to have so agreed.
Such  Director will be counted in the quorum and entitled to speak and vote
at the meeting.


d)   A Director  may, and the Secretary on request of a Director  shall,  call a
meeting of the  Board.  Reasonable  notice of the  meeting  specifying  the
place, day and hour of the meeting must be given by mail,  postage prepaid,
addressed to each of the Directors  and  alternate  Directors at his or her
address as it appears on the books of the  Corporation  or by leaving it at
his or her usual business or residential address or by telephone, facsimile
or other  method  of  transmitting  legibly  recorded  messages.  It is not
necessary  to  give  notice  of  a  meeting  of  Directors  to  a  Director
immediately  following a shareholder meeting at which the Director has been
elected, or is the meeting of Directors at which the Director is appointed.


e)   A  Director  of the  Corporation  may file with the  Secretary  a  document
executed  by him  waiving  notice of a past,  present or future  meeting or
meetings of the Directors  being, or required to have been, sent to him and
may at  any  time  withdraw  the  waiver  with  respect  to  meetings  held
thereafter.  After filing such waiver with  respect to future  meetings and
until the waiver is withdrawn  no notice of a meeting of Directors  need be
given to the Director. All meetings of the Directors so held will be deemed
not to be improperly  called or  constituted by reason of notice not having
been given to the Director.


f)   The quorum  necessary for the  transaction of the business of the Directors

b)   Certificated shares of the Corporation shall be signed,  either manually or
by facsimile,  by officers or agents designated by the Corporation for such
purposes,  and shall certify the number of shares owned by the  shareholder
in the Corporation.  Whenever any certificate is countersigned or otherwise
authenticated  by a transfer agent or transfer  clerk,  and by a registrar,
then a facsimile of the signatures of the officers or agents,  the transfer
agent or transfer clerk or the registrar of the  Corporation may be printed
or lithographed upon the certificate in lieu of the actual  signatures.  If
the Corporation uses facsimile signatures of its officers and agents on its
stock  certificates,  it cannot act as registrar of its own stock,  but its
transfer agent and registrar may be identical if the institution  acting in
those dual  capacities  countersigns or otherwise  authenticates  any stock
certificates  in both  capacities.  If any  officer who has signed or whose
facsimile  signature  has been  placed  upon such  certificate,  shall have
ceased to be such  officer  before such  certificate  is issued,  it may be
issued by the  Corporation  with the same effect as if he were such officer
at the date of its issue.


c)   If the Corporation  issued  uncertificated  shares as provided for in these
Bylaws,  within a  reasonable  time after the  issuance or transfer of such
uncertificated  shares, and at least annually  thereafter,  the Corporation


6





shall send the  shareholder a written  statement  certifying  the number of
shares owned by such shareholder in the Corporation.


d)   Except as  otherwise  provided by law,  the rights and  obligations  of the
holders of  uncertificated  shares and the  rights and  obligations  of the
holders of  certificates  representing  shares of the same class and series
shall be identical.


e)   If a share certificate:


(i)  is worn out or defaced,  the Directors shall,  upon production to them
of the  certificate  and upon such other  terms,  if any,  as they may
think  fit,  order the  certificate  to be  cancelled  and issue a new
certificate;


(ii) is lost,  stolen or  destroyed,  then upon  proof  being  given to the
satisfaction  of the  Directors and upon and  indemnity,  if any being
given, as the Directors  think  adequate,  the Directors shall issue a
new certificate; or


(iii)represents more than one share and the registered  owner surrenders it
to the Corporation  with a written request that the Corporation  issue
in his or her  name  two or more  certificates,  each  representing  a
specified number of shares and in the aggregate  representing the same
number of shares as the  certificate so  surrendered,  the Corporation
shall cancel the certificate so surrendered and issue new certificates
in accordance with such request.


Section 2 - Transfers of Shares


a)   Transfers or registration  of transfers of shares of the Corporation  shall
be made on the stock  transfer  books of the  Corporation by the registered
holder  thereof,  or by his or her attorney  duly  authorized  by a written
power of attorney;  and in the case of shares  represented by certificates,
only  after  the  surrender  to  the   Corporation   of  the   certificates
representing  such  shares with such shares  properly  endorsed,  with such
evidence of the authenticity of such endorsement,  transfer,  authorization
and other  matters  as the  Corporation  may  reasonably  require,  and the
payment of all stock transfer taxes due thereon.


b)   The  Corporation  shall be  entitled  to treat the  holder of record of any
share or  shares  as the  absolute  owner  thereof  for all  purposes  and,
accordingly,  shall not be bound to recognize any legal, equitable or other
claim to, or  interest  in,  such  share or shares on the part of any other
person,  whether or not it shall  have  express  or other  notice  thereof,
except as otherwise expressly provided by law.


Section 3 - Record Date


a)   The  Directors  may fix in  advance a date,  which must not be more than 60
days permitted by the preceding the date of a meeting of  shareholders or a
class of  shareholders,  or of the payment of a dividend or of the proposed
taking  of  any  other  proper  action   requiring  the   determination  of
shareholders as the record date for the  determination  of the shareholders
entitled  to  notice  of,  or to  attend  and  vote at,  a  meeting  and an
adjournment of the meeting, or entitled to receive payment of a dividend or
for any other proper purpose and, in such case, notwithstanding anything in


7





these  Bylaws,  only  shareholders  of records on the date so fixed will be
deemed to be the shareholders for the purposes of this Bylaw.


b)   Where no record date is so fixed for the  determination  of shareholders as
provided in the preceding  Bylaw, the date on which the notice is mailed or
on which the resolution  declaring the dividend is adopted, as the case may
be, is the record date for such determination.


Section 4 - Fractional Shares


Notwithstanding anything else in these Bylaws, the Corporation, if the Directors
so resolve,  will not be required to issue fractional  shares in connection with
an amalgamation, consolidation, exchange or conversion. At the discretion of the
Directors,  fractional  interests in shares may be rounded to the nearest  whole
number, with fractions of 1/2 being rounded to the next highest whole number, or
may be purchased for  cancellation by the Corporation for such  consideration as
the  Directors  determine.  The  Directors  may  determine  the  manner in which
fractional  interests  in shares  are to be  transferred  and  delivered  to the
Corporation in exchange for consideration and a determination so made is binding
upon all shareholders of the Corporation. In case shareholders having fractional
interests in shares fail to deliver them to the Corporation in accordance with a
determination  made by the  Directors,  the  Corporation  may  deposit  with the
Corporation's  Registrar  and  Transfer  Agent  a  sum  sufficient  to  pay  the
consideration payable by the Corporation for the fractional interests in shares,
such deposit to be set aside in trust for such shareholders.  Such setting aside
is deemed to be payment to such  shareholders  for the  fractional  interests in
shares not so delivered  which will  thereupon not be considered as  outstanding
and  such  shareholders  will  not  be  considered  to be  shareholders  of  the
Corporation  with  respect  thereto  and will have no right  except  to  receive
payment  of  the  money  so  set  aside  and  deposited  upon  delivery  of  the
certificates  for the  shares  held  prior to the  amalgamation,  consolidation,
exchange or conversion which result in fractional interests in shares.

classes or series.

Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the  "Act"),  relating to the  offering of  9,000,000  shares of the  Company's
common stock.


In rendering the opinion set forth below, we have reviewed: (a) the Registration
Statement  and the exhibits  attached  thereto;  (b) the  Company's  Articles of
Incorporation;  (c) the Company's  Bylaws;  (d) certain records of the Company's
