On July 13, the U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination of William Hagerty IV to be the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. He succeeds Caroline Bouvier Kennedy (1957–) who served at the US Embassy Tokyo from November 19, 2013 to January 2017. See related posts:

Other previous appointees to this position include career and political appointees like Howard Henry Baker Jr. (1925–2014), Walter F. Mondale (1928–), Michael Joseph Mansfield (1903–2001), Douglas MacArthur II (1909–1997) and Ural Alexis Johnson (1908–1997) to name a few.
Only 6 of the last 15 appointments as Ambassador to Japan since the 1950’s were career diplomats:  Ural Alexis Johnson (1908–1997), Armin Henry Meyer (1914–2006), Douglas MacArthur II (1909–1997), John Moore Allison (1905–1978), Robert Daniel Murphy (1894–1978) and Michael Hayden Armacost (1937–).  According to history.state.gov, the last career diplomat sent as ambassador to Japan was Michael Hayden Armacost (1937–) who served from May 15, 1989–July 19, 1993. With the latest confirmation, it has now been 24 years since a career diplomat was appointed and confirmed as chief of mission at U.S. Embassy Tokyo.

On July 13, the U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination of William Hagerty IV to be the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. He succeeds Caroline Bouvier Kennedy (1957–) who served at the US Embassy Tokyo from November 19, 2013 to January 2017. See related posts:

SFRC Hearing: William Francis Hagerty IV to be U.S. Ambassador to Japan
Trump Nominates William Francis Hagerty IV of Tennessee to be US Ambassador to Japan
Tillerson/Priebus Standoff on Ambassadorships, Plus Rumored Names/Posts (Updated)

Other previous appointees to this position include career and political appointees like Howard Henry Baker Jr. (1925–2014), Walter F. Mondale (1928–), Michael Joseph Mansfield (1903–2001), Douglas MacArthur II (1909–1997) and Ural Alexis Johnson (1908–1997) to name a few.
Only 6 of the last 15 appointments as Ambassador to Japan since the 1950’s were career diplomats:  Ural Alexis Johnson (1908–1997), Armin Henry Meyer (1914–2006), Douglas MacArthur II (1909–1997), John Moore Allison (1905–1978), Robert Daniel Murphy (1894–1978) and Michael Hayden Armacost (1937–).  According to history.state.gov, the last career diplomat sent as ambassador to Japan was Michael Hayden Armacost (1937–) who served from May 15, 1989–July 19, 1993. With the latest confirmation, it has now been 24 years since a career diplomat was appointed and confirmed as chief of mission at U.S. Embassy Tokyo.

Hagerty joins RGI Board of Directors












Rogers Group Inc. Board of Directors is proud to announce the recent election of William F. Hagerty, IV to their board. A resident of Nashville, TN, Mr. Hagerty is a founder and Managing Director of Hagerty Peterson & Company, LLC, a merchant bank and private equity investment firm. Through January of 2015, Bill served in the Cabinet of Governor Bill Haslam, as the Commissioner of Economic Development for his home state of Tennessee. In this role, Bill ran the department responsible for jobs, industry and economic growth for Tennessee. As Cabinet member he reported to Governor Bill Haslam and the 132 elected Members of the Tennessee General Assembly.  He worked on a regular basis with the US Congress, where he has provided Congressional testimony, as well as the US Treasury, the US Department of Commerce, the US Trade Representative, the International Trade Administration, HUD, SBA and other federal agencies on an as-needed basis.

He began his career with The Boston Consulting Group, ultimately serving as the senior expatriate in its Tokyo office with responsibility for the firm’s international activities in Japan.  Bill left BCG to serve on the White House Staff where he was selected a White House Fellow reporting to the Vice President of the United States.  

Following his service on the White House staff, Bill joined Trident Capital and launched his career in private equity.  One of his first deals was the formation of Mapquest which was eventually taken public and subsequently acquired by AOL Time Warner.  

Bill has served on multiple Boards, including CyMed, NEW Customer Service Company, Ultra Stores, Sound Advice, Birch Telecom, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and presently the Board of R. J. O’Brien.

Additional leadership roles have included Director of Presidential Appointments on the 2012 US Presidential Transition Team, Chairman of the Executive Board of the National Capital Council of the Boy Scouts of America, Chair of the Regional Selection Panel for the President’s Commission on White House Fellowships (administrations of Clinton, Bush and Obama), Vice-Chairman of the Board of Columbia Hospital for Women, and a Trustee of Cheekwood.

               NEW has consistently delivered many industry "firsts" since its inception more than 20 years ago. Many of the innovations it has pioneered over the past 20 years are now standard practices throughout the industry, including 24x7x365 call center operations, insurance underwriting for every plan sold, 48-hour claims processing, price interval underwriting and replacement plans for lower-price merchandise. "Taking care of the customer is an enormous part of NEW's mission. However, we don't stop with the customer. We pride ourselves on not only delivering exceptional customer care, but instilling that value in everything we do," added Schaufeld. "We work hard to be a great employer, to give back to the communities we work in, and to be solid business partners to our clients. We realize the better you take care of people, whether it is a customer, employee, client or a member of the community, the better the outcome for everyone." NEW's call center operations handled more than 8.2 million telephone, e-mail and fax interactions in 2004 from its call centers in Great Falls, MT; Crestview, FL; and Klamath Falls, OR. The call center operation successfully passed a detailed audit of recruiting, training, employee incentives, management roles and responsibilities and quality assurance capabilities. In addition, J.D. Power and Associates conducted a random survey of NEW's customers who had recently contacted its call center. For certification status, a call center must perform within the top 20 percent of customer service, based on J.D. Power and Associates' cross-industry customer satisfaction research. The evaluation criteria used in the survey included: courtesy of the customer service representative (CSR); knowledge of the CSR; the CSR's concern for the customer questions and/or problem; usefulness of the information provided; convenience of customer service operating hours; ease of getting through to a CSR; and the timely resolution of the customer's problem, question or request. Certification is valid for one year.

Vote Details


Notes: 
“Aye” or “Yea”?

“Aye” and “Yea” mean the same thing, and so do “No” and “Nay”. Congress uses different words in different sorts of votes.
The U.S. Constitution says that bills should be decided on by the “yeas and nays” (Article I, Section 7). Congress takes this literally and uses “yea” and “nay” when voting on the final passage of bills.
All Senate votes use these words. But the House of Representatives uses “Aye” and “No” in other sorts of votes.
