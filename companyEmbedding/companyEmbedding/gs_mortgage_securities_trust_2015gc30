Overview of Products
Single-Family Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) »
Fannie Mae creates MBS that represent beneficial ownership interests in a pool of mortgage loans secured by single-family (1-4 units) residential properties. An individual Single-Family MBS pool may hold mortgage loans that are either fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loans but will not hold both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans.
Multifamily Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) »
Fannie Mae creates MBS that represent beneficial ownership interests in a pool of mortgage loans secured by multifamily (5 or more units) residential properties. An individual Multifamily MBS pool may hold one or more mortgage loans that are either fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loans but will not hold both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans.
Structured Transactions and Megas »
Fannie Mae creates multiclass mortgage-backed securities including real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) and stripped mortgage-backed securities (SMBS). REMICs permit an issuer to restructure cash flows on underlying mortgage assets into separately tradable securities. SMBS separate the principal and interest cash flows from underlying mortgage assets to create classes that pay only principal or only interest (known as principal only or interest only classes). Fannie Mae also creates and guarantees a single-class MBS known as a Fannie Mega® security or Mega. Megas are pass-through certificates backed by previously pooled Fannie Mae MBS with similar characteristics and/or other previously pooled Megas with similar characteristics.
