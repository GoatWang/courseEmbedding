After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for reply from the Investor Relations section of WPX Energy's website following this call.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. David Sullivan, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Sullivan. You may begin.
David Sullivan - Manager-Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning everybody. Welcome to the WPX Energy second quarter 2015 earnings call. We appreciate your interest in WPX Energy. Rick Muncrief, our CEO; Clay Gaspar, our Senior Vice President of Operations and Resource Development; and Kevin Vann, our CFO, will review the prepared slide presentation this morning. Along with Rick, Clay, and Kevin are members of the senior management team; Bryan Guderian, our Senior Vice President of Business Development; and Mike Fiser, Senior Vice President of Marketing, will be available for questions after the presentation.
On our website, wpxenergy.com, you'll find today's presentation and the press release that was issued after the market closed yesterday. Also, the 10-Q will be filed later today. Please review the forward-looking statements and disclaimer on oil and gas reserves at the end of the presentation. They are important and integral to our remarks, so please review them.
So with that, Rick, I'll turn it over to you.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone on the call. We appreciate your interest and investment in our team. I want to start today by recognizing the volatility in today's commodity prices. I know it's on everyone's mind. It's on my mind. Obviously, we're faced with near-term headwinds. There will always be ups and downs and swings to the left and right in the market.
At WPX, we have a long-term strategy and a balanced, yet flexible, game plan. We can play the defense like we've done before by cutting capital spending, maintaining attractive hedge positions and actively managing our revolver and the terms of it. We can also play offense like we did recently with our previously announced acquisition in the Permian Basin. As I've said before, the time to buy is when prices are down. When prices are higher, we'll be very busy drilling.
With experience, comes perspective and there is an extremely knowledgeable, highly seasoned management team in place here. We've been down these roads before. Along those lines, I want to emphasize that our ability to execute is one of our strengths. We bolstered our balance sheet, which allowed us to be optimistic with our Permian acquisition, and we're going to be just as aggressive in reestablishing our balance sheet's strength. We haven't even closed on the RKI transaction, but the de-levering activity is already underway.
In terms of our quarterly results, we continue to drive significant change and measurable improvements across the company. There's a higher standard here now for capital allocation, talent acquisition, spending, career development and how we go about maximizing the opportunities in each of our basins. The diversity in our portfolio, both geographically and by product mix, is one of the things that sets WPX apart. We have high margin oil growth all while sitting on a mountain of massive natural gas option value.

We have three core basins, along with a new cleanup hitter that we're now adding. That's the Permian Basin that I referred to earlier. All of our operations are focused in the Western U.S., which has the advantages of higher commodity pricing and quicker access to markets through established infrastructure.
We are completely focused on value creation, regardless of whether commodity prices are up or down. Pricing challenges are simply opportunities for us to flex our muscles and demonstrate our creativity to deliver value.
So let's turn to slide two. This was another strong quarter. The results you're seeing show what's possible as we integrate technical excellence into our operations. Oil production was up 38%. Our cash operating expenses were down 16%. That's very much a winning formula. We have a set of assets that are performing well and posting excellent results despite depressed commodity prices. For example, our year-to-date cash margins are only 5% lower than a year ago, despite a 45% decrease in commodity prices.
You can also see items on this page that show the quality of the rock we're developing. Our ability to increase our scale through bolt-on opportunities, as well as our ability to bring dollars in the door by shedding non-core assets. Everything is on track with our previous – turning to slide three, excuse me. Everything is on track with our previously announced acquisition in the Permian basin. As we become more familiar with RKI and its people over the past few weeks, we're more confident than ever about the benefits of this merger. We expect to complete the merger this month.
That's a very quick process for a transaction of this size and it underscores the complementary nature of our two companies. Once we close, we're going to hit the ground running. Ultimately, we believe this transaction will help us take our strategy further and execute it faster. With RKI, we acquired an enormous, high-quality drilling inventory across stacked pay, a company with existing production, a substantial midstream infrastructure and acreage in the very core of the Permian's Delaware basin.
There's two things that I want to emphasize about this transaction: Number one, the upside opportunities; and number two, our ability to focus to quickly de-lever. On the upside, keep in mind that our metrics around this transaction are based on the historical data that we've seen and are inheriting.
Their results to date are based on a somewhat conservative approach to operations, such as doing 800 pounds to 1,000-pounds per foot of proppant on their completions while most peers are doing twice that. Second, and I want to be very clear about this: We have set our targets for de-levering and we're moving quickly. Before you bet against our team, I want to point out what we've accomplished in the last year.
As a quick refresher, we divested our international operations, most of our holdings in the Marcellus, a couple of complex transportation positions and some working interest in the Piceance Basin involving two separate transactions. And as I said earlier, we get things done and we're going to act quickly and aggressively on our de-levering plan.
We are targeting $400 million to $500 million in divestures before the end of this year and another $400 million to $500 million of proceeds in 2016. A lot of our own pipe that we've put in place around our assets will fetch very attractive multiples. In fact, right now could be one of the most opportune times ever to be marketing midstream assets. We're also creative. We're willing to entertain proposals that are consistent with our blueprint for creating shareholder value.
And with that, here's Clay Gaspar, our Senior Vice President of Operations & Resource Development.

Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development
Thank you, Rick. Before we get into the nuts and bolts, I want to recognize the people who have really taken our operations to next level. Our teams out in the field and here in Tulsa have benefited from being immersed in the operations, and from that vantage, they get to see real-time wins that we are achieving on all fronts. While enduring an amazing amount of change in a short amount of time in the midst of a major industry downturn, they've not only embraced our drive for operational excellence, they're leading it.
Two weeks ago, our asset teams walked our senior leadership through a revamped quarterly review process. These reviews are designed to be a combination of progress update, a direct two-way communication tool and an important means of accountability.
As Rick said, we've seen a lot of change at WPX in a short period; leadership changes, organization, asset sales, contract renegotiations, process improvement, office consolidation and importantly the evolution of our corporate culture. These changes have been rapidly implemented, but not taken on without significant thought and consideration. I believe that it's also very important in this environment to underscore our dedication to capital management from an overall capital insensitive (08:09) perspective as well as the proper allocations of the best investments.
Since December, we've dropped from 17 rigs to 4 rigs. We know how to aggressively cut spending when it's the right business decision. Starting with our current rig fleet, adding the rigs that we will inherent from RKI and other rigs that we've previously discussed bringing on, we will only have one long-term contract and we're also in a very high HBP position. This gives us a lot of capital flexibilities, and you can bet we'll exercise it.
Let's turn to slide five and talk a little bit about the Williston Basin. The Williston Basin is loaded with tangible examples of operational excellence that we are seeking to achieve as a matter of course around the company. Our completion team is quickly adapting industry's best practices to extract significantly more value from this high quality asset. We are currently completing the first round of wells with a new approach to perforation strategy, carrying fluid design, profit size, concentration and total volume pumped.
We're confident that the revised EUR completion designs – revised completion design will result in significantly higher EURs and we'll be able to tune these designs in the depressed stimulation market. We have drilled five three-mile laterals leading the industry to new territory. Where appropriate, we're using cutting edge rotary steerable tools that offer much better penetration rates, but until recently have been too costly to use in most resource plays.
We have significantly lower LOE through smarter operations, better contracting, and efficiency gains. All of these actions create real value for the shareholders.
Turning to slide six: In the San Juan Gallup the key word is efficiency. Today, we're doing more with less particularly in regards to our rig count. We've driven drilling days down to a single digit, and we're pushing the boundaries of what's been done before in the basin. We mentioned on this slide that we've drilled two wells in under eight days. The update is that this week we drilled a well from spud to rig release in 6.7 days, drilling more than a mile down and a mile over and that amount of time is impressive by any standard.
We recently drilled the longest lateral in the basin, not just once, but managed to break our own record two more times, and the third well measuring over 15,000 feet with a nearly 10,000 feet of lateral. We've also focused on execution in regards to growing our position. Two years ago, we were roughly 30,000 acres in the Gallup. We now have 100,000 acres in the best part of the oil window.

I should also mention that our marketing team continues to do an excellent job of lowering differentials and creating value. We reduced our netbacks by nearly 25% and we have clear line of sight to additional savings going forward.
Let me pause for a second to make an important point. Please don't mistake my excitement for operational progress as an indication that we're solely taking technical objectives rather than economic ones. We are laser focused on value creation for the shareholder. We believe the improvements we are making are critical to the ability to extract value; but if the evidence were to lead us in a different direction than our current path of longer laterals and higher intensity completions, you can bet we'll move aggressively towards value.
Turning to slide seven, the Piceance continues to be a consistent performer. We've made significant progress in delineating our Niobrara play. There is no doubt about the resource potential – it's huge. We've been plowing through the technical challenges and improving our drilling times dramatically. We just drilled our first two-mile Niobrara lateral and the team did it in less than half the time of a one-mile lateral we drilled a year ago.
If you'll notice on the graph, the green line representing the drilling progress for the longer lateral, actually reaches total depth at 35 days. The flat spot after this point is what the drillers see as an opportunity for improvement on the next well. A 40-day well will be another 20% drop in days, and it's clearly achievable from the evidence we've seen thus far. But even with the technical progress, the program's struggled to compete for the capital. The team understands the brutal nature of our capital allocation process.
Lastly week, we dropped the Niobrara rig and we're going to focus on studying the well results we have to better understand how we create value from this massive resource. In our Mesa Verde play, we are aggressively working to better understand the enormous value proposition. Our Piceance team knows how to pinch a penny as well as anyone out there. That mindset and performance are key to driving down costs and focusing on margins. But sometimes to focus on costs, we miss an opportunity to create value.
With the remaining rig we're running in the basin, we're now moving counter to our multiple year down spacing trend. The team is experimenting with wider space wells and larger state-of-the-art completions to see if the resulting larger EUR will generate competitive returns. The upside related to this project is very significant in understanding the value of this amazing asset.
Now I'll turn it over to Kevin Vann, our CFO.
J. Kevin Vann - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks, Clay, and thanks to your team for yet another solid quarter of execution. Both Rick and Clay have provided some detail on the accomplishments of the second quarter. I will cover a few further specifics around production, EBITDAX, adjusted net income and finally capital activity.
Given our Permian acquisition and our expected closing for later this month, I will also touch on our update guidance metrics and what the results through the first half of the year mean for the full year. I will also provide a picture of what our pro forma hedge position for oil and gas look like given additional hedging we did in the quarter, coupled with RKI hedges assumed as part of the transaction.
As Rick mentioned, our oil production was 38% higher in the second quarter of this year versus last year. We produced nearly 33,000 barrels of oil per day during the quarter. This figure represents a slight drop from the first quarter. However, as you know, we had made the decision to defer completions in the Williston Basin and the second quarter results reflect it. When comparing the second quarter of 2015 to prior year, the Williston Basin still posted a 20% increase in production, while the San Juan team continued their impressive growth story by posting oil growth of over 180%.

For our natural gas production of 675 million cubic feet per day is down 116 billion cubic feet, or 15%, from the second quarter of 2014. However, when you consider the impact of the two dispositions that affected quarter-to-quarter comparison, our natural gas volumes were down by only approximately 1%.
As you are aware, the second quarter of 2014 includes production from both the working interest in Piceance wells, for which we sold the legacy reserves in May of last year, and our previously owned Marcellus property in the Susquehanna County, for which Southwestern Energy purchased. That sale closed in late January of this year. These divestitures account for nearly 108 million cubic feet per day of production during the second quarter of 2014.
Our NGL production for the quarter came in at 19,700 barrels per day, which was up from second quarter of last year by nearly 2,000 barrels and nearly 3,000 barrels higher than the first quarter of this year. The increase was driven by higher ethane recovery rates at the Meeker plant in Colorado together with higher production coming out of the San Juan Gallup.
So again, our combined oil and liquids production reached an all-time high of 52,400 barrels per day or approximately 32% of our total production. On a revenue bases, our liquids production now represents over half of our total revenues at 57%.
With the impressive growth in oil volumes, coupled with our continued focus on cost, we are reporting an adjusted EBITDAX of $222 million, which is down approximately 12% from the second quarter of last year. However, these results were achieved in the commodity price environment where oil prices were down over 44% and natural gas prices were down 40%. Said another way, our commodity revenues were down $213 million, and despite this challenging commodity environment, our adjusted EBITDAX for the quarter and year-to-date was down by just around 11%.
We remain focused on delivering on our strategy of increasing margins through our prudent management of costs and operational excellence. We are reporting an adjusted net loss of $22 million for the quarter versus an adjusted net income of $6 million in the prior year. This decline again was driven by lower commodity prices, but was greatly mitigated by our focus on cost and the hedging decisions we made in the prior year.
Our capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $138 million, compared to $388 million in the second quarter of 2014. This amount is consistent with where we anticipated being at this point in the year, and keeps us on track with our full year guidance and new activity. I will note that on a year-to-date basis, our new capital activity totals $435 million, whereas our cash flows from operations totaled $430 million. We designed our capital program to be primarily funded by operating cash flows and we are delivering.
Now, to guidance: There are a couple items I want to highlight. First and foremost, we are incorporating the projected results of RKI into our guidance under the presumption that we close in the back half of August. Including those results, we are raising our full-year production guidance to a range of a 163,000 to 168,000 equivalent barrels per day, up from our previous guidance range of 152,000 to 160,000 barrels of equivalent oil per day.
In addition, we have increased our capital guidance to a range $825 million to $925 million, which includes the expected capital activity in the Permian. Other notable changes include lowering our expected full-year oil differentials from WTI less $9 to $12 to WTI less $8 to $10. These new differentials incorporate our expectations on the RKI production post close.
Also, given the continued realizations of lower LOE and GPT on a per Boe basis, we have slightly lowered those projections. We have raised our DD&A expense guidance for the full-year by $0.50, reflecting two major contributors. First, higher production volumes; and second, an increase in the rate, driven by a decrease in the estimated reserves used in the calculation of it. The SEC rules require reserves to be estimated based on a trailing 12-month average commodity price. As prices have declined over the course of the last six months, our DD&A rate per Boe has increased.

Lastly, we have increased the range on our G&A to $230 million to $240 million to reflect the RKI G&A expenses, lowered our guidance on exploration expenses and increased our interest expense, which is obviously driven by the new bonds issued to fund the consideration for the acquisition.
Turning to slide 11, you will see the pro forma commodity hedging profile for the portfolio, post-closing of the RKI transaction. Our natural gas hedge position will consist of approximately 436,000 per day of fixed price swaps at $4.05 and another 50,000 per day of collars with a floor of $4.00. This puts us at nearly 75% hedged for the balance of this year.
For 2016, we have over 300,000 per day hedged through fixed price loss at $3.83. Given the current balance of 2015 pricing and full-year strip pricing in 2016, our natural gas hedge book will continue to provide financial support to our cash flows, especially in these volatile commodity markets.
I will point out that the average price of our basis swaps continues to be around $0.12 to $0.13 per MMbtu. We have said it before that having natural gas exposure in the Western United States continues to assist in our relative returns.
As far as oil hedges, we have nearly 31,000 barrels hedged for the balance of this year at an average price at $85.14 on a pro forma basis. This is a substantial percentage of our remaining production forecasted for this year.
And finally, we have made a significant increase since the end of the first quarter in our crude oil hedging position for 2016, with over 25,000 barrels hedged at a price of over $62 per barrel. This strong hedging position demonstrates our focus on managing commodity risk and protecting cash flows.
The quarter was yet another good quarter operationally and financially. As Rick indicated earlier, we are focused on our de-levering execution and I am extremely confident and excited about what the RKI assets provide in our continued story of margin improvement.
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Rick.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Kevin. Turning to slide 12, I am extremely excited about this new opportunity and company that's emerging. And when I saying new, I mean that sincerely. With the RKI transaction, we're combining two companies into a new one; one that's going to be stronger, a force to be reckoned with within our industry, and one that has decades of attractive drilling inventory.
And even before we add the Permian Basin to our mix, we've already posted double volume growth, in each of the past three years. We're going to get stronger and better with the RKI transaction. And we're going to quickly de-lever in order to reestablish the strength of our balance sheet. So as I look at the math, we have great assets. We're in the core of the core in each our four basins, and we have optionality in regards to capital flexibility to ensure that can maximize returns for our shareholders.
This concludes the presentation portion of today's call. And at this time, we would be happy to open up the line for questions. Operator?

Jeffrey Campbell - Touhy Brothers Investment Research Inc.
Good morning.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
Jeffrey Campbell - Touhy Brothers Investment Research Inc.
Just referring to the slide that we were looking at, slide 12, it shows in the Permian acquisition, 670,000 net prospective acres. Obviously, that's looking at the acreage from a multi-zone standpoint. I was just wondering kind of going into this transaction, what do you expect to be the zones that you're going to be testing sooner rather than later?

Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Clay, do you want to field that?
Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development
Yeah, happy to take that, Jeff. Initially, we're going to focus on the Wolfcamp A, the second Bone Spring, and the vertical Delaware. But, we're going to take a balanced approach to also start testing some of the other horizons that we're seeing some of our close neighbors making some really good wells with as well.
Jeffrey Campbell - Touhy Brothers Investment Research Inc.
Okay. The press release highlighted tailoring Piceance Valley and Ryan Gulch well density and frac designs to achieve rates of return that can compete with oil. I was just wondering what sort of production uplift is required to achieve those returns?
Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development
Yeah. As an example of the value, we talked about EURs, just a little – probably about (22:35) bcf per well as a standard EUR. What we're seeing with these – from past history, where we've seen similar completion results from a spacing standpoint, but we haven't applied yet is the improved fracture technology. We think we can get to 3 bcf wells without too much of a stretch. That would put us in the hunt. I think there's a series of other things we're looking at as well on how to extract value further downstream, be it from the GPT contracts, or even further downstream than that, to put us in a better position to compete directly.
Jeffrey Campbell - Touhy Brothers Investment Research Inc.
Okay, great. And if I could – I don't want to hog it up here, if I could ask one more question. I noted your discussion a little earlier about the San Juan midstream, and how you're getting better cost reduction to basis differentials from the infrastructure that you're installing there. Just thinking out a little bit, do you feel that, that infrastructure is going to retain more value by staying within the company or do you think it would eventually be attractive landing in an MLP structure?
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Well, certainly, Jeffrey, as you structure development initially, it very much is probably advantageous for you to maintain the operations and the ownership of that midstream. At some point in time, it may flip. And part of that is just due to the valuation; everything has got a price. And that's one of the things I really love about our picture right now is we've got a lot of flexibility and lot of optionality, we've talked about in the prepared remarks. And so at some point in time, that asset very well could be in the hunt.
Jeffrey Campbell - Touhy Brothers Investment Research Inc.
Is it also fair to say there's some commodity sensitivity involved as well, because I mean if you're saving $3 a barrel when oil's $50 a barrel, that's a lot more valuable than if it's $90.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's exactly right. And that's one of the things that has to go into your considerations as you evaluate what you do. Absolutely. Good point.
Jeffrey Campbell - Touhy Brothers Investment Research Inc.
Great. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Go ahead caller. Your line is open.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors
Sorry about that earlier.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thant's okay.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors
When I think about your midstream business, particularly in the Delaware Basin, do you ever consider doing your own MLP as opposed to the monetization of those midstream type assets across the portfolio?

Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
You know, David, I think you have to look at all of our options and that's something you could certainly look at. That's where we potentially have the scale that you could consider something like that. Some of our other assets on the midstream side, I'm not sure that we have the scale of it on a standalone basis. But as you look at what we have there, both the water, the gas and some of our plans around crude oil gathering along with the bolt-on operations, there's just a lot of potential there. So it's something that we would evaluate.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors
Okay. And then the upspacing commentary in the Piceance, what would expect as an EUR productivity uplift, like how much time do you need to know from a production history standpoint to really evaluate the ongoing thoughts of the new completion designs in the Piceance asset?
Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development
Yeah. Great question, Dave. So the benefit that we have is that we have 5,000 existing wells. And so the first thing the team has done is looked through our history and say, okay, which wells have we completed that most similarly look like what we're trying to accomplish. So we have lots of 20 acre wells in our history. We don't have exactly the completion designs, but can kind of narrow in to get an idea of what the uplift could be. So we have a pretty good feel as a starting point. When we actually get production and be able to lay over that type curve, I think we'll know in relatively short fashion, 60 days to 90 days, if we're on the right track or not.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors
Okay. Thank you.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Dave, let me also interject that, as we're going through the asset reviews and you had all the Permian curves, if you will, of all the historic wells that you had, you had a handful of outliers that were obviously just outperforming, just lapping everything else. And Clay's question to the team was, my goodness, tell me about these wells.
Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development
You can say that again.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And that's where you get excited about the spacing and the stimulation up-side.

Your next question comes from the line of David Amoss from IBERIA Capital Partners. Your line is open.
David Meagher Amoss - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC
Good morning, guys.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hi, Dave.
David Meagher Amoss - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC
Rick, I want to start kind of high level and just run through a potential stress case. When you think about activity, let's just assume that oil stays in the $40 range for an extended period of time. What type of activity level could we be looking at in 2016 versus the plan that you laid out with the acquisition?
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I think, let me ask you Dave, when you say the $40 range, if we're talking $40 for WTI then I think you're going to have a very, very limit amount of activity. At $45, it's probably in the range where we're at right now. And as we've said in our press release, in the Bakken, where we've talked about adding a second and third rig, those are well-to-well type contracts. And so, to think we'd have – if we really felt it was going to be sustained at $45, we're going to have a minimal amount of activity. And then as you get north of $50, that's where you start adding some more rigs.
Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development

And David, this is Clay. If I could just add a point to that, we look at it from a macro standpoint and say, okay, how does our capital intensity look relative to our capital spend? And as we look at the individual returns that we are creating from these wells, that's kind of how we get to the spend rate. So certainly as our overall cash flow is reduced by commodity price, that'll affect overall cash – excuse me, capital investment. But as we're able to fight that off with better performance and then strike better returns, then we can look to achieve that and push that even further.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
The other thing I may also add is although we've come a long way in our resource assessment of understanding our assets, I will say that there's still an element, we have some ideas around the lower benches up in Three Forks, up in the Bakken. We're looking at looking at some interesting things out in the Gallup, some ideas we may have there. And then, obviously, as Clay stated real well earlier, an earlier question, we've got some other ideas. We want to test some of the concepts down in the Delaware.
So we've got some things, we still want to try, and so that would weigh a little bit on your rig activity as well just to try to gain a deeper and further understanding of our assets. I can tell you with the cost structures we're seeing now from a service perspective, now is a wonderful time to be doing some resource assessment.
David Meagher Amoss - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC
Good point. And that's really helpful and kind of leads me into my follow up. Clay, this quarter specifically you've heard several of your very direct neighbors in the Williston Basin come out and talk about EURs in the 800,000 barrel to 1 million barrel range for – let's call it, $7 million a well, and you've made great strides in improving the EUR uplift recently, and well cost is obviously trending in the right direction. Can you point us in the direction of is that a reasonable target the 800,000 barrels to 1 million barrels for $7 million, is that something that you're striving towards or should we be looking at the next six months of your Williston program differently?
Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development
Well, the politically correct answer is absolutely because you just said it in front of my boss.
David Meagher Amoss - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC
Fair enough.
Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development
But no, we absolutely have our eye on all the neighbors. From an EUR perspective, I assure you their rock is no better than our rock. We sit in the heart of the Williston basin. We have some of the best rock around. It's just a matter of unlocking the completion code. And I can tell you, we're making huge strides in that regard. We've thrown out the 750,000 barrels just as an indication that we're confident. Again, from prior experience and what we've been able to deliver, we're confident that 750,000 barrels. I don't want to put a stake in the ground at 800,000 barrels to 1 million barrels, but I have no reason to believe that, that's not achievable at this point.
On the cost side, we've come down. We started in a pretty good hole, worked our way out of that and I would say we're competitive. Now, I would never said we're top quartile on cost, but we want to get there and so we are now working towards an $8 million well cost, if we're at 750,000 barrels. I would say that the team continues to make strides on the cost side. Cost is a little bit trickier because as you upside it to the completion, you may end up giving back a little bit on the on the well cost. So we're looking at that value proposition. But the numbers you've thrown out certainly aren't out of the realm of our possibility.

David Meagher Amoss - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC
That's really helpful. Thank you.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Robert DuBoff - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
Yes. Hi. Good morning, guys.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, Robert.
Robert DuBoff - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
On the new CapEx guidance, during the RKI call last month, you were talking about, I believe, $900 million to $1 billion and now you're guiding to $825 million to $925 million. Can you just talk about the variance? Are you now actually looking at lower activity or is there just something else I'm missing?
J. Kevin Vann - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
No. That's a matter of just the timing of when you assume that we were to takeover and close the transaction. So if you assume a September 1 or a late August close date versus what we'd have originally assumed in those economics. Those economics assumed what it would look like for basically about half the year of 2015.
Robert DuBoff - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
Oh, okay. And if I can get a follow up, just on the ethane recovery, I noticed it's spiked up a little this last quarter. And even though you're still guiding for 15% for the full year, can you just talk about what happened there?
Michael R. Fiser - Senior Vice President of Marketing
Sure. This is Mike Fiser. The recoveries in Q2 are around 27%, compared to 16% in Q1. We have a couple of different processors out there, Enterprise and Williams. And the Enterprise facility actually is recovering more ethane. It's hard for us to determine exactly what that's going to look like month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. Our outlet right now is probably to be in that same range, balance of year. But we don't actually control that decision, but we're assuming that it'll be somewhere close to that for balance of year.
Robert DuBoff - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
All right. Great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Christensen from Imperial Capital. Your line is open.
Robert Christensen - Imperial Capital LLC
Thank you very much. Gentlemen, on the Delaware Basin acquisition, how much of those lands are federal? We've heard something about the difficulties of getting permits on time?
Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development
Hey, Bob. This is Clay. One of the reasons we were attracted to this Permian position is because we do have so much federal already in our portfolio. We see this as very complementary to our portfolio in that regard. The Stateline field is the heart of the field. It mostly sits on the Texas side. And so all of that is fee land. As you move to the North, into New Mexico, a lot of that is federal land. But it's a little different federal land. It's a little easier to work in that area. And so we think it's a good beneficial asset for our portfolio in that regard.
Robert Christensen - Imperial Capital LLC
I'm a little confused. Federal land is federal land, I thought. And there was another one of your competitors talking about – can't outrun our permits, permits are to seven months to eight months to drill here in New Mexico and getting a permit inventory is a constant. I don't understand what you just described, I'm sorry.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah.
Robert Christensen - Imperial Capital LLC
(35:31) this morning.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Yeah. Bob, this is Rick. I do know because I've worked on federal land for the better part of 35 years. And so you do see some variations in the different BLM districts on -

Robert Christensen - Imperial Capital LLC
Yeah.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
...on how they permit, how efficient they are. Sometimes they have resource issues themselves. And so I would say that a company like us, we're very, very used to dealing with that. We know how important it is to plan. If you have not been working on federal lands – and the State of Texas really doesn't have federal lands – but if you have traditionally worked there and then suddenly you start working on federal lands, it is a new ball game. And so I think that from our perspective, we certainly don't see it as an issue. And I'll also say that on many of those federal lands, from our perspective that, that's where we see a higher percentage of our non-operated interest, as well. And as Clay mentioned, the heart of our acreage is that state line area, which is predominantly in Loving County, Texas.
Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development
One thing I'll add to that, Bob, is we are inheriting this position with a nice inventory of permits. And the BLM office we work with New Mexico is very savvy. These guys have been in the oil and gas business, the heart of it, very good. So they do a real good job there.
Robert Christensen - Imperial Capital LLC
Right.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
They're very busy though. You got to reserve them.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Campbell - Touhy Brothers Investment Research Inc.
Thanks for getting me back in. I just wanted to ask one follow up. You've been drilling some really long wells lately, 14.7k in the Williston and 15 point 3,000 in the San Juan (37:20). I'm just wondering, are you seeing any enhanced performance characteristics from these wells or is this just simply a matter of better economics, avoiding an extra vertical well bore?
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I think what you see is a combination. In the Bakken, we are seeing some very nice returns. The three mile laterals we've drilled there have been driven primarily by the fact of some geographic situations with a lake. And so you've got some stranded sections, and so you're looking at needing to drill 3 mile laterals to access that last section. There's a couple ways that you can look at that. Number one is you'll never recover value from that section, and in my mind, that's certainly value enhancing. And then, in the San Juan, where Clay and his team have just drilled the 10,000 foot lateral, we'll see with time. That well has just been drilled and we've not got it completed yet. Completion operations are underway.
Jeffrey Campbell - Touhy Brothers Investment Research Inc.
Okay. Well, we'll look forward to that. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Coleman from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, thanks for taking my questions, guys. The first one was for Clay and it's – you're seeing some other operators, I guess people that are in the Bakken, but also those talking about change in the cluster spacing and proppant size. Could you just go back over the rescue that you-all are using and what's your, I guess, the steps and things that you might change as you roll through the back half of 2015 and then into 2016?

Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development
Sure, Andrew. I appreciate the question. I think the first thing we're doing is the right thing to do, which is look across the fence and see what those other very capable operators are achieving. We're plugged into the service companies. We're really studying all the work that's being done. And then, we're acting upon it. As I mentioned, we have our first four wells. We're just getting back into the completion and each of those have a little bit unique test to them.
And so, we're testing 6 million pounds, 10 million pounds, different prop size. You talked about perf cluster spacing, tightening those up in a couple of the different wells, and then also gel loadings, cross-linked versus slick water, sand versus the man-made proppant. And so there's a lot of things that we're testing and we're doing it in a very strategic, time measured approach to see where the value really gets achieved in each one of those.
Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. All right. Thank you. And then a question on the midstream side and are you looking at the possibility of doing something with just the water side of things or I guess separating the water from the gathering or is the plan to kind of try something on the midstream side with all the assets at once?
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Andrew, we do have that optionality to separate the water gathering systems that we have from some of the gas gathering, or crude oil gathering. But there's a lot of demand for those water gathering systems. They drive a lot of value. And since we've announced RKI transaction, our phone has literally been ringing off the hook, and a lot of interest in the water gathering, a lot of interest in the gas gathering and the crude oil gathering systems that we have. So I'd say right now everything's in play.
Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Excellent. It's good to have those options. The last question was just kind of looking at the, y'all being one of the fewer companies adding some additional rigs here in the back half of the year, I guess we're getting close to when that Bakken rig's going to be on location, but do you anticipate or have you seen so far any folks going non-consent on activity in any of your major operating regions?
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No. In the Williston, specifically, we have a lot of under consent and a large working interest up there. So, we're talking about adding rigs in the core of the corridor of the Bakken. That's something people will not go typically non-consent on. So we don't expect that.
Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thank you for your time today.

Your next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson from KLR Group. Your line is open.
Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC
Good morning, everyone. Just curious on those three-mile laterals in the Williston, what are the well costs on them?
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think – what are you looking at? $10.5 million?
Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development
Yeah.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Something like that?
Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development
Yeah, $10.5 million. Maybe a little bit higher because at least one of those – we drilled five earlier on in the process, we haven't completed. We have a couple more to complete and so they'll benefit more directly from the better costs we're seeing. So, it's kind of a blended cost, but generically as you think about it that incremental lateral, as long as everything is going good that extra 5,000 feet you can blow that through in just a few more days, and so your real cost is the completion cost and it will just be proportional to the incremental lateral length.

Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC
Great. Thank you. And then, on the San Juan, the 400 locations that you give in the oil window are based on 4,600 foot laterals. From a carry standpoint you've been pushing that lateral length, have you quantified the effect of the location count change utilizing a longer lateral on a go-forward basis or you're still in the testing mode and haven't made any decisions yet?
Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development
Yeah. So what we've done is we kept the 4,600 feet, which keeps the well count intact. I personally hope the longer laterals prove up and that as we develop these larger units, it'll get us a lot more flexibility to drill the longer laterals. I think what we're seeing in most every other basin is the longer laterals typically win from an economic standpoint. And end of the day, we're trying to create value, and if we do it by drilling fewer wells, I'm all in favor of that. We happen to have a huge amount of oil inventory these days. So that works pretty well in our favor.
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Gail, I may interject also, that in the second quarter, we announced a transaction where we picked up another 14,000 acre, and it's right there in the core. It really sets Clay and his team up for more of those longer laterals. And so the value creation that he's referring to really in my mind are twofold: Number one is the well cost and efficiency, those sort of things. And then number two is we have built out our midstream. We have to lay a lot less pipe basically to gather the same amount of gas or crude or water. That's where the economics that additional acreage we picked up really, really are going to come into play with those kind of efficiencies as well.
Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC
Okay, great. Thank you.

And again, we have a question from the line of Robert Christensen of Imperial Capital. Go ahead caller. Your line is open.
Robert Christensen - Imperial Capital LLC
Yeah. Thank you. In the Williston Basin, I see a sequential decline in oil in the first quarter of 9%. Is that the underlying decline rate in the Williston Basin?
Clay M. Gaspar - Senior VP-Operations & Resource Development
I wouldn't call it the pure decline. We have actually had a few of the completions trickle into the early part of the second quarter. And then as you well know, when you have a bunch of brand new wells, that decline gets very steep at the beginning and then tapers off. Starting the completions back in the third quarter, we'll have a little bit of benefit there from the wells we're drilling – or the wells we're completing in the third quarter. And if we stay on track to complete the drill on complete wells for the remainder of the year, we should see that curve flatten through the rest of the year.
Robert Christensen - Imperial Capital LLC
Yeah. That's helpful. I anticipate something of a positive nature coming there with what's going on. I just wanted to kind of get a sense because we're all watching industry and what's prone to happen with lesser activity. So I mean this is somewhat reflective of a decline rate, correct?
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think that's fair. It is a little bit of -
Robert Christensen - Imperial Capital LLC
I want to just be fair to myself and -
Richard E. Muncrief - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

The other thing that happens is that, producers, as they complete wells, they may have offsetting wells shut in. Well, if you're not completing wells, you're going to bring all of those wells on. And so from our perspective, once you start seeing people start completing wells, you're going to see some wells offset shut-in. So it gets a little cloudy at times. But I think you're looking for the same thing that everyone else is looking for and that's when are you going to start seeing volumes from a higher level start to roll over.
