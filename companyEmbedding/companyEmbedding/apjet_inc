What is a "Plasma"?






 
The first three states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas, and matter transitions from one state to the next by the addition of energy (often in the form of heat).  For example, “solid” water is ice and melts into water with the addition of heat (energy).  Water is evaporated into a gas with the addition of more heat.  Plasma occurs after the gas state, with the addition of more energy.   When molecules of the gas are given energy in excess of their ionization potential, electrons are able to escape the electron cloud.  This results in a body of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons.  These charged species can be affected by electric and magnetic fields, resulting in the production of additional excited species. More information, click below:

Plasma exists in many everyday forms.   The glow from neon signs is a plasma, as are lightening bolts.  Flames, lasers, and most of “outer space” are also plasma.   In general, plasma is classified by two factors, electron number density and temperature.  Electron number density refers to the number of molecules that have ionized (lost one or more electrons) relative to the number of neutral gas species.  “plasma temperature” is a bit confusing and does not refer to whether a plasma feels hot or cold, but rather to the energy (in the units eV) of the free electrons.  If there are significantly more neutral gas molecules than ionized gas molecules, the plasma may be cold to the touch, but still have very energetic electrons and thus a very high plasma temperature.Chemically active species can be produced by plasma if the proper conditions for generating  plasma are chosen and  the correct gases are selected.  APJeT™ is an expert in selecting gases and designing systems to maximize the production of these chemically active species and engineering them for the finishing of fabric and other substrates.

Atmospheric Pressure﻿ Plasma Jet (APPJ)
First patented in 1999 by founders of APJeT™ .Has no dielectric cover and is capable of producing a chemical flux. Key aspects of this technology include the use of helium and other proprietary gas blends to inhibit arcing, the absence of dielectric cover, the gap spacing between the electrodes and the RF frequencies used for powering the discharge.High plasma density without the associated high gas temperatures.








Mini-Tex






 
 
The Mini-Tex is a small scale fabric treatment system capable of processing narrow width, roll to roll fabrics.  It comprises two chemical dispense and two plasma treatment stations.  The system is used for developing new chemical processes as well as running customer fabric samples in roll widths from 10" to 16”.  The fabric handling system consists of multiple driven rolls with load cell control to run woven, knit, or non-woven fabrics of various weights and pile heights. 
 











APTeX: Roll-to-Roll Full 72" Prototype






 
 
The APTeX™ plasma machine is APJeT’s industrial scale plasma machine for finishing fabric.  It is designed to handle all fabric constructions: knits, wovens, nonwovens, pile materials and all polymer types: cotton, wool, silk, nylon, polyester, acrylic, aramids, etc.  It can be operated with a variety of fabric-finishing chemicals, depending on the desired end result.  The fabric is not exposed to any heat or water inside the plasma treatment system, making it possible to finish low melting point materials (polypropylene) and water sensitive materials (silk).Fabric is introduced into the system using conventional fabric handling equipment.  Inside the APTeX™ machine, chemistry and plasma are applied to the fabric in the space about 2m.  When the fabric exits the machine, the fabric finish is fully cured and ready for shipment.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

About us APJeT executed an exclusive license with the University of California on March 28, 2002, for all fields of use involving the Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jet (APPJ) technology. The widespread benefits of plasmas in numerous industrial and medical applications have been known for many years, but they have been encumbered by the necessity to generate them in a vacuum environment. Apjet''s focus is to develop commercial applications for this novel, atmospheric-pressure technology and to sell or lease systems suited for those applications.Business InformationEstablished In:2000Business Type:Manufacturer, Trader, Service Provider
