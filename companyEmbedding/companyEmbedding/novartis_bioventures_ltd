Heptares Therapeutics was acquired by Sosei Group Corporation in 2015
Combination Creates a Leading Global Biopharmaceutical Company with a Major Drug Discovery and Development Hub in the UK
Tokyo, Japan and London, UK – 23 February 2015: Sosei Group Corporation (the “Group” or “Sosei” - 4565, Tokyo Stock Exchange MOTHERS index), a leading Japanese biopharmaceutical company with operations in Japan and the UK, announces that it has acquired Heptares Therapeutics Limited (“Heptares”), a clinical-stage private UK-based biotechnology company focused on creating novel medicines targeting G protein-coupled receptors (“GPCRs”).
The combination will create a leading global biopharmaceutical group with:

sustainable, proven and highly successful drug discovery and clinical development capabilities for generating innovative medicines;
a broad and balanced pipeline with strong growth prospects, including products with blockbuster potential;
access to global pharmaceutical markets;
regulatory expertise across the EU, US and Japan; and
a significant cash balance.

These strengths will enable the Group to sustain its pipeline and revenue stream on a long-term basis. Heptares will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, with its existing R&D operations continuing in the UK.
Shinichi Tamura, Chairman and CEO of Sosei Group Corporation, said: “Today is an historic day for Sosei. Heptares is based on truly world-class science and its drug discovery and development capabilities will contribute to a sustainable stream of new products for the Group. While core to our future, an independent subsidiary structure will ensure Heptares is able to maintain the culture and business model that has been the foundation of its success so far.”
Dr Malcolm Weir, CEO of Heptares, added: “This is an excellent next step for Heptares which maintains our integrity and purpose within a Group that has a clear and coherent vision. It is a great example of the translation of ground-breaking UK academic science into economic and potential therapeutic value and secures significant investment into our technology platform and clinical pipeline well into the future. We look forward to working within the Group to advance our programmes, both partnered and in-house, and, over time, to providing much needed new treatment options for patients.”
1. Strategic rationale
The Group has been exploring strategic opportunities that can both build on and go beyond the secured revenue stream in milestones and royalties derived from the two COPD products (Ultibro® Breezhaler® and Seebri® Breezhaler®*) marketed by its partner Novartis.
The acquisition of Heptares, with its exciting clinical and preclinical pipeline of potentially transformative new medicines targeting serious diseases with major unmet need (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease, ADHD, metabolic disease, schizophrenia, migraine, and others), and its unique, differentiated and high potential StaR® drug discovery platform, significantly fulfils this goal and further represents a major step towards the Group’s strategic vision of becoming a significant global biopharmaceutical company arising from Japan.
In addition to its pipeline and platform, Heptares has established collaborative partnerships with a number of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies that provide the company with a prospective stream of revenue through milestones and royalties. Consolidation of these revenues will make a significant contribution to the Group’s financial position. The combined entity expects continued strong growth driven by revenues from new clinical-stage alliances and platform partnerships.
Heptares overview
Heptares was founded in 2007 based on the pioneering work of its founding scientists Richard Henderson and Christopher Tate at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (Cambridge, UK), with investment from MVM Life Science Partners and led by co-founders Malcolm Weir and Fiona Marshall. From these origins, and with additional venture funding from MVM, Clarus Ventures, Novartis Venture Fund, Takeda Ventures and the Stanley Family Foundation, Heptares has moved on to develop its unique StaR® technology platform that enables it to design drugs precisely based on a detailed understanding of the structure of the drug target – an approach known as structure-based drug design (SBDD). By this method, Heptares aims to design and develop superior medicines that are more effective, with better selectivity and fewer side effects.
Heptares applies this approach primarily to GPCRs – a superfamily of membrane proteins found in every cell in the body that are crucial to communication between cells. Their central role in many biological processes means that they are important targets for drugs: GPCRs are the site of action of about 40% of currently marketed drugs. The potential of the Heptares platform for both discovery of novel, differentiated small molecules and biologics, is therefore very high.
Heptares brings to the Group

An enhanced product pipelineHeptares’ StaR® platform has been used to generate an exciting, wholly owned pipeline of new medicines with potential to transform the treatment of a wide range of human diseases. The pipeline is focused on highly validated targets and is diversified across the neuroscience, metabolic and orphan disease areas, creating multiple future opportunities for both internal development and partnering, and thereby poised to generate revenue in the near future and over a long-term period.
Heptares’ pipeline of first-in-class or superior next-generation therapeutics includes:

Besides the above-mentioned programmes, the enlarged product portfolio of the Group will also include two COPD products, Seebri® Breezhaler® and Ultibro® Breezhaler®, developed and marketed in the EU, Japan, etc. (NDA submitted in the US) by licensing partner Novartis, SO-1105, a Phase III product indicated for oropharyngeal candidiasis, and four early stage products.
A proprietary drug discovery technology platform that is expected to generate revenue through and beyond the expiration of the Group’s COPD patents in 2026In addition to in-house development, Heptares has leveraged the capabilities of its proprietary StaR® technology to sign partnership agreements with a number of the world’s leadingpharmaceutical and biologics companies, including AstraZeneca, Cubist (Merck), Takeda Pharmaceutical, MorphoSys, MedImmune and Novartis. These existing partnerships have provided more than USD 30 million in upfront and milestone payments to-date and are expected to continue generating revenues through milestone payments and royalties over the coming years and beyond the expiration of the Group’s COPD products patents in 2026. New pipeline products and alliance deals will likewise generate income for many years to come.
The Heptares platform will complement the existing technologies of the Group subsidiaries: Activus’ nanoparticle technology (APNT), and Jitsubo’s novel peptide manufacturing technology (Molecular Hiving™) and peptide modification technology (Peptune™). Together, these technologies are expected to generate synergies in the effort to identify new compounds, and to further strengthen the pipeline and enhance corporate value.

Experienced leadership team with enhanced development and regulatory potentialHeptares is founded on world-class UK science and has built an outstanding team of scientists with expertise in GPCRs, SBDD, drug discovery and development, and neuroscience. These capabilities of Heptares in the EU and US will complement those of the Group in Japan, and will be supported by the management team that has extensive expertise in EU/US drug development and commercialization.

2. Management Structure
The Group will continue to be led by Shinichi Tamura as Chairman and CEO. Dr Malcolm Weir, Heptares co-founder and CEO, will remain as CEO of Heptares, which will be managed as an autonomous subsidiary of the Group. Dr Weir will also join the enlarged Group as Chief R&D Officer and will be responsible for worldwide research and development outside Japan. Dr Declan Doogan and Peter Bains, currently serving as non-executive directors on the Group’s main Board, will join the Heptares Board representing the Group’s interest. Dr Fiona Marshall, co-founder of Heptares and CSO, will also join the Heptares Board
3. Transaction details
Sosei has acquired 100% of Heptares’ share capital for USD 180 million in cash consideration and up to USD 220 million contingent upon the successful progression of the company’s pipeline and platform.
Sosei was advised by Moelis & Company and Clifford Chance LLP. Heptares was advised by Goldman Sachs International and Covington & Burling LLP.

Evaluation and Investment Process
We are stage agnostic (seed to commercial companies) and invest in multiple therapeutic areas where there is clear unmet medical need. Our first step in the process is to review non-confidential information about the company, team, technology / data, financial and exit plan. The further evaluation of business proposals is then based on confidential presentations by the management team that starts the full due diligence process.
Investments by the Novartis Venture Fund are made as equity participation typically as the lead or co-lead investor in a syndicate with a board seat.

Use of cookies on Novartis web sites



What is a cookie?
Cookies are small text files that are sent to your computer when you visit a website. Cookies on Novartis Group company (Novartis) web sites do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences and generally improving your experience of a website.
The EU Directive 2009/136/EC states that we can store cookies on your machine, if they are essential to the operation of this site, but that for all others we need your permission to do so.
Novartis sites can use some non-essential cookies. We do not do this to track individual users or to identify them, but to gain useful knowledge about how the sites are used so that we can keep improving them for our users. Without the knowledge we gain from the systems that use these cookies we would not be able to provide the service we do.
The types of cookies we use
If you decide to set the language, font-size or specific version of the site (e.g. high-contrast), we use “user interface customization cookies”. Once set, you do not need to specify your preferences again on another visit to the site.
If you use parts of the site that require registration to access content, we will place an “authentication cookie” on your computer. This allows you to leave and return to these parts of the site without re-authenticating yourself.
If you have Adobe Flash installed on your computer (most computers do) and you use video players, we store a “flash cookie” on your computer. These cookies are used to store data needed to play back video or audio content and store the user’s preferences.
Novartis likes to understand how visitors use our websites by using web analytics services. They count the number of visitors and tell us things about the visitors’ behaviour overall – such as identifying the search engine keywords that lead the user to the site, the typical length of stay on the site or the average number of pages a user views. For this purpose we place a “first party analytics cookie” on your computer.
We may also use services such as Google Analytics to track web statistics. In this case, Google will place a “3rd party cookie” on your computer. This is also the case when we use Google Maps.
Any data collected by using these cookies will be stored and managed by Novartis or one of its trusted affiliates in countries Novartis operates in.
For more information or how to contact Novartis, please refer to the Privacy Policy.
How to control cookies
If you don’t want to receive cookies, you can modify your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it or you can refuse cookies altogether. You can also delete cookies that have already been set.
If you wish to restrict or block web browser cookies which are set on your device then you can do this through your browser settings; the Help function within your browser should tell you how. Alternatively, you may wish to visit www.aboutcookies.org, which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of desktop browsers.

YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NOVARTIS AG MAY PERIODICALLY CHANGE, MODIFY, ADD OR REMOVE OR OTHERWISE UPDATE THIS PRIVACY POLICY AT ITS DISCRETION, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTIFICATION.

			The next sections explain how and when we collect Personal Data from you.
			

			2. Intended Use of Personal Data

In these situations, if you choose to withhold any Personal Data requested by us, it may not be possible for you to gain access to certain parts of the site and for us to respond to your query.
			

			We may collect and use Personal Data to provide you with products or services, to bill you for products and services you request, to market products and services which we think may be of interest to you, or to communicate with you for other purposes which are evident from the circumstances or about which we inform you when we collect Personal Data from you.

Personal Data may also be transferred to third parties who act for or on our behalf, for further processing in accordance with the purpose(s) for which the data were originally collected or may otherwise be lawfully processed, such as services delivery, evaluating the usefulness of this website, marketing, data management or technical support. These third parties have contracted with us to only use Personal Data for the agreed upon purpose, and not to sell your Personal Information to third parties, and not to disclose it to third parties except as may be required by law, as permitted by us or as stated in this Privacy Policy.
			

			Personal Data collected from you may also be transferred to a third party in the event that the business of this site or a part of it and the customer data connected with it is sold, assigned or transferred, in which case we would require the buyer, assignee or transferee to treat Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Also, Personal Data may be disclosed to a third party if we are required to do so because of an applicable law, court order or governmental regulation, or if such disclosure is otherwise necessary in support of any criminal or other legal investigation or proceeding here or abroad.
			

			4. Right of Access, Correction and Objection
			

			Whenever we process Personal Data, we take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Data is kept accurate and up-to date for the purposes for which it was collected. We will provide you with the ability to object to the processing of your Personal Data if such processing is not reasonably required for a legitimate business purpose as described in this policy or our compliance with law. In the case of electronic direct marketing, we will provide you with a method to opt out of receiving further marketing materials or with a method to opt in if required by law. If you wish to contact us regarding our use of your Personal Data or object to the processing of your Personal Data, please email us at corporate.enquiries@group.novartis.com. If you contact us, please note the name of the website where you provided the information, as well as the specific information you would like us to correct, update or delete plus a proper identification of you. Requests to delete personal data will be subject to any applicable legal and ethical reporting or document filing or retention obligations imposed on us.
			

			5. Security and Confidentiality
			

			To ensure the security and confidentiality of Personal Data that we collect online, we use data networks protected, inter alia, by industry standard firewall and password protection. In the course of handling your Personal Data, we take measures reasonably designed to protect that information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. 
			

			6. Data Transfer Abroad
			

			We are part of the Novartis Group which is a global group of companies and has databases in different countries, some of which are operated by the local Novartis Group Company, and some of which are operated by third parties on behalf of the local Novartis Group Company. We may transfer your data to one of the Group's databases outside your country of domicile, potentially including countries which may not require an adequate level of protection for your Personal Data compared with that provided in your country. 
			

			However, Novartis has adopted Binding Corporate Rules, a system of principles, rules and tools, provided by European law, in an effort to ensure effective levels of data protection, in particular relating to transfers of personal information outside the EEA and Switzerland.

Security and Issuer.  This statement on Schedule 13D (this Schedule 13D) relates to the common stock, par value $0.001 per
share (the Common Stock), of Aileron Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Issuer). The address of the Issuers principal executive office is 281 Albany Street, Cambridge, MA 02139.  Item 2. Identity and Background.  (a)    This Schedule 13D is being filed by Novartis Bioventures Ltd. (NBV) and Novartis AG
(Novartis). NBV and Novartis are hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the Reporting Persons.  (b)    The principal business address of NBV is 131 Front Street, Hamilton HM12 Bermuda, Mail: PO Box HM 2899, Hamilton HM
LX, Bermuda. The principal business address of Novartis is Lichtstrasse 35, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.  (c)    NBV is a company organized under the laws of Bermuda and is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Novartis. NBV is
a financially driven corporate life science venture fund whose purpose is to foster innovation, drive significant patient benefit and generate superior returns by creating and investing in innovative life science companies at various stages of their
development, independent from Novartis strategy.  Novartis is a corporation organized under the laws of Switzerland and is the
publicly owned parent of a multinational group of companies specializing in the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of healthcare products led by innovative pharmaceuticals. Novartis is the 100% indirect owner of NBV.
 (d) - (e) Neither the Reporting Persons nor, to the best knowledge of each of them, any of the executive officers and members of the
Board of Directors of each of the Reporting Persons set forth on Schedule I hereto during the last five years, (i) has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) was a party to a
civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject
to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.  (f) The name, business address, present
principal occupation or employment and citizenship of the executive officers and members of the Board of Directors of each of the Reporting Persons is set forth on Schedule I hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.  Item 3. Source and Amounts of Funds or Other Consideration.  NBV acquired 22,631,671 shares of the Issuers Series C-1, Series
C-2, Series D, Series E, Series E-1, Series E-2, Series E-3 and Series F preferred stock
at various times between November 21, 2007 and June 28, 2017, the date the Issuer became a reporting company. Such shares of preferred stock automatically converted into 2,277,515 shares of Common Stock on a
9.937-for-one-basis upon the closing of the Issuers initial public offering without payment of consideration. NBV acquired
266,667 shares of Common Stock following the closing of the Issuers initial public offering at the public offering price of $15.00 per share.  The source of funds for the purchases of the Issuers securities was working capital of NBV.  Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.  The
information contained in Item 3 above is incorporated herein by reference.  All shares of Common Stock reported acquired by the Reporting
Persons in this Schedule 13D were acquired for the purpose of investment and were not intended to and did not affect any change in the control of the Issuer.  The Reporting Persons from time to time intend to review their investment in the Issuer on the basis of various factors, including the
Issuers business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, general economic and industry conditions, the securities markets in general and those for the Issuers shares of Common Stock in particular, as well as other
developments and other investment opportunities. Based upon such review, the    Page 4 of 10 Pages    CUSIP No. 00887A 105    Schedule 13D  
Reporting Persons will take such actions in the future as the Reporting Persons may deem appropriate in light of the circumstances existing from time to time. If the Reporting Persons believe
that further investment in the Issuer is attractive, whether because of the market price of the Common Stock or otherwise, they may acquire shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Issuer either in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions. Similarly, depending on market and other factors, the Reporting Persons may determine to dispose of some or all of the shares of Common Stock currently owned by the Reporting Persons or otherwise acquired by the Reporting Persons
either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  Except as described above, none of the Reporting Persons currently has
any plan or proposal that relates to or would result in any of the actions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.  Dr. Ambros, a member of the board of directors of the Issuer, serves as the global head of the Novartis Venture Fund and, in this

securities directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, by either Reporting Person.  (d)    Not applicable.  (e)    Not applicable.  Item 6.

dated as of December 23, 2016 (the Investor Rights Agreement), among the Issuer, NBV and the other stockholders party thereto, pursuant to which, among other things, (i) NBV has the right to require the Issuer to register the

of the Issuers counsel and accountants and reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel representing any selling stockholders, other than any underwriting discounts and commissions, related to any demand or incidental registration; and
 A lock-up agreement entered into by NBV in connection with the Issuers initial public

Issuers Common Stock or any securities convertible into, exercisable for or exchangeable for the Issuers Common Stock, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of shares of the Issuers Common Stock or other
securities, in cash or otherwise, or publicly disclose the intention to enter into any such transaction, or (ii) enter into any swap or other derivative transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or
risks of ownership of such shares of the Issuers Common Stock, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of shares of the Issuers Common Stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise, or publicly disclose the intention
to enter into any such transaction.  The descriptions contained in this Statement on Schedule 13D of the Investor Rights Agreement and the
