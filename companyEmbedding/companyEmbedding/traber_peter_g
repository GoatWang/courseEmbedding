He received his undergraduate degree B.S. in Chemical Engineering at the University of Michigan in 1977, his M.D. from Wayne State Medical School in Michigan in 1981, and he trained as a gastroenterologist, after completing an internal medicine residency at Northwestern University School of Medicine in Chicago.
In 2003, Traber was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and is a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation. In 1999, Traber received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Wayne State University School of Medicine and in 2006 he was honored with the American Gastroenterological Association outstanding Service Award.

By Peter G. Traber, M.D. on March 17, 2016
We often talk about how Galectin Therapeutics’ proprietary compound, GR-MD-02, is protected by a strong intellectual property portfolio. I thought it might be useful to drill a little more deeply into that statement. 
Our patent portfolio is an important asset for Galectin Therapeutics, and it took hard and careful work to put it in place. Each patent/patent application is a strategic building block which reflects present and future business objectives and protects current core technology. The Galectin Therapeutics’ patent portfolio covers the products or composition of matter (i.e. active pharmaceutical ingredient or API), formulations of the products, use of the products and methods of manufacturing.
The most valuable patent in the Galectin Therapeutics’ portfolio is a composition of matter patent which covers the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Composition patents exclude others from making, using, selling or offering for sale the API. 
Patenting complex carbohydrates can be more challenging than for a small molecule
Galectin Therapeutics’ proprietary compound, GR-MD-02, is derived from the modification of a natural pectin. Pectins are widely used in the food industry as a thickening agent for making things such as jellies and jams. There are a substantial number of patents on using pectin in pharmaceutical applications. Galectin Therapeutics had to show that GR-MD-02 was novel and non-obvious, in view of the prior pectin art.
GR-MD-02 is a complex carbohydrate molecule. A small molecule with a small molecular weight (e.g. 300 Da) in comparison can have a very specific structure and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) can then compare the molecule to a chemical database to assess if the compound is different than publically available compounds.
GR-MD-02 on the other hand, is a mixture of complex carbohydrates having an average molecular weight between 20,000 to 70,000 Da. These are big molecules. This means that Galectin Therapeutics had to take a slightly different approach to characterizing the molecule in its patent applications. GR-MD-02 can be defined by its physical and chemical properties such as the average molecular weight, the carbohydrate composition, the ratio of critical carbohydrates from one to the other, and a two-dimensional NMR to establish a “fingerprint” of the molecule. One of the most critical carbohydrates in GR-MD-02 is galactose, and GR-MD-02 can be characterized by the ratio between galactose and arabinose. GR-MD-02 can be characterized by its degree of methoxylation — or the amount of methyl groups on the backbone of the molecule. Galectin Therapeutics was awarded a composition of matter patent in the U.S. on GR-MD-02 (U.S. patent 8,871,925 entitled “Compositions of Novel Carbohydrate Drug for Treatment of Human Diseases.” The U.S. patent issued on October 28, 2014 and will expire in 2032.
Protecting not just the molecule but also its manufacture and its use
Beyond the composition of matter patent for GR-MD-02 stands a portfolio of other patents that strengthen Galectin Therapeutics’ patent portfolio. Galectin Therapeutics holds a process patent that covers the manufacture GR-MD-02 from the pectin (U.S. patent No. 8,962,824). Presumably, a similar process has to be used to manufacture a drug similar to GR-MD-02, and having the process patented adds a second layer of protection to the compound as well.
Galectin Therapeutics also has 5 different patent families that cover the methods of use. These support the various indications for GR-MD-02 that Galectin Therapeutics plans to test. Method of use patents exclude others for using the API in specific indications. Galectin Therapeutics has a method of use U.S. patent for NASH (U.S. patent No. 8,658,787). Galectin Therapeutics has a method of use patent for kidney disease, specifically diabetic nephropathy as well as other similar types of glomerulopathy that patients develop, not necessarily related to diabetes (U.S. patent No. 8,828,971). We also have a method of use patent application allowed for pulmonary fibrosis, as well as method of use U.S. patents covering liver fibrosis, kidney fibrosis and heart fibrosis. 
Patents pending
Galectin Therapeutics has more than 50 patent applications pending. There are a number of method of use patents pending, in both cancer immunotherapy and other disease states. The method of use patents and applications strengthen the patent portfolio and protect Galectin Therapeutics for future business objectives. 
Foreign patents
Galectin Therapeutics has filed for patent protection in 10 foreign countries which are viewed are significant market for the API or the manufacture of the API (Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico and South Africa).  The U.S. patent process generally moves more quickly than the rest of the world and issuance of patents in the U.S. can be helpful to expedite prosecution in foreign countries. 
These “CEO Perspectives” are a regular feature of our communication activities and may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements relate to future events and use words such as “may,” “might,” “could,” “expect” and others. These statements include those regarding the hope that Galectin Therapeutic’ s development program for GR-MD-02 will show that it can be both safe and effective when used in combination with other drugs for the treatment of patients with cancer. For a discussion of additional factors impacting Galectin’s business, see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and subsequent filings with the SEC. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Although subsequent events may cause its views to change, management disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements.

              Abstract




Intestinal epithelia cells express unique gene products which enable the intestine to perform specialized tasks including the absorption and processing of nutrients. Enterocyte function varies during development, along the length of the intestinal tract (horizontal axis), along the crypt-villus unit (vertical axis), in response to physiological stimuli, and in disease states. This complex pattern of function is directly related, in many cases, to the pattern of expression of intestine-specific genes that encode proteins which perform those functions. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms which regulate patterns of intestine- specific gene transcription or intestinal epithelial cell development and differentiation. In this proposal, sucrase-isomaltase (SI) will be used as a model gene to probe the molecular mechanisms which regulate enterocyte- specific gene transcription. SI has been chosen because it is enterocyte- specific, expressed at moderately high levels, has a complex pattern of developmental and adult expression, is altered in physiological and disease states, and is expressed in intestinal tumor cell lines which enables in vitro experimental approaches. The reagents required for these studies have been developed including human and mouse SI CDNAS and genomic clones containing the 5'-flanking regions of both the human and mouse SI genes. Transfection experiments have demonstrated that the human SI gene contains elements capable of directing intestine-specific transcription an transgenic mice containing a human SI gene construct have been made. Therefore, the goals of this proposal are: 1) To identify DNA regulatory regions in the SI gene and the corresponding sequence-specific nuclear binding proteins which are necessary to direct efficient, enterocyte- specific transcription, and 2) To determine which DNA regulatory regions are required to recapitulate the spatial (horizontal and vertical) and developmental patterns of SI gene expression in adult tissues using transgenic mice. The experiments outlined in this proposal use a multifaceted approach to provide detailed information on the regulation of SI gene transcription. Elucidation of transcriptional mechanisms for tissue-specific genes in other tissues has led to identification of DNA binding proteins which direct cell-specific transcription and are important for cellular differentiation and proliferation. Thus, SI DNA elements and/or nuclear binding proteins may participate in the regulation of multiple intestinal genes, in the process of differentiation and development, or serve to regulate proliferation. The anticipated result of these studies will be a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms which regulate intestinal gene expression, development, and differentiation.

I've spent my career in academia and medical research, becoming a leading researcher in gastroenterology and hepatology and serving as the head of two prestigious medical schools. In the pharmaceutical industry, I was senior vice president and chief medical officer at GlaxoSmithKline. I took on the position as CEO of Galectin Therapeutics because of the opportunity to address the major unmet medical need presented by liver fibrosis and NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), both with no currently approved drug therapies. This role allows me to apply the experiences of a lifetime to solving a problem that affects millions of people in the U.S. alone.You can learn more about me at http://petertraber.com/.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
