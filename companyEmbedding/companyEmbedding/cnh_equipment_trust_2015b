                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

RECITALS
 

WHEREAS , CNHICA and CNHCR wish to set forth the terms
pursuant to which Contracts having an aggregate Contract Value of
approximately $234,351,535.76 and identified on Schedule A to
the CNHICA Assignment (the “Purchased Contracts”) as of
the Cutoff Date are to be sold by CNHICA to CNHCR on the date
hereof; and
 

WHEREAS , CNHCR, as of the Cutoff Date, owned Contracts
previously purchased from CNHICA pursuant to an Amended and
Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement dated as of
December 15, 2000 (as amended from time to time, the
“Liquidity Receivables Purchase Agreement”) between
CNHICA and CNHCR, having an aggregate Contract Value of
approximately $515,648,856.23 and identified on Schedule A to the
Assignment (the “Owned Contracts”, and together with
the Purchased Contracts, the “Receivables”);
and
 

WHEREAS , the Receivables will be transferred by CNHCR,
pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, to CNH Equipment
Trust 2015-C (the “Trust”), which Trust will issue
Certificates representing non-assessable, fully paid, undivided
beneficial interests in, and Notes collateralized by, the
Receivables and the other property of the Trust; and
 

WHEREAS , CNHICA and CNHCR wish to set forth herein
certain representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities of
CNHICA with respect to the Receivables for the benefit of CNHCR,
the Trust, the Noteholders and the Certificateholders.
 

NOW, THEREFORE
, in consideration of the foregoing,
other good and valuable consideration and the mutual terms and
covenants contained herein the parties hereto agree as
follows:
 

ARTICLE I
 

CERTAIN
DEFINITIONS

Definitions
.  Capitalized terms used
herein and not otherwise defined herein are defined in Appendix A
to the Indenture dated as of the date hereof between CNH Equipment
Trust 2015-C and Citibank, N.A., as Indenture Trustee.
 

Section 1.2.
                                                             
Other Definitional
Provisions .
 

(a)                                 
All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise
defined therein.
 

(b)                                 
As used in this Agreement and in any

accounting terms not defined in this Agreement or in any
such
 





 
certificate or other document, and accounting
terms partly defined in this Agreement or in any such certificate
or other document to the extent not defined, shall have the
respective meanings given to them under generally accepted
accounting principles as in effect on the date hereof.  To the
extent that the definitions of accounting terms in this Agreement
or in any such certificate or other document are inconsistent with
the meanings of such terms under generally accepted accounting
principles, the definitions contained in this Agreement or in any
such certificate or other document shall control.
 

(c)                                  
The words “hereof”,
“herein”, “hereunder” and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as

(f)                                   
References to any agreement refer to
that agreement as from time to time amended or supplemented or as
the terms of such agreement are waived or modified in accordance
with its terms.
 

(g)

ARTICLE II
 

CONVEYANCE OF
RECEIVABLES
 

Section 2.1.
                                                             
Conveyance of Purchased
Contracts .  In
consideration of CNHCR’s payment of $234,351,535.76 (the
“Purchase Price”) in the manner set out in
Section 2.5(a), and the other consideration (including the
terms and covenants) contained herein, CNHICA does hereby sell,
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to CNHCR, without
recourse (subject to the obligations herein), all of its right,
title, interest in, to and under (collectively, the “CNHICA
Assets”):
 

(i)                                     
the Purchased Contracts and the
Owned Contracts, including all documents constituting chattel paper
included therewith, and all obligations of the Obligors thereunder,
including all monies paid thereunder on or after the Cutoff
Date;
 

(ii)                                  
the security interests in the
Financed Equipment granted by Obligors pursuant to the Purchased
Contracts and the Owned Contracts and any other interest of CNHICA
in such Financed Equipment;
 
2 





 

(iii)                               
any proceeds with respect to the
Purchased Contracts and the Owned Contracts from claims on
insurance policies covering Financed Equipment or Obligors (to the
extent not used to purchase Substitute Equipment);
 

(iv)                              
any proceeds from recourse to
Dealers with respect to the Purchased Contracts and the Owned
Contracts;
 

(v)                                 
any Financed Equipment that shall
have secured the Purchased Contracts and the Owned Contracts and
that shall have been acquired by or on behalf of CNHCR;
and
 

(vi)                              
the proceeds of any and all of the
foregoing.
 
Insofar as the grant above relates to Owned
Contracts and related property, it is made for administrative
convenience and is not intended to derogate from the prior
conveyance of the Owned Contracts and related property pursuant to
the Liquidity Receivables Purchase Agreement.  The parties to
this Agreement acknowledge and agree that, except as set
forth in Section 5.5 of this Agreement, the sole
remedy for any breach of any representation or warranty made by
CNHICA to CNHCR at any time as to the Owned
Contracts and related property will be the repurchase
obligation of CNHICA set forth in Section 6.2 of this
Agreement.
 

Section 2.2.
                                                             
[Reserved]
.
 

Section 2.3.
                                                             
Intention of the
Parties .  The
parties to this Agreement intend that the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be, and shall be treated as, a purchase by CNHCR and a
sale by CNHICA of the Receivables and not as a lending transaction,
such that in the event of a filing of a petition for relief by or
against CNHICA under the Bankruptcy Code, (i) such Receivables
would not be property of CNHICA’s bankruptcy estate under
Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code, (ii) the bankruptcy
court would not compel the turnover of such Receivables or
collections thereon by CNHCR to CNHICA under Section 542 of
the Bankruptcy Code, and (iii) the bankruptcy court would
determine that payments on such Receivables not in the possession
of CNHICA would not be subject to the automatic stay provisions of
Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code imposed upon the
commencement of CNHICA’s bankruptcy case.  The foregoing
sale, assignment, transfer and conveyance does not constitute, and
is not intended to result in a creation or assumption by CNHCR of,
any obligation or liability with respect to any Receivables, nor
shall CNHCR be obligated to perform or otherwise be responsible for
any obligation of CNHICA or any other Person in connection with the
Receivables or under any agreement or instrument relating thereto,
including any contract or any other obligation to any
Obligor.  If (but only to the extent that) the transfer of the

6 





 
assignment and transfer of such Receivables to
the Trust pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the
Grant to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the
Indenture:
 

(i)                                     
Characteristics of
Receivables.   Each
Receivable is a Retail Installment Contract and: 
(A) (1) (i) was originated in the United States of
America by a Dealer in connection with the retail sale of Financed
Equipment in the ordinary course of such Dealer’s business,
and (ii) was purchased by CNHICA from a Dealer and validly
assigned by such Dealer to CNHICA in accordance with its terms,
except that some of the Receivables were purchased by NH Credit
from Dealers (after being originated as provided above),
securitized in a previous CNH Equipment Trust and purchased by
CNHICA through the exercise of a clean-up call relating to that
previous securitization or (2) was originated in the United
States of America by CNHICA in connection with the financing or
refinancing, as applicable, of Financed Equipment in the ordinary
course of CNHICA’s business, and in the case of the foregoing
clauses (1) and (2), was fully and properly executed by the
parties thereto, (B) has created a valid, subsisting and
enforceable first priority security interest in the Financed
Equipment in favor of CNHICA except to the extent that such
security interest has been assigned by CNHICA to CNHCR, by CNHCR to
the Issuing Entity and by the Issuing Entity to the Indenture
Trustee, (C) contains customary and enforceable provisions
such that the rights and remedies of the holder thereof are
adequate for realization against the collateral of the benefits of
the security, and (D) provides for fixed payments on a
periodic basis that fully amortize the Amount Financed by maturity
and yield interest at the Annual Percentage Rate.
 

(ii)                                  
Schedule of Receivables; No
Adverse Selection of Receivables; Accuracy of Computer
Tape.   The
information set forth on Schedule A to the CNHICA Assignment
delivered on the Closing Date is true and correct in all material
respects as of the opening of business on the Cutoff Date.  No
selection procedures believed by CNHICA to be adverse to the
interests of the Trust, the Noteholders or the Certificateholders
were or will be utilized in selecting the Receivables.  The
computer tape regarding the Receivables made available to CNHCR and
its assigns is true and correct in all respects.
 

(iii)                               
Compliance with Law.
  Each Receivable and the sale
of the related Financed Equipment complied in all material respects
at the time it was originated or made and at the execution of this
Agreement with all requirements of applicable federal, state and
local laws and regulations thereunder, including usury law, the
Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act,
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulations B and
Z, the Wisconsin Consumer Act and state adaptations of the National
Consumer Act and of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code, and other
consumer credit laws and equal credit opportunity and disclosure
laws, in each case, to the extent applicable.
 

(iv)                              
Binding Obligation.
  Each Receivable represents
the genuine, legal, valid and binding payment obligation in writing
of the Obligor, enforceable by the holder thereof in accordance
with its terms.
 
7 






 

(v)          
No Government Obligor.   None of the Receivables is due
from the United States of America or any state or from any agency,
department or instrumentality of the United States of America or
any state.
 

(vi)         
Security Interest in Financed Equipment.   Immediately
prior to the sale, assignment and transfer thereof, each Receivable
shall be secured by a validly perfected first priority security
interest in the Financed Equipment in favor of CNHICA as secured
party or all necessary and appropriate actions have been commenced
that would result in the valid perfection of a first priority
security interest in the Financed Equipment in favor of CNHICA as
secured party.
 

(vii)        
Receivables in Force.   No Receivable has been
satisfied, subordinated or rescinded, nor has any Financed
Equipment been released from the Lien granted by the related
Receivable in whole or in part (other than with respect to
equipment released from a Lien in accordance with the Servicing
Procedures and replaced with Substitute Equipment).
 

(viii)       
No Amendment or Waiver.   No provision of a Receivable
has been waived, altered or modified in any respect, except
pursuant to a document, instrument or writing included in the
Receivable Files and no such amendment, waiver, alteration or
modification causes such Receivable not to conform to the other
warranties contained in this Section.
 

(ix)         
No Defenses.   No right of rescission, setoff,
counterclaim or defense has been asserted or threatened or exists
with respect to any Receivable.
 

(x)          
No Liens.   To the best of CNHICA’s knowledge, no
Liens or claims, including claims for work, labor or materials,
relating to any of the Financed Equipment have been filed that are
Liens prior to, or equal or coordinate with, the security interest
in the Financed Equipment granted by any Receivable, except those
pursuant to the Basic Documents.
 

(xi)         
No Default; Delinquency Limitations.   No Receivable is
a non-performing Receivable or has a payment that is more than 90
days overdue as of the Cutoff Date and, except for a payment
default continuing for a period of not more than 90 days, no
default, breach, violation or event permitting acceleration under
the terms of any Receivable has occurred and is continuing; and no
continuing condition (other than a payment default

CNH Industrial's (CNHI) Note Issue Rated by Moody's - Analyst Blog


May 05, 2015, 06:49:00 PM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

Moody's Investors Service, a leading credit rating agency,
assigned provisional ratings to the notes to be issued by CNH
Equipment Trust 2015-B (CNH 2015-B), the debt issuing entity
of 
CNH Industrial N.V.
CNHI

, a premier global manufacturer in the capital goods sector. The
notes will be sponsored by CNH Industrial Capital America LLC, an
affiliate of CNH Industrial.
This CNH Equipment Trust 2014-B securitization involves
underlying collateral of U.S. retail installment contracts and
loans, backed by new or used agricultural equipment.
CNH Industrial's equipment lease securitization consists of five
tranches of A notes and one tranche of B notes. The Class A notes
have been assigned a rating of Aaa, which is awarded to securities
of the highest quality with the lowest level of credit risk.
In addition, its Class A-1 notes have received a P-1 rating,
indicating a superior ability to repay short-term debt obligations.
The Class B notes have been assigned an A2 rating, and are subject
to low credit risk.
The ratings of the notes address their credit quality and
signify the likelihood of the timely repayment of interest and the
ultimate payment of principal pursuant to their terms.
The strong ratings by Moody's reflect the first-rate quality of
the underlying collateral pool, the strength of the ABS structure,
and the experience and proficiency of the ABS servicer, New Holland
Credit Company, LLC.
In addition, there is an initial 4.50% hard credit enhancement
behind the Class A notes, consisting of a spread account and
subordination. Credit enhancements improve the credit quality and
ratings assigned to the notes. The subordination of the B tranche
provides a credit enhancement to the Class A notes of the
structure.
The notes could receive an upgrade in case the issuer provides
better credit protection to investors by way of enhancements.
Robust macroeconomic performance and improved agricultural markets,
being major drivers of performance of the collateral, might also
lead to an upgrade.
CNH Industrial presently holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
Better-ranked stocks in the sector that look promising include
Daimler AG
DDAIF

, AB Volvo
VOLVY

and Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.
CTB

, each holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Moody's Assigns Rating to CNH Industrial's Note Issue - Analyst Blog


May 14, 2015, 11:50:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

Moody's Investors Service, a leading credit rating agency,
assigned definitive ratings to the notes issued by CNH Equipment
Trust 2015-B (CNH 2015-B), the debt issuing entity of 
CNH Industrial N.V.
CNHI

, a premier global manufacturer in the capital goods sector. The
notes are sponsored by CNH Industrial Capital America LLC, an
affiliate of CNH Industrial.
This CNH Equipment Trust 2014-B securitization involves
underlying collateral of U.S. retail installment contracts and
loans, backed by new or used agricultural equipment.
CNH Industrial's equipment lease securitization consists of five
tranches of A notes and one tranche of B notes. The Class A notes
have been assigned a rating of Aaa, which is awarded to securities
of the highest quality with the lowest level of credit risk. In
addition, its Class A-1 notes have received a P-1 rating,
indicating a superior ability to repay short-term debt obligations.
The Class B notes have been assigned an A2 rating, which indicates
that they are subject to low credit risk.
The ratings of the notes address their credit quality and
signify the likelihood of the timely repayment of interest and the
ultimate payment of principal pursuant to their terms.
The strong ratings by Moody's reflect the first-rate quality of
the underlying collateral pool, the strength of the ABS structure,
and the experience and proficiency of the ABS servicer, New Holland
Credit Company, LLC.
In addition, there is an initial 4.50% hard credit enhancement
behind the Class A notes, consisting of a spread account and
subordination. Credit enhancements improve the credit quality and
ratings assigned to the notes. The subordination of the B tranche
provides a credit enhancement to the Class A notes of the
structure.
The notes could receive an upgrade in case the issuer provides
better credit protection to investors by way of enhancements.
Robust macroeconomic performance and improved agricultural markets,
being major drivers of performance of the collateral, might also
lead to an upgrade.
The company is, at present, rated Ba1 with a stable outlook by
Moody's. A Ba1 rating indicates speculative elements and signifies
the presence of substantial credit risk.
CNH Industrial designs, produces, markets, sells, and finances
agricultural and construction equipment, trucks, commercial
vehicles, buses, and specialty vehicles, engines, transmissions and
axles globally.
CNH Industrial presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Better-ranked stocks in the sector that look promising include
Daimler AG
DDAIF

, Valeo SA.
VLEEY

and Wabash National Corp
WNC

, all holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
