Pull-down member for an eyeglass frame with improved coupling pin



Patent number:  6293673
                                            

Abstract:  An eyeglass frame includes two temples and a pull-down member rotatably and ratchedly attached in an opening of the distal end of each temple. Each pull-down member is movable with respect to the end-piece at a series of discrete angles, and thereby provides a snug fit of the eyeglass frame on the user's face. The pull-down member includes a core with a central opening defined by a series of teeth. A pin having a complementary series of teeth along an outer surface thereof engages the toothed opening of the core to provide the pivotable and ratchetable displacement of the pull-down member relative to the end-piece of the frame temple. The pin has a top portion with an adjustment protrusion extending therefrom and a bottom portion which covers the opening of the end piece.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        June 14, 2000
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        September 25, 2001
                        

Assignee: 
                                                                        Pareto Corporation
                                

Inventors:

Rimless or semi-rimless safety eyeglasses



Patent number:  6217169
                                            

Abstract:  An eyeglass assembly including an endpiece which is adapted to engage a flexible strand for holding a lens, the endpiece having an inner surface which is disposed adjacent to the lens when the lens is present; the inner surface of the endpiece having a front edge and a back edge for being located adjacent to front and back sides of the lens; the front edge being chamfered to define a chamfer angle of substantially 8° to 65° with respect to the lens; and the back edge being chamfered to define a chamfer angle of substantially 8° to 50° with respect to the lens. The chamfering of the edges of the endpiece is effective to reduce the risk of chipping the lens when the endpiece is adjusted to fit the wearer's head. Also disclosed is an elastic cushioning ring disposed between the lens and the frame and/or the flexible lens supporting strand in a rimless or semi-rimless frame.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant

Date of Patent: 
                                                        April 17, 2001

Inventors:

Pull down member on temple of eyeglasses



Patent number:  5623322
                                            

Abstract:  A pull-down member is pivotably and ratchetly attached to the distal end of the end-piece of each eyeglass temple. Each pull-down member is pivotably displaceable to the end-piece at a series of angles, and thereby provides a snug fit of the eyeglasses on the user's face. In one embodiment, the pull-down member comprises a disk-shaped core having an edge on which is attached an elongated appendage which is the portion of the pull-down member abutting against the user's ear. The edge of the core also includes a series of notches which are biased by a ball and spring mechanism to provide the pivotable and ratchetable displacement of the pull-down member relative to the end-piece of the eyeglass temple. In another embodiment of the pull-down member, the core has a central opening defined by a series of teeth.
