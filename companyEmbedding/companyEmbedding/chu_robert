                                    On January 25, 2013, the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) of the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) published the long-awaited omnibus final regulation governing health data privacy, security and enforcement (Omnibus Rule). The Omnibus Rule is a group of regulations that finalizes four sets of proposed or interim final rules, including changes to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules mandated by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act and proposed in 2010; changes to the interim final breach notification rule; modifications to the interim final enforcement rule; and implementation of changes to the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA). The Omnibus Rule goes into effect on March 26, 2013, and compliance is required by September 23, 2013. As expected, the Omnibus Rule did not finalize the May 31, 2011 proposed regulation regarding accounting for disclosures.

Robert Chu - MasterClass Wing Chun Kuen - 3 DVD Set This three-DVD Wing Chun series by Master Robert Chu is packed with information you won't find anywhere else. Sifu Robert Chu is widely regarded as a repository of Wing Chun knowledge, gained from many years of research and training.  In this series he explains from basic to advanced the 'core' principles of the Wing Chun Kuen system. Concepts and techniques of controlling the centerline, entering, intercepting, body power and proper balance, amongst many others, are analyzed in minute detail.  This set is a superb technical reference for all Wing Chun Kung Fu practitioners and a post-graduate level course for those wishing to learn and understand the inner applications of the complete set of essential principles used in the system. These more advanced methods will help refine your movement and technique in the art, allowing you to develop a higher level of skill in Wing Chun Kuen more quickly.
