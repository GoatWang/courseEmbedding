About | DFJ Venture Capital




























FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS WE’VE CELEBRATED IDEA MAKERS WHO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF POSSIBILITY











Welcome to DFJ
At DFJ, we work with big thinkers to bring their bold ideas to life. We like to think you can experience the DFJ difference by just walking through our front door. No fancy art here – instead you'll find rockets, satellites, robots, and 3D printers – the fruits of great entrepreneurial achievement. We invest in technology companies serving the needs of consumers and enterprises, as well as companies creating disruptive technologies such as commercial space exploration, robotics, and sustainable transportation. Some of our investments include Baidu (Nasdaq: BIDU), Box (NYSE: BOX), Cylance, Nervana (Intel), Planet, Skype, SolarCity (Nasdaq: SCTY), SpaceX, Tesla Motors (Nasdaq: TSLA), Twilio (NYSE: TWLO), Twitter (NYSE: TWTR), Tumblr (Yahoo!), Unity, Yammer (Microsoft), and Zoox.
We back early stage and growth stage companies

DFJ began in 1985 with a focus on early-stage companies. A decade ago, we added our Growth team dedicated to late-stage investing. Today, we have two teams investing two funds. Our Venture team works with founders in the early phases of company building. Our Growth team partners with companies entering hyper-growth mode. DFJ has backed 24 companies that have each achieved more than $1 billion in realized value through an initial public offering or acquisition.
DFJ supports bold thinkers who 
build enduring companies – 
24 DFJ investments have exited 
at greater than $1 billion each.
We are committed to building successful businesses
Entrepreneurs with the most ambitious visions come to us to nurture and launch companies that change the world. We work with entrepreneurs like Aaron Levie, Robin Li, Elon Musk, and Lyndon Rive to answer the central question in any market disruption: How big would this opportunity be if we put the right team together with the right resources? Our team helps clear the path for great new businesses to thrive and we work side by side with the entrepreneur and his or her team to help with recruiting, business development, partnering – whatever it takes. We genuinely understand what it takes for a company to succeed.

Tim Draper and John Fisher are stepping back from the Menlo Park venture capital firm they founded three decades ago.
The partners are giving up investment duties on Draper Fisher Jurvetson's next fund but will still be part of the management team.

The firm issued a statement and Draper himself commented on Twitter on Tuesday, contradicting an earlier report by Fortune's Dan Primack that said Draper, Fisher and three other partners were leaving the firm.
Draper tweeted, "To be clear I have no intention of leaving DFJ ever. I plan to skip a fund to work on projects that could help DFJ like @Draper U."




Here is the statement from DFJ:
"Tim is actively building Draper University and continuing his angel investments through Draper Associates, and continues to be part of DFJ's management team to guide the firm's direction, manage his existing responsibilities, and work on new projects that could potentially help DFJ in the future. Tim expects to be one of our largest limited partners and has full confidence in the existing team.
"It is correct that Tim is not planning to be an investment partner in the next fund. Josh Stein and Andreas Stavropoulos are members of the management committee with Tim, John and Steve (Jurvetson). We are still actively investing from our current fund, DFJ Fund X, and have recently announced several new investments in that fund.




 


"To correct something that was misreported in a previous article: Tim Draper, John Fisher, Jennifer Fonstad, Don Wood and Hope Chen all remain DFJ Managing Directors of existing funds, and will continue to manage existing portfolio responsibilities. Tim Draper and John Fisher are also both members of the DFJ management committee, which is responsible for setting the governance and direction of the firm as a whole."
The firm earlier this year shook up its sprawling partner network that was started 23 years ago. Its 16 outside funds the DFJ name and a governing board has been established to oversee them.
The firm has reportedly decided to focus on early stage investments. The new fund that is expected to be raised next year will reportedly have about $300 million to invest.
