Learn more about this chart

Description of chart: This chart shows the historical performance by grade for all issued loans.
This chart includes all loans that were issued 18 months or more before the last day of the most recently completed quarter. The historical returns data in the chart is updated monthly.
Adjusted NAR models potential losses on a loan prior to that loan being charged off. Adjusted NAR is calculated using the formula described here. It is based on monthly borrower payments actually received net of service and collections fees, actual charge offs, recoveries, and estimated future losses. To estimate future losses, we apply a loss rate estimate to the outstanding principal of any loans that are past-due but not charged off. The loss rate estimate is based on historical charge off rates by loan grade and loan status over a 9-month period. Historical returns are not a promise of future results. Lending Club Notes are not insured or guaranteed and investors may have negative returns. Individual portfolio results may be impacted by, among other things, the diversity of the portfolio, exposure to any single borrower or group of borrowers, as well as macroeconomic conditions.






Lending Club assigns a grade (from A to G) to each loan based on borrower credit quality and risk attributes. Grade A has less risk and lower expected returns, whereas Grade G has more risk and higher expected returns.3

  Lending Club Notes are similar to traditional unsecured bonds in that investors receive regularly scheduled cash flows at predetermined dates. Lending Club Notes deliver payments monthly, while most bonds pay their coupon semi-annually (with the exception of bond funds, which can also pay monthly). Neither is secured by collateral and neither provides promise of payment; Lending Club does not guarantee payment of the Notes or the corresponding borrower loan, and our obligation to make payments is limited to an amount equal to the investor's pro rata share of amounts received with respect to the corresponding borrower loan for that Note, net of any fee charges. Lending Club Notes deliver exposure to a fraction of the underlying borrower loan obligation, while traditional bonds are bought in their entirety (with the exception of investments in bond funds). Each borrower loan underlying a Lending Club Note is given an internally assigned grade, while traditional bonds are rated by a ratings agency - but both are based on the amount of risk inherent to the instrument. Unlike traditional bonds, Lending Club Notes are fully amortizing and distribute the investor's pro rata share of principal and interest within each payment. Borrowers can also prepay the loans corresponding to Lending Club Notes. Traditional bonds are structured with bullet maturities and the entirety of the principal is promised to be delivered at maturity - not over time during the life of the bond. The loans that correspond to Lending Club Notes are debt obligations of individual consumers, while traditional bonds are debt obligations of corporations, governments, agencies, etc. in most cases. Unlike many bond instruments (e.g. high yield bonds), the terms of a borrower loan underlying a Lending Club Note do not limit the amount of debt that the borrower can incur (other than the impact that additional, future debt may have on the borrower's ability to repay the loan), while the terms of a high yield bond may, among other prohibitive covenants, limit the amount of additional debt that the underlying corporate borrower can incur. Tax treatment of Lending Club Notes may also differ from traditional bonds and bond funds.


  This information is not intended to be investment, tax or legal advice. Lending Club Notes are not guaranteed or insured, and investors may lose some or all of the principal invested. Individual portfolio results may be impacted by, among other things, the diversity of the portfolio, exposure to any single Note or group of Notes, as well as macroeconomic conditions. Notes are offered by prospectus filed with the SEC and you should review the risks and uncertainties described in the prospectus prior to investing. You should consult your financial, tax or legal advisor if you have any questions or need additional information. Actual results may vary.

  4.95% - 7.10% average historical returns for loan grades A through C as of March 31, 2017. To be included in the historical returns ("Historical Returns") calculation, a Note must have been originated prior to September 30, 2015.  Historical Returns are Lending Club's adjusted net annualized returns ("Adjusted NAR") for Notes with Grades A through C. Adjusted NAR is calculated using the formula described here. Historical returns are based on actual borrower payments received each month, net of fees, actual charge offs, recoveries, and estimated future losses. To estimate future losses, we apply a charge-off rate estimate to the outstanding principal of any loans that are past-due but not charged off. The charge-off rate estimate is based on historical charge-off rates by loan status over a 9-month period. Historical performance is not a guarantee of future results. Lending Club Notes are not insured or guaranteed and investors may have negative returns. Individual portfolio results may be impacted by, among other things, the size and diversity of the portfolio, the exposure to any single Note, borrower or group of Notes or borrowers, as well as macroeconomic conditions. Notes are offered by prospectus filed with the SEC and investors should review the risks and uncertainties described in the prospectus prior to investing in the Notes.

	Data as of March 31, 2017. Lending Club retail investors have historically received 2% &dash; 5% monthly cash flow. Retail investor accounts are defined as those accounts with at least $2,500 in outstanding principal balance in any given month. Monthly cash flow for any given account is calculated by dividing an account's proceeds for any given month (scheduled principal & interest and additional payments, reduced by any charged-off Notes and fees) by the outstanding principal amount in such month. The monthly cash flow values reported above are based on the 12-month trailing average of the 10th and 90th percentile monthly cash flow values for all retail investors in the 12-month period ending March 31, 2017. Individual results may vary based on grade and term composition of an investor's investment strategy. Historical performance is not a guarantee of future results.

Description of chart: This chart shows the historical performance by grade for all issued loans.
This chart includes all loans that were issued 18 months or more before the last day of the most recently completed quarter. The historical returns data in the chart is updated monthly.
Adjusted NAR models potential losses on a loan prior to that loan being charged off. Adjusted NAR is calculated using the formula described here. It is based on monthly borrower payments actually received net of service and collections fees, actual charge offs, recoveries, and estimated future losses. To estimate future losses, we apply a loss rate estimate to the outstanding principal of any loans that are past-due but not charged off. The loss rate estimate is based on historical charge off rates by loan grade and loan status over a 9-month period. Historical returns are not a promise of future results. Lending Club Notes are not insured or guaranteed and investors may have negative returns. Individual portfolio results may be impacted by, among other things, the diversity of the portfolio, exposure to any single borrower or group of borrowers, as well as macroeconomic conditions.






Lending Club assigns a grade (from A to G) to each loan based on borrower credit quality and risk attributes. Grade A has less risk and lower expected returns, whereas Grade G has more risk and higher expected returns.3

  Lending Club Notes are similar to traditional unsecured bonds in that investors receive regularly scheduled cash flows at predetermined dates. Lending Club Notes deliver payments monthly, while most bonds pay their coupon semi-annually (with the exception of bond funds, which can also pay monthly). Neither is secured by collateral and neither provides promise of payment; Lending Club does not guarantee payment of the Notes or the corresponding borrower loan, and our obligation to make payments is limited to an amount equal to the investor's pro rata share of amounts received with respect to the corresponding borrower loan for that Note, net of any fee charges. Lending Club Notes deliver exposure to a fraction of the underlying borrower loan obligation, while traditional bonds are bought in their entirety (with the exception of investments in bond funds). Each borrower loan underlying a Lending Club Note is given an internally assigned grade, while traditional bonds are rated by a ratings agency - but both are based on the amount of risk inherent to the instrument. Unlike traditional bonds, Lending Club Notes are fully amortizing and distribute the investor's pro rata share of principal and interest within each payment. Borrowers can also prepay the loans corresponding to Lending Club Notes. Traditional bonds are structured with bullet maturities and the entirety of the principal is promised to be delivered at maturity - not over time during the life of the bond. The loans that correspond to Lending Club Notes are debt obligations of individual consumers, while traditional bonds are debt obligations of corporations, governments, agencies, etc. in most cases. Unlike many bond instruments (e.g. high yield bonds), the terms of a borrower loan underlying a Lending Club Note do not limit the amount of debt that the borrower can incur (other than the impact that additional, future debt may have on the borrower's ability to repay the loan), while the terms of a high yield bond may, among other prohibitive covenants, limit the amount of additional debt that the underlying corporate borrower can incur. Tax treatment of Lending Club Notes may also differ from traditional bonds and bond funds.

  4.95% - 7.10% average historical returns for loan grades A through C as of March 31, 2017. To be included in the historical returns ("Historical Returns") calculation, a Note must have been originated prior to September 30, 2015.  Historical Returns are Lending Club's adjusted net annualized returns ("Adjusted NAR") for Notes with Grades A through C. Adjusted NAR is calculated using the formula described here. Historical returns are based on actual borrower payments received each month, net of fees, actual charge offs, recoveries, and estimated future losses. To estimate future losses, we apply a charge-off rate estimate to the outstanding principal of any loans that are past-due but not charged off.

              What we look for:
            

24 months in business
At least $75,000 in annual sales
No recent bankruptcies or tax liens
You own at least 20% of the business and have at least fair or better personal credit





              What we don't need:

A loan you can trust
Lending Club business vs. the competition

Repayment Term

                      1-5 years 
(means lower monthly payments)

Typically less than a year


Type of Rate

                      Fixed interest rate 
simple and transparent


                      Factor rate 
This is not an interest rate and can make expensive loans appear cheaper1



Origination Fee
0.99% - 6.99%
2.5%


Early Pay Off
$0. You can eliminate interest costs by paying off any time
You're charged interest for the entire loan - even if you pay off early2


Monthly payment per $10,000 borrowed3
$227 - $1,000
$509 - $3,900 (Daily payments required)


Total Annualized Rate4
7.77% - 35.11%
35% - 99%





1 Factor rate is the financing cost divided by the loan amount - but that’s not how traditional interest rates work.
                  For example, if you pay 30 cents for a one-year loan of one dollar, your factor rate is 30% but is equivalent to a 55% interest rate!
                  Factor rates can make short-term loans appear less expensive than a traditional interest rate would.
                

2 These loans require you to repay a fixed amount of interest, so paying off early won't save you any money.
                  In fact, it can increase your effective interest rate to 200% or more.
                

3 Payments calculated based on range of interest rates and repayment terms offered,
                  assuming a loan amount of $10,000.
                

4 Total Annualized Rate shows all costs for one year in a single equivalent interest rate
                  so that you can make apples-to-apples comparisons.
                






            Lending Club is America’s #1 credit marketplace, transforming banking to make it more efficient, transparent and consumer friendly.
            We operate fully online with no branch infrastructure and use technology to lower cost and deliver an amazing experience.

How can we help?
You have questions. We have answers.




How quickly can I get a loan?


              The entire process typically takes about 7 days. In some cases, it may take a little longer, depending on what we need from you. You can complete the entire process from the comfort of your home, or even on your phone!  You can keep things moving by checking your To-Do List to make sure we have all the information and documents we need.  Once your loan is approved and backed by investors, your money is automatically deposited directly into your bank account. Depending on your bank, this step can take a few more days.
            



Will checking my rate affect my credit score?


                No, checking your rate won't affect your credit score. Applying for a loan through LendingClub generates a soft credit inquiry, which we use to understand your creditworthiness. This is visible only to you, not to creditors or other users of your credit report. Visit Credit Score 101 to learn more about your credit score and protecting your credit health.




What happens after I check my rate?


                After you check your rate, here's what's next:  Choose your offer.  You'll receive multiple loan offers if you qualify. Each one shows the loan amount, interest rate, APR, monthly payment, and loan term (either 36 or 60 months).  Complete the application and verify your information.  We ask for your Social Security number, as well as information about your income and employment. If we need any additional documents, we'll let you know in your To-Do List. Then, hold tight while we review your application. Get your money.  Once your loan is approved and backed by investors, your money will be automatically deposited into your bank account.  The entire process typically takes about 7 days. In some cases, it may take a little longer, particularly if you need to send us additional information or documents.

A smarter way to invest and borrow.
























How does 
an online credit 
marketplace 
work?


Lending Club uses technology to operate a credit marketplace at a lower cost than traditional bank loan programs, passing the savings on to borrowers in the form of lower rates and to investors in the form of solid returns. Borrowers
                        who used a personal loan via Lending Club to consolidate debt or pay off high interest credit cards report in a survey that the interest rate on their loan was an average of 24% lower than they were paying on their outstanding
                        debt or credit cards.
                        1

By providing borrowers with better rates, and investors with attractive, risk-adjusted returns, Lending Club has earned among the highest satisfaction ratings
                         in the financial services industry.
                        2






Innovation transforms lending
Lending Club is America’s largest marketplace connecting borrowers and investors, where consumers and small business owners lower the cost of their credit and enjoy a better experience than traditional bank lending, and investors
                  earn attractive risk-adjusted returns.
                  4

Here's how it works: 

Customers interested in a loan complete a simple application at LendingClub.com
We leverage online data and technology to quickly assess risk, determine a credit rating and assign appropriate interest rates. Qualified applicants receive offers in just minutes and can evaluate loan options with no impact to their
                    credit score
Investors ranging from individuals to institutions select loans in which to invest and can earn monthly returns

The entire process is online, using technology to lower the cost of credit and pass the savings back in the form of lower rates for borrowers and solid returns for investors.

We cut the cost and complexities of traditional bank loans and pass the savings on to borrowers.

Common Questions

 What is Lending Club? 
 Can a person be both a borrower and an investor? 








1
                  Based on responses from 7,715 borrowers in a survey of 122,975 randomly selected borrowers conducted from 1/1/16 - 3/31/17. Borrowers who received a loan to consolidate existing debt or pay off their credit card balance reported that the interest rate
                  on outstanding debt or credit cards was 20% and average interest rate on loans via Lending Club is 15.2%. The origination fee ranges from 1% to 6% and the average origination fee is 5.49% as of Q1 2017. Best APR is available to borrowers
                  with excellent credit.
                

2 All loans made by WebBank, Member FDIC. Your actual rate depends upon credit score, loan amount, loan term, and credit usage & history. Source for savings % and satisfaction scores: Lending Club borrower surveys, 2013 –
                  2017.
                

3 This depiction is a summary of the processes for obtaining a loan or making an investment. All loans made by WebBank, Member FDIC, Equal Housing Lender. Investors do not invest directly in loans. Investors purchase Member Dependent
                  Notes from Lending Club. Individual borrowers must be a US citizen or permanent resident and at least 18 years old. Valid bank account and social security number/FEIN are required. All loans are subject to credit review and approval.
                  Your actual rate depends upon credit score, loan amount, loan term, credit usage and history. LendingClub notes are issued pursuant to a
                  Prospectus  on file with the SEC. You should review the risks and uncertainties described in the
                  Prospectus  related to your possible investment in the notes. Currently only residents of the following states may invest in Lending Club notes: AL, AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DC, DE, FL, GA, HI, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI,
                  MN, MO, MS, MT, ND, NE, NH, NJ, NV, NY, OK, OR, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, VT, WA, WI, WV, or WY. Our mailing address is: Lending Club, 71 Stevenson, Suite 300, San Francisco, CA 94105.

                  4.95% - 7.10% average historical returns for loan grades A through C as of March 31, 2017. To be included in the historical returns ("Historical Returns") calculation, a Note must have been originated prior to September 30, 2015. Historical
                  Returns are Lending Club's adjusted net annualized returns ("Adjusted NAR") for Notes with Grades A through C. Adjusted NAR is calculated using the formula described
                  here . Historical returns are based on actual borrower payments received each month, net of fees, actual charge offs, recoveries, and estimated future losses. To estimate future losses, we apply a charge-off rate estimate to the outstanding
                  principal of any loans that are past-due but not charged off. The charge-off rate estimate is based on historical charge-off rates by loan status over a 9-month period. Historical performance is not a guarantee of future results. Lending
                  Club Notes are not insured or guaranteed and investors may have negative returns. Individual portfolio results may be impacted by, among other things, the size and diversity of the portfolio, the exposure to any single Note, borrower
                  or group of Notes or borrowers, as well as macroeconomic conditions. Notes are offered by
                  prospectus  filed with the SEC and investors should review the risks and uncertainties described in the prospectus prior to investing in the Notes.

LendingClub brushes off unsolicited offer from IEG for stake
Online lender LendingClub Corp.  said Friday it received a letter last week from consumer-lending company IEG Holdings Corp.  stating IEG's intention to buy up to 9.99% of the LendingClub's shares on the basis of two shares of IEG stock for each share of LendingClub stock, a 38% discount to the current price of LendingClub's stock. There's no "rational economic basis" for LendingClub stockholders to accept the exchange offer, which "appears intended to mislead investors into mistakenly tendering into a deeply discounted offer," LendingClub said in a statement. The offer is "grossly inadequate," and LendingClub urged stockholders "not to be misled into tendering into the offer, if and when it is made," it said. Shares of LendingClub were recently down 0.6% after ending the regular session up 1.1%.

LendingClub brushes off unsolicited offer from IEG for stake
Online lender LendingClub Corp.  said Friday it received a letter last week from consumer-lending company IEG Holdings Corp.  stating IEG's intention to buy up to 9.99% of the LendingClub's shares on the basis of two shares of IEG stock for each share of LendingClub stock, a 38% discount to the current price of LendingClub's stock. There's no "rational economic basis" for LendingClub stockholders to accept the exchange offer, which "appears intended to mislead investors into mistakenly tendering into a deeply discounted offer," LendingClub said in a statement. The offer is "grossly inadequate," and LendingClub urged stockholders "not to be misled into tendering into the offer, if and when it is made," it said. Shares of LendingClub were recently down 0.6% after ending the regular session up 1.1%.

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[7] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. Lending Club operates an online lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to purchase notes backed by payments made on loans. Lending Club is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.[8] The company claims that $15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to 31 December 2015.[9]
Lending Club enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee.
Lending Club also makes traditional direct to consumer loans, including automobile refinance transactions, through WebBank, an FDIC-insured, state-chartered industrial bank that is heaquarted in Salt Lake City Utah. The loans are not funded by investors but are assigned to other financial institutions.
The company raised $1 billion in what became the largest technology IPO of 2014 in the United States. Though viewed as a pioneer in the fintech industry and one of the largest such firms, Lending Club experienced problems in early 2016, with difficulties in attracting investors, a scandal over some of the firm's loans and concerns by the board over CEO Renaud Laplanche's disclosures leading to a large drop in its share price and Laplanche's resignation.

History[edit]
Lending Club was initially launched on Facebook as one of Facebook's first applications.[10][11] After receiving $10.26 million in a Series A funding round in August 2007, from venture capital investors Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners, Lending Club was developed into a full-scale peer-to-peer lending company.[10][12]
On April 8, 2008, Lending Club temporarily suspended new lender registration, canceled its affiliate program and entered a "quiet period" while it awaited approval to issue promissory notes to lenders.[13] On June 20, 2008, Lending Club filed an S-1 statement[14] with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking the registration of $600 million in "Member Payment Dependent Notes" to be issued on its Web site.[15] On August 1, 2008, Lending Club filed an amendment to its Form S-1[16] outlining new interest rate formulas as well as more details on a "resale trading system".[17] On October 14, 2008, Lending Club announced its completion of the SEC registration process, posted the filed prospectus on its website, and resumed new lender registration. Notes issued on or after October 14, 2008 represent Lending Club securities rather than direct obligations of the ultimate borrower and are tradable (can be bought and sold) on the Foliofn trading platform.[18] In March 2009, Lending Club raised $12 million in a Series B funding round led by Morgenthaler Ventures.[19]
Pre-IPO growth[edit]
In April 2010, the company raised $24.5 million in a Series C funding led by Foundation Capital and joined by existing investors including Morgenthaler Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners.[20]
In August 2011, Lending Club raised an additional $25 million in venture capital from Union Square Ventures and Thomvest, owned by the Thomson family of Thomson-Reuters.[1][21] This led to Lending Club earning a $275 million post-money valuation and an increase of $80 million in valuation from the preceding year.[22] Thomson-Reuters founder Peter J. Thomson also invested an unspecified amount of his personal fortune into Lending Club.[23] In fall 2011, Lending Club's headquarters moved to downtown San Francisco; its earlier offices were located in Sunnyvale and Redwood City.[1] Co-founder Soul Htite moved to China to start Dianrong.com, a peer-to-peer lending company based in Shanghai.[24]
In 2012, the company employed about 80 people, with Renaud Laplanche continuing as the company CEO and chairman of the Board of Directors.[1][25][26] The company averaged about $1.5 million in loan originations daily, with a total of $600 million since its founding.[27] In April 2012, Lending Club's SEC registration from 2008 was renewed for $1 billion USD in Member Payment Dependent Notes and became effective on April 10, 2012.[28] In June 2012, the company received $15 million in new funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and $2.5 million of personal investments from John J. Mack. Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meeker joined Mack on Lending Club's board of directors.[3] This led to a $570 million valuation of the company.[29] In November 2012, Lending Club surpassed $1 billion in loans issued since inception and announced they were now cash flow positive.[30]
In May 2013, Google Capital purchased a stake in Lending Club.[29] Lending Club also began partnering with smaller banks in order to help streamline their small loans operations. In June 2013 the company partnered with Titan Bank in Texas and Congressional Bank in Maryland in order to help them facilitate loans that would have been otherwise unprofitable for them.[31][32]
Initial Public Offering (IPO)[edit]
In March 2014, Lending Club began providing loans to small businesses.[33] In April 2014 Lending Club acquired Springstone Financial.[34] In May 2014 Lending Club formed a partnership with Union Bank.[35] On August 27, 2014, Lending Club filed for an IPO with the SEC,[36] the offering taking place in December 2014.[37] On December 10, 2014, the company raised almost $900 million in the largest U.S. tech IPO of 2014. The stock ended the first trading day up 56%, valuing the company at $8.5bn.[38]




Stevenson Place, San Francisco, the location of Lending Club headquarters


Car loans and mortgages[edit]
Laplanche told Forbes in April 2015 that Lending Club would expand into car loans and mortgages.[39] Lending Club also announced a partnership with Google to extend credit to smaller companies that use Google's business services.[40] The company signed partnerships with Google, Alibaba.com, BancAlliance, and HomeAdvisor, including vetting community bank lenders for BancAlliance (a group of 200 banks), in order to send people on its platform to various community finance institutions.[41] That year Lending Club partnered with Opportunity Fund, announced by former President Bill Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative. The partnership intended to provide $10 million to small businesses in areas of California that are underserved by lenders.[42] Lending Club and other small business lenders partnered with Sam’s Club to deliver its “business lending center” product.[43] In August 2015 the company created Lending Club Open Integration (LCOI).[44] In October, the company launched a multi-draw line of credit product for small businesses.[45]
2016[edit]
Like other peer-to-peer lenders including Prosper, Sofi and Khutzpa.com, Lending Club experienced increasing difficulty attracting investors during early 2016. This led the firm to increase the interest rate it charges borrowers on three occasions during the first months of the year.[46] The increase in interest rates and concerns over the impact of the slowing United States economy caused a large drop in Lending Club's share price.[47]
In April 2016, a Lending Club employee reported to Laplanche that the dates on approximately $US 3 million in the firm's loans appeared to have been altered.[46] Lending Club's internal auditor engaged an outside firm to investigate the report.[48] This investigation found additional problems with loans, including that $US 22 million in loans which had been sold to the Jefferies investment bank did not in fact meet the bank's investment criteria. Lending Club bought these loans back from the bank and resold them.[46][49]
The New York Times reported that the investigation found that Laplanche had not disclosed to the board that he owned part of an investment fund which Lending Club was considering purchasing.[46] The Wall Street Journal also stated that Laplanche was found to have not fully disclosed what he knew about the problematic loans.[49]
On 6 May Lending Club's board made it clear to Laplanche that he no longer had their confidence, leading to his resignation on 9 May.[46] The Wall Street Journal reported that Laplanche had been fired by the board. Three of the firm's other managers had also been fired or had resigned by that time as a result of the problematic loans.[49] Lending Club's stock price fell by a further 34 percent after Laplanche's departure was announced.[46] This placed the stock price at 70 percent of the price at the time of the firm's initial public offering.[48] As a result of the incident, the Securities and Exchange Commission was reported to be investigating Lending Club's disclosures to investors.[49] From May 2015 until May 2016 the share price of Lending Club had decreased by over 60%. Since Laplanche's announced exit the share price cut in half again.[50]
Business model[edit]
Overview[edit]
Lending Club enables borrowers to create loan listings on its website by supplying details about themselves and the loans that they would like to request. All loans are unsecured personal loans and can be between $1,000 - $40,000. On the basis of the borrower’s credit score, credit history, desired loan amount and the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio, Lending Club determines whether the borrower is credit worthy and assigns to its approved loans a credit grade that determines payable interest rate and fees. The standard loan period is three years; a five-year period is available at a higher interest rate and additional fees. The loans can be repaid at any time without penalty.
Only investors in 39 US states are eligible to purchase notes on the Lending Club Platform.[51] However, eligibility differs when purchasing notes on the secondary market, FolioFN. Borrowers from all but 2 US states are eligible to apply for a loan.[51]
Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. The loans can only be chosen at the interest rates assigned by Lending Club but investors can decide how much to fund each borrower, with the minimum investment of $25 per note.[52]
Investors make money from interest. Rates vary from 6.03% to 26.06%, depending on the credit grade assigned to the loan.[53] Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee. The size of the origination fee depends on the credit grade and ranges to be 1.1%-5.0% of the loan amount. The size of the service fee is 1% on all amounts the borrower pays.[54] The company facilitates interest rates that are better for lenders and borrowers than they would receive from most banks. It has averaged between a six and nine percent return to investors between its founding and 2013.[55] However, because lenders are making personal loans to individuals on the site, their gains are taxable as personal income instead of investment income. Therefore, income from Lending Club loans may be taxed at a higher rate than investments that are taxed at the capital gains rate.
Loan ownership[edit]
After the notes are issued, Lending Club purchases the loans from the issuing bank and notes become the obligations of Lending Club, and not of the ultimate borrower: Lending Club promises to pay the noteholder monies it receives from the borrower less its service fees, while the holders of Lending Club notes have the status of unsecured creditors of Lending Club. This means that there is a risk that the investor may lose all or part of the investment if Lending Club becomes insolvent or declares bankruptcy, even if the ultimate borrower continues to pay.[26]
The investors have the ability to put notes up for sale before the notes have reached maturity. This service is offered in a partnership with FOLIOfn Investments which charges a 1% fee on note sales, making Lending Club the first peer-to-peer lending network to offer a secondary market for peer-to-peer loans. Other peer to peer lending networks such as Khutzpa.com have subsequently also partnered with FOLIOfn Investments to offer a secondary market.[56][57]
As of 2016, a high proportion of funds for Lending Club-facilitated loans came from hedge funds. During May of that year Lending Club was seeking to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loans as bonds as part of a strategy to overcome difficulties in accessing sufficient funding.[58]
Credit risk[edit]
When initially founded, Lending Club positioned itself as a social networking service and set up opportunities for members to identify group affinities, based on a theory that borrowers would be less likely to default to lenders with whom they had affinities and social relationships. It developed an algorithm called LendingMatch for identifying common relationship factors such as geographic location, educational and professional background, and connectedness within a given social network.[59][60][61]
After registering with the SEC, Lending Club stopped presenting itself as a social network and maintaining that social affinity will necessarily reduce the defaulting risk. It now presents the algorithm just as a search tool for investors to find Notes they would like to purchase, using borrower and loan attributes such as the length of a loan term, target weighted average interest rate, borrower credit score, employment tenure, home ownership status, and others.[62] To reduce default risk, Lending Club focuses on high-credit-worthy borrowers, declining approximately 90% of the loan applications it received as of 2012[63] and assigning higher interest rates to riskier borrowers within its credit criteria.[27] Only borrowers with FICO score of 660 or higher can be approved for loans.[53]
The statistics on Lending Club's website state that, as of 31 December 2016, 62.3 percent of borrowers report using their loans to refinance other loans or pay credit card debt.[64]
Loan performance statistics[edit]
As of June 30, 2015, the average Lending Club borrower has a FICO score of 699, 17.7% debt-to-income ratio (excluding mortgage), 16.2 years of credit history, $73,945 of personal income and takes out an average loan of $14,553 that s/he uses for debt consolidation or for paying off credit card debts. The investors had funded $11,217,348,156 in loans, with $1,911,759,192 coming from Q2 2015. The nominal average interest rate is 14.08%, default rate 3.39%, and an average net annualized return (net of defaults and service fees) of 8.93%.[27][65] The average returns of investment for Lending Club lenders are between 5.47% and 10.22%, with 23 straight quarters of positive returns as of the second quarter of 2013.[66]

Recognition[edit]
In 2011 and 2012 the company was named to as one of the AlwaysOn Global 250.[73][74] Lending Club is the winner of the World Economic Forum 2012 Technology Pioneer Award.[75] It has been recognized by Forbes as one of America’s 20 most promising companies in 2011[1] and 2012,[76] and by Fast Company as one of the ten most innovative financial companies in the world.[77] It was named one of the Disruptor 50 by CNBC in May 2013 and 2014, as a disruptive innovator in next generation financial services.[78][79] In 2014, Lending Club was recognized by Inc. as one of the 500 Fastest Growing Private Companies in America at #248.[80] Renaud Laplanche, the company’s founder and CEO, also received The Economist Innovation Award in 2014 for the consumer products category.[81]

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[7] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. Lending Club operates an online lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to purchase notes backed by payments made on loans. Lending Club is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.[8] The company claims that $15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to 31 December 2015.[9]
Lending Club enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee.
Lending Club also makes traditional direct to consumer loans, including automobile refinance transactions, through WebBank, an FDIC-insured, state-chartered industrial bank that is heaquarted in Salt Lake City Utah. The loans are not funded by investors but are assigned to other financial institutions.
The company raised $1 billion in what became the largest technology IPO of 2014 in the United States. Though viewed as a pioneer in the fintech industry and one of the largest such firms, Lending Club experienced problems in early 2016, with difficulties in attracting investors, a scandal over some of the firm's loans and concerns by the board over CEO Renaud Laplanche's disclosures leading to a large drop in its share price and Laplanche's resignation.

History[edit]
Lending Club was initially launched on Facebook as one of Facebook's first applications.[10][11] After receiving $10.26 million in a Series A funding round in August 2007, from venture capital investors Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners, Lending Club was developed into a full-scale peer-to-peer lending company.[10][12]
On April 8, 2008, Lending Club temporarily suspended new lender registration, canceled its affiliate program and entered a "quiet period" while it awaited approval to issue promissory notes to lenders.[13] On June 20, 2008, Lending Club filed an S-1 statement[14] with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking the registration of $600 million in "Member Payment Dependent Notes" to be issued on its Web site.[15] On August 1, 2008, Lending Club filed an amendment to its Form S-1[16] outlining new interest rate formulas as well as more details on a "resale trading system".[17] On October 14, 2008, Lending Club announced its completion of the SEC registration process, posted the filed prospectus on its website, and resumed new lender registration. Notes issued on or after October 14, 2008 represent Lending Club securities rather than direct obligations of the ultimate borrower and are tradable (can be bought and sold) on the Foliofn trading platform.[18] In March 2009, Lending Club raised $12 million in a Series B funding round led by Morgenthaler Ventures.[19]
Pre-IPO growth[edit]
In April 2010, the company raised $24.5 million in a Series C funding led by Foundation Capital and joined by existing investors including Morgenthaler Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners.[20]
In August 2011, Lending Club raised an additional $25 million in venture capital from Union Square Ventures and Thomvest, owned by the Thomson family of Thomson-Reuters.[1][21] This led to Lending Club earning a $275 million post-money valuation and an increase of $80 million in valuation from the preceding year.[22] Thomson-Reuters founder Peter J. Thomson also invested an unspecified amount of his personal fortune into Lending Club.[23] In fall 2011, Lending Club's headquarters moved to downtown San Francisco; its earlier offices were located in Sunnyvale and Redwood City.[1] Co-founder Soul Htite moved to China to start Dianrong.com, a peer-to-peer lending company based in Shanghai.[24]
In 2012, the company employed about 80 people, with Renaud Laplanche continuing as the company CEO and chairman of the Board of Directors.[1][25][26] The company averaged about $1.5 million in loan originations daily, with a total of $600 million since its founding.[27] In April 2012, Lending Club's SEC registration from 2008 was renewed for $1 billion USD in Member Payment Dependent Notes and became effective on April 10, 2012.[28] In June 2012, the company received $15 million in new funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and $2.5 million of personal investments from John J. Mack. Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meeker joined Mack on Lending Club's board of directors.[3] This led to a $570 million valuation of the company.[29] In November 2012, Lending Club surpassed $1 billion in loans issued since inception and announced they were now cash flow positive.[30]
In May 2013, Google Capital purchased a stake in Lending Club.[29] Lending Club also began partnering with smaller banks in order to help streamline their small loans operations. In June 2013 the company partnered with Titan Bank in Texas and Congressional Bank in Maryland in order to help them facilitate loans that would have been otherwise unprofitable for them.[31][32]
Initial Public Offering (IPO)[edit]
In March 2014, Lending Club began providing loans to small businesses.[33] In April 2014 Lending Club acquired Springstone Financial.[34] In May 2014 Lending Club formed a partnership with Union Bank.[35] On August 27, 2014, Lending Club filed for an IPO with the SEC,[36] the offering taking place in December 2014.[37] On December 10, 2014, the company raised almost $900 million in the largest U.S. tech IPO of 2014. The stock ended the first trading day up 56%, valuing the company at $8.5bn.[38]




Stevenson Place, San Francisco, the location of Lending Club headquarters


Car loans and mortgages[edit]
Laplanche told Forbes in April 2015 that Lending Club would expand into car loans and mortgages.[39] Lending Club also announced a partnership with Google to extend credit to smaller companies that use Google's business services.[40] The company signed partnerships with Google, Alibaba.com, BancAlliance, and HomeAdvisor, including vetting community bank lenders for BancAlliance (a group of 200 banks), in order to send people on its platform to various community finance institutions.[41] That year Lending Club partnered with Opportunity Fund, announced by former President Bill Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative. The partnership intended to provide $10 million to small businesses in areas of California that are underserved by lenders.[42] Lending Club and other small business lenders partnered with Sam’s Club to deliver its “business lending center” product.[43] In August 2015 the company created Lending Club Open Integration (LCOI).[44] In October, the company launched a multi-draw line of credit product for small businesses.[45]
2016[edit]
Like other peer-to-peer lenders including Prosper, Sofi and Khutzpa.com, Lending Club experienced increasing difficulty attracting investors during early 2016. This led the firm to increase the interest rate it charges borrowers on three occasions during the first months of the year.[46] The increase in interest rates and concerns over the impact of the slowing United States economy caused a large drop in Lending Club's share price.[47]
In April 2016, a Lending Club employee reported to Laplanche that the dates on approximately $US 3 million in the firm's loans appeared to have been altered.[46] Lending Club's internal auditor engaged an outside firm to investigate the report.[48] This investigation found additional problems with loans, including that $US 22 million in loans which had been sold to the Jefferies investment bank did not in fact meet the bank's investment criteria. Lending Club bought these loans back from the bank and resold them.[46][49]
The New York Times reported that the investigation found that Laplanche had not disclosed to the board that he owned part of an investment fund which Lending Club was considering purchasing.[46] The Wall Street Journal also stated that Laplanche was found to have not fully disclosed what he knew about the problematic loans.[49]
On 6 May Lending Club's board made it clear to Laplanche that he no longer had their confidence, leading to his resignation on 9 May.[46] The Wall Street Journal reported that Laplanche had been fired by the board. Three of the firm's other managers had also been fired or had resigned by that time as a result of the problematic loans.[49] Lending Club's stock price fell by a further 34 percent after Laplanche's departure was announced.[46] This placed the stock price at 70 percent of the price at the time of the firm's initial public offering.[48] As a result of the incident, the Securities and Exchange Commission was reported to be investigating Lending Club's disclosures to investors.[49] From May 2015 until May 2016 the share price of Lending Club had decreased by over 60%. Since Laplanche's announced exit the share price cut in half again.[50]
Business model[edit]
Overview[edit]
Lending Club enables borrowers to create loan listings on its website by supplying details about themselves and the loans that they would like to request. All loans are unsecured personal loans and can be between $1,000 - $40,000. On the basis of the borrower’s credit score, credit history, desired loan amount and the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio, Lending Club determines whether the borrower is credit worthy and assigns to its approved loans a credit grade that determines payable interest rate and fees. The standard loan period is three years; a five-year period is available at a higher interest rate and additional fees. The loans can be repaid at any time without penalty.
Only investors in 39 US states are eligible to purchase notes on the Lending Club Platform.[51] However, eligibility differs when purchasing notes on the secondary market, FolioFN. Borrowers from all but 2 US states are eligible to apply for a loan.[51]
Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. The loans can only be chosen at the interest rates assigned by Lending Club but investors can decide how much to fund each borrower, with the minimum investment of $25 per note.[52]
Investors make money from interest. Rates vary from 6.03% to 26.06%, depending on the credit grade assigned to the loan.[53] Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee. The size of the origination fee depends on the credit grade and ranges to be 1.1%-5.0% of the loan amount. The size of the service fee is 1% on all amounts the borrower pays.[54] The company facilitates interest rates that are better for lenders and borrowers than they would receive from most banks. It has averaged between a six and nine percent return to investors between its founding and 2013.[55] However, because lenders are making personal loans to individuals on the site, their gains are taxable as personal income instead of investment income. Therefore, income from Lending Club loans may be taxed at a higher rate than investments that are taxed at the capital gains rate.
Loan ownership[edit]
After the notes are issued, Lending Club purchases the loans from the issuing bank and notes become the obligations of Lending Club, and not of the ultimate borrower: Lending Club promises to pay the noteholder monies it receives from the borrower less its service fees, while the holders of Lending Club notes have the status of unsecured creditors of Lending Club. This means that there is a risk that the investor may lose all or part of the investment if Lending Club becomes insolvent or declares bankruptcy, even if the ultimate borrower continues to pay.[26]
The investors have the ability to put notes up for sale before the notes have reached maturity. This service is offered in a partnership with FOLIOfn Investments which charges a 1% fee on note sales, making Lending Club the first peer-to-peer lending network to offer a secondary market for peer-to-peer loans. Other peer to peer lending networks such as Khutzpa.com have subsequently also partnered with FOLIOfn Investments to offer a secondary market.[56][57]
As of 2016, a high proportion of funds for Lending Club-facilitated loans came from hedge funds. During May of that year Lending Club was seeking to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loans as bonds as part of a strategy to overcome difficulties in accessing sufficient funding.[58]
Credit risk[edit]
When initially founded, Lending Club positioned itself as a social networking service and set up opportunities for members to identify group affinities, based on a theory that borrowers would be less likely to default to lenders with whom they had affinities and social relationships. It developed an algorithm called LendingMatch for identifying common relationship factors such as geographic location, educational and professional background, and connectedness within a given social network.[59][60][61]
After registering with the SEC, Lending Club stopped presenting itself as a social network and maintaining that social affinity will necessarily reduce the defaulting risk. It now presents the algorithm just as a search tool for investors to find Notes they would like to purchase, using borrower and loan attributes such as the length of a loan term, target weighted average interest rate, borrower credit score, employment tenure, home ownership status, and others.[62] To reduce default risk, Lending Club focuses on high-credit-worthy borrowers, declining approximately 90% of the loan applications it received as of 2012[63] and assigning higher interest rates to riskier borrowers within its credit criteria.[27] Only borrowers with FICO score of 660 or higher can be approved for loans.[53]
The statistics on Lending Club's website state that, as of 31 December 2016, 62.3 percent of borrowers report using their loans to refinance other loans or pay credit card debt.[64]
Loan performance statistics[edit]
As of June 30, 2015, the average Lending Club borrower has a FICO score of 699, 17.7% debt-to-income ratio (excluding mortgage), 16.2 years of credit history, $73,945 of personal income and takes out an average loan of $14,553 that s/he uses for debt consolidation or for paying off credit card debts. The investors had funded $11,217,348,156 in loans, with $1,911,759,192 coming from Q2 2015. The nominal average interest rate is 14.08%, default rate 3.39%, and an average net annualized return (net of defaults and service fees) of 8.93%.[27][65] The average returns of investment for Lending Club lenders are between 5.47% and 10.22%, with 23 straight quarters of positive returns as of the second quarter of 2013.[66]

Recognition[edit]
In 2011 and 2012 the company was named to as one of the AlwaysOn Global 250.[73][74] Lending Club is the winner of the World Economic Forum 2012 Technology Pioneer Award.[75] It has been recognized by Forbes as one of America’s 20 most promising companies in 2011[1] and 2012,[76] and by Fast Company as one of the ten most innovative financial companies in the world.[77] It was named one of the Disruptor 50 by CNBC in May 2013 and 2014, as a disruptive innovator in next generation financial services.[78][79] In 2014, Lending Club was recognized by Inc. as one of the 500 Fastest Growing Private Companies in America at #248.[80] Renaud Laplanche, the company’s founder and CEO, also received The Economist Innovation Award in 2014 for the consumer products category.[81]

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[7] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. Lending Club operates an online lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to purchase notes backed by payments made on loans. Lending Club is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.[8] The company claims that $15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to 31 December 2015.[9]
Lending Club enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee.
Lending Club also makes traditional direct to consumer loans, including automobile refinance transactions, through WebBank, an FDIC-insured, state-chartered industrial bank that is heaquarted in Salt Lake City Utah. The loans are not funded by investors but are assigned to other financial institutions.
The company raised $1 billion in what became the largest technology IPO of 2014 in the United States. Though viewed as a pioneer in the fintech industry and one of the largest such firms, Lending Club experienced problems in early 2016, with difficulties in attracting investors, a scandal over some of the firm's loans and concerns by the board over CEO Renaud Laplanche's disclosures leading to a large drop in its share price and Laplanche's resignation.

History[edit]
Lending Club was initially launched on Facebook as one of Facebook's first applications.[10][11] After receiving $10.26 million in a Series A funding round in August 2007, from venture capital investors Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners, Lending Club was developed into a full-scale peer-to-peer lending company.[10][12]
On April 8, 2008, Lending Club temporarily suspended new lender registration, canceled its affiliate program and entered a "quiet period" while it awaited approval to issue promissory notes to lenders.[13] On June 20, 2008, Lending Club filed an S-1 statement[14] with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking the registration of $600 million in "Member Payment Dependent Notes" to be issued on its Web site.[15] On August 1, 2008, Lending Club filed an amendment to its Form S-1[16] outlining new interest rate formulas as well as more details on a "resale trading system".[17] On October 14, 2008, Lending Club announced its completion of the SEC registration process, posted the filed prospectus on its website, and resumed new lender registration. Notes issued on or after October 14, 2008 represent Lending Club securities rather than direct obligations of the ultimate borrower and are tradable (can be bought and sold) on the Foliofn trading platform.[18] In March 2009, Lending Club raised $12 million in a Series B funding round led by Morgenthaler Ventures.[19]
Pre-IPO growth[edit]
In April 2010, the company raised $24.5 million in a Series C funding led by Foundation Capital and joined by existing investors including Morgenthaler Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners.[20]
In August 2011, Lending Club raised an additional $25 million in venture capital from Union Square Ventures and Thomvest, owned by the Thomson family of Thomson-Reuters.[1][21] This led to Lending Club earning a $275 million post-money valuation and an increase of $80 million in valuation from the preceding year.[22] Thomson-Reuters founder Peter J. Thomson also invested an unspecified amount of his personal fortune into Lending Club.[23] In fall 2011, Lending Club's headquarters moved to downtown San Francisco; its earlier offices were located in Sunnyvale and Redwood City.[1] Co-founder Soul Htite moved to China to start Dianrong.com, a peer-to-peer lending company based in Shanghai.[24]
In 2012, the company employed about 80 people, with Renaud Laplanche continuing as the company CEO and chairman of the Board of Directors.[1][25][26] The company averaged about $1.5 million in loan originations daily, with a total of $600 million since its founding.[27] In April 2012, Lending Club's SEC registration from 2008 was renewed for $1 billion USD in Member Payment Dependent Notes and became effective on April 10, 2012.[28] In June 2012, the company received $15 million in new funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and $2.5 million of personal investments from John J. Mack. Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meeker joined Mack on Lending Club's board of directors.[3] This led to a $570 million valuation of the company.[29] In November 2012, Lending Club surpassed $1 billion in loans issued since inception and announced they were now cash flow positive.[30]
In May 2013, Google Capital purchased a stake in Lending Club.[29] Lending Club also began partnering with smaller banks in order to help streamline their small loans operations. In June 2013 the company partnered with Titan Bank in Texas and Congressional Bank in Maryland in order to help them facilitate loans that would have been otherwise unprofitable for them.[31][32]
Initial Public Offering (IPO)[edit]
In March 2014, Lending Club began providing loans to small businesses.[33] In April 2014 Lending Club acquired Springstone Financial.[34] In May 2014 Lending Club formed a partnership with Union Bank.[35] On August 27, 2014, Lending Club filed for an IPO with the SEC,[36] the offering taking place in December 2014.[37] On December 10, 2014, the company raised almost $900 million in the largest U.S. tech IPO of 2014. The stock ended the first trading day up 56%, valuing the company at $8.5bn.[38]




Stevenson Place, San Francisco, the location of Lending Club headquarters


Car loans and mortgages[edit]
Laplanche told Forbes in April 2015 that Lending Club would expand into car loans and mortgages.[39] Lending Club also announced a partnership with Google to extend credit to smaller companies that use Google's business services.[40] The company signed partnerships with Google, Alibaba.com, BancAlliance, and HomeAdvisor, including vetting community bank lenders for BancAlliance (a group of 200 banks), in order to send people on its platform to various community finance institutions.[41] That year Lending Club partnered with Opportunity Fund, announced by former President Bill Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative. The partnership intended to provide $10 million to small businesses in areas of California that are underserved by lenders.[42] Lending Club and other small business lenders partnered with Sam’s Club to deliver its “business lending center” product.[43] In August 2015 the company created Lending Club Open Integration (LCOI).[44] In October, the company launched a multi-draw line of credit product for small businesses.[45]
2016[edit]
Like other peer-to-peer lenders including Prosper, Sofi and Khutzpa.com, Lending Club experienced increasing difficulty attracting investors during early 2016. This led the firm to increase the interest rate it charges borrowers on three occasions during the first months of the year.[46] The increase in interest rates and concerns over the impact of the slowing United States economy caused a large drop in Lending Club's share price.[47]
In April 2016, a Lending Club employee reported to Laplanche that the dates on approximately $US 3 million in the firm's loans appeared to have been altered.[46] Lending Club's internal auditor engaged an outside firm to investigate the report.[48] This investigation found additional problems with loans, including that $US 22 million in loans which had been sold to the Jefferies investment bank did not in fact meet the bank's investment criteria. Lending Club bought these loans back from the bank and resold them.[46][49]
The New York Times reported that the investigation found that Laplanche had not disclosed to the board that he owned part of an investment fund which Lending Club was considering purchasing.[46] The Wall Street Journal also stated that Laplanche was found to have not fully disclosed what he knew about the problematic loans.[49]
On 6 May Lending Club's board made it clear to Laplanche that he no longer had their confidence, leading to his resignation on 9 May.[46] The Wall Street Journal reported that Laplanche had been fired by the board. Three of the firm's other managers had also been fired or had resigned by that time as a result of the problematic loans.[49] Lending Club's stock price fell by a further 34 percent after Laplanche's departure was announced.[46] This placed the stock price at 70 percent of the price at the time of the firm's initial public offering.[48] As a result of the incident, the Securities and Exchange Commission was reported to be investigating Lending Club's disclosures to investors.[49] From May 2015 until May 2016 the share price of Lending Club had decreased by over 60%. Since Laplanche's announced exit the share price cut in half again.[50]
Business model[edit]
Overview[edit]
Lending Club enables borrowers to create loan listings on its website by supplying details about themselves and the loans that they would like to request. All loans are unsecured personal loans and can be between $1,000 - $40,000. On the basis of the borrower’s credit score, credit history, desired loan amount and the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio, Lending Club determines whether the borrower is credit worthy and assigns to its approved loans a credit grade that determines payable interest rate and fees. The standard loan period is three years; a five-year period is available at a higher interest rate and additional fees. The loans can be repaid at any time without penalty.
Only investors in 39 US states are eligible to purchase notes on the Lending Club Platform.[51] However, eligibility differs when purchasing notes on the secondary market, FolioFN. Borrowers from all but 2 US states are eligible to apply for a loan.[51]
Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. The loans can only be chosen at the interest rates assigned by Lending Club but investors can decide how much to fund each borrower, with the minimum investment of $25 per note.[52]
Investors make money from interest. Rates vary from 6.03% to 26.06%, depending on the credit grade assigned to the loan.[53] Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee. The size of the origination fee depends on the credit grade and ranges to be 1.1%-5.0% of the loan amount. The size of the service fee is 1% on all amounts the borrower pays.[54] The company facilitates interest rates that are better for lenders and borrowers than they would receive from most banks. It has averaged between a six and nine percent return to investors between its founding and 2013.[55] However, because lenders are making personal loans to individuals on the site, their gains are taxable as personal income instead of investment income. Therefore, income from Lending Club loans may be taxed at a higher rate than investments that are taxed at the capital gains rate.
Loan ownership[edit]
After the notes are issued, Lending Club purchases the loans from the issuing bank and notes become the obligations of Lending Club, and not of the ultimate borrower: Lending Club promises to pay the noteholder monies it receives from the borrower less its service fees, while the holders of Lending Club notes have the status of unsecured creditors of Lending Club. This means that there is a risk that the investor may lose all or part of the investment if Lending Club becomes insolvent or declares bankruptcy, even if the ultimate borrower continues to pay.[26]
The investors have the ability to put notes up for sale before the notes have reached maturity. This service is offered in a partnership with FOLIOfn Investments which charges a 1% fee on note sales, making Lending Club the first peer-to-peer lending network to offer a secondary market for peer-to-peer loans. Other peer to peer lending networks such as Khutzpa.com have subsequently also partnered with FOLIOfn Investments to offer a secondary market.[56][57]
As of 2016, a high proportion of funds for Lending Club-facilitated loans came from hedge funds. During May of that year Lending Club was seeking to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loans as bonds as part of a strategy to overcome difficulties in accessing sufficient funding.[58]
Credit risk[edit]
When initially founded, Lending Club positioned itself as a social networking service and set up opportunities for members to identify group affinities, based on a theory that borrowers would be less likely to default to lenders with whom they had affinities and social relationships. It developed an algorithm called LendingMatch for identifying common relationship factors such as geographic location, educational and professional background, and connectedness within a given social network.[59][60][61]
After registering with the SEC, Lending Club stopped presenting itself as a social network and maintaining that social affinity will necessarily reduce the defaulting risk. It now presents the algorithm just as a search tool for investors to find Notes they would like to purchase, using borrower and loan attributes such as the length of a loan term, target weighted average interest rate, borrower credit score, employment tenure, home ownership status, and others.[62] To reduce default risk, Lending Club focuses on high-credit-worthy borrowers, declining approximately 90% of the loan applications it received as of 2012[63] and assigning higher interest rates to riskier borrowers within its credit criteria.[27] Only borrowers with FICO score of 660 or higher can be approved for loans.[53]
The statistics on Lending Club's website state that, as of 31 December 2016, 62.3 percent of borrowers report using their loans to refinance other loans or pay credit card debt.[64]
Loan performance statistics[edit]
As of June 30, 2015, the average Lending Club borrower has a FICO score of 699, 17.7% debt-to-income ratio (excluding mortgage), 16.2 years of credit history, $73,945 of personal income and takes out an average loan of $14,553 that s/he uses for debt consolidation or for paying off credit card debts. The investors had funded $11,217,348,156 in loans, with $1,911,759,192 coming from Q2 2015. The nominal average interest rate is 14.08%, default rate 3.39%, and an average net annualized return (net of defaults and service fees) of 8.93%.[27][65] The average returns of investment for Lending Club lenders are between 5.47% and 10.22%, with 23 straight quarters of positive returns as of the second quarter of 2013.[66]

Recognition[edit]
In 2011 and 2012 the company was named to as one of the AlwaysOn Global 250.[73][74] Lending Club is the winner of the World Economic Forum 2012 Technology Pioneer Award.[75] It has been recognized by Forbes as one of America’s 20 most promising companies in 2011[1] and 2012,[76] and by Fast Company as one of the ten most innovative financial companies in the world.[77] It was named one of the Disruptor 50 by CNBC in May 2013 and 2014, as a disruptive innovator in next generation financial services.[78][79] In 2014, Lending Club was recognized by Inc. as one of the 500 Fastest Growing Private Companies in America at #248.[80] Renaud Laplanche, the company’s founder and CEO, also received The Economist Innovation Award in 2014 for the consumer products category.[81]

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[7] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. Lending Club operates an online lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to purchase notes backed by payments made on loans. Lending Club is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.[8] The company claims that $15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to 31 December 2015.[9]
Lending Club enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee.
Lending Club also makes traditional direct to consumer loans, including automobile refinance transactions, through WebBank, an FDIC-insured, state-chartered industrial bank that is heaquarted in Salt Lake City Utah. The loans are not funded by investors but are assigned to other financial institutions.
The company raised $1 billion in what became the largest technology IPO of 2014 in the United States. Though viewed as a pioneer in the fintech industry and one of the largest such firms, Lending Club experienced problems in early 2016, with difficulties in attracting investors, a scandal over some of the firm's loans and concerns by the board over CEO Renaud Laplanche's disclosures leading to a large drop in its share price and Laplanche's resignation.

History[edit]
Lending Club was initially launched on Facebook as one of Facebook's first applications.[10][11] After receiving $10.26 million in a Series A funding round in August 2007, from venture capital investors Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners, Lending Club was developed into a full-scale peer-to-peer lending company.[10][12]
On April 8, 2008, Lending Club temporarily suspended new lender registration, canceled its affiliate program and entered a "quiet period" while it awaited approval to issue promissory notes to lenders.[13] On June 20, 2008, Lending Club filed an S-1 statement[14] with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking the registration of $600 million in "Member Payment Dependent Notes" to be issued on its Web site.[15] On August 1, 2008, Lending Club filed an amendment to its Form S-1[16] outlining new interest rate formulas as well as more details on a "resale trading system".[17] On October 14, 2008, Lending Club announced its completion of the SEC registration process, posted the filed prospectus on its website, and resumed new lender registration. Notes issued on or after October 14, 2008 represent Lending Club securities rather than direct obligations of the ultimate borrower and are tradable (can be bought and sold) on the Foliofn trading platform.[18] In March 2009, Lending Club raised $12 million in a Series B funding round led by Morgenthaler Ventures.[19]
Pre-IPO growth[edit]
In April 2010, the company raised $24.5 million in a Series C funding led by Foundation Capital and joined by existing investors including Morgenthaler Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners.[20]
In August 2011, Lending Club raised an additional $25 million in venture capital from Union Square Ventures and Thomvest, owned by the Thomson family of Thomson-Reuters.[1][21] This led to Lending Club earning a $275 million post-money valuation and an increase of $80 million in valuation from the preceding year.[22] Thomson-Reuters founder Peter J. Thomson also invested an unspecified amount of his personal fortune into Lending Club.[23] In fall 2011, Lending Club's headquarters moved to downtown San Francisco; its earlier offices were located in Sunnyvale and Redwood City.[1] Co-founder Soul Htite moved to China to start Dianrong.com, a peer-to-peer lending company based in Shanghai.[24]
In 2012, the company employed about 80 people, with Renaud Laplanche continuing as the company CEO and chairman of the Board of Directors.[1][25][26] The company averaged about $1.5 million in loan originations daily, with a total of $600 million since its founding.[27] In April 2012, Lending Club's SEC registration from 2008 was renewed for $1 billion USD in Member Payment Dependent Notes and became effective on April 10, 2012.[28] In June 2012, the company received $15 million in new funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and $2.5 million of personal investments from John J. Mack. Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meeker joined Mack on Lending Club's board of directors.[3] This led to a $570 million valuation of the company.[29] In November 2012, Lending Club surpassed $1 billion in loans issued since inception and announced they were now cash flow positive.[30]
In May 2013, Google Capital purchased a stake in Lending Club.[29] Lending Club also began partnering with smaller banks in order to help streamline their small loans operations. In June 2013 the company partnered with Titan Bank in Texas and Congressional Bank in Maryland in order to help them facilitate loans that would have been otherwise unprofitable for them.[31][32]
Initial Public Offering (IPO)[edit]
In March 2014, Lending Club began providing loans to small businesses.[33] In April 2014 Lending Club acquired Springstone Financial.[34] In May 2014 Lending Club formed a partnership with Union Bank.[35] On August 27, 2014, Lending Club filed for an IPO with the SEC,[36] the offering taking place in December 2014.[37] On December 10, 2014, the company raised almost $900 million in the largest U.S. tech IPO of 2014. The stock ended the first trading day up 56%, valuing the company at $8.5bn.[38]




Stevenson Place, San Francisco, the location of Lending Club headquarters


Car loans and mortgages[edit]
Laplanche told Forbes in April 2015 that Lending Club would expand into car loans and mortgages.[39] Lending Club also announced a partnership with Google to extend credit to smaller companies that use Google's business services.[40] The company signed partnerships with Google, Alibaba.com, BancAlliance, and HomeAdvisor, including vetting community bank lenders for BancAlliance (a group of 200 banks), in order to send people on its platform to various community finance institutions.[41] That year Lending Club partnered with Opportunity Fund, announced by former President Bill Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative. The partnership intended to provide $10 million to small businesses in areas of California that are underserved by lenders.[42] Lending Club and other small business lenders partnered with Sam’s Club to deliver its “business lending center” product.[43] In August 2015 the company created Lending Club Open Integration (LCOI).[44] In October, the company launched a multi-draw line of credit product for small businesses.[45]
2016[edit]
Like other peer-to-peer lenders including Prosper, Sofi and Khutzpa.com, Lending Club experienced increasing difficulty attracting investors during early 2016. This led the firm to increase the interest rate it charges borrowers on three occasions during the first months of the year.[46] The increase in interest rates and concerns over the impact of the slowing United States economy caused a large drop in Lending Club's share price.[47]
In April 2016, a Lending Club employee reported to Laplanche that the dates on approximately $US 3 million in the firm's loans appeared to have been altered.[46] Lending Club's internal auditor engaged an outside firm to investigate the report.[48] This investigation found additional problems with loans, including that $US 22 million in loans which had been sold to the Jefferies investment bank did not in fact meet the bank's investment criteria. Lending Club bought these loans back from the bank and resold them.[46][49]
The New York Times reported that the investigation found that Laplanche had not disclosed to the board that he owned part of an investment fund which Lending Club was considering purchasing.[46] The Wall Street Journal also stated that Laplanche was found to have not fully disclosed what he knew about the problematic loans.[49]
On 6 May Lending Club's board made it clear to Laplanche that he no longer had their confidence, leading to his resignation on 9 May.[46] The Wall Street Journal reported that Laplanche had been fired by the board. Three of the firm's other managers had also been fired or had resigned by that time as a result of the problematic loans.[49] Lending Club's stock price fell by a further 34 percent after Laplanche's departure was announced.[46] This placed the stock price at 70 percent of the price at the time of the firm's initial public offering.[48] As a result of the incident, the Securities and Exchange Commission was reported to be investigating Lending Club's disclosures to investors.[49] From May 2015 until May 2016 the share price of Lending Club had decreased by over 60%. Since Laplanche's announced exit the share price cut in half again.[50]
Business model[edit]
Overview[edit]
Lending Club enables borrowers to create loan listings on its website by supplying details about themselves and the loans that they would like to request. All loans are unsecured personal loans and can be between $1,000 - $40,000. On the basis of the borrower’s credit score, credit history, desired loan amount and the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio, Lending Club determines whether the borrower is credit worthy and assigns to its approved loans a credit grade that determines payable interest rate and fees. The standard loan period is three years; a five-year period is available at a higher interest rate and additional fees. The loans can be repaid at any time without penalty.
Only investors in 39 US states are eligible to purchase notes on the Lending Club Platform.[51] However, eligibility differs when purchasing notes on the secondary market, FolioFN. Borrowers from all but 2 US states are eligible to apply for a loan.[51]
Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. The loans can only be chosen at the interest rates assigned by Lending Club but investors can decide how much to fund each borrower, with the minimum investment of $25 per note.[52]
Investors make money from interest. Rates vary from 6.03% to 26.06%, depending on the credit grade assigned to the loan.[53] Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee. The size of the origination fee depends on the credit grade and ranges to be 1.1%-5.0% of the loan amount. The size of the service fee is 1% on all amounts the borrower pays.[54] The company facilitates interest rates that are better for lenders and borrowers than they would receive from most banks. It has averaged between a six and nine percent return to investors between its founding and 2013.[55] However, because lenders are making personal loans to individuals on the site, their gains are taxable as personal income instead of investment income. Therefore, income from Lending Club loans may be taxed at a higher rate than investments that are taxed at the capital gains rate.
Loan ownership[edit]
After the notes are issued, Lending Club purchases the loans from the issuing bank and notes become the obligations of Lending Club, and not of the ultimate borrower: Lending Club promises to pay the noteholder monies it receives from the borrower less its service fees, while the holders of Lending Club notes have the status of unsecured creditors of Lending Club. This means that there is a risk that the investor may lose all or part of the investment if Lending Club becomes insolvent or declares bankruptcy, even if the ultimate borrower continues to pay.[26]
The investors have the ability to put notes up for sale before the notes have reached maturity. This service is offered in a partnership with FOLIOfn Investments which charges a 1% fee on note sales, making Lending Club the first peer-to-peer lending network to offer a secondary market for peer-to-peer loans. Other peer to peer lending networks such as Khutzpa.com have subsequently also partnered with FOLIOfn Investments to offer a secondary market.[56][57]
As of 2016, a high proportion of funds for Lending Club-facilitated loans came from hedge funds. During May of that year Lending Club was seeking to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loans as bonds as part of a strategy to overcome difficulties in accessing sufficient funding.[58]
Credit risk[edit]
When initially founded, Lending Club positioned itself as a social networking service and set up opportunities for members to identify group affinities, based on a theory that borrowers would be less likely to default to lenders with whom they had affinities and social relationships. It developed an algorithm called LendingMatch for identifying common relationship factors such as geographic location, educational and professional background, and connectedness within a given social network.[59][60][61]
After registering with the SEC, Lending Club stopped presenting itself as a social network and maintaining that social affinity will necessarily reduce the defaulting risk. It now presents the algorithm just as a search tool for investors to find Notes they would like to purchase, using borrower and loan attributes such as the length of a loan term, target weighted average interest rate, borrower credit score, employment tenure, home ownership status, and others.[62] To reduce default risk, Lending Club focuses on high-credit-worthy borrowers, declining approximately 90% of the loan applications it received as of 2012[63] and assigning higher interest rates to riskier borrowers within its credit criteria.[27] Only borrowers with FICO score of 660 or higher can be approved for loans.[53]
The statistics on Lending Club's website state that, as of 31 December 2016, 62.3 percent of borrowers report using their loans to refinance other loans or pay credit card debt.[64]
Loan performance statistics[edit]
As of June 30, 2015, the average Lending Club borrower has a FICO score of 699, 17.7% debt-to-income ratio (excluding mortgage), 16.2 years of credit history, $73,945 of personal income and takes out an average loan of $14,553 that s/he uses for debt consolidation or for paying off credit card debts. The investors had funded $11,217,348,156 in loans, with $1,911,759,192 coming from Q2 2015. The nominal average interest rate is 14.08%, default rate 3.39%, and an average net annualized return (net of defaults and service fees) of 8.93%.[27][65] The average returns of investment for Lending Club lenders are between 5.47% and 10.22%, with 23 straight quarters of positive returns as of the second quarter of 2013.[66]

Recognition[edit]
In 2011 and 2012 the company was named to as one of the AlwaysOn Global 250.[73][74] Lending Club is the winner of the World Economic Forum 2012 Technology Pioneer Award.[75] It has been recognized by Forbes as one of America’s 20 most promising companies in 2011[1] and 2012,[76] and by Fast Company as one of the ten most innovative financial companies in the world.[77] It was named one of the Disruptor 50 by CNBC in May 2013 and 2014, as a disruptive innovator in next generation financial services.[78][79] In 2014, Lending Club was recognized by Inc. as one of the 500 Fastest Growing Private Companies in America at #248.[80] Renaud Laplanche, the company’s founder and CEO, also received The Economist Innovation Award in 2014 for the consumer products category.[81]

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[7] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. Lending Club operates an online lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to purchase notes backed by payments made on loans. Lending Club is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.[8] The company claims that $15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to 31 December 2015.[9]
Lending Club enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee.
Lending Club also makes traditional direct to consumer loans, including automobile refinance transactions, through WebBank, an FDIC-insured, state-chartered industrial bank that is heaquarted in Salt Lake City Utah. The loans are not funded by investors but are assigned to other financial institutions.
The company raised $1 billion in what became the largest technology IPO of 2014 in the United States. Though viewed as a pioneer in the fintech industry and one of the largest such firms, Lending Club experienced problems in early 2016, with difficulties in attracting investors, a scandal over some of the firm's loans and concerns by the board over CEO Renaud Laplanche's disclosures leading to a large drop in its share price and Laplanche's resignation.

History[edit]
Lending Club was initially launched on Facebook as one of Facebook's first applications.[10][11] After receiving $10.26 million in a Series A funding round in August 2007, from venture capital investors Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners, Lending Club was developed into a full-scale peer-to-peer lending company.[10][12]
On April 8, 2008, Lending Club temporarily suspended new lender registration, canceled its affiliate program and entered a "quiet period" while it awaited approval to issue promissory notes to lenders.[13] On June 20, 2008, Lending Club filed an S-1 statement[14] with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking the registration of $600 million in "Member Payment Dependent Notes" to be issued on its Web site.[15] On August 1, 2008, Lending Club filed an amendment to its Form S-1[16] outlining new interest rate formulas as well as more details on a "resale trading system".[17] On October 14, 2008, Lending Club announced its completion of the SEC registration process, posted the filed prospectus on its website, and resumed new lender registration. Notes issued on or after October 14, 2008 represent Lending Club securities rather than direct obligations of the ultimate borrower and are tradable (can be bought and sold) on the Foliofn trading platform.[18] In March 2009, Lending Club raised $12 million in a Series B funding round led by Morgenthaler Ventures.[19]
Pre-IPO growth[edit]
In April 2010, the company raised $24.5 million in a Series C funding led by Foundation Capital and joined by existing investors including Morgenthaler Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners and Canaan Partners.[20]
In August 2011, Lending Club raised an additional $25 million in venture capital from Union Square Ventures and Thomvest, owned by the Thomson family of Thomson-Reuters.[1][21] This led to Lending Club earning a $275 million post-money valuation and an increase of $80 million in valuation from the preceding year.[22] Thomson-Reuters founder Peter J. Thomson also invested an unspecified amount of his personal fortune into Lending Club.[23] In fall 2011, Lending Club's headquarters moved to downtown San Francisco; its earlier offices were located in Sunnyvale and Redwood City.[1] Co-founder Soul Htite moved to China to start Dianrong.com, a peer-to-peer lending company based in Shanghai.[24]
In 2012, the company employed about 80 people, with Renaud Laplanche continuing as the company CEO and chairman of the Board of Directors.[1][25][26] The company averaged about $1.5 million in loan originations daily, with a total of $600 million since its founding.[27] In April 2012, Lending Club's SEC registration from 2008 was renewed for $1 billion USD in Member Payment Dependent Notes and became effective on April 10, 2012.[28] In June 2012, the company received $15 million in new funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and $2.5 million of personal investments from John J. Mack. Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meeker joined Mack on Lending Club's board of directors.[3] This led to a $570 million valuation of the company.[29] In November 2012, Lending Club surpassed $1 billion in loans issued since inception and announced they were now cash flow positive.[30]
In May 2013, Google Capital purchased a stake in Lending Club.[29] Lending Club also began partnering with smaller banks in order to help streamline their small loans operations. In June 2013 the company partnered with Titan Bank in Texas and Congressional Bank in Maryland in order to help them facilitate loans that would have been otherwise unprofitable for them.[31][32]
Initial Public Offering (IPO)[edit]
In March 2014, Lending Club began providing loans to small businesses.[33] In April 2014 Lending Club acquired Springstone Financial.[34] In May 2014 Lending Club formed a partnership with Union Bank.[35] On August 27, 2014, Lending Club filed for an IPO with the SEC,[36] the offering taking place in December 2014.[37] On December 10, 2014, the company raised almost $900 million in the largest U.S. tech IPO of 2014. The stock ended the first trading day up 56%, valuing the company at $8.5bn.[38]




Stevenson Place, San Francisco, the location of Lending Club headquarters


Car loans and mortgages[edit]
Laplanche told Forbes in April 2015 that Lending Club would expand into car loans and mortgages.[39] Lending Club also announced a partnership with Google to extend credit to smaller companies that use Google's business services.[40] The company signed partnerships with Google, Alibaba.com, BancAlliance, and HomeAdvisor, including vetting community bank lenders for BancAlliance (a group of 200 banks), in order to send people on its platform to various community finance institutions.[41] That year Lending Club partnered with Opportunity Fund, announced by former President Bill Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative. The partnership intended to provide $10 million to small businesses in areas of California that are underserved by lenders.[42] Lending Club and other small business lenders partnered with Sam’s Club to deliver its “business lending center” product.[43] In August 2015 the company created Lending Club Open Integration (LCOI).[44] In October, the company launched a multi-draw line of credit product for small businesses.[45]
2016[edit]
Like other peer-to-peer lenders including Prosper, Sofi and Khutzpa.com, Lending Club experienced increasing difficulty attracting investors during early 2016. This led the firm to increase the interest rate it charges borrowers on three occasions during the first months of the year.[46] The increase in interest rates and concerns over the impact of the slowing United States economy caused a large drop in Lending Club's share price.[47]
In April 2016, a Lending Club employee reported to Laplanche that the dates on approximately $US 3 million in the firm's loans appeared to have been altered.[46] Lending Club's internal auditor engaged an outside firm to investigate the report.[48] This investigation found additional problems with loans, including that $US 22 million in loans which had been sold to the Jefferies investment bank did not in fact meet the bank's investment criteria. Lending Club bought these loans back from the bank and resold them.[46][49]
The New York Times reported that the investigation found that Laplanche had not disclosed to the board that he owned part of an investment fund which Lending Club was considering purchasing.[46] The Wall Street Journal also stated that Laplanche was found to have not fully disclosed what he knew about the problematic loans.[49]
On 6 May Lending Club's board made it clear to Laplanche that he no longer had their confidence, leading to his resignation on 9 May.[46] The Wall Street Journal reported that Laplanche had been fired by the board. Three of the firm's other managers had also been fired or had resigned by that time as a result of the problematic loans.[49] Lending Club's stock price fell by a further 34 percent after Laplanche's departure was announced.[46] This placed the stock price at 70 percent of the price at the time of the firm's initial public offering.[48] As a result of the incident, the Securities and Exchange Commission was reported to be investigating Lending Club's disclosures to investors.[49] From May 2015 until May 2016 the share price of Lending Club had decreased by over 60%. Since Laplanche's announced exit the share price cut in half again.[50]
Business model[edit]
Overview[edit]
Lending Club enables borrowers to create loan listings on its website by supplying details about themselves and the loans that they would like to request. All loans are unsecured personal loans and can be between $1,000 - $40,000. On the basis of the borrower’s credit score, credit history, desired loan amount and the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio, Lending Club determines whether the borrower is credit worthy and assigns to its approved loans a credit grade that determines payable interest rate and fees. The standard loan period is three years; a five-year period is available at a higher interest rate and additional fees. The loans can be repaid at any time without penalty.
Only investors in 39 US states are eligible to purchase notes on the Lending Club Platform.[51] However, eligibility differs when purchasing notes on the secondary market, FolioFN. Borrowers from all but 2 US states are eligible to apply for a loan.[51]
Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. The loans can only be chosen at the interest rates assigned by Lending Club but investors can decide how much to fund each borrower, with the minimum investment of $25 per note.[52]
Investors make money from interest. Rates vary from 6.03% to 26.06%, depending on the credit grade assigned to the loan.[53] Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee. The size of the origination fee depends on the credit grade and ranges to be 1.1%-5.0% of the loan amount. The size of the service fee is 1% on all amounts the borrower pays.[54] The company facilitates interest rates that are better for lenders and borrowers than they would receive from most banks. It has averaged between a six and nine percent return to investors between its founding and 2013.[55] However, because lenders are making personal loans to individuals on the site, their gains are taxable as personal income instead of investment income. Therefore, income from Lending Club loans may be taxed at a higher rate than investments that are taxed at the capital gains rate.
Loan ownership[edit]
After the notes are issued, Lending Club purchases the loans from the issuing bank and notes become the obligations of Lending Club, and not of the ultimate borrower: Lending Club promises to pay the noteholder monies it receives from the borrower less its service fees, while the holders of Lending Club notes have the status of unsecured creditors of Lending Club. This means that there is a risk that the investor may lose all or part of the investment if Lending Club becomes insolvent or declares bankruptcy, even if the ultimate borrower continues to pay.[26]
The investors have the ability to put notes up for sale before the notes have reached maturity. This service is offered in a partnership with FOLIOfn Investments which charges a 1% fee on note sales, making Lending Club the first peer-to-peer lending network to offer a secondary market for peer-to-peer loans. Other peer to peer lending networks such as Khutzpa.com have subsequently also partnered with FOLIOfn Investments to offer a secondary market.[56][57]
As of 2016, a high proportion of funds for Lending Club-facilitated loans came from hedge funds. During May of that year Lending Club was seeking to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loans as bonds as part of a strategy to overcome difficulties in accessing sufficient funding.[58]
Credit risk[edit]
When initially founded, Lending Club positioned itself as a social networking service and set up opportunities for members to identify group affinities, based on a theory that borrowers would be less likely to default to lenders with whom they had affinities and social relationships. It developed an algorithm called LendingMatch for identifying common relationship factors such as geographic location, educational and professional background, and connectedness within a given social network.[59][60][61]
After registering with the SEC, Lending Club stopped presenting itself as a social network and maintaining that social affinity will necessarily reduce the defaulting risk. It now presents the algorithm just as a search tool for investors to find Notes they would like to purchase, using borrower and loan attributes such as the length of a loan term, target weighted average interest rate, borrower credit score, employment tenure, home ownership status, and others.[62] To reduce default risk, Lending Club focuses on high-credit-worthy borrowers, declining approximately 90% of the loan applications it received as of 2012[63] and assigning higher interest rates to riskier borrowers within its credit criteria.[27] Only borrowers with FICO score of 660 or higher can be approved for loans.[53]
The statistics on Lending Club's website state that, as of 31 December 2016, 62.3 percent of borrowers report using their loans to refinance other loans or pay credit card debt.[64]
Loan performance statistics[edit]
As of June 30, 2015, the average Lending Club borrower has a FICO score of 699, 17.7% debt-to-income ratio (excluding mortgage), 16.2 years of credit history, $73,945 of personal income and takes out an average loan of $14,553 that s/he uses for debt consolidation or for paying off credit card debts. The investors had funded $11,217,348,156 in loans, with $1,911,759,192 coming from Q2 2015. The nominal average interest rate is 14.08%, default rate 3.39%, and an average net annualized return (net of defaults and service fees) of 8.93%.[27][65] The average returns of investment for Lending Club lenders are between 5.47% and 10.22%, with 23 straight quarters of positive returns as of the second quarter of 2013.[66]

Recognition[edit]
In 2011 and 2012 the company was named to as one of the AlwaysOn Global 250.[73][74] Lending Club is the winner of the World Economic Forum 2012 Technology Pioneer Award.[75] It has been recognized by Forbes as one of America’s 20 most promising companies in 2011[1] and 2012,[76] and by Fast Company as one of the ten most innovative financial companies in the world.[77] It was named one of the Disruptor 50 by CNBC in May 2013 and 2014, as a disruptive innovator in next generation financial services.[78][79] In 2014, Lending Club was recognized by Inc. as one of the 500 Fastest Growing Private Companies in America at #248.[80] Renaud Laplanche, the company’s founder and CEO, also received The Economist Innovation Award in 2014 for the consumer products category.[81]

LendingClub Corp (NYSE:LC) Launches Auto Refinancing Product

LendingClub Corp (NYSE:LC) the renowned online marketplace connecting investors and borrowers reported the introduction of an auto refinance product that offers car owners an innovative solution to save capital on their auto loans. It is being introduced initially to California residents, and the firm plans to launch it nationally in 2017.
The new product leverages Lending company’s expertise and technology to help eligible clients save capital by refinancing into affordable loans with clear terms, no hidden fees and better rates.
The management speaks
Scott Sanborn, the CEO and President of Lending Club, said that tens of millions of U.S. residents borrow more than half a trillion dollars annually to purchase cars. The processes and practices of the auto lending industry provide consumers limited alternatives and a lack of transparency. It has resulted in a gap between the prices customers pay and the prices they might otherwise eligible for, unnecessarily leading to debt burdens. The company is thrilled to leverage core capabilities and technology to put funds back in customers’ pockets.
Lending Club has turned into the country’s largest source for personal loans, mainly by helping customers get lower interest rates compared to conventional alternatives including high interest credit cards. Presently there is over $1 trillion in outstanding auto debt, with only a fraction of that refinanced yearly. It presents huge potential for the millions of residents in the U.S. and for the company. Customers can save by refinancing into an affordable product.
The company predicts the average APR on new loans through it will be nearly 1-3% lower than existing loan, converting into a mean savings of up to $1,350. This is firm’s first access offering for a secured loan with a risk and return ratio that’s corresponding to the unsecured loans obtainable through same platform. It’s a remarkable step in the advancement of Lending Club’s platform, a win for clients, and will provide investors contact to another established asset.
The new offering is intended to educate and allow consumers to minimize the interest they pay and lower monthly payments, using an automated, fast and secure online system.

Lending Club: Take A Look At The Competition - LendingClub Corporation (NYSE:LC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Lending Club: Take A Look At The CompetitionJun.22.17 | About: LendingClub Corporation (LC) Heath White Long only, value, growth at reasonable price, medium-term horizonSummaryLending Club had an innovative product when it launched in 2007.
        In 2017, though, the product has been commoditized and Lending Club has no edge.
        Marcus by Goldman Sachs, a new competitor, is especially formidable.
        Not much reason to expect Lending Club to flourish in the new, highly competitive environment.
        When it started in 2007, Lending Club (NYSE:LC) offered an innovative product: unsecured personal loans, applied for and disbursed over the internet. Although Prosper was an also-ran in the same space, the real implicit competition was credit cards. Millions of Americans carried thousands of dollars of credit balances at high interest rates, and Lending Club's selling point to consumers was that a loan from them was way cheaper than paying the bank 20% or so indefinitely. Fast forward ten years. Lending Club's business model has been commoditized and they no longer offer the consumer an innovative product. The long-term viability of their business depends on how well they match their competitors. This article will take a look at Lending Club's competitive environment. I will pay special attention to the newest and, in my opinion, most formidable entrant, Marcus by Goldman Sachs. The competitive environment for online lending CreditKarma is a personal finance website. They provide a list of online personal loan options, given some basic information. I put in $10,000 as my desired loan amount and selected a credit score of 700-749. I got the following list of offers:   Lender APR Payment   

 6.47% $306   

 10.99% $327   

 11.95% $332   

 11.76% $331   

 12.04% $332   

 12.12% $333   

 12.95% $337   

 13.65% $340   

 14.00% $342   

 13.80% $341   

 22.88% $386   That's eleven online, unsecured personal loan providers. The list does not include some others, like SoFi and Lightstream. Try it yourself here. The bottom line here is that, as far as the consumer is concerned, Lending Club does not do anything that, literally, a dozen other websites do. This is not a good situation to be in, for a business: as a rule, commodity businesses have their profits competed down to subsistence level. Lending Club is not winning this competition on price. Their APR is smack in the middle of the list. I varied the inputs but this list is representative: Lending Club has no special pricing edge. Lending Club is not going to win this competition on service, either. To see why, let me introduce the newest and fiercest competitor on this particular block: Marcus by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Marcus by Goldman Sachs Marcus by Goldman Sachs is the name of the online lending platform unveiled by Goldman Sachs last October. It competes directly with Lending Club. I covered its genesis here. The team that created Marcus made a special effort to be customer-oriented and rethink the loan process from the ground up. They did extensive research to see what consumers did and didn't like about the lending process. This effort shows up numerous ways on the Marcus platform:   No fees. Borrowers understand that they have to pay their loan back but it turns out that they hate fees. So Marcus does not charge any fees of any kind. If a borrower is late on payment, interest rolls into principal, and eventually the loan defaults. But no fees. In contrast, Lending Club charges an origination fee of about 5%, late fees, and a check processing fee if you pay with a physical check.  Flexible terms. Marcus will lend money at terms anywhere from 2 to 6 years. Borrowers worry about (1) their loan amount, and (2) their monthly payment. So Marcus lets them select those variables, and the term of the loan is an output. If you want to borrow for 29 or 43 months, you can do that. In contrast, Lending Club offers 3-yr and 5-yr loan terms. This standardization is useful for packaging loans up to sell to investors. But Goldman Sachs keeps the loans on its balance sheet, so they can forgo investor-focused standardization for customer-focused flexibility.  Payment deferral. In another nod to customer-focused flexibility, once a borrower has made twelve payments on time, they are allowed to defer a payment. This is useful for many people, for example, around Christmas. Again, loans packaged for investors couldn't offer this kind of flexibility, but a balance-sheet lender can.  Customer service. People want to be able to call their lender if they have a problem. Marcus maintains a customer service center in Utah, and the number is easy to find on every page of their website. Now head on over to Lending Club and look for a phone number.  Speed. Marcus advertises funds available in 1-2 business days, though some reviews I saw said it took 3-4 business days. Lending Club says their loan process "typically takes about 7 business days." 
 Lending Club vs. Marcus The two companies have very different funding models and risk profiles. Lending Club is an originate-to-distribute lender, while Marcus is a balance-sheet lender. Lending Club gives much of the profit of a loan to its investors, along with default risk and prepayment risk. Marcus keeps the risks and the profit. If we assume that Marcus's loans look like Lending Club's, with interest rates averaging 14% and defaults averaging 6%, then the income from each loan looks approximately like this: LC: 5% origination fee + 1% servicing fee = 6% of loan principal GS: 14% interest - 6% default - 1% cost of funds = 7% of loan principal LC's income is heavily front-loaded while Goldman has to wait, so given the time value of money, the economics come out roughly the same. Goldman is in a position to improve their margins and/or lower rates by limiting defaults, and Marcus is indeed marketed to higher-credit borrowers. The real difference, though, is in the flexibility of the business models. For one thing, Lending Club needs to grow (they aren't anywhere near profitability yet) and their growth is constrained by the amount of investment capital they can attract. As competition in their space heats up, investment capital gets harder to come by: maybe it is significant that Lending Club originations haven't moved much in a year. Nobody knows what the P/L on Marcus looks like. But Marcus' growth has no similar constraint: it will be a lot easier for Goldman to raise, or redirect, cheap capital as needed. Second, Lending Club is only superficially immune to default risk. Investors bear this risk, and they respond to the characteristics of the loan portfolio. Elevated defaults mean investors withdraw money, which Lending Club cannot afford. So Lending Club must manage defaults at least as vigorously as Goldman does. More importantly, it is a lot more painful for Lending Club to cut back on loan originations, for example in a downturn, and it doesn't necessarily control the pace of lending. If Lending Club stops originating loans, the lion's share of its income dries up immediately. A relatively minor pullback in lending capital in 1Q16 led the founder and then-CEO of Lending Club, Reynaud Laplanche, to cut a few corners in order to maintain Lending Club's profitability and growth profile. (For a few details, see an earlier article of mine.) That caused a scandal, a DoJ investigation, and a change of CEO.
 If Marcus stops originating loans, in contrast, it still has a steady stream of loan payments coming in. Defaults would hurt, but Marcus can start lending again when it believes the coast is clear. When defaults rise on Lending Club's platform, investors rather than the company control when the lending starts up again. In other words, Goldman retains the flexibility to say, "this is not a good time to lend," while Lending Club never has that luxury, and they can step back in when they, not outside investors, judge it prudent. Summary Lending Club was an innovative product when it started a decade ago. Success breeds imitation, however, and now any number of companies are helping consumers cut their credit card payments. The addressable market is truly gargantuan-consumer debt in the US stands at $3.4T and almost $1T of that is revolving debt (source)-but still, the competition has begun to intensify and over time it will get fierce. The real winners will be borrowers. The companies that come out on top will be those with cheap funding and excellent customer service. Balance-sheet flexibility will be an asset. Goldman has all of these bases covered, and they are a tech-savvy, highly experienced, deeply connected competitor. Lending Club has no special advantages at this point. The easy growth, when competition was thinner, is behind them. I have no predictions to make about the short term fate of the company, but the long term future looks dim.

How can we help?
You have questions. We have answers.




How quickly can I get a loan?


              The entire process typically takes about 7 days. In some cases, it may take a little longer, depending on what we need from you. You can complete the entire process from the comfort of your home, or even on your phone!  You can keep things moving by checking your To-Do List to make sure we have all the information and documents we need.  Once your loan is approved and backed by investors, your money is automatically deposited directly into your bank account. Depending on your bank, this step can take a few more days.
            



Will checking my rate affect my credit score?


                No, checking your rate won't affect your credit score. Applying for a loan through LendingClub generates a soft credit inquiry, which we use to understand your creditworthiness. This is visible only to you, not to creditors or other users of your credit report. Visit Credit Score 101 to learn more about your credit score and protecting your credit health.




What happens after I check my rate?


                After you check your rate, here's what's next:  Choose your offer.  You'll receive multiple loan offers if you qualify. Each one shows the loan amount, interest rate, APR, monthly payment, and loan term (either 36 or 60 months).  Complete the application and verify your information.  We ask for your Social Security number, as well as information about your income and employment. If we need any additional documents, we'll let you know in your To-Do List. Then, hold tight while we review your application. Get your money.  Once your loan is approved and backed by investors, your money will be automatically deposited into your bank account.  The entire process typically takes about 7 days. In some cases, it may take a little longer, particularly if you need to send us additional information or documents.

How can we help?
You have questions. We have answers.




How quickly can I get a loan?


              The entire process typically takes about 7 days. In some cases, it may take a little longer, depending on what we need from you. You can complete the entire process from the comfort of your home, or even on your phone!  You can keep things moving by checking your To-Do List to make sure we have all the information and documents we need.  Once your loan is approved and backed by investors, your money is automatically deposited directly into your bank account. Depending on your bank, this step can take a few more days.
            



Will checking my rate affect my credit score?


                No, checking your rate won't affect your credit score. Applying for a loan through LendingClub generates a soft credit inquiry, which we use to understand your creditworthiness. This is visible only to you, not to creditors or other users of your credit report. Visit Credit Score 101 to learn more about your credit score and protecting your credit health.




What happens after I check my rate?


                After you check your rate, here's what's next:  Choose your offer.  You'll receive multiple loan offers if you qualify. Each one shows the loan amount, interest rate, APR, monthly payment, and loan term (either 36 or 60 months).  Complete the application and verify your information.  We ask for your Social Security number, as well as information about your income and employment. If we need any additional documents, we'll let you know in your To-Do List. Then, hold tight while we review your application. Get your money.  Once your loan is approved and backed by investors, your money will be automatically deposited into your bank account.  The entire process typically takes about 7 days. In some cases, it may take a little longer, particularly if you need to send us additional information or documents.

Description of chart: This chart shows the historical performance by grade for all issued loans.
This chart includes all loans that were issued 18 months or more before the last day of the most recently completed quarter. The historical returns data in the chart is updated monthly.
Adjusted NAR models potential losses on a loan prior to that loan being charged off. Adjusted NAR is calculated using the formula described here. It is based on monthly borrower payments actually received net of service and collections fees, actual charge offs, recoveries, and estimated future losses. To estimate future losses, we apply a loss rate estimate to the outstanding principal of any loans that are past-due but not charged off. The loss rate estimate is based on historical charge off rates by loan grade and loan status over a 9-month period. Historical returns are not a promise of future results. Lending Club Notes are not insured or guaranteed and investors may have negative returns. Individual portfolio results may be impacted by, among other things, the diversity of the portfolio, exposure to any single borrower or group of borrowers, as well as macroeconomic conditions.






Lending Club assigns a grade (from A to G) to each loan based on borrower credit quality and risk attributes. Grade A has less risk and lower expected returns, whereas Grade G has more risk and higher expected returns.3

  Lending Club Notes are similar to traditional unsecured bonds in that investors receive regularly scheduled cash flows at predetermined dates. Lending Club Notes deliver payments monthly, while most bonds pay their coupon semi-annually (with the exception of bond funds, which can also pay monthly). Neither is secured by collateral and neither provides promise of payment; Lending Club does not guarantee payment of the Notes or the corresponding borrower loan, and our obligation to make payments is limited to an amount equal to the investor's pro rata share of amounts received with respect to the corresponding borrower loan for that Note, net of any fee charges. Lending Club Notes deliver exposure to a fraction of the underlying borrower loan obligation, while traditional bonds are bought in their entirety (with the exception of investments in bond funds). Each borrower loan underlying a Lending Club Note is given an internally assigned grade, while traditional bonds are rated by a ratings agency - but both are based on the amount of risk inherent to the instrument. Unlike traditional bonds, Lending Club Notes are fully amortizing and distribute the investor's pro rata share of principal and interest within each payment. Borrowers can also prepay the loans corresponding to Lending Club Notes. Traditional bonds are structured with bullet maturities and the entirety of the principal is promised to be delivered at maturity - not over time during the life of the bond. The loans that correspond to Lending Club Notes are debt obligations of individual consumers, while traditional bonds are debt obligations of corporations, governments, agencies, etc. in most cases. Unlike many bond instruments (e.g. high yield bonds), the terms of a borrower loan underlying a Lending Club Note do not limit the amount of debt that the borrower can incur (other than the impact that additional, future debt may have on the borrower's ability to repay the loan), while the terms of a high yield bond may, among other prohibitive covenants, limit the amount of additional debt that the underlying corporate borrower can incur. Tax treatment of Lending Club Notes may also differ from traditional bonds and bond funds.


  This information is not intended to be investment, tax or legal advice. Lending Club Notes are not guaranteed or insured, and investors may lose some or all of the principal invested. Individual portfolio results may be impacted by, among other things, the diversity of the portfolio, exposure to any single Note or group of Notes, as well as macroeconomic conditions. Notes are offered by prospectus filed with the SEC and you should review the risks and uncertainties described in the prospectus prior to investing. You should consult your financial, tax or legal advisor if you have any questions or need additional information. Actual results may vary.

  4.95% - 7.10% average historical returns for loan grades A through C as of March 31, 2017. To be included in the historical returns ("Historical Returns") calculation, a Note must have been originated prior to September 30, 2015.  Historical Returns are Lending Club's adjusted net annualized returns ("Adjusted NAR") for Notes with Grades A through C. Adjusted NAR is calculated using the formula described here. Historical returns are based on actual borrower payments received each month, net of fees, actual charge offs, recoveries, and estimated future losses. To estimate future losses, we apply a charge-off rate estimate to the outstanding principal of any loans that are past-due but not charged off. The charge-off rate estimate is based on historical charge-off rates by loan status over a 9-month period. Historical performance is not a guarantee of future results. Lending Club Notes are not insured or guaranteed and investors may have negative returns. Individual portfolio results may be impacted by, among other things, the size and diversity of the portfolio, the exposure to any single Note, borrower or group of Notes or borrowers, as well as macroeconomic conditions.

	Data as of March 31, 2017. Lending Club retail investors have historically received 2% &dash; 5% monthly cash flow. Retail investor accounts are defined as those accounts with at least $2,500 in outstanding principal balance in any given month. Monthly cash flow for any given account is calculated by dividing an account's proceeds for any given month (scheduled principal & interest and additional payments, reduced by any charged-off Notes and fees) by the outstanding principal amount in such month. The monthly cash flow values reported above are based on the 12-month trailing average of the 10th and 90th percentile monthly cash flow values for all retail investors in the 12-month period ending March 31, 2017. Individual results may vary based on grade and term composition of an investor's investment strategy. Historical performance is not a guarantee of future results.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
