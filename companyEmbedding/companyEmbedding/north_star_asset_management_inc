Guiding our clients to their financial objectives

http://www.northstarinvestments.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/commercial.mp4
During the Past 35 Years, We Have Developed a Research Process and a Commitment to Service that is Helping Our Clients Achieve Their Financial Goals.
We established North Star Asset Management, Inc. (NSAM) in 1996 to provide superior investment performance by focusing on internal, proprietary research and investing in high quality, consistent growth companies. We developed a vision of the way we wished to work and how we would help our clients achieve their financial goals. The result is a cohesive, agile firm that invests opportunistically and assertively.  Our success is a product of our experience, continuity, and commitment.
Prior to the establishment of North Star Asset Management, Inc., the five founding principals of the firm had worked as a team of Trust Investment Officers at Associated Bank in Neenah, Wisconsin. With an average of 20 years of investment analysis and portfolio management experience, our group has produced an enviable record of investment performance and client service. 
North Star Asset Management was founded to ensure the continuity of our team of professionals and to improve upon an already solid track record of results and service. The creation of an investment advisory firm with a limited number of clients for each portfolio manager has allowed for an enhanced level of proprietary investment research, expanded flexibility to pursue new investment opportunities, and a greater level of client communications. We remain firmly committed to our philosophy of long-term investment in a diversified portfolio of fundamentally sound, consistent growth companies.
North Star Asset Management is incorporated in Wisconsin and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NSAM advises clients in 34 states and several foreign countries.

Our Approach
Our Equity Investment Approach:
Investing for the Long-Term in a Diversified Portfolio of Fundamentally Sound Consistent Growth Companies at a Reasonable Price. 
We focus on identifying consistent growth companies offering above-average return potential regardless of their size or geographic location.  Those companies typically possess the following characteristics:
 
Sustainable competitive advantage.  A sustainable competitive advantage is what differentiates a company from its competitors.  This includes such things as providing a superior product or service, having the leading market share, being the low-cost producer, possessing a superior distribution system, utilizing better technology, having superior research and development technology, or offering the best customer service.  Trademarks, trade names, and patents also provide compelling competitive advantages.
 
Superior management that acts in the shareholders’ interest.   Management should have a defined business objective and strategy.  It must use the company’s assets wisely and invest to generate superior levels of profit and growth.  They must be innovative and able to anticipate and act on change.  In addition, management must apply high standards of corporate governance and truly think of shareholders as owners of the business. A high level of management ownership in the company better aligns management with shareholders and is viewed positively. 
 
Long-term track record of revenue and EPS growth.  The company should have reported consistent revenue and EPS growth over the past 5-10 years or more.  To continue such a record, demand for its products or services must be growing, as cost containment and margin improvement will not last forever.  The consistency of reported EPS also demonstrates recurring and predictable demand for the company’s products or services.  A company that exhibits this consistency will most likely have below average vulnerability to a downturn in the economy. 
 
Leader in a growing industry.  The company’s end-markets should be growing faster than the overall economy.  The company should be a leader and innovator, not necessarily the largest.  The rate of internal growth (as opposed to growth from acquisitions) is important because it will provide a sustainable annual return and increase the value of the company over the long-term.  
 
Strong balance sheet.  A company with a strong balance sheet (low net debt-to-capital) should have the capacity to finance its growth. A company’s operating income should provide a very secure level of interest coverage under varied economic conditions.  A solid balance sheet will help reduce volatility in reported earnings during an economic recession, as well as reduce the risk of charges from write-downs.
 
Generation of free cash flow – The best businesses tend to be relatively less capital intensive and generate significant free cash flow.  Free cash flow can benefit shareholders in many ways, such as share repurchases, debt reduction, or strategic acquisitions. 
 
Attractive Valuation.  After finding a company that meets most, if not all, of the above criteria, it is critical to investment success to have the discipline to wait for the appropriate purchase price.  Key valuation determinants include a company’s probable long-term earnings per share growth rate, consistency and stability of estimated growth, profitability, financial condition, projected cash flow, and quality of management.  Our valuation methodology incorporates the use of a dividend discount model as well as relative price-to-earnings ratio (PE) and price-to-earnings relative to expected growth ratio (PEG) analysis.
 
Our Fixed Income Approach:
A Focus on High Quality Securities and Duration Management. 
Our bond investment approach emphasizes the generation of long-term, consistent returns within the parameters of individual client objectives.   Our staff has experience in a variety of fixed income disciplines, from emphasizing income and principal stability for conservative clients, to applying active duration management techniques for dedicated institutional portfolios.   Our strength lies in our ability to customize a fixed income portfolio to meet the specific needs of each client.  However, several aspects of our philosophy will apply to all fixed income portfolios under our management: 

Focus on investment grade securities.  

 

Avoid excessive interest rate risk.

 

Maintain adequate liquidity to ensure maximum flexibility.

Permissible investments include U.S. Treasury securities, government agency issues, corporate securities, preferred stocks, municipal bonds, mortgage and asset-backed issues, certificates of deposit, fixed income mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and high quality money market funds.

Our Philosophy
Our Investment Philosophy:
How Your Portfolio Will Be Managed.
 
North Star Asset Management tailors each portfolio to meet the specific needs and objectives of our clients primarily through a combination of high quality, consistent growth companies and investment grade fixed income securities.  Though each portfolio is unique, the majority of the investments are consistent with a model portfolio developed by our team of investment professionals.  We customize the risk of each portfolio primarily by adjusting the level of stocks and bonds rather than changing the mix of individual securities, although each portfolio manager has the flexibility to invest in securities that are appropriate for each clients risk tolerance.  By limiting the ratio of clients per portfolio manager, we ensure that our portfolio managers have the time necessary for properly assessing client objectives and developing and implementing a portfolio strategy to meet those needs.  
 
We utilize a team approach with eleven investment professionals working together to provide personalized portfolio management services by researching and investing in consistent growth companies and appropriate fixed income securities. Each portfolio is guided by a veteran manager with the resources and experience of the entire team in support. All portfolios are reviewed regularly by the entire investment team.
 
Our team of investment professionals evaluates investment opportunities through proprietary, fundamental analysis, involving company visits, input from Wall Street, and the utilization of a dividend discount valuation model.  Our equity portfolios are invested in a select number of stocks representing 15-20 industries.  Holdings of individual securities are generally limited to no more than 7% of an equity portfolio.  This provides sufficient diversification while permitting us to leverage our internal research.  By diversifying between large, medium, and small stocks along with growth, value and international stocks, NSAM provides broad diversification for its clients.  This flexibility allows us to invest in the most attractive companies regardless of their size or geographic location.
 
North Star Asset Management believes in long-term investing.  We have relatively low portfolio turnover, thereby avoiding excessive trading costs.  Our equity portfolio turnover is approximately 20% annually, resulting in an average holding period of approximately 5 years.  This turnover is significantly below industry averages.  In addition to minimizing trading expenses, the low turnover reduces potential tax liabilities.
 
While the firm utilizes a low portfolio turnover approach, it also recognizes the need to be flexible and take action when the fundamentals warrant the sale of an investment.  Other key elements of our sell discipline include disposing of investments when they materially exceed fair value, when holdings can be modified to enhance returns, or when prudence dictates portfolio diversification.
 
Although our dividend discount valuation model and fundamental research provide valuable input and our investment philosophy adds discipline, there are no substitutes for knowledge and experience when making investment decisions.  To that end, our investment professionals continuously review current holdings, security recommendations, and portfolio strategy for each account.

Their approach has been guided by their deeply-held belief that the financial system is broken, that people are suffering, and that they need to help their clients use their resources to effect change. As their analysis of creating change broadened, shareholder activism, community investing, community engagement, and charitable giving became essential ingredients of their active portfolio management process.NorthStar carefully chooses public equities from each of the major industry groups. Identifying particular strengths relative to their impact on the global community, they simultaneously acknowledge the issues, problems, and challenges unique to each company. Their goal is to find the best, financially sound and socially conscious businesses with full awareness of the limitations of any public company. They then intervene at a corporate level to improve their behavior with regard to such issues as human rights, the environment, employee relations, and corporate citizenship.Their fixed income investments fall into three categories: investment grade bonds, community loan funds, and micro or alternative lending. Ideally, they invest in a broad range of fixed-income options guided by the clients’ financial and risk constraints. They look to provide funding for a variety of projects, weighing interest rate risk, maturity, safety, and social impact.NorthStar's goal is to engage along the whole spectrum of financial activity, from equities, to loans and loan guarantees, to supporting local businesses, to finding private alternatives, and finally through philanthropy. They help their progressive clients negotiate their financial lives in a world filled with income inequality and complicated solutions. They listen to every client’s aspirations and create a customized portfolio that reflects their vision for change.NorthStar’s mission is to provide the most integrative approach to portfolio management available today.  Wealth management begins with an analysis of the social, ecological, and political problems of our time and with deep conversations with our clients.  These steps result in the construction of portfolios that integrate financial goals while upholding a commitment to social change.  Becoming a B Corp enhances our value as visionaries and change-makers in a very competitive field.The Change We Seek®NorthStar carefully chooses public equities from each of the major industry groups.

Guiding our clients to their financial objectives

http://www.northstarinvestments.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/commercial.mp4
During the Past 35 Years, We Have Developed a Research Process and a Commitment to Service that is Helping Our Clients Achieve Their Financial Goals.
We established North Star Asset Management, Inc. (NSAM) in 1996 to provide superior investment performance by focusing on internal, proprietary research and investing in high quality, consistent growth companies. We developed a vision of the way we wished to work and how we would help our clients achieve their financial goals. The result is a cohesive, agile firm that invests opportunistically and assertively.  Our success is a product of our experience, continuity, and commitment.
Prior to the establishment of North Star Asset Management, Inc., the five founding principals of the firm had worked as a team of Trust Investment Officers at Associated Bank in Neenah, Wisconsin. With an average of 20 years of investment analysis and portfolio management experience, our group has produced an enviable record of investment performance and client service. 
North Star Asset Management was founded to ensure the continuity of our team of professionals and to improve upon an already solid track record of results and service. The creation of an investment advisory firm with a limited number of clients for each portfolio manager has allowed for an enhanced level of proprietary investment research, expanded flexibility to pursue new investment opportunities, and a greater level of client communications. We remain firmly committed to our philosophy of long-term investment in a diversified portfolio of fundamentally sound, consistent growth companies.
North Star Asset Management is incorporated in Wisconsin and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NSAM advises clients in 34 states and several foreign countries.

Why choose us?


Long-Term Focus which underlies all of our investment decisions.

Strong, Internal Research capabilities which include management visits and fundamental valuation techniques.
Organizational Stability given that we are 100% employee owned.

Low Fees based on assets that we manage, not on transactions.
Extremely Confidential














North Star Asset Management tailors each portfolio to meet the  specific needs and objective of our clients through a combination of high quality, consistent growth companies and investment grade fixed income securities. 






Investing for the long-term in a diversified portifolio of fundamentally sound consistent   growth companies at a reasonable price.  We focus on indentifying consistent growth companies offering above average return potential.
