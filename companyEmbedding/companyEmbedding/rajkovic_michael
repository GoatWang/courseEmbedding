This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

 AND PEOPLE

A hidden getaway in the heart of Shibuya. The upper floor is decorated in a very French bohemian style, which helps create an incredibly relaxing ambiance. Flowing white curtains separate the tables, and the whole place feels very idyllic when flooded with rays of sunlight. For me, it’s the perfect place to relax and enjoy some very delicious drinks with friends.        -MICHAEL

		To me Tokyo is a paradoxical city, where the future and the past not only coexist but also influence each other. The size of the city is awe-inspiring and the speed at which life moves here inspire daily moments of reflection on both the meaning and purpose of a person's existence. Most people are incredibly dedicated to whatever it is they do, which results in extraordinarily high levels of service, professionalism, and thoughtfulness in regards to the product or service they end up providing.

 TRUMP ROOM

One of the most unique venues in Tokyo. Completely covered in gold frames, mirrors and chandeliers, it often hosts some of the most underground events in the city. Rather than a typical nightclub, Trump Room feels like a massive house party, giving you the option of meeting new people or dancing all night. The crowd is very fashionable and the music top notch.        -MICHAEL
