Cash Dividend On The Way From Summit Financial Group (SMMF)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 3/13/17, Summit Financial Group Inc will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.11, payable on 3/31/17. As a percentage of SMMF's recent stock price of $21.49, this dividend works out to approximately 0.51%, so look for shares of Summit Financial Group Inc to trade 0.51% lower — all else being equal — when SMMF shares open for trading on 3/13/17.

Summit Financial Group Becomes Oversold
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Summit Financial Group Inc presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.

Oversold Conditions For Summit Financial Group (SMMF)
Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

SMMF: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 10/14/2016 settlement date, and Summit Financial Group Inc is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 14.92 "days to cover" versus the median component at 6.24. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.
