Who we are

Uniquely passionate entrepreneurs.
We back the best and most ambitious entrepreneurs and help them make their ideas real and lasting. The entrepreneurs we team up with were born to build their businesses -- it is their life’s mission. Working side-by-side with these visionaries makes us incredibly optimistic about the future. The transformative companies they’re building, include: Adyen, Dropbox, Etsy, Sonos, SoundCloud, King, BlaBlaCar, Squarespace, Just Eat, Lookout, Hortonworks, Pure Storage, Supercell, Criteo, Funding Circle and many others.
Full attention of our partnership.
To us, providing full-service means giving you the full attention of our partnership. We structurally de-emphasize individual partner achievements to provide you with the full partnerships’ collective experience and expertise. Access to one means access to all. As our founding partner, Gerald Rimer, likes to say, “We’re not a family business, we’re a business family.”
Global ambitions.
We believe that passionate entrepreneurs can come from anywhere. We’ve supported consumer and enterprise technology entrepreneurs in 39 cities around the world and have helped them as they grow into new regions. Our physical presence in San Francisco, London and Geneva serve as places where our entrepreneurs can come together, and as jumping off points to discover what’s next.
 






Our history

Founded in Geneva in 1996 by Neil Rimer, Giuseppe Zocco, David Rimer.
Principal offices: London and San Francisco.
Most recent funds: early-stage fund (Index Ventures 8) & growth fund (Index Growth 3).

About Us


Our Mission

Wilshire Associates' mission is to provide innovative investment solutions and objective, independent investment advice to investors throughout the world.

Wilshire fulfills its mission by:

Promoting a culture of integrity
Aligning client objectives with individual & firm growth
Balancing tradeoffs between investment return & risk
Rewarding both teamwork and individual initiative

History

Since its founding in 1972, Wilshire Associates has evolved from an investment technology firm into a global advisory company specializing in investment products, consulting services, and technology solutions. We have worked throughout our history to maintain a strong commitment to our clients and to retain a position of leadership in providing innovative ideas to the investment industry.

Wilshire was an early innovator of the integrated asset/liability modeling technique, as well as risk management and portfolio optimization models. These models help plan sponsors and institutional investors arrive at optimal portfolios based on their specific needs. We also produce investment management tools designed to create index funds, optimize portfolios, develop dedicated and immunized bond portfolios, and measure performance. The Wilshire 5000 Total Market IndexSM, and the Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service® (Wilshire TUCS®) — two very familiar products in today's investment community — were developed in our first decade.
In 1981, Wilshire Consulting was established to provide the fund sponsor community with customized consulting solutions designed to enhance every stage of the investment decision-making process. For over 35 years, Wilshire Consulting has served many of the world’s largest asset owners and taken great pride for its innovations in the areas of performance fees and style mapping in equity management. These capabilities, combined with an established infrastructure and industry-leading technology, have helped Wilshire Consulting effectively deliver full discretionary advisory services or Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) Solutions to institutional investors seeking economies of scale for the ultimate benefit of their constituents. As of 12/31/16, Wilshire Consulting has $1 trillion in assets under advisement and $7.5 billion in discretionary assets under management.
In the mid-1990s, Wilshire launched its first Private Equity fund of funds, meeting institutional investors' growing appetite for alternative investments. As of 12/31/16, Wilshire Private Markets has over $4 billion in committed capital and serves more than 100 investors around the world with private equity solutions.
In 2005, Wilshire began leveraging its strong institutional brand by developing investment solutions for the retail market. Wilshire Funds Management (WFM) works with financial intermediaries to create customized investment solutions for a wide variety of retail distribution channels. As of 12/31/2016, WFM advises on more than $157 billion in assets, serving approximately 50 leading financial intermediaries.

Think of what you could achieve if you believed you couldn’t fail. We love fearless entrepreneurs, who see building a transformational business as their destiny. We love teams who see opportunity where others just see obstacles. We love companies that challenge convention and break the rules … just a bit. Above all, we love building lifelong relationships with the entrepreneurs we back, which are based on trust, respect and a shared vision.
