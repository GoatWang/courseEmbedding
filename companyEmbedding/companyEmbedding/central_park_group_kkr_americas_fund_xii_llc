By Buying Prisma, KKR Bolsters Its Alternative-Assets Lineup

							KKR's 2012 acquisition of Girish Reddy's fund-of-hedge-funds firm Prisma was a move in the right direction. Two keys to its success: Ties to Goldman Sachs and the promise of independence.

Page 1 of 3


Henry Kravis knows a thing or two about acquisitions, but
    the deal that KKR & Co. engineered in October 2012 promised
    to be particularly delicate. The buyer was an established
    company seeking new revenue sources. The targets capital
    came from investors nervous about changing anything. The
    principals of both companies had to see eye to eye; if the
    targets executives walked because the buyer wanted to
    impose its own ideas, the transaction might fail. So although
    Kravis; his longtime partner, George Roberts; and other KKR
    executives might normally advise an acquirer to cut costs,
    eliminate jobs and rethink the business, in this case they had
    to tread carefully.
The reason: The buyer was KKR.
    And the target, New York fund-of-hedge-funds firm Prisma
    Capital Partners, was KKRs first acquisition for
    itself  that is, not as a participant in a buyout.
Today, Kravis can say, Its been a great
    marriage, despite the long and anxious courtship. It is a
    marriage, however, in which the two parties live apart and
    operate autonomously; that was part of the deal. Kravis and his
    KKR colleagues work out of the firms elegant headquarters
    at 9 West 57th Street, just off Fifth Avenue and a short stroll
    from Central Park. The CEO of whats now called KKR Prisma, Girish Reddy, runs his firm
    from offices at One Penn Plaza, a new building that is one of
    the few examples of gentrification in a shabby, if bustling,
    part of Midtown near Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.
    Whereas Kravis has hung his own art collection at KKR,
    featuring work by Cindy Sherman and Edward Ruscha, Reddys
    Prisma displays pieces by emerging artists, including
    almost-large-as-life photos of Mongolia by John Delaney, a
    former master printer for Richard Avedon.
Reddy co-founded Prisma ten years ago with two former
    colleagues from Goldman Sachs Group: Gavyn Davies and Thomas
    Healey, who remain advisers to the firm. KKR Prisma is a
    sizable business now, with $10.1 billion in assets  No.
    16 on the Fund of Funds 50, Institutional
    Investors Alphas ranking of the worlds
    largest fund-of-hedge-fund firms. But KKR expects much
    more. 
Funds of funds gained prominence in the 1990s, mostly for
    high-net-worth individuals and smaller institutions that wanted
    to invest in 
    hedge funds. A fund of funds allocates its capital to
    multiple hedge funds, offering clients less risk than in
    betting on a few single-fund managers, and allowing investments
    in otherwise inaccessible funds. When Reddy and his partners
    started Prisma in 2003, they thought the future lay with
    institutional clients and customized portfolios; they were
    right.
The largest private equity firms have long been attracted to
    hedge funds. 
    Blackstone Group  KKRs biggest rival 
    started a fund of hedge funds with partner capital in 1990, 17
    years before the firms public offering, then expanded it
    under J. Tomilson Hill, a former Lehman Brothers Holdings
    investment banker and executive. Hill is now CEO of Blackstone
    Alternative Asset Management, the largest provider of funds of
    hedge funds in the world, with $55 billion in assets.
Today all the publicly listed private equity firms 
    Apollo Global Management, Blackstone, Carlyle Group, Fortress
    Investment Group, KKR, Oaktree Capital Management  have
    diversified into other alternative assets, including hedge
    funds. Goldman Sachs senior analyst Marc Irizarry says total
    assets in publicly traded alternative-asset managers have
    doubled, from $420 billion in 2009 to $835 billion in 2013,
    while capital from non-private-equity businesses has grown from
    56 percent to almost 70 percent. KKR remains more dependent on
    buyouts than its publicly traded peers: 60 percent of its $102
    billion in assets comes from private equity.
These firms pursued diversification for a variety of
    reasons. There are natural limits in private equity, so to
    maintain growth these firms seek new asset classes. As private
    equity matures, firms focus on leveraging their brands. Younger
    managers clamor to expand to build their careers, while share
    prices get a boost from assets that run countercyclically to
    private equity. And most buyout firms want to offer investors
    more products, in some cases broadening offerings into liquid
    alternatives in hopes of cracking the retail investor
    market.
But getting 
    hedge funds right isnt easy. In June, KKR liquidated
    its KKR Equities Strategies fund, a hedge fund it had formed in
    2011 with a team from Goldman Sachs proprietary trading
    desk. The fund had $500 million in assets; sources at KKR say
    it never achieved the scale they hoped for and that the firm
    wants to concentrate on Prisma, its credit hedge funds and
    seeding new hedge funds. In 2009, KKR wound down a credit hedge
    fund, the KKR Strategic Capital Fund, after assets fell from
    $1.35 billion in 2007 to a little more than $400 million, hurt,
    like many funds at the time, by investor redemptions. KKR still
    runs about $800 million in two credit strategies and owns a
    24.9 percent stake in Nephila Capital, a $10 billion
    reinsurance hedge fund based in Bermuda. And it owns 100
    percent of Prisma.
A fund of hedge funds can fit well into an alternative-asset
    structure. To some extent, a fund of funds removes a
    firms vulnerability to the performance of an individual
    fund manager. Because clients in funds of funds are generally
    smaller or less sophisticated institutions than those in
    private equity, a firm can expand its base without the risk of
    scaring off core investors
    if things dont work out. Certainly, a fund of funds can
    go awry. Apollo Global Management bought a stake in a fund of
    hedge funds, Lighthouse Investment Partners, in December 2010
    but reportedly is now trying to cash out after disappointing
    performance and disagreements over strategy.
Small wonder that KKR took its time over the Prisma
    acquisition  about two years. A fund of hedge funds is a
    complicated business that must cope with new complexities when
    it becomes part of a large, more diversified alternative-asset
    firm. Throughout the acquisition process both KKR, which has a
    long history of buying out hundreds of companies of all kinds,
    and Prisma, which specializes in carefully designing and
    constructing portfolios of hedge funds, clearly understood the
    special nature of the relationship. Now, after two years, the
    honeymoon and the adjustment period are both over, and the
    story of Prisma and KKR has truly begun.
PRISMA CEO REDDY SPEAKS of portfolios as precision
    instruments. You should test the risk factors before you
    put the pieces together, he says. When you add a
    new manager, how does his or her risk complement other
    managers? You should test the portfolio at that stage,
    not after you make a 5 percent allocation.
Such exactitude is not accidental: Reddy studied engineering
    before he considered a finance career. Now 59, he was born and
    raised in Hyderabad, India, and earned a BS in electrical
    engineering at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology
    Madras. He came to the U.S. to work on a graduate degree in
    engineering at Cornell University. Cornell had just started a
    three-year engineering and MBA program, which Reddy joined. He
    says the program opened up a new view of the world.
One of my favorite courses was in derivatives,
    primarily focused on options and futures, he says.
    At the time, derivatives and investment management were a
    big focus at Cornell, with two leading professors in the area,
    Andrew Rudd and Robert Jarrow, so it was a natural fit for me,
    and I ended up doing my MBA in finance. Rudd had
    co-founded analytic research firm Barra (now MSCI Barra), and
    Jarrow developed a number of derivatives models and
    techniques.
In 1990, Reddy went to work for Goldman Sachs in London,
    where he eventually co-headed the equity derivatives group; he
    became a partner six years later. Davies was in the London
    office too, as chief economist. Reddy considered the
    Zimbabwe-born, Cambridge Universityeducated Davies a
    thoughtful policy guy. Healey was a partner in
    Goldmans New York office, where he was chairman of the
    pension services group and led institutional marketing. He saw
    that pension managers were starting to consider alternative
    assets. Pension funds had large pools of capital and
    interesting investment ideas, and we perceived that there would
    be a growing interest in hedge funds, says Healey, who
    served as assistant secretary of the Treasury for domestic
    finance under Ronald Reagan.
The trio were at Goldman when the bank went public in 1999,
    a move that gave partners a share of the IPO profits but
    reportedly with a three-year lockup. Reddy elected to leave in
    2002, at the age of 47. He declined to comment on any financial
    incentives but says, I thought it was time to try
    something more entrepreneurial. He moved with his family
    to Summit, New Jersey, and began to explore new ventures. He
    became a director at his former professors firm, Barra,
    in 2003. (MSCI acquired the firm the next year.)
Healey and Davies also left Goldman. All of us had run
    our course at Goldman, and we all left within a six- to
    12-month period, for different reasons, says Healey, who
    began teaching at Harvard Business School and participating in
    various investment partnerships. Davies, who had been
    interested in the economics of the media industry, became
    chairman of the BBC in 2001. He brought in ideas for funding
    and adapting to the web, satellite and other changing media
    technologies, but his tenure ended under a cloud in January
    2004, after a U.K. judicial inquiry criticized the BBC for what
    even the broadcaster called sexing up a report on
    Iraqs capability for producing weapons of mass
    destruction.

L.P.      KKR & Co. LP provides investment and private equity asset management services. It manages investments across multiple asset classes includes private equity, energy, infrastructure, real estate, credit and hedge funds. The firm operates business through four business segments: Private Markets, Public Markets and Capital Markets and Principal Activities. The Private Markets segment is comprised of the global private equity business, which manages and sponsors a group of investment funds and vehicles that invest capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic minority positions. The Public Markets segment is comprised primarily of the company fixed income businesses which manage capital in liquid credit strategies, such as leveraged loans and high yield bonds, and less liquid credit products, such as mezzanine debt, special situation assets, rescue financings, distressed assets, debtor-in-possession financings and exit financings.

The Principal Activities segment manages the firm's own assets and deploys capital to support and grow the businesses. The company was founded by Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts on June 25, 2007 and is headquartered in New York, NY.    expand             Key People KKR & Co. L.P.   Board of Directors    Name/Title Current Board Membership          Henry R.
