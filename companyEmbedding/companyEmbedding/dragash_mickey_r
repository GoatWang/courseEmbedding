Mr. Mickey R. Dragash
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Legal Department
601 North Walton Boulevard. MS-L20
Bentonville, Arkansas 72716-0710
Ref. No.: 10-0097
Dear Mr. Dragash:
    This letter is in response to the meeting that occurred on September 22,2009 in which Wal-Mart asked for clarification of a previous Letter of Interpretation (08-0133) that was issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration's (PHMSA) Office of Hazardous Materials Standards. Attendees at that meeting inclu...[more]


Interpretation #11-0027
This is in response to your February 3, 2011 letter requesting clarification of the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR Parts 171-180) applicable to closure instructions. You presented a transportation scenario and ask how these requirements apply to a company that does not fill or close a package but only reoffers it for transportation? Your scenario is paraphrased and addressed below.

In your letter, you state a packaging manufacturer of a UN 4G fiberboard box with four inner plastic containers produces closure instructions for the packaging that clearly indicate the proper way to close each inner container (using the tops and seals provided), how to place each inner container in the outer packaging (with cushioning), and...[more]


Interpretation #04-0195
This responds to your December 15, 2004 letter requesting  clarification of the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR Parts  171-180) for plant nutrient products that are sold for hydroponic plant growth.  Specifically, you ask if the products described in your letter are subject to  the HMR. You provide the following two product descriptions:
1)         Aqueous  solution of inorganic minerals containing less than 10% Nitrates.
2)        Dry mixtures of inorganic minerals  containing calcium nitrate and ammonium nitrate, with less than 10% ammonium  nitrate and at least 12% water of crystallization.
In accordance with § 173.22 of the ...[more]


Interpretation #02-0250
This  is in response to your September 11, 2002, letter requesting clarification of  the emergency response information requirements under the Hazardous Materials  Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR Parts 171-180).   Specifically you ask whether the Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG)  could be stored in a compartment behind, the driver seat, within the driver's  immediate reach while restrained by his seatbelt.
Your  answer is no.  In accordance with §  172.602(c)(1), each carrier who transports a hazardous material shall maintain  the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section and § 172.606 of  this part in the same manner as prescribed for shipping papers.  Section 177.817 addresses shipping papers and  e...[more]


Interpretation #11-0297
This responds to your December 2, 2011 letter requesting clarification of marking requirements for foreign-made UN cylinders under the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR Parts 171-180). 

Your questions are paraphrased and answered as follows:
Q1.  Does equal treatment of U.S.-made specification cylinders by a foreign competent authority eliminate the requirement that a foreign-made UN cylinder must be approved in accordance with the HMR?
A1.  No.  With regard to use of cylinders, except for Canadian-made cylinders authorized under Transport Canada¿s Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations (see § 171.12(a)(4)) and foreign-made cylinders under conditional use in port areas or for exp...[more]


Interpretation #09-0152
This responds to your July 2, 2009 email requesting clarification of requirements for transporting explosives under the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR Parts 171-180). Specifically, you ask if you may use fire-retardant tarpaulins to protect explosives transported on a motor vehicle as required by § 177.835(h).

Section 177.835(h) requires explosives to be protected from moisture and sparks and permits the use of fire- and water-resistant tarpaulin. The HMR do not define the terms fireresistant or fire-retardant. For purposes of compliance with § 177.835(h), any tarpaulin that is manufactured using material that will protect an explosives shipment from moisture or sparks is acceptable. Note that for purposes of this...[more]


Interpretation #01-0277
This responds to your October 15, 2001 letter, and  November 30 and December 5, 2001 telephone conversations with this office's  staff concerning a leaking package of   “1, 1, 1 ­Trichloroethane solution, 6. 1, UN 283 1, PG III” you found on  your truck when you worked for Consolidated Freightways (CF) in 1996.  You stated CF's management, directed a dock  worker to load the package after discovering it was damaged.  You asked us if it was CF's responsibility to  put the leaking package in another authorized container before loading it on  your truck.
Although the shipper is primarily responsible for  ensuring that a hazardous materials is properly packaged, as stated in §  173.22, if a leaking pac...[more]


Interpretation #08-0160
This responds to your May 12, 2008 letter requesting clarification on the registration requirements in 49 CFR Part 107, Subpart G. Specifically, you ask if you must register and pay a registration fee.

According to your letter, you are a gas distributor for Sinclair. Your dealers order fuel, which is delivered to them by Sinclair in Sinclairs trucks. The gas delivery is billed to you and you collect payment from the dealers. You do not own gas stations nor do you operate the motor vehicles that deliver gas.
In accordance with 49 CFR 107.601, shippers and carriers of certain quantities of hazardous materials must register with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and pay a registration fee. Because you ...[more]


Interpretation #11-0070
This responds to your December 21, 2010 letter and follow-up emails requesting clarification of the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR Parts 171-180). Specifically, you inquire as to the applicability of the HMR to shipments of scrap dental amalgam. According to your letter, the material that you intend to ship is dental amalgam that is not derived from the medical treatment of humans, in that it has not been in contact with a patient; rather, it is the excess amalgam that remains unused in a dental filling procedure. You indicate that the amalgam contains approximately 50% mercury and 50% metal alloy, which is comprised of silver, copper and tin. You further state that you intend to ship approximately 6 ounces of amalgam at a tim...[more]
