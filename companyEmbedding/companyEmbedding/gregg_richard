Richard & Son.Richard succeeds Scott Hymas, who will be taking a three-year leave of absence from NATM and RC Willey, where he serves as CEO, effective June 1.Hymas became president of NATM in 2014, and was the first group member to hold that position since 1992. He and his wife Alison are taking time off to assume new roles as missionary presidents for the Mormon Church in Sacramento, Calif.“It has been a pleasure working in this industry for the past 30 years,” Hymas said. “Although this is a unique transition for my wife and me, we feel it is the right thing for us to do at this time.  I look forward to reestablishing my relationship with this group at the end of our three years of service.”In announcing the change, NATM executive director Jerry Satoren thanked Hymas for his “mentorship and leadership” during Satoren’s three-year tenure at NATM, and welcomed Richard, currently VP, to his new role.“I could not have asked for a better succession scenario than to have Gregg step into the presidency,” Satoren noted. “Gregg is among the most successful and respected leaders in our industry.”P.C. Richard's Gregg Richard, center, with dad Gary and son Scott at a 2015 NATM gatheringRichard will be succeeded as VP by secretary Marty Hartunian, president/CEO of ABC Warehouse. Hartunian, in turn, will be succeeded by Eddie Maloney, president of Cowboy Maloney’s Electric City, who has been elected to NATM’s executive board.Mike Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics & Appliances, continues as a NATM VP.More immediate is the April 1 addition of Appliance Factory to NATM’s member ranks. The business, launched 30 years ago out of founder/CEO’s Chuck Ewing’s garage, now boasts 16 locations throughout Colorado and placed 28th on TWICE’s latest Top 50 Major Appliance Retailers report with some $73 million in white-goods sales.The majap chain has distinguished itself within its market by adding Mattress Kingdom sleep centers and branching into contract appliance sales, in-house appliance repair, home remodeling, and digital signage.Ewing said his membership presages additional store expansions this year, and that aligning with “some of the most prestigious and successful retailers in the country” will help it navigate the complexities that are certain to come with its next phase of growth.For NATM, the addition gives the group “a dominant presence in the Denver market and brings us a step closer to filling in our national footprint,” Satoren said.Appliance Factory represents the second dealer to join the group under Satoren’s watch, following the addition of Warehouse Discount Center in 2015.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

  Dealerscope: P.C. Richard & Son’s 105th anniversary has just passed, and your family has continued to run the company for going on five generations now. Talk about the philosophy that has informed your way of doing business.


  Gregg Richard: Our culture started way back in 1909. My great-grandfather, P.C., started P.C. Richard & Son as a hardware store in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. His son, A.J., my grandfather, was second generation, and is the one who gave us the foundation we stand on today. He was a true entrepreneur – and he believed one thing: very simply, that we need to take care of the customers before, during and after the sale. That was passed from my dad, Gary, who is third generation, to me, the fourth generation and then to my son, Scott, who is also in the business – the fifth generation.

Our Story

P.C. Richard & Son, a family owned and operated business for over 107 years, is a leading retailer of major appliances, consumer electronics, computer products and mattresses in the Tri-State Area.  The company currently operates 66 retail showrooms throughout Long Island, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island, Westchester, Rockland County, New Jersey, N.E. Philadelphia and Connecticut and has achieved strong consumer loyalty and recognition for Honesty, Integrity and Reliability.
The business started with Peter Christian Richard ("P.C.") who was born in 1882 in Amsterdam, Holland.  P.C. came to America as a young man.  He delivered milk, learned the tinsmith trade, and performed repair jobs for people in his community.  By the early 1900's he had saved enough money to open a small hardware store in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.
P.C.'s son, Alfred J. Richard ("A.J.") was born in 1909.  A.J. grew up in the business alongside P.C., serving customers from a very young age.  A.J. expanded the hardware store by selling the first irons, radios, toasters, refrigerators, washers, dryers and other consumer electronics and appliances as they became available in the marketplace.  These industry firsts established P.C. Richard & Son as a pioneer in our industry.  Today, P.C. Richard & Son is recognized as America's #1 family owned and operated TV, appliance & consumer electronics retailer.


A.J.'s two sons, Gary Richard and Peter Richard II have both worked at P.C. Richard & Son as members of the third generation.  As former President & CEO, Gary Richard has left his mark and led our Company to greater heights than even his father, A.J., had ever dreamed of.
Our fourth generation leader, Gregg Richard, President and CEO, has worked in all aspects of the company starting as a young boy.  He became President of P.C. Richard & Son in 2004 and CEO beginning in 2012. Other members of the fourth generation currently working in the Company are Peter Richard III, Operations Manager; and Bonni Richard-Rondinello, Human Resources Manager.  We are proud to have members of the fifth generation now involved in the company as well including Gregg's son, Scott Richard, a merchant in the Buying Department.
Sadly, our Founder, A.J. Richard passed away December 28, 2004. His legacy will live on and his business philosophy of Honesty, Integrity and Reliability will continue to be the foundation of our company.
