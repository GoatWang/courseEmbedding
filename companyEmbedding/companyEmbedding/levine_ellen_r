Ellen Levine became an editorial consultant to Hearst in January 2017, working across corporate divisions, from newspapers, to television to entertainment, to develop new projects and foster ideas and collaboration.From 2006 to 2016, Levine was editorial director of Hearst Magazines. She was responsible for strengthening current titles, developing new titles domestically and internationally, and evaluating opportunities for brand extensions, books, and digital alternatives.Levine made publishing history in October 1994 as the first woman to be named editor in chief of Good Housekeeping since the magazine was founded, in 1885. During her tenure, she was instrumental in launching new titles at Hearst Magazines, including O, The Oprah Magazine in 1999, the most successful magazine launch ever, and Food Network Magazine in 2008. During Levine's role as editor in chief at Good Housekeeping, the publication received a National Magazine Award from the American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) in 1999 and was nominated for a National Magazine Award in general excellence in 2005. The magazine has also received many industry accolades, including Adweek's "Hit List" in 2005, "Big List" in 2003, and "Hot List" as one of the top ten magazines in 2002. In January 2004, ASME and the Magazine Publishers of America (MPA) inducted Levine into the Magazine Editors' Hall of Fame.Before her appointment to the top post at the flagship publication of Hearst Magazines, Levine served as editor in chief of two other major women's magazines, Redbook (1990 to 1994) and Woman's Day (1982 to 1990), and as a senior editor of Cosmopolitan (1976 to 1982).Throughout her career, Levine has been cited by many organizations. In 2005, she received the Wellesley College Alumnae Achievement Award. This award is the highest honor given to alumnae for excellence and distinction in their field of endeavor. In November 2003, she received a Leadership in Media Award from the American Legacy Foundation for her antismoking initiatives and a WISER Award from the Heinz Family Philanthropies. Levine was awarded the first annual Media Award by the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) for the numerous articles on mental illness she published in Good Housekeeping. She was also recognized by the American Health Foundation in 1996, received the Writer's Hall of Fame Award for her lifestyle coverage, served as a delegate at the International Women's Media Foundation meeting in Prague, and was elected to the YMCA's Academy of Women Achievers. Similar citations have been bestowed upon Levine by the New Jersey State Federation of Women's Clubs, Douglass College of Rutgers University, the East Bergen Business and Professional Women's Club, Columbia University School of Nursing (which awarded Ms. Levine a Second Century Award for Excellence in Health Care in 1997) and Birmingham-Southern College for outstanding achievement. In 1989, she received the Matrix Award for exceptional achievement, one of the communication industry's most prestigious honors.Levine served two terms as President of the American Society of Magazine Editors, from 1994 to 1996. She was appointed a member of the U.S. Attorney General's Commission on Pornography and filed a minority dissent. As a result of her work with the commission, the American Society of Journalists and Authors presented her with an award in 1986 for courage in the pursuit of truth. And in 1987, she was similarly honored by the Atlantic Coast Independent Distributors for distinguished service in defending the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.She currently serves on the charitable boards of the New York Restoration Project, Bette Midler's effort to revitalize parks in all boroughs of New York City, and the Board of Advisors of New York Women in Communications.

   For New and Established Writers







Passion and Class
     by Michael Neff

An Interview with Ellen Levine
Ellen Levine began her career with two publishers: New American Library and Harper & Row (now HarperCollins).  She then worked at two other agencies before forming the Ellen Levine Literary Agency in 1980.  Since then, Ellen has acquired a reputation and a client list second to none in the industry.  The authors she represents and nurtures include Garrison Keillor, Jane Heller, Michael Ondaatje, Russell Banks, Cristina Garcia, and Marilynne Robinson, among many others.  Her fiction list encompasses thrillers, strong stories for women, multicultural fiction, and a wide range of literary fiction.  Ellen's agency recently merged with Trident Media.  Ellen is now a partner and a senior officer of Trident Media Group. 



NEFF: Ellen, hi.  Let's start at the beginning.  What made you decide to leave the publishing side and form an agency?

ELLEN:   I had hoped to find an editorial position since I had loved the editing I had been doing as assistant to an editor at Harper & Row (now Harper Collins) but none were turning up. He suggested I work at an agency to gain experience on the other side while waiting for the right job. I began at the Paul R. Reynolds Agency (no longer an active agency, and the oldest in America) selling first serial rights for the agency's clients.  I placed their book excerpts, articles, and short stories, and after about a year, I started to find writers of my own.  I was hooked. In another couple of years I was hired as an agent at Curtis Brown and left in 1980 to begin my own agency. 

NEFF: You are at the top of your game.  Why the decision to merge with Trident Media Group?

ELLEN: A number of reasons.  It was a great opportunity to be able to have more time to take care of my clients within a larger framework, but with the same autonomy which I've enjoyed.  Running a business, particularly one that had grown as mine did, is a separate parallel endeavor and an extremely time-consuming one.  It's liberating not to have to find solutions for malfunctioning computers and other equipment, employee health care options, bookkeeping systems, and so on.  

Nevertheless, I might not have made such a move if the right situation had not presented itself.  Robert Gottlieb is an exciting and innovative partner and Trident's list of authors is an interesting contrast and balance to mine.  Together we cover all aspects of the business very nicely.  Trident also offers certain clients of mine additional professional opportunities since the company's interests go beyond traditional book publishing. We've already begun work on an exciting project which combines our resources.

NEFF: It's been said that you provide "boutique-style" attention to your writers.  What does this really mean?  Do you specialize your relations with your writers in a manner that sets you apart from other agents?

ELLEN: I can't speak for other agent's styles and I don't think I'm the only agent to represent writers the way I do, but I can say that I work extremely closely with my writers on all aspects of their books.  In a good number of instances, I offer editorial guidance and suggestions when I think the work will benefit. 

In some cases this might involve line work as well as broader recommendations in fiction, perhaps in terms of plot or characters.  I also have a number of clients whose representation I feel needs a lot of  close attention to smaller transactions - these writers are often asked to write introductions to other books, contribute to anthologies, and they often receive magazine assignments. Several regularly have their work excerpted or quoted in other books;  this requires negotiating permission fees and contracts which is careful and time-intensive work.  Also some of my writers of fiction are also poets, playwrights, anthology editors, consultants on film projects, and so on.  I try to provide assistance in these areas too.  

Overall, I like to give my writers close attention in matters which seem smaller than selling their books but which are nevertheless quite important (another good reason why it's great to be free of the ever-increasing time spent on the administration of a business!) I also like to really get to know my clients and spend as much time with them as possible.  I have close and rich client friendships which I treasure.

NEFF: As a pragmatic literary agent conscious of market demands, how do you pick and choose between quality literary fiction that comes your way from new and unrepresented writers?   Assuming that the ms is well written to begin with, what factors enter into deciding on whether or not to represent the writer?

ELLEN:  I try to choose books that I can't bear to turn away - those that stay with me way after I've finished the last page.   Books that move me, whose language dazzles me.  Books that keep me quickly turning the pages, characters I keep thinking about.  Books that take me to a place or an experience that I would not have had, teach me, entertain me, or make me laugh or think.  And I have to be optimistic that I can find the right editor and house and launch the career.

NEFF: As an agent who represents literary fiction, how important to you is the quality and originality of the story itself as compared to the wordsmithing, i.e., if given a strict choice between the two, would you prefer an entertaining and original story written in a non-flashy manner--for example, a straightforward literary style like Robbins or Kingsolver--or an adequate story brilliantly wordsmithed in Annie Proulx-like fashion?

ELLEN: Wouldn't choose.  I'd take them both.

NEFF: As a reader and an editor, I often see the work of certain name authors getting worse and worse; and I hear it is difficult if not impossible to edit some authors, i.e., once they've become legends in their own mind.  I know from my own experience with certain writers that severe indignation follows if one attemtpts to suggest edits to them.  They clearly believe that anything they type on a white space is gold.  Given this situation, how do you approach, i.e, if one of your clients ever presented an ms clearly in need of a fix, are you able to assist?

ELLEN: I would always speak my mind.  It's up to the writer whether or not to listen.

NEFF: A minor agent I met at a recent conference openly scoffed at seeing a synopsis as useful.  As an editor and workshop leader though, I find a comprehensive yet short synopsis to be invaluable in being able to determine whether or not an otherwise good writer has an original story and/or one good enough to possibly get published.  What is your take on the value of the synopsis?

ELLEN: I think a synopsis is useful only when it follows several chapters or more of the book.  I don't feel a summary without the writer's ability to engage the reader's interest in the actual pages is useful.  However, if it is a device to show where the story is going from that point it can be very helpful.

NEFF: Who are some of your favorite contemporary literary authors right now?

ELLEN: Other than my own wonderful writers, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Louise Erdrich, Rohinton Mistry, Toni Morrison, Ian McEwan, Margaret Atwood. 

NEFF: What factors determine whether or not a first time literary work is going to get marketing dollars?  

ELLEN: Obviously what the publisher has paid for the book and whether there is a solid advertising and marketing budget (and perhaps an outside publicist as part of the deal).  Then early reactions inside the house,  good early industry reviews, great quotes, strong press, large orders and consequent large printing which will then have more marketing dollars attached.   

NEFF: What is your view on the contemporary publishing climate for first time literary authors?  Any advice?

ELLEN: There is always an appetite for new voices and strong first books.  There is so much joy in discovery and the promise and potential which comes with the launch of a new talent.  A strong concept and dazzling writing help.

NEFF: How best for an aspiring author to balance "writing from the heart" with "writing for the market"?  Any way to resolve?

ELLEN: Always write from the heart.  You should be writing because the story and the characters take you over.  The result will have the best shot in the market.  If you write by the numbers it shows.

NEFF: For our readers and writers, please tell us what types of stories Ellen Levine is looking to represent now.  What will capture her heart and mind?

ELLEN: My interests are wide - right now I'm in love with some of these new mss -  a Southern novel starring several eccentric women, a heartbreaking and exquisite novel about a mother who deserts her daughter, a period piece set right after WWII with a tragic love story and characters so real I feel I can speak to them.  Right now I would love to find a novel set in earlier times, perhaps a century or so ago, a novel with an exotic setting, always a novel with very strong characters who are discovering some truths, a novel which teaches me about some new scientific or cultural phenomenon, or presents me with a slice of life I really don't know, a novel that is simply a lot of fun.  I would love to read anything that is wise, uses language inventively, and surprises me with its observations. 

NEFF: Thanks, Ellen!  I'll keep a look out!

Book Summaries: 
If You Traveled on the Underground Railroad, Scholastic, 1988 
Thousands of slaves used the Underground Railroad to Escape from slavery in the south to freedom in the North.  They traveled on foot, by carriage, and sometimes by train.  Fugitive slaves faced dangerous animals, starvation, slave hunters, and many other dangers on their journey to freedom.  If they, or the people who helped them were caught, they faced severe punishment. 
Why would a slave want to risk his/her life to escape?  Why would someone, especially a Caucasian, want to help a slave?  How did fugitive slaves hide?  What did they do when they finally reached freedom?  These are just some of the questions answered by Ellen Levine in this book.  This book begins with a brief introduction explaining what the Underground Railroad was and how it began, and ends with the defeat of slavery at the end of the Civil War. 
If You Lived at the Time of Martin Luther King, Scholastic, 1990 
Laws enforcing segregation dominated the South after the Civil War.  African Americans were forced to use separate rest rooms, drinking fountains, restaurants, schools, and hospitals.  They were treated as inferior people even though slavery had ended.  The Supreme Court supported this treatment of African Americans in the 1890�s in a court case involving a man named Homer Plessy. 
Ms. Levine describes the changes created during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950�s and 1960�s.  The emergence of Martin Luther King during the Montgomery Boycott as a central figure of the movement is detailed.  Though great strides were made, equality for African Americans has not been completely achieved.  The importance of sit-ins, marches, other forms of nonviolent protests, and other leaders of the Civil Rights Movement are discussed. 
If Your Name Was Changed at Ellis Island, Scholastic 
Ms. Levine writes this book in format that she commonly uses.  After giving background information, she stages hypothetical questions that young people may ask about the topic and then proceeds to answer the questions in simple terminology. 
This book gives basic background information concerning Ellis Island, explaining what it is, when and what things happened there, and the important role it played in our history.  It is written in a way that young children are able to understand the concepts, yet adults are able use the historical information. 
Questions such as, "Did all immigrants come through Ellis Island?"  "Did they do it voluntarily?"  "Who helped them?"  "Was it dangerous?"  and many more are answered in this beautifully illustrated children�s book. 
Freedom�s Children, Avon Flare, 1993 
This nonfiction book includes stories from thirty different young adults who were active during the Civil Rights Movement.  The approach to the subject that Ms. Levine takes is a refreshing one.  Although the times were cruel and unfair, the interviewees take pride in their involvement, and a type of confidence shines through their stories. 
The book includes an important part in the history of the Civil Rights Movement by showing the real life experiences of young people during this time.  It is written in a way that young people could relate to their peers, yet accurately depicts the historical view of the Civil Rights Movement 
The Tree That Would Not Die, Scholastic, 1995 
In this book, Ms. Levine takes the voice of a four hundred year old oak tree in Austin, Texas.  Treaty Oak recounts the history of the area from the arrival of the Native Americans to the present.  As the tree grows, it becomes valuable to those who have contact with her.  The tree scratches the itch of a buffalo calf, provides refuge to a runaway slave, shelter for the homeless during the Great Depression, and comfort to many others throughout history.  In the end, it is the tree itself who needs care and protection from the people.  Illustrations by Ted Rand make this an excellent book for young readers.  It is a wonderful story of the history and character of the southwest and its people. 
Unifying Elements Among the Works of Ellen Levine: 
The most evident unifying element of Ms. Levine�s work would have to be her concentration on nonfiction material.  She also tends to write about diverse groups struggling for some type of equality, whether it be abused women, African Americans escaping from slavery, or immigrants and their difficulties through Ellis Island.  Most of her books are structured in a question/answer form so that the knowledge is understandable to young people. 




Suggested Teaching Activities: 
(These activities are designed to be flexible according to age) 
If Your Name Was Changed at Ellis Island: 
Have students create a family tree, and research the history of their last name. 
Freedom�s Children and If You Lived at the Time of Martin Luther King: 
Have students interview a Civil Rights Activist. 
Have students create a news article of a nonviolent movement. 
Invite a guest speaker to speak to the class personally about the time period. 
If You Traveled on the Underground Railroad: 
Have students draw a map tracing an imaginary trip North on the Underground Railroad.  Make sure that they include specific stops. 
Have students create their own "code language" for communicating with helpers of the Underground Railroad. 
The Tree That Would Not Die: 
This book could be incorporated into a unit on conservation.

"Ellen's skin has a natural glow already, so she doesn't need much makeup," says Pati. Not all of us are blessed with such youthful skin, but you can get an amazing complexion like Ellen's with these anti-aging tips from the makeup pro:You are what you eatEllen sticks to vegan fare and practices yoga, and it's written all over her face. Boosting your intake of antioxidant-rich fruits and veggies and cutting out processed foods helps give you that luminous look.Cleanse carefullyFace washes that lather up contain sulfates, which can dry your skin and make fine lines and wrinkles look worse. Instead, go for a cleansing cream that doesn't suds; it will leave skin soft and get rid of makeup and grime.Quench thirsty skinIf you're super dry, consider using a face oil at bedtime. These hydrating serums give your skin an extra plumpness and dewiness. Smooth on after cleansing and top with your night cream.Give powder makeup the brush offPowders can sink into lines, so switch to cream-based blushes, shadows, concealers and foundations. As you age, your skin loses radiance, so give it a boost with sheer, hydrating formulas that contain light reflecting particles.Go easy on the eyesLots of eye makeup can attract attention to crows feet. Use neutral shadows and a dab of smudgey liner instead of attempting a come-hither smoky eye or garish colors.Choose the right lip lookTons of super shiny lip gloss can make you look like a teenager, while dark matte lipsticks can make lip lines look more prominent. Go for something in between; I recommend a hydrating sheer lipstick one shade darker than your lip tone.
