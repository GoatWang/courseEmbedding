Breaking            
Energy ETF on track for its worst one-day drop in 3 months
A popular exchange-traded fund used to bet on the energy sector on Tuesday was looking at its worst daily decline in more than three months, according to FactSet data. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  was down 2.2% in recent trade, putting it on pace to log its steepest drop since March 8, when it plunged 2.6%. The slump in the energy-focused ETF was led by sharp drops in Transocean Ltd.  , Hess Corp.   and Marathon Oil Corp. , which were down at least 4%. All of the index's components were trading in the red, in early trade. The decline for the sector comes as crude-oil prices  sink to a seven-month low and are flirting with a close in bear-market territory, defined as a fall of at least 20% from a recent peak. Crude's slump was putting pressure on the S&P 500 index , with the energy sector the worst performer among the benchmark's 11 sectors, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was lower, weighed by a 1.6% decline in shares of Chevron Corp.  and a 1.3% fall in shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. .

Buy these 3 energy winners — and avoid this trio of losers

These dividend stocks are down a lot, but there’s plenty of cash flow to raise payouts

Breaking            
Energy ETF on track for its worst one-day drop in 3 months
A popular exchange-traded fund used to bet on the energy sector on Tuesday was looking at its worst daily decline in more than three months, according to FactSet data. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  was down 2.2% in recent trade, putting it on pace to log its steepest drop since March 8, when it plunged 2.6%. The slump in the energy-focused ETF was led by sharp drops in Transocean Ltd.  , Hess Corp.   and Marathon Oil Corp. , which were down at least 4%. All of the index's components were trading in the red, in early trade. The decline for the sector comes as crude-oil prices  sink to a seven-month low and are flirting with a close in bear-market territory, defined as a fall of at least 20% from a recent peak. Crude's slump was putting pressure on the S&P 500 index , with the energy sector the worst performer among the benchmark's 11 sectors, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was lower, weighed by a 1.6% decline in shares of Chevron Corp.  and a 1.3% fall in shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. .

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 1, Business, our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  Due to the separation of our former natural gas distribution business on January 31, 2014, the wind down of our former energy services business on March 31, 2014, and the subsequent reporting of such businesses as discontinued operations, income from continuing operations reflects the continuing operations of ONEOK Partners and of ONEOK as its general partner. All references to income as used in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to income from continuing operations. Please refer to the "Financial Results and Operating Information" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional information. ONEOK and its subsidiaries own all of the general partner interest and certain limited partner interests, which, together, represented a 41.2 percent ownership interest at December 31, 2015, in ONEOK Partners, one of the largest publicly traded master limited partnerships.  Due in part to the rapid growth in crude oil and natural gas production in the United States, the global supply of crude oil and natural gas exceeded demand and led to a dramatic fall in commodity prices beginning in the fourth quarter 2014. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices persisted throughout 2015 and are expected to remain low in 2016. The production growth and decline in crude oil prices have also contributed to lower NGL product prices, as well as narrow NGL product price differentials.  WTI crude oil prices declined to an average of approximately $50.00 per barrel in 2015, compared with prices averaging approximately $93.00 per barrel in 2014. NYMEX natural gas prices also declined to an average of approximately $2.60 per MMBtu in 2015, compared with prices averaging approximately $4.30 per MMBtu in 2014. OPIS Conway propane prices averaged less than $0.41 per gallon in 2015, compared with prices averaging more than $1.10 per gallon in 2014. At December 31, 2015, prices for WTI crude oil, NYMEX natural gas and OPIS Conway propane declined to approximately $35.00 per barrel, $2.30 per MMBtu and $0.33 per gallon, respectively, and remained weak into early 2016.  ONEOK Partners has mitigated partially its exposure to the current commodity price environment by growing its fee-based business. ONEOK Partners has a predominantly fee-based business in the Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Pipelines segments and, historically to a lesser extent, in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. In 2015, however, the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment restructured many POP with fee contracts associated with a significant amount  Table of contents  of its gathered volumes to increase the fee-based component and will continue to seek opportunities to similarly restructure additional contracts in 2016. These restructured contracts favorably impacted ONEOK Partners' 2015 results, and it expects to receive the full benefit of the improved earnings from these contracts in its 2016 financial results. In the fourth quarter 2015, the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment's fee revenues averaged $0.55 per MMBtu, compared with an average of $0.36 per MMBtu in 2014. As a result of these restructured contracts, we expect the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment's fee-based earnings to increase significantly to more than 75 percent in 2016 and ONEOK Partners' consolidated fee-based earnings to increase to approximately 85 percent in 2016. To further mitigate the impact of lower commodity prices, ONEOK Partners has hedged a significant portion of the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment's expected equity volumes for 2016 and 2017. The Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Pipelines segments continue to provide primarily fee-based services, and many of the contracts in these segments include fixed fee, minimum volume or firm demand charge agreements that provide a minimum level of revenues regardless of commodity prices or volumetric throughput.  The current weakened commodity price environment, resulting from factors beyond our control, is creating challenges for ONEOK Partners' crude oil and natural gas producer customers and resulted in decreased drilling activity in 2015, compared with 2014. In the Williston Basin, the number of rigs drilling on acreage dedicated to ONEOK Partners decreased from approximately 80 rigs in January 2015 to approximately 30 rigs in December 2015. Despite the sustained lower crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices and reduced capital spending by producers, we continue to expect demand for midstream services and infrastructure development to be driven by producers who need to connect production with end-use markets where current infrastructure is insufficient or nonexistent. ONEOK Partners' natural gas and NGL volumes increased in 2015, particularly in the Williston Basin, as producers are focusing their drilling in the most productive areas and are using more efficient drilling and completion techniques. We expect this lower commodity price environment to continue in 2016, which will impact ONEOK Partners' net realized prices for natural gas, NGLs and condensate, as well as our financial results. If the low commodity price environment persists for a prolonged period or prices decline further, volumes across ONEOK Partners' assets may grow more slowly than in the past or decline.  Although drilling has slowed, many of ONEOK Partners' customers continue to drill new wells in the most productive areas, and improvements in drilling and completion technology are resulting in higher volumes from the wells that are completed. These new technologies, such as multi-well pads and more efficient drilling rigs, are resulting in lower drilling and completion costs, which are mitigating partially the lower commodity prices for ONEOK Partners' producer customers. In addition, new wells drilled using horizontal drilling technologies tend to produce volumes at higher initial production rates resulting generally in higher initial decline rates than conventional vertical wells; however, the decline rates flatten out over time. A significant portion of ONEOK Partners' Williston Basin gathering and processing assets are in the most productive areas, which typically produce at higher initial production rates compared with other areas, have the highest natural gas content and have slower natural gas declines than crude oil. We expect ONEOK Partners' natural gas gathered and processed volumes in the Williston Basin to continue to grow in 2016, despite expected reductions in producer drilling activity. The significant drilling activity in recent years in the Williston Basin has caused natural gas production to exceed the capacity of existing natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure, which results in the flaring of natural gas (the controlled burning of natural gas at the wellhead) by producers. We expect ONEOK Partners to capture a substantial amount of natural gas currently being flared by producers due to an additional processing plant and compression projects that were placed in service in late 2015 and projects that are expected to be completed in 2016. Additionally, we expect ONEOK Partners to benefit from production from new wells on ONEOK Partners' dedicated acreage in the Williston Basin that have been drilled previously but have not yet been completed or connected to its system by expanding its natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids gathering infrastructure in the Williston Basin.  We expect ethane rejection to persist at current levels, which have exceeded 150 MBbl/d on ONEOK Partners' natural gas liquids system during 2015, until ethylene producers increase their capacity to consume additional ethane feedstock volumes through plant modifications, plant expansions and the completion of announced new world-scale ethylene production projects, which are anticipated to begin coming on line in 2017. Ethane rejection is expected to continue to have a significant impact on our and ONEOK Partners' financial results into 2017.  Beginning in June 2015, the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment reduced its level of ethane rejection in the Williston Basin to alleviate downstream NGL product specification issues, which offsets partially the financial impact of ethane rejection. We expect this decreased level of ethane rejection to continue throughout 2016. In addition, the Natural Gas Liquids segment's integrated assets enable ONEOK Partners to mitigate partially this impact through minimum volume commitments, contract modifications that vary fees for ethane and other NGL products, and ONEOK Partners' ability to utilize the transportation capacity made available due to ethane rejection to capture additional NGL location price differentials, when they exist, in its optimization activities.  Table of contents  ONEOK Partners' Growth Projects - In 2015, crude oil and natural gas producers continued to drill for crude oil and NGL-rich natural gas in many regions where ONEOK Partners has operations, including in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations in the Williston Basin; in the Cana-Woodford Shale, Woodford Shale, Springer Shale, Stack and SCOOP areas in the Mid-Continent region; and in the Permian Basin. In response to this continued production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, and higher demand for NGL products from the petrochemical industry, ONEOK Partners has completed growth projects and acquisitions in these regions. In addition, ONEOK Partners' current projects are expected to expand the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids gathering infrastructure in the Williston Basin to capture natural gas currently being flared by producers. Through its Roadrunner joint venture, ONEOK Partners is constructing a pipeline to transport natural gas from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Mexican border near El Paso, Texas. The Roadrunner pipeline will connect with ONEOK Partners' existing natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure in Texas and, together with ONEOK Partners' WesTex intrastate natural gas transmission pipeline expansion project, is expected to create a platform for future opportunities to deliver natural gas supply to Mexico. The execution of these capital investments aligns with ONEOK Partners' strategy to generate consistent growth and sustainable earnings. ONEOK Partners' contractual commitments from crude oil and natural gas producers, natural gas processors and electric generators are expected to provide incremental cash flows and long-term fee-based earnings.  While reduced crude oil and natural gas producer drilling activity is slowing supply growth, we expect ONEOK Partners to complete its previously announced projects to meet crude oil and natural gas producers' demand for its gathering, processing, fractionation and transportation services. ONEOK Partners has suspended capital expenditures for certain natural gas processing plants and related infrastructure to align with the needs of its customers. ONEOK Partners could resume its suspended capital-growth projects when market conditions improve and customers' needs change. In 2016, we expect lower capital spending for ONEOK Partners, compared with spending levels from 2013 through 2015, due to the current commodity price environment and ONEOK Partners' alignment of capital-growth projects with the needs of its customers. If the current commodity price environment persists for a prolonged period, it may further impact the timing or demand for additional infrastructure projects or growth opportunities in the future.  WesTex Transmission Pipeline Expansion - In July 2015, ONEOK Partners announced plans to invest $70 million to $100 million to expand its WesTex intrastate natural gas pipeline system in the Permian Basin in the Natural Gas Pipelines segment. WesTex, which had qualifying open season bids in excess of 500 MMcf/d, plans to utilize 240 MMcf/d of existing capacity and create additional capacity by expanding its system by 260 MMcf/d by the first quarter 2017. This expansion project is supported by firm demand charge transportation agreements and is complementary to ONEOK Partners' recently announced Roadrunner joint venture pipeline project discussed below.  See additional discussion of ONEOK Partners' other growth projects in the "Financial Results and Operating Information" section in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Pipelines segments.  Roadrunner - In March 2015, ONEOK Partners entered into a 50-50 joint venture with a subsidiary of Fermaca Infrastructure B.V. (Fermaca), a Mexico City-based natural gas infrastructure company, to construct a pipeline to transport natural gas from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Mexican border near El Paso, Texas. The pipeline will connect with ONEOK Partners' existing natural gas pipeline and storage infrastructure in Texas. These integrated assets are also expected to provide markets in Mexico access to upstream supply basins in West Texas and the Mid-Continent region, which adds location and price diversity to their supply mix and supports the plan of Mexico's national electric utility, Comisi�n Federal de Electricidad, to replace fuel oil-based power plants with natural gas-fueled power plants, which are more economical and produce fewer GHG emissions. The estimated total cost of the project is approximately $430 million to $480 million. ONEOK Partners contributed approximately $30 million to Roadrunner in 2015 and expects to contribute approximately $50 million to Roadrunner during 2016.  Roadrunner has all permits needed to complete construction on Phase I and all permits needed to begin construction on Phase II. Construction on both Phase I and Phase II is ongoing and we expect Phase I to be completed in the first quarter 2016.  Roadrunner entered into a $230 million senior secured credit facility for the construction and operation of the pipeline. The senior secured credit facility expires seven years after the Roadrunner in-service date of Phase II, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter 2017. In addition, Roadrunner executed interest-rate swaps to hedge the variability of its interest payments during the term of the credit facility. Roadrunner's credit facility is nonrecourse to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, and neither ONEOK nor ONEOK Partners guarantees Roadrunner's debts or obligations under the credit facility.  See additional discussion in the "Financial Results and Operating Information" section in the Natural Gas Pipelines segment.  Table of contents  Impairment Charges - In the fourth quarter 2015, ONEOK Partners recorded $264.3 million of noncash impairment charges, primarily related to its long-lived assets and equity investments in the dry natural gas area of the Powder River Basin.  Dividends/Distributions - During 2015, we paid dividends totaling $2.43 per share, an increase of approximately 14 percent from the $2.125 per share paid during 2014. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.615 per share ($2.46 per share on an annualized basis) in January 2016, an increase of approximately 2 percent from the $0.605 declared in January 2015. During 2015, ONEOK Partners paid cash distributions totaling $3.16 per unit, an increase of approximately 5 percent over the $3.01 per unit paid during 2014. ONEOK Partners paid total cash distributions to us in 2015 of $706.3 million, which includes $310.2 million resulting from our limited-partner interest and $396.1 million related to our general partner interest. A cash distribution from ONEOK Partners of $0.79 per unit ($3.16 per unit on an annualized basis) was declared in January 2016.  ONEOK Debt Issuance - In August 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million of 7.5 percent senior notes due 2023. The net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses, were approximately $487.1 million. We used the proceeds together with cash on hand to purchase $650 million of additional common units from ONEOK Partners.  ONEOK Partners Debt Issuances - In January 2016, ONEOK Partners entered into the $1.0 billion senior unsecured Term Loan Agreement with a syndicate of banks that matures in January 2019. Proceeds from the Term Loan Agreement effectively refinance ONEOK Partners' 2016 debt maturities.  In March 2015, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of $800 million of senior notes, generating net proceeds of approximately $792.3 million. ONEOK Partners used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program and for general partnership purposes.  ONEOK Partners Equity Issuances - In August 2015, ONEOK Partners completed a private placement of 21.5 million common units at a price of $30.17 per unit with us. Additionally, ONEOK Partners completed a concurrent sale of approximately 3.3 million common units at a price of $30.17 per unit to funds managed by Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors in a registered direct offering, which were issued through ONEOK Partners' existing "at-the-market" equity program. The combined offerings generated net cash proceeds of approximately $749 million to ONEOK Partners. In conjunction with these issuances, ONEOK Partners GP contributed approximately $15.3 million in order to maintain our 2 percent general partner interest in ONEOK Partners. ONEOK Partners used the proceeds for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures and repayment of commercial paper borrowings.  During 2015, ONEOK Partners sold 10.5 million common units through its "at-the-market" equity program, including the units sold to funds managed by Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors in the offering discussed above. The net proceeds, including ONEOK Partners GP's contribution to maintain our 2 percent general partner interest in ONEOK Partners, were approximately $381.6 million, which were used for general partnership purposes, including repayment of commercial paper borrowings.  As a result of these transactions, our aggregate ownership interest in ONEOK Partners increased to 41.2 percent at December 31, 2015, compared with 37.8 percent at December 31, 2014.  See Note Q of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for a discussion of ONEOK Partners' issuance of common units and distributions to noncontrolling interests.  Table of contents  FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATING INFORMATION Consolidated Operations Selected Financial Results - The following table sets forth certain selected consolidated financial results for the periods indicated: Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 Financial Results 2015 2014 2013 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars) Revenues Commodity sales $ 6,098.3 $ 10,725.0 $ 10,549.2 $ (4,626.7 ) (43 )% $ 175.8 2 % Services 1,665.0 1,470.1 1,322.7 194.9 13 % 147.4 11 % Total revenues 7,763.3 12,195.1 11,871.9 (4,431.8 ) (36 )% 323.2 3 % Cost of sales and fuel (exclusive of items shown separately below) 5,641.1 10,088.5 10,222.2 (4,447.4 ) (44 )% (133.7 ) (1 )% Operating costs 693.3 674.9 541.7 18.4 3 % 133.2 25 % Depreciation and amortization 354.6 294.7 239.3 59.9 20 % 55.4 23 % Impairment of long-lived assets 83.7 - - 83.7 * - - % Gain (loss) on sale of assets 5.6 6.6 11.9 (1.0 ) (15 )% (5.3 ) (45 )% Operating income $ 996.2 $ 1,143.6 $ 880.6 $ (147.4 ) (13 )% $ 263.0 30 % Equity in net earnings from investments $ 125.3 $ 117.4 $ 110.5 $ 7.9 7 % $ 6.9 6 % Impairment of equity investments $ (180.6 ) $ (76.4 ) $ - $ 104.2 * $ 76.4 * Interest expense $ (416.8 ) $ (356.2 ) $ (270.6 ) $ 60.6 17 % $ 85.6 32 % Income from continuing operations $ 385.3 $ 668.7 $ 589.1 $ (283.4 ) (42 )% $ 79.6 14 % Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (6.1 ) $ (5.6 ) $ (12.1 ) $ (0.5 ) (9 )% $ 6.5 (54 )% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests $ 134.2 $ 349.0 $ 310.4 $ (214.8 ) (62 )% $ 38.6 12 % Net income attributable to ONEOK $ 245.0 $ 314.1 $ 266.5 $ (69.1 ) (22 )% $ 47.6 18 % Capital expenditures (a) $ 1,188.3 $ 1,779.2 $ 2,256.6 $ (590.9 ) (33 )% $ (477.4 ) (21 )%  * Percentage change is greater than 100 percent or is not meaningful.  Due to the nature of ONEOK Partners' contracts, changes in commodity prices and volumes affect both commodity sales and cost of sales and fuel in our Consolidated Statements of Income and therefore the impact is largely offset between the two line items. As a result, we consider operating income provided by revenues less cost of sales and fuel meaningful and necessary to understand our results of operations.  2015 vs. 2014 - Services revenues increased for 2015, compared with 2014, due primarily to higher natural gas and NGL volumes from recently completed capital projects and acquisitions in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing and Natural Gas Liquids segments and higher fees resulting from contract restructuring in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment.  Commodity sales revenues and costs of sales and fuel decreased for 2015, compared with 2014, due to the sharp decline in commodity prices that began in the fourth quarter 2014 and continued throughout 2015 and higher propane and natural gas prices, as well as wider NGL location and product price differentials experienced in the first quarter 2014 as a result of unusually high weather-related seasonal demand. The impact from the price decrease was offset partially by higher gathered and processed volumes in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment and higher NGL volumes transported on gathering lines and fractionated in the Natural Gas Liquids segment in 2015, compared with 2014.  Operating costs and depreciation and amortization expense increased for 2015, compared with 2014, due primarily to the growth of ONEOK Partners' operations related to the completed capital projects, including acquisitions, in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing and Natural Gas Liquids segments. This increase was offset partially by decreased operating costs due to lower rates charged by service providers.  Table of contents  ONEOK Partners recorded $264.3 million and $76.4 million of noncash impairment charges, primarily related to its long-lived assets and equity investments in the dry natural gas area of the Powder River Basin in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Equity in net earnings from investments increased for 2015, compared with 2014, due primarily to higher volumes in 2015 delivered to Overland Pass Pipeline from the Bakken NGL Pipeline in the Natural Gas Liquids segment.  Interest expense increased for 2015, compared with 2014, primarily as a result of higher interest costs incurred associated with ONEOK Partners' issuance of $800 million of senior notes in March 2015, higher interest rates on ONEOK Partners' short-term borrowings, lower capitalized interest due to capital-growth projects completed and placed in service in 2014, and higher interest costs incurred associated with our $500 million debt issuance in August 2015.  Income from continuing operations decreased in 2015, compared with 2014, due primarily to the factors discussed above and a $26.4 million net reduction in deferred income tax expense in the first quarter 2014 as a result of the separation of our former natural gas distribution business and the wind down of the energy services business.  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, which reflects primarily the portion of ONEOK Partners that we do not own, decreased in 2015, compared with 2014, due primarily to lower earnings at ONEOK Partners and impairment charges discussed above.  Capital expenditures decreased for 2015, compared with 2014, due to the completion of several large capital-growth projects in 2014, suspension of several projects and the timing of expenditures in 2015 for ONEOK Partners' capital-growth projects.  Additional information regarding the financial results and operating information is provided in the following discussion for each of the segments.  2014 vs. 2013 - Revenues less cost of sales and fuel for 2014, compared with 2013, increased due primarily to higher volumes across ONEOK Partners' systems. ONEOK Partners' new natural gas processing plants in the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent region resulted in increased natural gas volumes gathered, processed and sold in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment and, combined with third-party plant connections, increased NGL volumes transported in the Natural Gas Liquids segment's exchange-services business. ONEOK Partners' optimization, marketing, isomerization and differentials-based businesses benefited from wider realized NGL product price differentials in 2014, compared with 2013, primarily related to increased weather-related seasonal demand for propane during the first quarter 2014 and wider realized NGL product price differentials between normal butane and iso-butane. The Natural Gas Pipelines segment also experienced higher transportation revenues, primarily from increased rates and higher contracted capacity and higher storage revenues from park-and-loan activity. These increases were offset partially by the impact of ethane rejection in the Natural Gas Liquids segment and lower contracted storage capacity in the Natural Gas Pipelines segment.  Operating costs and depreciation and amortization expense increased for 2014, compared with 2013, due primarily to the growth of ONEOK Partners' operations related to the completed capital projects in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing and Natural Gas Liquids segments.  In 2014, ONEOK Partners recorded $76.4 million of noncash impairment charges related to its equity investment in Bighorn Gas Gathering in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment.  Equity in net earnings from investments increased for 2014, compared with 2013, due primarily to higher volumes in 2014 delivered to Overland Pass Pipeline from the Bakken NGL Pipeline in the Natural Gas Liquids segment.  Interest expense increased for 2014, compared with 2013, primarily as a result of higher interest costs incurred associated with a full year of interest costs . . .

Latest Articles







                    COMPANY BRIEFS                
CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORP., Oklahoma City, agreed to buy 200 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas from Oneok, Tulsa, Okla., an energy company that has been shedding assets. BB&T CORP., Winston-Salem, N.C., said it would buy Southeastern Fidelity Corp., Tallahassee, Fla., an insurance premium finance company, in a stock swap.










COMPANY NEWS

                    WESTERN RESOURCES TO SELL ITS 44.5% STAKE IN ONEOK                
Western Resources, a Kansas utility owner, said yesterday that it had notified Oneok, a natural gas utility, of plans to sell its 44.5 percent stake in the company, valued at about $1 billion. Oneok has the right for 90 days to buy Western's 4.9 million shares for $21.77 each, Western said. Western said in a filing that it had ''lost faith'' in Oneok's management. Oneok's earnings fell 30 percent last year. Western, which reported a $21.8 million loss in 2001, is raising cash after writing down the value of its 84 percent stake in Protection One, a security and alarm business. Shares in Oneok fell 44 cents, to $21.05.











                    Oneok Buys Gas Plants                
Oneok Inc., a natural gas utility, agreed today to buy Kinder Morgan Inc.'s natural gas processing plants and pipelines in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas for $114 million. Oneok is buying six plants that can process 1.26 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day, along with 12,000 miles of pipeline and three storage facilities. The Tulsa, Okla., company is expanding through small acquisitions after canceling its $1.8 billion purchase of the Southwest Gas Corporation of Las Vegas.

The natural gas company Oneok Inc. agreed yesterday to buy Dynegy Inc.'s gathering systems, processing facilities and transmission pipelines in Oklahoma, Kansas and the Texas Panhandle for $308 million. The assets include Dynegy's eight gas processing plants, interests in two other plants and about 7,000 miles of gas gathering and intrastate pipeline systems. Oneok, based in Tulsa, Okla., said the acquisition would complement its existing natural gas assets. The stock of Houston-based Dynegy rose $1.25 a share, to $32.25.










COMPANY NEWS

                    ONEOK CANCELS PLANNED PURCHASE OF SOUTHWEST GAS                
The shares of the Southwest Gas Corporation shares fell yesterday after Oneok Inc. canceled its $1.8 billion purchase of the company, a Las Vegas-based utility, and the Southern Union Company said it would not resume its effort to buy the company.

OneOK headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma on 20 March 2007


ONEOK, Inc. is a diversified Fortune 200 corporation based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ONEOK was founded in 1906 as Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, but It changed its corporate name to ONEOK in December 1980. ONEOK is a general partner and owns 41.2 percent of ONEOK Partners, LP which is one of the largest publicly traded limited partnerships in the gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas. It also owns major natural gas liquids (NGL) systems due to the 2005 acquisition of Koch Industries natural gas businesses.
ONEOK's Energy Services operation focuses primarily on marketing natural gas and related services throughout the U.S. Energy Services, which derives more than 84 percent of its earnings from the physical marketing business, showed an operating income increase of $26.5 million. Energy Services’ retail business participates in customer gas choice program in Nebraska and Wyoming.
On December 22, 2005, The ONEOK Foundation said it would donate $1 million this winter to assist residents in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas with their energy bills.[3]
In 2007, Fortune magazine named ONEOK the most admired company in the energy industry.[4]
ONEOK's predecessor, Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG), had been headquartered in an Art Deco building on the northwest corner of Seventh Street and Boston Avenue in Tulsa since 1928. In 1982, ONEOK chairman, J. E. Tyree, announced plans to demolish the ONG building and replace it with a new 16-story tower. However, this did not happen. Instead, ONEOK bought the Cities Service Company (later renamed Citgo) in August, 1982. The acquired company already had a project underway to build a high-rise headquarters building at Fifth and Boulder. ONEOK realized that it would be more economical to cap the planned structure at 17 stories and move its headquarters there, rather than to proceed with its original plan. It completed the new black granite and glass tower in 1984.[5]
In 2009, ONEOK sponsored the construction of ONEOK Field, the new Tulsa Drillers minor league baseball stadium in downtown Tulsa.

History[edit]




Oklahoma Natural Gas Company headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma built in 1928


Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG) was founded in 1906 by two attorneys, Dennis T. Flynn and Charles B. Ames, who planned to develop the natural gas that was a byproduct of the northern Oklahoma oilfields. ONG incorporated on October 9, 1906, under the laws of Oklahoma Territory. Flynn was president and Ames the secretary. Joined by Chicago entrepreneur, H. M. Byllesby, for whom they worked, they also formed the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company (OG&E) to bring natural gas from the Cleveland Oil Field to Oklahoma City, using it to generate electric power. Byllesby soon resigned, but Glenn T. Braden and Theodore N. Barnsdall joined ONG. Both were already experienced oilmen. Together, they owned the Osage and Oklahoma Gas Company. Braden had been an executive of Standard Oil Company and Barnsdall an oil producer.[a] ONG built a natural gas pipeline from the Osage fields to Oklahoma City which went into service December 28, 1907. ONG extended the line to Guthrie and Shawnee. It also built the first gas pipeline compressor station in the state in 1910.[6] Braden followed Flynn as president of the company.
ONG continued to build pipelines throughout Oklahoma. By the time Braden retired in 1921, ONG owned over 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of lines and served over a half million customers in 48 of the state's 77 counties. In 1928, it built its noted headquarters building in Tulsa. It reorganized several times, first becoming a Maryland Corporation, then a Delaware Corporation.[6]
The board of directors voted to change the name of Oklahoma Natural Gas Company to ONEOK, Inc. in December 1980. The part of the corporation that operated utility services became a separate division named Oklahoma Natural Gas and headquartered in Oklahoma City. The parent company is headquartered in Tulsa.[6]
In February 2014, ONEOK spun off its natural gas distribution companies (Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Services, and Texas Gas Services) into a separate publicly traded company, ONE Gas.
Oklahoma Natural Gas, the company that started it all back in 1906, now operates as a division of ONE Gas.
Notes[edit]



^ Barnsdall owned the Barnsdall oil company and became the namesake of Barnsdall, Oklahoma.

OneOK headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma on 20 March 2007


ONEOK, Inc. is a diversified Fortune 200 corporation based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ONEOK was founded in 1906 as Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, but It changed its corporate name to ONEOK in December 1980. ONEOK is a general partner and owns 41.2 percent of ONEOK Partners, LP which is one of the largest publicly traded limited partnerships in the gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas. It also owns major natural gas liquids (NGL) systems due to the 2005 acquisition of Koch Industries natural gas businesses.
ONEOK's Energy Services operation focuses primarily on marketing natural gas and related services throughout the U.S. Energy Services, which derives more than 84 percent of its earnings from the physical marketing business, showed an operating income increase of $26.5 million. Energy Services’ retail business participates in customer gas choice program in Nebraska and Wyoming.
On December 22, 2005, The ONEOK Foundation said it would donate $1 million this winter to assist residents in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas with their energy bills.[3]
In 2007, Fortune magazine named ONEOK the most admired company in the energy industry.[4]
ONEOK's predecessor, Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG), had been headquartered in an Art Deco building on the northwest corner of Seventh Street and Boston Avenue in Tulsa since 1928. In 1982, ONEOK chairman, J. E. Tyree, announced plans to demolish the ONG building and replace it with a new 16-story tower. However, this did not happen. Instead, ONEOK bought the Cities Service Company (later renamed Citgo) in August, 1982. The acquired company already had a project underway to build a high-rise headquarters building at Fifth and Boulder. ONEOK realized that it would be more economical to cap the planned structure at 17 stories and move its headquarters there, rather than to proceed with its original plan. It completed the new black granite and glass tower in 1984.[5]
In 2009, ONEOK sponsored the construction of ONEOK Field, the new Tulsa Drillers minor league baseball stadium in downtown Tulsa.

History[edit]




Oklahoma Natural Gas Company headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma built in 1928


Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG) was founded in 1906 by two attorneys, Dennis T. Flynn and Charles B. Ames, who planned to develop the natural gas that was a byproduct of the northern Oklahoma oilfields. ONG incorporated on October 9, 1906, under the laws of Oklahoma Territory. Flynn was president and Ames the secretary. Joined by Chicago entrepreneur, H. M. Byllesby, for whom they worked, they also formed the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company (OG&E) to bring natural gas from the Cleveland Oil Field to Oklahoma City, using it to generate electric power. Byllesby soon resigned, but Glenn T. Braden and Theodore N. Barnsdall joined ONG. Both were already experienced oilmen. Together, they owned the Osage and Oklahoma Gas Company. Braden had been an executive of Standard Oil Company and Barnsdall an oil producer.[a] ONG built a natural gas pipeline from the Osage fields to Oklahoma City which went into service December 28, 1907. ONG extended the line to Guthrie and Shawnee. It also built the first gas pipeline compressor station in the state in 1910.[6] Braden followed Flynn as president of the company.
ONG continued to build pipelines throughout Oklahoma. By the time Braden retired in 1921, ONG owned over 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of lines and served over a half million customers in 48 of the state's 77 counties. In 1928, it built its noted headquarters building in Tulsa. It reorganized several times, first becoming a Maryland Corporation, then a Delaware Corporation.[6]
The board of directors voted to change the name of Oklahoma Natural Gas Company to ONEOK, Inc. in December 1980. The part of the corporation that operated utility services became a separate division named Oklahoma Natural Gas and headquartered in Oklahoma City. The parent company is headquartered in Tulsa.[6]
In February 2014, ONEOK spun off its natural gas distribution companies (Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Services, and Texas Gas Services) into a separate publicly traded company, ONE Gas.
Oklahoma Natural Gas, the company that started it all back in 1906, now operates as a division of ONE Gas.
Notes[edit]



^ Barnsdall owned the Barnsdall oil company and became the namesake of Barnsdall, Oklahoma.

OneOK headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma on 20 March 2007


ONEOK, Inc. is a diversified Fortune 200 corporation based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ONEOK was founded in 1906 as Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, but It changed its corporate name to ONEOK in December 1980. ONEOK is a general partner and owns 41.2 percent of ONEOK Partners, LP which is one of the largest publicly traded limited partnerships in the gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas. It also owns major natural gas liquids (NGL) systems due to the 2005 acquisition of Koch Industries natural gas businesses.
ONEOK's Energy Services operation focuses primarily on marketing natural gas and related services throughout the U.S. Energy Services, which derives more than 84 percent of its earnings from the physical marketing business, showed an operating income increase of $26.5 million. Energy Services’ retail business participates in customer gas choice program in Nebraska and Wyoming.
On December 22, 2005, The ONEOK Foundation said it would donate $1 million this winter to assist residents in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas with their energy bills.[3]
In 2007, Fortune magazine named ONEOK the most admired company in the energy industry.[4]
ONEOK's predecessor, Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG), had been headquartered in an Art Deco building on the northwest corner of Seventh Street and Boston Avenue in Tulsa since 1928. In 1982, ONEOK chairman, J. E. Tyree, announced plans to demolish the ONG building and replace it with a new 16-story tower. However, this did not happen. Instead, ONEOK bought the Cities Service Company (later renamed Citgo) in August, 1982. The acquired company already had a project underway to build a high-rise headquarters building at Fifth and Boulder. ONEOK realized that it would be more economical to cap the planned structure at 17 stories and move its headquarters there, rather than to proceed with its original plan. It completed the new black granite and glass tower in 1984.[5]
In 2009, ONEOK sponsored the construction of ONEOK Field, the new Tulsa Drillers minor league baseball stadium in downtown Tulsa.

History[edit]




Oklahoma Natural Gas Company headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma built in 1928


Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG) was founded in 1906 by two attorneys, Dennis T. Flynn and Charles B. Ames, who planned to develop the natural gas that was a byproduct of the northern Oklahoma oilfields. ONG incorporated on October 9, 1906, under the laws of Oklahoma Territory. Flynn was president and Ames the secretary. Joined by Chicago entrepreneur, H. M. Byllesby, for whom they worked, they also formed the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company (OG&E) to bring natural gas from the Cleveland Oil Field to Oklahoma City, using it to generate electric power. Byllesby soon resigned, but Glenn T. Braden and Theodore N. Barnsdall joined ONG. Both were already experienced oilmen. Together, they owned the Osage and Oklahoma Gas Company. Braden had been an executive of Standard Oil Company and Barnsdall an oil producer.[a] ONG built a natural gas pipeline from the Osage fields to Oklahoma City which went into service December 28, 1907. ONG extended the line to Guthrie and Shawnee. It also built the first gas pipeline compressor station in the state in 1910.[6] Braden followed Flynn as president of the company.
ONG continued to build pipelines throughout Oklahoma. By the time Braden retired in 1921, ONG owned over 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of lines and served over a half million customers in 48 of the state's 77 counties. In 1928, it built its noted headquarters building in Tulsa. It reorganized several times, first becoming a Maryland Corporation, then a Delaware Corporation.[6]
The board of directors voted to change the name of Oklahoma Natural Gas Company to ONEOK, Inc. in December 1980. The part of the corporation that operated utility services became a separate division named Oklahoma Natural Gas and headquartered in Oklahoma City. The parent company is headquartered in Tulsa.[6]
In February 2014, ONEOK spun off its natural gas distribution companies (Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Services, and Texas Gas Services) into a separate publicly traded company, ONE Gas.
Oklahoma Natural Gas, the company that started it all back in 1906, now operates as a division of ONE Gas.
Notes[edit]



^ Barnsdall owned the Barnsdall oil company and became the namesake of Barnsdall, Oklahoma.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
