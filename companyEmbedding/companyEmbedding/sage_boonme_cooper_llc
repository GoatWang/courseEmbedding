After a long day at work or school, many of us have the tendency to walk through the front door, drop everything and head for the couch. Because of this, the entryway can get pretty messy with shoes, bags, coats and more. Minimize front-door mania with some well-placed  entryway products, including coatracks, benches and baskets — and don’t forget to give your family a pep talk so they follow through with your new system.

Have plenty of entryway hooks on hand.To ensure that no coats, sweatshirts or rain jackets go without a home, place more hooks than you need near the front door. Don’t think about just your family; think about your guests too. When friends and family come to visit, make sure to have designated racks or stands so no one has to fight over coatrack real estate.Think about where to stock those shoes.Circumvent a wet, muddy mess by including an entryway rug that you don’t mind getting a little dirty. A doormat outside the front door will hopefully catch some of the dirt before it makes its way in, but having another rug on hand will help keep that wood floor or carpet clean. To encourage a shoes-off rule in your home, find a convenient place near the front door for stashing shoes. Use either a boot tray or shoe rack so family and friends don’t have to think twice about taking them off.Find a place for your seasonal accessories.Whether they’re sunglasses and baseball caps in the summer or scarves and hats in the winter, small accessories are a given, and they often get thrown down and forgotten near the entryway. Avoid a pileup by using wicker or wire baskets to house these smaller accessories, and keep umbrellas in check with an umbrella stand.Add an entryway bench.Make putting on rain boots easier by placing a wood bench near the front door. Not only would it come in handy for putting on shoes, but you can find one with nooks for  baskets or bins, making it a great storage option as well.Give each family member a cubby.Avoid confusion by providing built-in entryway lockers for each individual. If space is an issue, you can always use personal wicker baskets and coat hooks instead. As long as each person has a spot, there will be no fighting over particular cubbies or hooks, which will lead to easier grab-and-go in the morning.Use  decorations to make it feel like home.The entryway is the first glimpse guests (and you) get of the interior of your home, so make it cozy and welcoming by adding some personal touches. Welcome mats are a great way to immediately bring in a touch of personality, and entryway mirrors add style while simultaneously making the area feel larger. To add some warmth and additional decor, pile a console table with flowers, candles and picture frames.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreWhat types of  wall mirrors are available?Depending on the main purpose of your wall-mounted mirror, you’ll have a few options. If you’re getting it to fix your hair and makeup, make sure it’s a substantial size so that you can see your entire face and upper torso. If you need one to check out your entire outfit, look for a  full-length wall mirror that will reflect you from head to toe, but doesn’t take up any precious floor space. If you want one for strictly style purposes, take a look at the various  decorative wall mirrors that come in fun finishes, shapes and sizes to add a little pizazz to your walls — it doesn’t even matter if they’re hung at practical heights! For those looking to reflect a lot of light in a darker space, go for a large  wall mirror that will make the room appear bigger and brighten it up as well.Where is the best place to hang a  wall mirror?A single  wall-mount mirror can easily be a great focal point, whether you want it to be fully functional or not. If you want to actually use a wall mirror, place the middle of it at about eye level so you don’t have to crouch down or jump up to get a good look at yourself. Another option is to pair a few  wall mirrors together to create usable wall art — hung at varying heights, each one will be accessible to different people. Sizes can be mixed and matched, too, with larger wall mirrors being tastefully offset by smaller ones. Also try mixing frame finishes and shapes for a carefully curated effect, or matching them for a more coordinated vibe. In terms of which rooms would benefit most from  wall mirrors, consider where you most often check yourself out, or which space could stand to use a bit more light — bedrooms, hallways, living rooms and entryways are all good candidates.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreWhat size mirror do I need?When you're picking out your new mirror, whether decorative or not, first and foremost consider its overall function. Do you need a full-length one to nitpick daily outfits, or do you merely need a small wall mirror for added decoration? The placement can affect the size requirements as well. Big mirrors work well in entryways, since they help reflect light and give you one last look before heading out the door. Living room mirrors are usually more decorative, and therefore are often smaller with more ornate details. Bedrooms and closets often include tall floor mirrors, while bathrooms opt for vanity units or medicine cabinets.What  decorative mirrors are available?Although most serve a purpose,  mirrors are also great decorative elements. You can cluster several round ones together to form a piece of art, or use a single sunburst-shaped one as a focal point for your space. Leaning mirrors are also great for  decor, since they often have beautiful, intricate frames; they can take up a good amount of floor space, though, so be sure you have the room (and the budget) before you buy one.Which type of  mirror frame is best?If it's going in the bathroom, you want to be sure the frame can withstand moisture. If it's going in any other room, go with what feels right for you and looks good in the space! Mirrors are a chance to add some serious flair to your  decor, so feel free to get a little glamorous. You can also choose various surface treatments for the mirror itself. If it’s solely decorative (or is just hung to add a little light to a room), you don’t need to worry too much if it’s super functional. Go for a treatment that adds a little gold for warmth, or a vintage style that’s worn down a bit for some visual interest. Just be aware that the price range for  mirrors varies quite widely — it depends on the combination of size, design and purpose.
