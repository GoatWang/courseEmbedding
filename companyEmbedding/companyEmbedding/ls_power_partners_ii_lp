Overview
History
Values and Principles
Management Team







Founded in 1990, LS Power is an employee-owned, independent power company with offices in New York, New Jersey, Missouri,  California and Texas.  We are a developer, owner, operator and investor in power generation and electric transmission infrastructure throughout the United States. Since our inception, we have developed, constructed, managed or acquired more than 30,000 MW of competitive power generation and over 500 miles of transmission infrastructure, for which we have raised over $30 billion in debt and equity financing.
LS  Power Development has successfully developed over 9,000 MW of power generation and 470 miles of long-distance, high-voltage transmission infrastructure throughout the United States, with a combined capital cost in excess of $7.8 billion. We identify the need for new power generation and transmission infrastructure and work with our customers, including investor-owned utilities, electric cooperatives, municipal utilities, and regional power pools, to sell competitively priced electricity on a wholesale basis.    
LS  Power Equity Advisors is an established investment manager with $6.36 billion in equity capital raised across three private equity investment funds. Its focus is to acquire operating power generation assets and utilize our development, operations, power marketing and financial expertise to improve their commercial and physical operations. Since its 2005 inception, the private equity investment funds managed by LS Power Equity Advisors have acquired over 24,000 MW of power generation capacity.  
Critical to our organization’s success is a team of approximately 150 highly skilled professionals that provide extensive capabilities in managing every aspect of the independent power business, including land acquisition and zoning, environmental permitting, power marketing and origination, project finance, regulatory, engineering, construction management and operations.  Our team integrates ideas, skills and real-time market input in order to identify, evaluate and execute on opportunities that are designed to benefit our customers, communities and investors.  
Beyond our immediate team, our projects employ thousands of construction and operations personnel across the United States.  We take pride in our ability to positively impact our communities.
LS Power is led by its Founder and Chairman, Mike Segal, and its Chief Executive Officer, Paul Segal, and is supported by the Firm’s  Executive  Management Team.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
