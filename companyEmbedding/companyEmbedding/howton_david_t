Check out some of the testimonials from our satisfied customers:
Hi there,
  Moved to TN from Oldsmar, FL…. 4 years ago. Can’t find your sauce or rubs anywhere. Very sad as you have the best BBQ sauce in the world. Sure would like to order some of the rub and Hot BBQ as soon as possible…..(smokin’ ribs this Sunday) I prefer the Barns a Burnin but the kids can’t handle it….How can I go about stockin up?
  David B
 
Hi Steve,
  I made chicken for my youngest son and myself for lunch.  I used the rub and the mild sauce, WOW!!!!  It was freakin awesome. I will be talking about this product with very positive points.
  Thanks again.
  God bless
  Teddy
 
Hi Steve,
  As for the samples you sent over, everyone loved them.  I divided them up (selfishly keeping a couple for myself) and the response was great all the way around.  For the two I took home, the one I used for my BBQ ended up going home with my wife’s cousin that night because he loved it so much.  Great sauces!
  Kieth F.
 
By the way,
  I got the sauces from Jay a while ago, and man are they the bomb…
  Mouth watering, Awesome, Phenomenal. Really great.  I mean that.  I usually go for an Au Poivre with my Filet, but all that is changed, now.
  Later Bro,
  Julian
 
Steve,
  I apologize for not getting back with you…first I appreciate you
  sending the sauces, second, I had to fight off half the newsroom when I opened the box…I spread them around for everyone to try and I would say you have a good thing going. I tend to like the sauces that have a zing without destroying your taste buds…you have a couple like that…
  They are outstanding.
  Thanks again,
  Robert
 
Hi Steve,
  I put some rice buds in with the rub and it doesn’t stick anymore. Wonderful products, you have a big winner on your hands.
  God bless
  Teddy
 
Mr. Howton,
  I just wanted to say that the shipment of sauces that I received from you was terrific.  I have had the time to test each sauce, as well as the dry rub.  All I can say is wow.  The Southern Belle Sweet is still my favorite, but the the Southern Belle Sweet Heat is quickly closing in.I used your dry rub on an 8 pound pork butt that I smoked for a party and had people begging me for the recipe.  I have passed your name along to several friends here in Arizona and I’m sure that they will be ordering a combination of your sauces and rubs. Thank you for everything.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/29/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
