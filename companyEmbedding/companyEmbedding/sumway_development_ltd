Product diversification











growing sales | market segmentation | BBFC | black hole | 3 P's | MAGIC | behavioral premise | overlooked market | implementation | PSF











 Product diversification–



 growing sales of a new product in a new market.










Any modification of a current product that serves to expand the potential market implies that the company is following a strategy of product diversification.
The product diversification strategy is different from product development in that it involves creating a new customer base, which by definition expands the market potential of the original product. This is almost always done through brand extensions or new brands, but in some cases the product modification may "create" a new market by creating new uses for the product.
Teen People was an example of product diversification since it was a new product that expanded the market potential of the original product, People magazine. While some teenagers undoubtedly bought People magazine, they were not People's target market. Eventually, however, the product and Web site were merged into the People brand. Courtyard by Marriott and Fairfield Inn are other examples of product diversification since before Marriott offered those new brands they had little potential to expand sales in the business and budget categories. Marriott had business and budget guests, but they were not specifically targeted, so by concentrating on these two markets they were able to add to their market potential. It should be apparent why Marriott could not expand into such different categories with their original brand name.
When Heinz realized that children play with food and it would be more fun to play with ketchup if it were green or purple rather than red, they also were following a product diversification strategy since the market potential for ketchup increased from food to food plus play. Notice in this case that the brand name was unchanged.
Sometimes product diversification takes the form of a product extension with the same brand name. Heinz's introduction of "black label" ketchup, Heinz Tomato Ketchup Blended with Balsamic Vinegar, targets the upscale buyer who might not consider Heinz's regular ketchup, thus expanding market potential.
The dangers of product diversification

The main dangers facing a company following a product diversification strategy for a brand are that it could fail to adequately understand the new customer base and that any new brand name may result in loss of meaning for the original brand and/or cannibalization of the original brand, particularly if it is a brand extension.
The risk of not understanding the new customer base is present as it is with market development. And the risks of loss of meaning and/or cannibalization are just as significant as with product development.
For while Teen People had limited success, all of the women's sports magazines failed. The new market (women) was not interested in the new product (new magazines with various titles) since—unlike men—women did not want to read a magazine about sports without some link to fitness. And the few who did buy the new magazines simply switched from the men's versions.
The special case of retailers

Just as with product development, retailers present a special case. Thus, Subway's conversion from a ordinary sub shop to a healthy food outlet not only changed the brand's positioning substantially but also added new potential customers since, before the change, many of them would have never considered a Subway.

Subway: Expansion, Product Development and Community Affairs
Posted on August 27, 2015August 21, 2015 by Editorial Staff
  The sun may rise. The sun may set. But, the sun will set on a Subway logo. There is no doubt that Subway is the world’s largest fast food chain with more 43,000 stores that are serving healthy subs in 110 countries. And, do you know what Subway has been busy with? Making their subs even healthier and still trying to cover more earth space.More Subway Stores for 2015Subway is set to hitting its target of 2,500 additional stores for 2015. News from the Milford headquarters is that the company likes to take advantage of their versatility in space requirements to seek potential sites that can house a Subway store regardless of size and layout.According to John Devine, director of Subway real estate, large spaces are always ideal especially the ones that accommodate a drive-thru but, they are always considering the small store concept which represents 25% of their stores which are conveniently located in c-stores, universities, hospitals and sports arenas.  
Chris Kan, training and business promotion specialist for Subway real estate, says that the main advantage of Subway over their competitors is that the Subway concept is so flexible that it allows stores to come in various shapes and sizes and that accounts for the massive 53 million square feet of Subway property that is scattered in more than 110 countries in the world.This massive expansion campaign includes all territories and one of the most promising growth areas is China. There’s more to China now than just dumplings and noodles. In fact, if you happen to visit the Great Wall in Beijing, the biggest restaurant at the tourists’ entrance, where the cable cars are located, is a Subway store which is only one of the 900 stores that they are planning to put up by the end of 2015.With so many Subway stores located in major cities of the world, it is high time Subway tries to explore new markets. While the company concerns itself with selling more subs, it also focus in making the Subway business venture profitable. Subway can’t have too many stores operating too close to one another because they will eat up each other’s market. With more than 43,000 locations, the free capitalist world is getting smaller and smaller for the fast food giant. This is why Subway is focusing on China and they should also include Middle East as another possible growth area.Healthier Subway SubsAnd along with their expansion plans, Subway is focused in making their food healthier. Subway has joined the band wagon in the fast food companies’ movement towards eliminating artificial flavors in their list of ingredients. However, according to Elizabeth Stewart, director of corporate social responsibility for Subway, this move will be a little harder for Subway because of their size and scope. At the moment Subway research and development is working overtime to figure out which ingredients can go immediately and which ones would require more time. A realistic target for total removal of all artificial flavors and preservatives for Subway’s North American stores is 2017.2017? A lot may be asking, why should it take that long?It is very important for Subway to be very cautious and gradual about the changes they are going to make because being the healthier alternative among the fast food chains, they have to make sure that their food will still be good enough to eat. The main objecting is to make the healthy changes without sacrificing taste so that people will still prefer to eat the Subway subs. What’s the point of making a healthier sub when nobody is eating them anymore?What Subway can do at the moment is start introducing new products that will already follow the zero-artificial flavor and zero-preservative conditions. To start this off, Subway will be introducing a new Roast Beef recipe that will not contain any artificial flavors or preservatives. Then by August, Subway will introduce a new Ham that will also be free of artificial flavor and preservatives. These two new products will be available in 27,000 U.S. restaurants soon.Subway Singapore Special SAF OfferingOn a lighter note, Subway Singapore has something special for the men and women of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). As Singapore celebrates National SAF day on July 1, Subway would like to take the opportunity to express their gratitude and deep appreciation for the men and women of the SAF by giving free Regular Meal Upgrades for all SAF personnel.  With a purchase of any sub on July 1, an SAF personnel can get two cookies or a bag of chips plus 22-ounce drink free of charge. All he needs to do is visit any Subway store wearing his uniform or flash his military ID.Subway remains to be the largest fast food chain because they never miss out on opportunities to give back to the people that have placed them at the top of the ranks. With continued efforts on expansion, product development and personal involvement to community affairs and issues, Subway will remain to be number one in the hearts of millions.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
