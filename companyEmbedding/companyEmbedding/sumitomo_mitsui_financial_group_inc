Corporate Social Responsibility











Human Resources

















SMFG and its Group companies strive to create the kind of work environment in which every employee feels proud and is able to develop his or her full potential and capabilities. To that end, we implement numerous initiatives geared toward building a workforce of professionals equipped with extensive expertise, creating a corporate culture that derives strength from diversity, and raising employee awareness regarding rights of the individual.

Five Goals of SMBC's Human Resources Development

1. To develop professional and specialized employees who can provide our clients with highly valued products and services.
2. To maintain and strengthen our sound business management enabling SMBC to globally compete in the market.
3. To cultivate the kind of corporate culture which encourages values of forward-looking, creative attitudes and mutual cooperation.
4. To be conscious of the social responsibilities of the Group, and cultivate the kind of corporate culture that contributes to the sound development of society.
5. To encourage employees to respect their individuality based on an understanding of diversity, and personal fulfillment.


Training Employees with Specialized Professional Skills
To develop professional and specialized employees who can provide our clients with highly valued products and services, we are further strengthening the training systems in respective Group companies.
				From April 2013, eight major SMFG companies (SMBC,  SMFL, SMBC Nikko Securities, SMBC Friend Securities, Sumitomo Mitsui Card,  Cedyna, SMBC Consumer Finance, and JRI) are conducting joint training seminars  for their newly-hired employees, designed to provide them with a more in-depth  understanding of the overall Group vision and management policy, and also to  more fully encourage them to see themselves as part of Team SMFG.
				Further, we conduct �SMFG joint training seminars� for executive managers.
				

Creating a corporate culture which derives strength from diversity
SMFG is creating a workplace that enables employees with diverse backgrounds to excel, regardless of gender, nationality and other individual differences.  In April 2008, the Diversity and Inclusion Department was established in the Human Resources Department at SMBC, and other initiatives were implemented for creating the kind of corporate culture which derives its strength from diversity.  To that end, we operate an employee support program designed to help our people maintain a proper work-life balance. Meanwhile, all companies of the Group have adopted programs offering parental leave arrangements, time off for taking care of ill family, and reduced working hours.
In 2013, SMFG was designated a "Nadeshiko Brand", an accolade granted to companies that exhibit top-notch performance in terms of encouraging active participation of women in the workplace.




"Nadeshiko Brand" designation is awarded to listed companies deemed to have maintained a strong track record of encouraging women's participation in the workplace, on the basis of joint selection by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). In February 2013, the accolade was ultimately granted to 17 companies regarded as having achieved sound financial performance, from an initial pool of some 70 first-section TSE companies selected previously on the basis of scoring on excellence in two fronts: 1. their career support for women, and 2. assistance they provide toward enabling an adequate work-life balance.






Initiatives on Human Rights
SMFG participates in the "United Nations Global Compact," and also endorses and supports its 10 principles in the areas of human rights, labor standards, environment and anti-corruption measures.
Each Group company is implementing measures to further enhance awareness of individual human rights by organizing human rights awareness study sessions and inviting employees to reflect and come up with an individual human rights statement.



TOPICS
Human Rights Due Diligence
Participation in the Human Rights Due Diligence Workshop
SMBC takes part in the Nippon CSR Consortium's Human Rights Due Diligence Workshop, held amid a business environment where it is becoming ever more important that companies extend consideration to international CSR guidelines on human rights issues prescribed under such directives as the UN Framework on Human Rights, ISO 26000, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.
Caux Round Table Japan hosts the workshop sessions with the aim of encouraging Japanese companies to pursue CSR practices that will bolster their competitiveness.
SMBC's participation in the forum enables it to explore potential options and look into approaches that can be pursued in regard to human rights issues going forward.


Achieving Healthy and Fulfilling Lifestyles
SMFG companies pursue numerous initiatives that give rise to safe and pleasant workplace environments, and furthermore help employees achieve healthier and more fulfilling lives.
SMFG companies also forge sound management-worker relations through efforts that include holding regular discussions with respect to labor conditions and human resource practices.
Please refer to CSR Report for details.

Sumitomo Mitsui to Expand Overseas




Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. plans to add about 250 positions to its securities business abroad over the next three years to boost investment banking and make up for slumping loan profitability at home.The Tokyo-based bank will increase overseas headcount at its SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. unit from the current 500 by hiring and redeploying staff including bankers who can underwrite bond and stock sales and advise on mergers, said Narutoshi Terauchi, general manager of planning at Sumitomo Mitsui’s international business department.“We plan to be flexible in hiring specialists at each of our offices around the world,” Terauchi said in an interview in Tokyo last week. He expects gross profit from the securities business in the U.S. and Europe will climb to about 50 billion yen ($440 million) by March 2020 from around 30 billion yen in the year ended March. 




Japan’s biggest banks are expanding abroad and diversifying operations as record-low interest rates crimp earnings from domestic lending. Sumitomo Mitsui was a relative latecomer compared with peers Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. when it began developing its international securities business in 2010.“Mizuho is already performing well in its securities business, and Sumitomo Mitsui has some potential to catch up,” said Michael Makdad, a bank analyst in Tokyo at Haitong International Securities Group Ltd. “It’s a good move, but I won’t say it’s successful until I see the fruits.”SMBC Nikko will seek to work on more capital markets deals and mergers by tapping the lending unit’s corporate clients, Terauchi said. The move follows an organizational overhaul in April in which Sumitomo Mitsui formed four units -- retail, wholesale, international and global markets -- to improve cooperation and speed up decision-making across the group.Bond Underwriting“With customers where the bank is providing credit we want to make sure we capture as much of the profit that can be generated from that customer -- be it securities, currency or derivatives,” Terauchi said. “The strongest synergy with commercial banking is in bonds, so we want to expand this business.”Sumitomo Mitsui is ranked 19th among underwriters of U.S. investment grade debt this year, compared with 17th for all of 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. MUFG is 13th and Mizuho is 15th. For global cross-border mergers advisory, Sumitomo Mitsui is 36th, up from 66th last year, the data show.




Group President Takeshi Kunibe said in a May interview that Sumitomo Mitsui needs to expand abroad to maintain annual profit of 700 billion yen, given the squeeze on loan margins. Relatively strong economic growth in the U.S. is the best opportunity for Japan’s second-largest lender by market value to do this, he said.In Europe, similar to its efforts in the U.S., Sumitomo Mitsui is seeking to get its banking and brokerage operations to work more closely together, Terauchi said. This month, the company announced plans to open banking and securities units in Frankfurt to secure business after the U.K. eventually leaves the European Union. It will also set up a branch in London.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
