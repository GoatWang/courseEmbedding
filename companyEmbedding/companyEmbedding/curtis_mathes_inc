Curtis Mathes, Inc is a North American electronics retailer initially based in Garland, Texas and specializing in the sale of private label brand electronics and repair services. It manufactured its own brand of televisions in Athens, Texas until July 31, 1982; ten years later, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and reorganization which allowed it to stay in business and use future earnings to pay off creditors. The company is now based in Frisco, Texas.
Known for its commercials touting its televisions as the "most expensive television set in America, and darn well worth it", the company was credited with introducing longer warranties to electronics retailing. [1]

History[edit]
Early products[edit]
The Curtis Mathes Corporation started in 1919 as Connor and Mathes, a manufacturer and retailer of automobile and tractor parts. By the late 1920s, the company moved into the air conditioning industry. It also manufactured wooden cabinets and eventually furniture, acquiring Hub Furniture in 1942. The leading product through the 30s and 40s were electrical fans, many styles built into custom cabinets and permanent-type window fans. In the early 50s the company added a "central" or "attic fan" to its inventory. It pulled air from all open windows into the attic where it also ventilated the attic making the house much cooler.
As compressors were commercially introduced in the late 40s, Curtis Mathes' Fort Worth factory began making a wide variety of compressors that could be used in cars or buildings. Leonard L. Northrup, Jr. became one of the leading distributors of Curtis Mathes Products including developing and selling an add-on air conditioning unit first used in Cadillacs.
By the late 1940s, the Curtis Mathes Company had diversified into radios, having developed the large centerpiece radio for the living room to an artform. It was therefore logical that this approach would work in televisions as well.
Televisions[edit]
The Curtis Mathes Corporation was founded in 1957 and shortly thereafter entered the television industry, founding plants in Tarrant and Dallas Counties and in Athens, Texas, eventually moving most of its manufacturing to a huge Athens facility. From 1968 to 1988 it was the only fully American-owned electronics firm and the only American television manufacturer.
In the late 1960s, Leonard L. Northrup, Jr. bought a controlling interest in Donmark Corporation, a manufacturer of residential air conditioning and heating equipment from his lifelong friend Curtis Mathes, Sr. as Curtis Mathes moved toward electronics.
During the next few years Curtis Mathes worked to design a modular TV and modular TV parts and chassis, so that warranty service would involve quickly switching a part, tube, tuner or picture tube. These all had snap-in connectors and were held in place by brackets instead of solder or screws. He envisioned a TV that would never require costly repairs, and early on started offering a 4-year warranty on picture tube, parts and labor.
By the mid-70 s and the advent of solid state electronics, Mathes had achieved results. The TV consisted of 11 parts: 7 circuit boards, a tuner, a picture tube and a transformer, plus the cabinet. A repairman carried all ten electronic parts in his truck and a repair call seldom lasted more than 20 minutes. In home the fee was $20.00; in the shop the service was free.
Curtis Mathes TVs that were used for rentals (such as Colortyme) were sometimes rebranded "Rutherford".
After Curtis Mathes Jr.[edit]
On June 2, 1983, its second chairman, George Curtis Mathes Jr, 54, was one of 23 passengers killed in the Air Canada Flight 797 fire. The company then began to decline, going from a peak of 5000 employees and seven manufacturing facilities to about 50 employees in 1988 when it was sold to Enhanced Electronics. At the time of this sale, it was the last remaining fully U.S.-owned electronics company.
For a time, the company sold equipment sourced from Matsushita, Pioneer, Thomson, Samsung, Daewoo, Toshiba, and other manufacturers.
2000s[edit]
In the late 1990s to early 2000s, the Curtis Mathes brand became an in-house brand for the KMart discount chain. As of late 2007, Curtis Mathes had re-emerged with products marketed at several discount retailers such as Wal-Mart, Sam's Club, Meijer and Target. Beginning in 2013, Curtis Mathes expanded its brand portfolio to step into the LED lighting market.

Curtis Mathes, Inc is a North American electronics retailer initially based in Garland, Texas and specializing in the sale of private label brand electronics and repair services. It manufactured its own brand of televisions in Athens, Texas until July 31, 1982; ten years later, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and reorganization which allowed it to stay in business and use future earnings to pay off creditors. The company is now based in Frisco, Texas.
Known for its commercials touting its televisions as the "most expensive television set in America, and darn well worth it", the company was credited with introducing longer warranties to electronics retailing. [1]

History[edit]
Early products[edit]
The Curtis Mathes Corporation started in 1919 as Connor and Mathes, a manufacturer and retailer of automobile and tractor parts. By the late 1920s, the company moved into the air conditioning industry. It also manufactured wooden cabinets and eventually furniture, acquiring Hub Furniture in 1942. The leading product through the 30s and 40s were electrical fans, many styles built into custom cabinets and permanent-type window fans. In the early 50s the company added a "central" or "attic fan" to its inventory. It pulled air from all open windows into the attic where it also ventilated the attic making the house much cooler.
As compressors were commercially introduced in the late 40s, Curtis Mathes' Fort Worth factory began making a wide variety of compressors that could be used in cars or buildings. Leonard L. Northrup, Jr. became one of the leading distributors of Curtis Mathes Products including developing and selling an add-on air conditioning unit first used in Cadillacs.
By the late 1940s, the Curtis Mathes Company had diversified into radios, having developed the large centerpiece radio for the living room to an artform. It was therefore logical that this approach would work in televisions as well.
Televisions[edit]
The Curtis Mathes Corporation was founded in 1957 and shortly thereafter entered the television industry, founding plants in Tarrant and Dallas Counties and in Athens, Texas, eventually moving most of its manufacturing to a huge Athens facility. From 1968 to 1988 it was the only fully American-owned electronics firm and the only American television manufacturer.
In the late 1960s, Leonard L. Northrup, Jr. bought a controlling interest in Donmark Corporation, a manufacturer of residential air conditioning and heating equipment from his lifelong friend Curtis Mathes, Sr. as Curtis Mathes moved toward electronics.
During the next few years Curtis Mathes worked to design a modular TV and modular TV parts and chassis, so that warranty service would involve quickly switching a part, tube, tuner or picture tube. These all had snap-in connectors and were held in place by brackets instead of solder or screws. He envisioned a TV that would never require costly repairs, and early on started offering a 4-year warranty on picture tube, parts and labor.
By the mid-70 s and the advent of solid state electronics, Mathes had achieved results. The TV consisted of 11 parts: 7 circuit boards, a tuner, a picture tube and a transformer, plus the cabinet. A repairman carried all ten electronic parts in his truck and a repair call seldom lasted more than 20 minutes. In home the fee was $20.00; in the shop the service was free.
Curtis Mathes TVs that were used for rentals (such as Colortyme) were sometimes rebranded "Rutherford".
After Curtis Mathes Jr.[edit]
On June 2, 1983, its second chairman, George Curtis Mathes Jr, 54, was one of 23 passengers killed in the Air Canada Flight 797 fire. The company then began to decline, going from a peak of 5000 employees and seven manufacturing facilities to about 50 employees in 1988 when it was sold to Enhanced Electronics. At the time of this sale, it was the last remaining fully U.S.-owned electronics company.
For a time, the company sold equipment sourced from Matsushita, Pioneer, Thomson, Samsung, Daewoo, Toshiba, and other manufacturers.
2000s[edit]
In the late 1990s to early 2000s, the Curtis Mathes brand became an in-house brand for the KMart discount chain. As of late 2007, Curtis Mathes had re-emerged with products marketed at several discount retailers such as Wal-Mart, Sam's Club, Meijer and Target. Beginning in 2013, Curtis Mathes expanded its brand portfolio to step into the LED lighting market.

Curtis Mathes, Inc is a North American electronics retailer initially based in Garland, Texas and specializing in the sale of private label brand electronics and repair services. It manufactured its own brand of televisions in Athens, Texas until July 31, 1982; ten years later, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and reorganization which allowed it to stay in business and use future earnings to pay off creditors. The company is now based in Frisco, Texas.
Known for its commercials touting its televisions as the "most expensive television set in America, and darn well worth it", the company was credited with introducing longer warranties to electronics retailing. [1]

History[edit]
Early products[edit]
The Curtis Mathes Corporation started in 1919 as Connor and Mathes, a manufacturer and retailer of automobile and tractor parts. By the late 1920s, the company moved into the air conditioning industry. It also manufactured wooden cabinets and eventually furniture, acquiring Hub Furniture in 1942. The leading product through the 30s and 40s were electrical fans, many styles built into custom cabinets and permanent-type window fans. In the early 50s the company added a "central" or "attic fan" to its inventory. It pulled air from all open windows into the attic where it also ventilated the attic making the house much cooler.
As compressors were commercially introduced in the late 40s, Curtis Mathes' Fort Worth factory began making a wide variety of compressors that could be used in cars or buildings. Leonard L. Northrup, Jr. became one of the leading distributors of Curtis Mathes Products including developing and selling an add-on air conditioning unit first used in Cadillacs.
By the late 1940s, the Curtis Mathes Company had diversified into radios, having developed the large centerpiece radio for the living room to an artform. It was therefore logical that this approach would work in televisions as well.
Televisions[edit]
The Curtis Mathes Corporation was founded in 1957 and shortly thereafter entered the television industry, founding plants in Tarrant and Dallas Counties and in Athens, Texas, eventually moving most of its manufacturing to a huge Athens facility. From 1968 to 1988 it was the only fully American-owned electronics firm and the only American television manufacturer.
In the late 1960s, Leonard L. Northrup, Jr. bought a controlling interest in Donmark Corporation, a manufacturer of residential air conditioning and heating equipment from his lifelong friend Curtis Mathes, Sr. as Curtis Mathes moved toward electronics.
During the next few years Curtis Mathes worked to design a modular TV and modular TV parts and chassis, so that warranty service would involve quickly switching a part, tube, tuner or picture tube. These all had snap-in connectors and were held in place by brackets instead of solder or screws. He envisioned a TV that would never require costly repairs, and early on started offering a 4-year warranty on picture tube, parts and labor.
By the mid-70 s and the advent of solid state electronics, Mathes had achieved results. The TV consisted of 11 parts: 7 circuit boards, a tuner, a picture tube and a transformer, plus the cabinet. A repairman carried all ten electronic parts in his truck and a repair call seldom lasted more than 20 minutes. In home the fee was $20.00; in the shop the service was free.
Curtis Mathes TVs that were used for rentals (such as Colortyme) were sometimes rebranded "Rutherford".
After Curtis Mathes Jr.[edit]
On June 2, 1983, its second chairman, George Curtis Mathes Jr, 54, was one of 23 passengers killed in the Air Canada Flight 797 fire. The company then began to decline, going from a peak of 5000 employees and seven manufacturing facilities to about 50 employees in 1988 when it was sold to Enhanced Electronics. At the time of this sale, it was the last remaining fully U.S.-owned electronics company.
For a time, the company sold equipment sourced from Matsushita, Pioneer, Thomson, Samsung, Daewoo, Toshiba, and other manufacturers.
2000s[edit]
In the late 1990s to early 2000s, the Curtis Mathes brand became an in-house brand for the KMart discount chain. As of late 2007, Curtis Mathes had re-emerged with products marketed at several discount retailers such as Wal-Mart, Sam's Club, Meijer and Target. Beginning in 2013, Curtis Mathes expanded its brand portfolio to step into the LED lighting market.

LED MR16-GU5.3







LED BR30 9W (65W) 







LED A19 Lamp 11W (75 Watt) Dimmable







4W (40W) FLAME-TIP, BLUNT-TIP,  CLEAR & FROSTED 







What our Customers say



Great bulbs!
"They are great for the price. I have these bulbs in warm white and they set the room off perfectly."
Drew 14


Perfect lighting
"Perfect lighting replacement for 40 watt incandescent. The light is soft and even nicer than incandescents."
Tagman


Great replacements around makeup mirrors
"We used these to replace 160 40w incandescent lamps around our makeup mirrors. The results were great. The color temp made the actors and designers happy, the low heat made the actors even happier. Very even light in all directions eliminated shadows. Very pleased with this change over."
Hammer


Great bulb when 60w equiv. is too much.
"Most of the bulbs in my house have been switched over, save for a few fixtures that require *less* light than the 60w equiv. LEDs I have been buying. It turns out that those few fixtures really bother me now when the kids leave them on, so when I saw the 40w bulbs I knew I had to buy some.
These are perfect for my entry way light. With the two 60w equiv LEDs it was blindingly bright. With the two 40w equiv it is still slightly more than would be perfect, but it's better a tad bright than a tad dim.
These were still too bright to use for my triple bulb vanity fixture, but perfect for the entry way.
No issues, highly recommended."
Bronson J

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
