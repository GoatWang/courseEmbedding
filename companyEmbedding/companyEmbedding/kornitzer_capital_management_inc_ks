Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: $78.00 (0.08% upside)

History | Performance | Our Research Approach | Our Team
 
 
 
 
 

 
 




KCM is consistently ranked as one of the top 5 fee-based investment advisers in Kansas City, by assets under management, as ranked by the Kansas City Business Journal.
In 2016 we held the #3 spot.

 
 



History
 
 
 


KCM is a privately-held, employee-owned corporation, founded in 1989 by John C. Kornitzer. Prior to founding KCM, Mr. Kornitzer was Vice President of Investments for Employers Reinsurance Corp (ERC). He joined ERC in 1978, and managed corporate assets for the company through acquisitions by Getty Oil, Texaco and finally General Electric Investment Corporation (GEIC), where he ran investment portfolios for ERC and GEIC until founding KCM.
The firm was created to manage customized portfolios for private clients and institutions. We continue to provide client-focused, personalized money management through our Kornitzer Private Client Services (KPCS) group, and pension, corporate, and foundation separate account management through our institutional services group.
With our approach to lifetime asset management, KCM helps clients achieve their long-term financial goals throughout the various investment stages including accumulation, preservation, and retirement.
Over the years, based on client request or need, we formed companies and alliances to better serve specific niches.
 
 
 


 
 


Buffalo Funds
KCM founded this fund family in 1994 and continues to serve as its manager. The family of no-load mutual funds consists of 10 publicly registered stock and bond funds and represents a full range of capitalization size and growth and income options.
 


 

Great Plains Trust Company
GPTC is an independent, Kansas-chartered trust company founded in 1994. GPTC provides trust and investment management services to over 2,000 pension plans, personal trust customers, individually-managed accounts, and IRA holders. GPTC utilizes KCM as an investment advisor in the management of all of its investments, including Common and Collective Funds.
 


 
 
 
 
 

 
 



Our working philosophy:

Integrity and honesty in everything we do.
Independent thinking and creativity.
Hard work and attention to detail.
Pride of ownership.
Investing alongside our clients.


 
 



Performance
 
 
 


We take pride in our long-term track record. We work with our clients to set realistic investment objectives, and then endeavor to meet or exceed those objectives without taking undue risks. Historical performance of the firm's various investment strategies is available upon request. Regardless of the investment strategy, our investment professionals use the same fundamentally sound research process that has served our firm so well in the past when positioning a portfolio for the future.
Lastly, we recognize that fees and taxes play an important role in determining long-term performance, so we strive to keep our fee structure competitive and tax consequences to a minimum.
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 



We are dedicated to generating a majority of our research in-house.
 
 



Our Research Approach
 
 
 


Research is the cornerstone for each of the Kornitzer Capital Management investment disciplines. Our research is comprehensive and a vast majority is internally generated. Over the years, this process has been molded into a disciplined practice of discovery, investigation, and implementation. This proprietary analysis has been the key driver of our solid long-term results - not market timing or interest rate forecasting.
We pride ourselves on being able to find, analyze, and critique information on the companies we invest in. We use a variety of fundamental evaluation methods while dissecting vast amounts of data, visiting companies as well as their competitors and suppliers, and writing formal research reports. Lastly, we build proprietary financial models and use multiple valuation methodologies to derive a security’s intrinsic value.
After the completion of extensive analysis the recommendation is evaluated in both informal and formal investment meetings. The security is subject to intense group scrutiny. Once all discussion is complete then the group takes action.
KCM’s commitment to research enables its investment professionals to think independently and invest with confidence for the long term, especially when short-term sentiment runs the other way. Our belief is that periods of great pessimism often generate the best investment opportunities.
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 



KCM's lead portfolio managers have, on average, more than 20 years of research and portfolio management experience. Over 90% of our portfolio managers and research analysts hold the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation.
 
 



Our Team
 
 
 


Our approach to people is simple: hire the very best, and expect the very best from them. We only hire experienced professionals with proven analytical skills. Kornitzer Capital Management has attracted a talented team of investment professionals by providing an ethical working environment and the challenges, opportunities and rewards that are part of working at a growing firm.

About KCM
Kornitzer Capital Management is a full service investment management firm managing assets for institutions, mutual funds and private clients. Institutional clients benefit from our separately managed accounts, tailored to investment policy guidelines and tax requirements. With our approach to lifetime asset management, KCM helps our private clients achieve their long-term financial goals throughout the various investment stages including accumulation, preservation, and retirement.
History | Performance | Our Research Approach | Our Team
 
 
 
 
 

 
 




KCM is consistently ranked as one of the top 5 fee-based investment advisers in Kansas City, by assets under management, as ranked by the Kansas City Business Journal.
In 2016 we held the #3 spot.

 
 



History
 
 
 


KCM is a privately-held, employee-owned corporation, founded in 1989 by John C. Kornitzer. Prior to founding KCM, Mr. Kornitzer was Vice President of Investments for Employers Reinsurance Corp (ERC). He joined ERC in 1978, and managed corporate assets for the company through acquisitions by Getty Oil, Texaco and finally General Electric Investment Corporation (GEIC), where he ran investment portfolios for ERC and GEIC until founding KCM.
The firm was created to manage customized portfolios for private clients and institutions. We continue to provide client-focused, personalized money management through our Kornitzer Private Client Services (KPCS) group, and pension, corporate, and foundation separate account management through our institutional services group.
With our approach to lifetime asset management, KCM helps clients achieve their long-term financial goals throughout the various investment stages including accumulation, preservation, and retirement.
Over the years, based on client request or need, we formed companies and alliances to better serve specific niches.
 
 
 


 
 


Buffalo Funds
KCM founded this fund family in 1994 and continues to serve as its manager. The family of no-load mutual funds consists of 10 publicly registered stock and bond funds and represents a full range of capitalization size and growth and income options.
 


 

Great Plains Trust Company
GPTC is an independent, Kansas-chartered trust company founded in 1994. GPTC provides trust and investment management services to over 2,000 pension plans, personal trust customers, individually-managed accounts, and IRA holders. GPTC utilizes KCM as an investment advisor in the management of all of its investments, including Common and Collective Funds.
 


 
 
 
 
 

 
 



Our working philosophy:

Integrity and honesty in everything we do.
Independent thinking and creativity.
Hard work and attention to detail.
Pride of ownership.
Investing alongside our clients.


 
 



Performance
 
 
 


We take pride in our long-term track record. We work with our clients to set realistic investment objectives, and then endeavor to meet or exceed those objectives without taking undue risks. Historical performance of the firm's various investment strategies is available upon request. Regardless of the investment strategy, our investment professionals use the same fundamentally sound research process that has served our firm so well in the past when positioning a portfolio for the future.
Lastly, we recognize that fees and taxes play an important role in determining long-term performance, so we strive to keep our fee structure competitive and tax consequences to a minimum.
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 



We are dedicated to generating a majority of our research in-house.
 
 



Our Research Approach
 
 
 


Research is the cornerstone for each of the Kornitzer Capital Management investment disciplines. Our research is comprehensive and a vast majority is internally generated. Over the years, this process has been molded into a disciplined practice of discovery, investigation, and implementation. This proprietary analysis has been the key driver of our solid long-term results - not market timing or interest rate forecasting.
We pride ourselves on being able to find, analyze, and critique information on the companies we invest in. We use a variety of fundamental evaluation methods while dissecting vast amounts of data, visiting companies as well as their competitors and suppliers, and writing formal research reports. Lastly, we build proprietary financial models and use multiple valuation methodologies to derive a security’s intrinsic value.
After the completion of extensive analysis the recommendation is evaluated in both informal and formal investment meetings. The security is subject to intense group scrutiny. Once all discussion is complete then the group takes action.
KCM’s commitment to research enables its investment professionals to think independently and invest with confidence for the long term, especially when short-term sentiment runs the other way. Our belief is that periods of great pessimism often generate the best investment opportunities.
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 



KCM's lead portfolio managers have, on average, more than 20 years of research and portfolio management experience. Over 90% of our portfolio managers and research analysts hold the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation.
 
 



Our Team
 
 
 


Our approach to people is simple: hire the very best, and expect the very best from them. We only hire experienced professionals with proven analytical skills. Kornitzer Capital Management has attracted a talented team of investment professionals by providing an ethical working environment and the challenges, opportunities and rewards that are part of working at a growing firm.

Institutional Client Services
Advisors, consultants, and institutions utilize our separate account management to employ certain strategies and to accommodate investment policy restrictions, cash management, and accounting/tax planning. Separate accounts allow a greater degree of control and enable clients to capitalize on (or avoid) investments in specific sectors, companies, or screens.

KCM manages separate accounts for foundations, pensions, trusts, family offices, endowment funds, small businesses, and Fortune 500 companies – directly, and through open architecture platforms.
KCM claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®).  Click here to read our GIPS verification letter.

 
 



Investment Strategies
 
 
 


Portfolios can be managed in a similar manner to each of our value, growth, international, or fixed income strategies, or tailor-made to meet the needs of the client. These portfolios are classified as strategy portfolios.
All of our investment strategies have a long-term investment horizon. Your institution's needs and goals will determine which strategy, or combination of strategies, best suits your investment needs.
 
 
 


Growth Investing
Purchasing stocks of companies we believe will grow much faster than GDP over the next three to five years.
 
 

Value Investing
Purchasing stocks of stable, high-quality, dividend-paying companies.
 
 
 


Fixed Income Investing
Purchasing corporate, convertible, and municipal bonds.
 
 

International Investing
Purchasing international equities that provide exposure to developed and developing economies around the world.
 
 
 


 
 


Research Approach
 
Your account will be directed by one or more of the same portfolio managers who manage our mutual funds. KCM’s portfolio managers meet with corporate management teams, building financial models and writing reports on each company that we own in the portfolio. Our in-house research team helps us separate Wall Street’s noise from what we believe is important for long-term investing.
 
 
 


 
 


Client Service
 
A relationship manager will be assigned to your account to assure a high level of personal service. Our relationship managers can provide periodic presentations, due diligence, portfolio and performance data, and research as necessary. The portfolio managers are also accessible to clients; they are available to answers questions about the management or performance of the funds.
 
 
 


 
 


Results
 
We seek to achieve exceptional long term investment performance. This is accomplished by maintaining a consistent, repeatable investment discipline, providing a competitive value in the form of reasonable fees and always acting in the best interest of the client.
 
 
 
 
 
 




"We implement plans that help you and your business prosper and continue. We design retirement plans that take care of you, and offer high quality investment options to your employees. We help you prepare for the next generation, or the next owners, so your hard work is preserved."
