            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Ronald Collier and Associates commenced trading in Australia in 1967 having received an appointment to carry out a strategic review of the National Australia Bank's Melbourne properties. In 1970, three separate firms commenced trading in the cities of Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. The eight principals involved, who had each known each other as former employees of Jones Lang Wootton, traded as the Collier Group following a meeting, which took place at The Australia Hotel in September 1976. A few years later, on the 18th May 1979, Colliers International Pty Ltd was first registered.
In 1985, American and Canadian firms joined Colliers international, and by 1986, its Asia-Pacific operations had reached 20 markets. In 1990, Colliers began to enter markets in central Europe and Latin America. In 1991 Jardine Matheson purchased 50% of the Asia Pacific business thereby being branded Colliers Jardine. In 1997 Colliers Macaulay Nicolls acquired 50% of the Asia pacific business by acquiring the shares of the original Australian shareholders.
In 2004, Colliers' parent company, FirstService Corporation, invested in Colliers Macaulay Nicolls, the predecessor of FirstService REA and the largest member of Colliers International. FirstService REA subsequently invested in several North American-based firms whose operations focused on various commercial real estate service specialties.[5] Among these investments were:

PGP Valuation Inc.: A commercial and industrial real estate appraisal firm with 250 associates worldwide, PGP Valuation conducts market studies, consulting assignments, appraisal reviews and feasibility analyses.[6]
PKF Hotel and Hospitality Consulting: PKR is an association of independent firms in hospitality consulting, with 15,000 specialized hotel experts, auditors and tax consultants worldwide.[7] This investment (PKF Consulting USA) was later sold to CBRE Group in July 2014.[8]
MHPM Project Leaders: In 2007, Colliers Macaulay Nicolls, an affiliate in the Colliers International network (and predecessor to FirstService REA), acquired a majority interest in Canada's largest project management firm, MHPM Project Managers.[9]

Recent geographically-based investments include:

London (October 2009): Colliers International made a major investment in Colliers CRE, a London-based real estate services enterprise with offices in the UK, Ireland and Spain.[10][11] Colliers CRE subsequently rebranded as Colliers UK.
New York City: New York-based FirstService Williams, formerly known as GVA Williams, adopted the brand of Colliers International and today functions as the entity's "tri-state" hub (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut). The office consists of more than 300 brokers.[12]
Chicago (April 2010): Colliers International completed a significant investment in one of Chicago's largest commercial real estate services firms, Colliers Bennett & Kahnweiler (Colliers B&K), which now serves as the enterprise's Midwestern regional hub and operates as Colliers International.[13]

Other expansions include:

Cincinnati, Ohio (April 2010): The firm added one of Cincinnati's largest commercial real estate firms, West Shell Commercial.[14]
Nashville, Tennessee (April 2010): The Nashville commercial real estate brokerage firm known as NAI Nashville joined the firm [15]
Columbus, Ohio (May 2010): Commercial real estate firm Adena Commercial ended its ten-year relationship with Grubb & Ellis to affiliate with Colliers International, effective May 1, 2010.[16]
Grand Rapids, Michigan (May 2010): Grubb & Ellis Paramount Commerce, one of West Michigan's largest commercial real estate brokerages, changed its affiliation to Colliers effective May 1.[17]
Long Island, New York (June 2010): The firm added Sutton & Edwards, based in Lake Success and Ronkonkama. Founded in 1962, the firm provides office, industrial, retail, land, medical office and investment property brokerage services.[18]

In April 2010, Colliers and FirstService Real Estate Advisors combined their operations and global real estate services platforms, and began operation under the unified brand of Colliers International.[19]
In June 2015, Colliers Colliers International and FirstService Corporation announced the completion of their separation into two independent, publicly traded companies – Colliers International Group Inc. and FirstService Corporation.[20]
Business model[edit]
According to CoStar, the firm utilizes a "partnership model...- an entrepreneurial, locally-grounded company combined with the strength, reach, accountability and versatility of a global firm". FirstService REA, formed by property services firm FirstService Corp. in 2005 after buying Collier International's largest affiliate, now owns about 70% of Colliers International globally, and retains worldwide rights to the Colliers International name. The remainder of equity in Colliers is retained by local market partners." [21]
Amid a global, industry-wide consolidation among commercial real estate brokerages, industry watchers have noted the Colliers International expansion has run counter to this trend.[22][23]
Rankings and Honors[edit]
According to the April 2010 issue of National Real Estate Investor (NREI), Colliers International ranked second in the magazine's annual ranking of the top twenty-five brokerages in the global real estate industry. The ranking is based on the combined dollar value of leasing transactions and investment sales globally in 2009, which totaled $53.8 billion for Colliers International.[24]
The NREI survey also found that Colliers International had posted an increase of more than 28 percent over its 2008 ranking, when it conducted leasing transactions and investment sales volume totaling $42 billion and ranked fifth.
In March 2010, the annual Lipsey Survey of the top 25 brands in the commercial real estate industry worldwide ranked Colliers International in the #2 position. The firm had held the third-place position in the Lipsey Survey since 2004, after rising from sixth place in 2002 to fourth in 2003.[25]
In 2010, Colliers International was included in the Global Outsourcing 100 list by the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) for the fifth consecutive year.[26]

History[edit]
Ronald Collier and Associates commenced trading in Australia in 1967 having received an appointment to carry out a strategic review of the National Australia Bank's Melbourne properties. In 1970, three separate firms commenced trading in the cities of Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. The eight principals involved, who had each known each other as former employees of Jones Lang Wootton, traded as the Collier Group following a meeting, which took place at The Australia Hotel in September 1976. A few years later, on the 18th May 1979, Colliers International Pty Ltd was first registered.
In 1985, American and Canadian firms joined Colliers international, and by 1986, its Asia-Pacific operations had reached 20 markets. In 1990, Colliers began to enter markets in central Europe and Latin America. In 1991 Jardine Matheson purchased 50% of the Asia Pacific business thereby being branded Colliers Jardine. In 1997 Colliers Macaulay Nicolls acquired 50% of the Asia pacific business by acquiring the shares of the original Australian shareholders.
In 2004, Colliers' parent company, FirstService Corporation, invested in Colliers Macaulay Nicolls, the predecessor of FirstService REA and the largest member of Colliers International. FirstService REA subsequently invested in several North American-based firms whose operations focused on various commercial real estate service specialties.[5] Among these investments were:

PGP Valuation Inc.: A commercial and industrial real estate appraisal firm with 250 associates worldwide, PGP Valuation conducts market studies, consulting assignments, appraisal reviews and feasibility analyses.[6]
PKF Hotel and Hospitality Consulting: PKR is an association of independent firms in hospitality consulting, with 15,000 specialized hotel experts, auditors and tax consultants worldwide.[7] This investment (PKF Consulting USA) was later sold to CBRE Group in July 2014.[8]
MHPM Project Leaders: In 2007, Colliers Macaulay Nicolls, an affiliate in the Colliers International network (and predecessor to FirstService REA), acquired a majority interest in Canada's largest project management firm, MHPM Project Managers.[9]

Recent geographically-based investments include:

London (October 2009): Colliers International made a major investment in Colliers CRE, a London-based real estate services enterprise with offices in the UK, Ireland and Spain.[10][11] Colliers CRE subsequently rebranded as Colliers UK.
New York City: New York-based FirstService Williams, formerly known as GVA Williams, adopted the brand of Colliers International and today functions as the entity's "tri-state" hub (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut). The office consists of more than 300 brokers.[12]
Chicago (April 2010): Colliers International completed a significant investment in one of Chicago's largest commercial real estate services firms, Colliers Bennett & Kahnweiler (Colliers B&K), which now serves as the enterprise's Midwestern regional hub and operates as Colliers International.[13]

Other expansions include:

Cincinnati, Ohio (April 2010): The firm added one of Cincinnati's largest commercial real estate firms, West Shell Commercial.[14]
Nashville, Tennessee (April 2010): The Nashville commercial real estate brokerage firm known as NAI Nashville joined the firm [15]
Columbus, Ohio (May 2010): Commercial real estate firm Adena Commercial ended its ten-year relationship with Grubb & Ellis to affiliate with Colliers International, effective May 1, 2010.[16]
Grand Rapids, Michigan (May 2010): Grubb & Ellis Paramount Commerce, one of West Michigan's largest commercial real estate brokerages, changed its affiliation to Colliers effective May 1.[17]
Long Island, New York (June 2010): The firm added Sutton & Edwards, based in Lake Success and Ronkonkama. Founded in 1962, the firm provides office, industrial, retail, land, medical office and investment property brokerage services.[18]

In April 2010, Colliers and FirstService Real Estate Advisors combined their operations and global real estate services platforms, and began operation under the unified brand of Colliers International.[19]
In June 2015, Colliers Colliers International and FirstService Corporation announced the completion of their separation into two independent, publicly traded companies – Colliers International Group Inc. and FirstService Corporation.[20]
Business model[edit]
According to CoStar, the firm utilizes a "partnership model...- an entrepreneurial, locally-grounded company combined with the strength, reach, accountability and versatility of a global firm". FirstService REA, formed by property services firm FirstService Corp. in 2005 after buying Collier International's largest affiliate, now owns about 70% of Colliers International globally, and retains worldwide rights to the Colliers International name. The remainder of equity in Colliers is retained by local market partners." [21]
Amid a global, industry-wide consolidation among commercial real estate brokerages, industry watchers have noted the Colliers International expansion has run counter to this trend.[22][23]
Rankings and Honors[edit]
According to the April 2010 issue of National Real Estate Investor (NREI), Colliers International ranked second in the magazine's annual ranking of the top twenty-five brokerages in the global real estate industry. The ranking is based on the combined dollar value of leasing transactions and investment sales globally in 2009, which totaled $53.8 billion for Colliers International.[24]
The NREI survey also found that Colliers International had posted an increase of more than 28 percent over its 2008 ranking, when it conducted leasing transactions and investment sales volume totaling $42 billion and ranked fifth.
In March 2010, the annual Lipsey Survey of the top 25 brands in the commercial real estate industry worldwide ranked Colliers International in the #2 position. The firm had held the third-place position in the Lipsey Survey since 2004, after rising from sixth place in 2002 to fourth in 2003.[25]
In 2010, Colliers International was included in the Global Outsourcing 100 list by the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) for the fifth consecutive year.[26]

History[edit]
Ronald Collier and Associates commenced trading in Australia in 1967 having received an appointment to carry out a strategic review of the National Australia Bank's Melbourne properties. In 1970, three separate firms commenced trading in the cities of Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. The eight principals involved, who had each known each other as former employees of Jones Lang Wootton, traded as the Collier Group following a meeting, which took place at The Australia Hotel in September 1976. A few years later, on the 18th May 1979, Colliers International Pty Ltd was first registered.
In 1985, American and Canadian firms joined Colliers international, and by 1986, its Asia-Pacific operations had reached 20 markets. In 1990, Colliers began to enter markets in central Europe and Latin America. In 1991 Jardine Matheson purchased 50% of the Asia Pacific business thereby being branded Colliers Jardine. In 1997 Colliers Macaulay Nicolls acquired 50% of the Asia pacific business by acquiring the shares of the original Australian shareholders.
In 2004, Colliers' parent company, FirstService Corporation, invested in Colliers Macaulay Nicolls, the predecessor of FirstService REA and the largest member of Colliers International. FirstService REA subsequently invested in several North American-based firms whose operations focused on various commercial real estate service specialties.[5] Among these investments were:

PGP Valuation Inc.: A commercial and industrial real estate appraisal firm with 250 associates worldwide, PGP Valuation conducts market studies, consulting assignments, appraisal reviews and feasibility analyses.[6]
PKF Hotel and Hospitality Consulting: PKR is an association of independent firms in hospitality consulting, with 15,000 specialized hotel experts, auditors and tax consultants worldwide.[7] This investment (PKF Consulting USA) was later sold to CBRE Group in July 2014.[8]
MHPM Project Leaders: In 2007, Colliers Macaulay Nicolls, an affiliate in the Colliers International network (and predecessor to FirstService REA), acquired a majority interest in Canada's largest project management firm, MHPM Project Managers.[9]

Recent geographically-based investments include:

London (October 2009): Colliers International made a major investment in Colliers CRE, a London-based real estate services enterprise with offices in the UK, Ireland and Spain.[10][11] Colliers CRE subsequently rebranded as Colliers UK.
New York City: New York-based FirstService Williams, formerly known as GVA Williams, adopted the brand of Colliers International and today functions as the entity's "tri-state" hub (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut). The office consists of more than 300 brokers.[12]
Chicago (April 2010): Colliers International completed a significant investment in one of Chicago's largest commercial real estate services firms, Colliers Bennett & Kahnweiler (Colliers B&K), which now serves as the enterprise's Midwestern regional hub and operates as Colliers International.[13]

Other expansions include:

Cincinnati, Ohio (April 2010): The firm added one of Cincinnati's largest commercial real estate firms, West Shell Commercial.[14]
Nashville, Tennessee (April 2010): The Nashville commercial real estate brokerage firm known as NAI Nashville joined the firm [15]
Columbus, Ohio (May 2010): Commercial real estate firm Adena Commercial ended its ten-year relationship with Grubb & Ellis to affiliate with Colliers International, effective May 1, 2010.[16]
Grand Rapids, Michigan (May 2010): Grubb & Ellis Paramount Commerce, one of West Michigan's largest commercial real estate brokerages, changed its affiliation to Colliers effective May 1.[17]
Long Island, New York (June 2010): The firm added Sutton & Edwards, based in Lake Success and Ronkonkama. Founded in 1962, the firm provides office, industrial, retail, land, medical office and investment property brokerage services.[18]

In April 2010, Colliers and FirstService Real Estate Advisors combined their operations and global real estate services platforms, and began operation under the unified brand of Colliers International.[19]
In June 2015, Colliers Colliers International and FirstService Corporation announced the completion of their separation into two independent, publicly traded companies – Colliers International Group Inc. and FirstService Corporation.[20]
Business model[edit]
According to CoStar, the firm utilizes a "partnership model...- an entrepreneurial, locally-grounded company combined with the strength, reach, accountability and versatility of a global firm". FirstService REA, formed by property services firm FirstService Corp. in 2005 after buying Collier International's largest affiliate, now owns about 70% of Colliers International globally, and retains worldwide rights to the Colliers International name. The remainder of equity in Colliers is retained by local market partners." [21]
Amid a global, industry-wide consolidation among commercial real estate brokerages, industry watchers have noted the Colliers International expansion has run counter to this trend.[22][23]
Rankings and Honors[edit]
According to the April 2010 issue of National Real Estate Investor (NREI), Colliers International ranked second in the magazine's annual ranking of the top twenty-five brokerages in the global real estate industry. The ranking is based on the combined dollar value of leasing transactions and investment sales globally in 2009, which totaled $53.8 billion for Colliers International.[24]
The NREI survey also found that Colliers International had posted an increase of more than 28 percent over its 2008 ranking, when it conducted leasing transactions and investment sales volume totaling $42 billion and ranked fifth.
In March 2010, the annual Lipsey Survey of the top 25 brands in the commercial real estate industry worldwide ranked Colliers International in the #2 position. The firm had held the third-place position in the Lipsey Survey since 2004, after rising from sixth place in 2002 to fourth in 2003.[25]
In 2010, Colliers International was included in the Global Outsourcing 100 list by the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) for the fifth consecutive year.[26]

New York City: New York-based FirstService Williams, formerly known as GVA Williams, adopted the brand of Colliers International and today functions as the entity's "tri-state" hub (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut). The office consists of more than 300 brokers.[12]
Chicago (April 2010): Colliers International completed a significant investment in one of Chicago's largest commercial real estate services firms, Colliers Bennett & Kahnweiler (Colliers B&K), which now serves as the enterprise's Midwestern regional hub and operates as Colliers International.[13]

Other expansions include:

Cincinnati, Ohio (April 2010): The firm added one of Cincinnati's largest commercial real estate firms, West Shell Commercial.[14]
Nashville, Tennessee (April 2010): The Nashville commercial real estate brokerage firm known as NAI Nashville joined the firm [15]
Columbus, Ohio (May 2010): Commercial real estate firm Adena Commercial ended its ten-year relationship with Grubb & Ellis to affiliate with Colliers International, effective May 1, 2010.[16]
Grand Rapids, Michigan (May 2010): Grubb & Ellis Paramount Commerce, one of West Michigan's largest commercial real estate brokerages, changed its affiliation to Colliers effective May 1.[17]
Long Island, New York (June 2010): The firm added Sutton & Edwards, based in Lake Success and Ronkonkama. Founded in 1962, the firm provides office, industrial, retail, land, medical office and investment property brokerage services.[18]

In April 2010, Colliers and FirstService Real Estate Advisors combined their operations and global real estate services platforms, and began operation under the unified brand of Colliers International.[19]
In June 2015, Colliers Colliers International and FirstService Corporation announced the completion of their separation into two independent, publicly traded companies – Colliers International Group Inc. and FirstService Corporation.[20]
Business model[edit]
According to CoStar, the firm utilizes a "partnership model...- an entrepreneurial, locally-grounded company combined with the strength, reach, accountability and versatility of a global firm". FirstService REA, formed by property services firm FirstService Corp. in 2005 after buying Collier International's largest affiliate, now owns about 70% of Colliers International globally, and retains worldwide rights to the Colliers International name. The remainder of equity in Colliers is retained by local market partners." [21]
Amid a global, industry-wide consolidation among commercial real estate brokerages, industry watchers have noted the Colliers International expansion has run counter to this trend.[22][23]
Rankings and Honors[edit]
According to the April 2010 issue of National Real Estate Investor (NREI), Colliers International ranked second in the magazine's annual ranking of the top twenty-five brokerages in the global real estate industry. The ranking is based on the combined dollar value of leasing transactions and investment sales globally in 2009, which totaled $53.8 billion for Colliers International.[24]
The NREI survey also found that Colliers International had posted an increase of more than 28 percent over its 2008 ranking, when it conducted leasing transactions and investment sales volume totaling $42 billion and ranked fifth.
In March 2010, the annual Lipsey Survey of the top 25 brands in the commercial real estate industry worldwide ranked Colliers International in the #2 position. The firm had held the third-place position in the Lipsey Survey since 2004, after rising from sixth place in 2002 to fourth in 2003.[25]
In 2010, Colliers International was included in the Global Outsourcing 100 list by the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) for the fifth consecutive year.[26]

History[edit]
Ronald Collier and Associates commenced trading in Australia in 1967 having received an appointment to carry out a strategic review of the National Australia Bank's Melbourne properties. In 1970, three separate firms commenced trading in the cities of Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. The eight principals involved, who had each known each other as former employees of Jones Lang Wootton, traded as the Collier Group following a meeting, which took place at The Australia Hotel in September 1976. A few years later, on the 18th May 1979, Colliers International Pty Ltd was first registered.
In 1985, American and Canadian firms joined Colliers international, and by 1986, its Asia-Pacific operations had reached 20 markets. In 1990, Colliers began to enter markets in central Europe and Latin America. In 1991 Jardine Matheson purchased 50% of the Asia Pacific business thereby being branded Colliers Jardine. In 1997 Colliers Macaulay Nicolls acquired 50% of the Asia pacific business by acquiring the shares of the original Australian shareholders.
In 2004, Colliers' parent company, FirstService Corporation, invested in Colliers Macaulay Nicolls, the predecessor of FirstService REA and the largest member of Colliers International. FirstService REA subsequently invested in several North American-based firms whose operations focused on various commercial real estate service specialties.[5] Among these investments were:

PGP Valuation Inc.: A commercial and industrial real estate appraisal firm with 250 associates worldwide, PGP Valuation conducts market studies, consulting assignments, appraisal reviews and feasibility analyses.[6]
PKF Hotel and Hospitality Consulting: PKR is an association of independent firms in hospitality consulting, with 15,000 specialized hotel experts, auditors and tax consultants worldwide.[7] This investment (PKF Consulting USA) was later sold to CBRE Group in July 2014.[8]
MHPM Project Leaders: In 2007, Colliers Macaulay Nicolls, an affiliate in the Colliers International network (and predecessor to FirstService REA), acquired a majority interest in Canada's largest project management firm, MHPM Project Managers.[9]

Recent geographically-based investments include:

London (October 2009): Colliers International made a major investment in Colliers CRE, a London-based real estate services enterprise with offices in the UK, Ireland and Spain.[10][11] Colliers CRE subsequently rebranded as Colliers UK.
New York City: New York-based FirstService Williams, formerly known as GVA Williams, adopted the brand of Colliers International and today functions as the entity's "tri-state" hub (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut). The office consists of more than 300 brokers.[12]
Chicago (April 2010): Colliers International completed a significant investment in one of Chicago's largest commercial real estate services firms, Colliers Bennett & Kahnweiler (Colliers B&K), which now serves as the enterprise's Midwestern regional hub and operates as Colliers International.[13]

Other expansions include:

Cincinnati, Ohio (April 2010): The firm added one of Cincinnati's largest commercial real estate firms, West Shell Commercial.[14]
Nashville, Tennessee (April 2010): The Nashville commercial real estate brokerage firm known as NAI Nashville joined the firm [15]
Columbus, Ohio (May 2010): Commercial real estate firm Adena Commercial ended its ten-year relationship with Grubb & Ellis to affiliate with Colliers International, effective May 1, 2010.[16]
Grand Rapids, Michigan (May 2010): Grubb & Ellis Paramount Commerce, one of West Michigan's largest commercial real estate brokerages, changed its affiliation to Colliers effective May 1.[17]
Long Island, New York (June 2010): The firm added Sutton & Edwards, based in Lake Success and Ronkonkama. Founded in 1962, the firm provides office, industrial, retail, land, medical office and investment property brokerage services.[18]

In April 2010, Colliers and FirstService Real Estate Advisors combined their operations and global real estate services platforms, and began operation under the unified brand of Colliers International.[19]
In June 2015, Colliers Colliers International and FirstService Corporation announced the completion of their separation into two independent, publicly traded companies – Colliers International Group Inc. and FirstService Corporation.[20]
Business model[edit]
According to CoStar, the firm utilizes a "partnership model...- an entrepreneurial, locally-grounded company combined with the strength, reach, accountability and versatility of a global firm". FirstService REA, formed by property services firm FirstService Corp. in 2005 after buying Collier International's largest affiliate, now owns about 70% of Colliers International globally, and retains worldwide rights to the Colliers International name. The remainder of equity in Colliers is retained by local market partners." [21]
Amid a global, industry-wide consolidation among commercial real estate brokerages, industry watchers have noted the Colliers International expansion has run counter to this trend.[22][23]
Rankings and Honors[edit]
According to the April 2010 issue of National Real Estate Investor (NREI), Colliers International ranked second in the magazine's annual ranking of the top twenty-five brokerages in the global real estate industry. The ranking is based on the combined dollar value of leasing transactions and investment sales globally in 2009, which totaled $53.8 billion for Colliers International.[24]
The NREI survey also found that Colliers International had posted an increase of more than 28 percent over its 2008 ranking, when it conducted leasing transactions and investment sales volume totaling $42 billion and ranked fifth.
In March 2010, the annual Lipsey Survey of the top 25 brands in the commercial real estate industry worldwide ranked Colliers International in the #2 position. The firm had held the third-place position in the Lipsey Survey since 2004, after rising from sixth place in 2002 to fourth in 2003.[25]
In 2010, Colliers International was included in the Global Outsourcing 100 list by the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) for the fifth consecutive year.[26]

Colliers International Becomes an Independent Public Company
Colliers Strategically Positioned as a Leading Global, Publicly Traded Commercial Real Estate Firm Operating in 67 Countries
TORONTO and SEATTLE, June 1, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Colliers International Group Inc. (Nasdaq:CIGI) (TSX:CIG) and FirstService Corporation (Nasdaq:FSV) and (TSX:FSV) today announced the completion of their separation into two independent, publicly traded companies – Colliers International Group Inc. ("Colliers") and new FirstService Corporation ("FirstService"). Colliers's shares are expected to begin trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") under symbol CIGI and the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") under symbol CIG on June 2, 2015. The spin-off establishes Colliers' place as one of the leading publicly traded commercial real estate firms in the world.
"The spin-off is a critical and very carefully considered part of our growth strategy that will strengthen our visibility among investors and clients and further accelerate Colliers' evolution in key markets and service areas around the world," said Jay Hennick, Executive Chairman and largest shareholder of Colliers. "Colliers thrived as part of FirstService; its revenues grew from approximately $200 million in 2004 to $1.6 billion in 2014, thanks to an exceptional management team, soundly executed growth strategy, and a disciplined approach to creating shareholder value. The added visibility and flexibility that comes with the spin-off will only further enhance Colliers' reputation as one of the leading advisors to clients across a broad spectrum of property types and services in commercial real estate the world over," he added.
The move gives Colliers more flexibility to pursue a broader variety of growth opportunities including acquisitions and service-line diversification -- all with a view to enhancing global client service and shareholder value. One of the fastest growing commercial real estate firms over the past decade, Colliers will now also have a focused capital structure with significant inside ownership, making it a powerful "pure play" in global commercial real estate services that can be easily understood, evaluated, and compared to its competitors by the capital markets.
"Our mission has been to establish Colliers as the global firm that best serves the needs of today's real estate clients," said Doug Frye, Global President and Chief Executive Officer of Colliers. "To successfully support the next phase of this mission, we will continue to grow our global platform in professional services and seek out opportunities to diversify our revenue streams while advancing our track record of exceptional service. Consolidation is a reality of the commercial real estate industry, and Colliers will continue to stand out as a trailblazer, building on its proven record of growth, strong balance sheet and focus on building an enterprising and dynamic global commercial real estate services organization to benefit clients, professional advisors, and shareholders over the long-term," he added.
"With ample liquidity, modest leverage, and a newly established $525 million, five year, revolving credit facility, Colliers has the financial wherewithal to support continued investment in its balanced growth strategy focused on internal growth, targeted recruiting of top professionals, and prudent acquisitions as we have done so often in the past," said John Friedrichsen, CFO of Colliers. "With our spin-off complete, we can now focus our efforts on executing our growth strategy and with the support of our experienced board of directors, ensuring Colliers operates at the very highest of standards expected of publicly traded companies," he added.
Shareholders will benefit from the strong insider ownership and continuity of management to which they're accustomed; largest shareholder Jay Hennick continues his leadership role as Executive Chairman, while John Friedrichsen, serves as Chief Financial Officer and Elias Mulamoottil will serve as Global Head of Mergers and Acquisitions. Doug Frye, Global President and Chief Executive Officer of Colliers International, will retain the role he has for 13 years with Dylan Taylor, Chief Operating Officer, overseeing the executive team in charge of operations of Colliers.

Plan of Arrangement
On April 21, 2015, shareholders of FirstService voted overwhelmingly in favour of the transaction and, on May 28, 2015, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) approved the transaction.
Under the terms of the arrangement: (i) each holder of Subordinate Voting Shares of the former FirstService will continue to hold one Subordinate Voting Share of Colliers (which will continue to be represented by former FirstService share certificates, until replaced against transfer) and will receive one Subordinate Voting Share of New FirstService for every Subordinate Voting Share of the former FirstService held at the close of business on May 29, 2015; and (ii) each holder of Multiple Voting Shares of the former FirstService will continue to hold one Multiple Voting Share of Colliers (which will continue to be represented by former FirstService share certificates, until replaced against transfer) and will receive one Multiple Voting Share of new FirstService for every Multiple Voting Share of the former FirstService held at the close of business on May 29, 2015.
The last day of "if, as and when issued" trading for New FirstService, ex-distribution trading for Colliers and "due bill" trading for former FirstService is expected to be June 1, 2015. New FirstService Subordinate Voting Shares and Colliers Subordinate Voting Shares are anticipated to begin regular trading on the TSX and NASDAQ at the commencement of trading on June 2, 2015. The new FirstService Subordinate Voting Shares will trade under the symbol FSV on both the TSX and NASDAQ while the Colliers Subordinate Voting Shares will trade under the symbol CIG on the TSX and the symbol CIGI on NASDAQ.
