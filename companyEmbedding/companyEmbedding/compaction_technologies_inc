Home>Environmental impact



Think Green
Compacting trash is socially responsible and benefits the environment. Compactors are eco-friendly appliances for handling trash. With compactors in your Quick-Service Restaurant, your customers notice efforts to reduce trash volume and become more environmentally friendly. It simply improves guests’ perception of restaurant cleanliness and “Green” efforts. Here are some facts to consider of how trash compactors can help the planet we live on:

Compaction decreases the number of trash bags going into our landfills. One compactor can prevent 7,500 plastic bags from entering our landfills each year. Plastic trash bags are necessary to keep trash containers from becoming stained and to make it easier to handle trash. But plastic bags create a physical barrier, moisture barrier, and oxygen barrier that inhibit the decomposition of solid waste in landfills. Reducing the quantity of plastic is a step in the right direction to help improve the degradation of solid waste. By compacting trash, the number of trash bags required goes down. For example: If a dining room has 3 trash containers that are emptied 7 times per day, then switches to a compactor that is emptied 1 time per day, that’s a daily savings of 20 plastic trash bags per day, 140 per week, over 600 per month or 7,280 plastic trash bags per year. 7,280 plastic trash bags that don’t get into landfills every year – that’s Green!
Compaction saves fuel and reduces the carbon footprint. Trash trucks are absolutely necessary to collect and transport solid waste to landfills. But Trash trucks are not exactly fuel efficient. Compacting trash in the dining room reduces the volume of trash in the dumpster, and reduces the number of times per week the dumpster needs to be emptied. For example: If a trash dumpster is emptied 5 times per week and as a result of compacting dining room trash can be emptied 3 times per week, it would save trash haulers 40% of their operating costs. For a trash truck that gets 3 mpg and is driven 25,000 miles per year, a 40% reduction amounts to 3,333 gallons of diesel per year – that’s Green!
Once trash gets to a landfill, operators try to cover the loose trash with dirt and compact the trash as much as possible. The idea being to get as much loose trash into a landfill as possible for two reasons; 1) to avoid opening more landfills and 2) to promote the bio-degradation of the trash and produce methane gas. Landfill operators know compacting trash is good, thats why they use gigantic earth-moving equipment to cover trash and roll it down tight. Compacting trash where it is created (dining room of a QSR) is more efficient than hauling it loose then trying to compact it in the landfill. Its hard to put a number on it, but directionally it makes sense to compact at the point of origin and save the expense in fuel and equipment compacting in a landfill.

Compaction Technologies, Inc., located in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park, offers an exciting new solution to waste management. Our front-of-house trash compactors and PTC (restroom paper towel compactors)  can save you time and money by collecting and compacting trash in one step on site. Best of all, our at the source compacting gives you have the freedom to install a unit anywhere customers dispose of their own trash in a public setting. 
What is “at the source” Trash Compacting?
Trash compactors or balers have been around for decades in “back-of-house” applications where filled trash bags are smashed together into 80-120lb. cubes.   These very large cubes are then tied-off, moved, and lifted into the trash dumpster.  Our compactors give the same benefit of reducing volume immediately upon collection without the added labor intense step.  When your customer disposes of trash in a receptacle provided by Compaction Technologies, the unit automatically flattens and reduces the size of the solid waste.  They don’t have to push open a door, or cram trash through a small hole.  Our hands-free deposit system uses a motion sensor to automatically open the trash door.  After trash is deposited, it’s compacted automatically and taken to the dumpster.  Not only does this decrease your organization's carbon footprint and increase cleanliness, it eliminates the need for your staff to empty the waste container several times a day, and avoids the added steps of compacting or baling in the back of the house. Depending on the trash volume your customers produce, your staff may only need to empty the front-of-house trash compactors once a day.  That saves a tremendous amount of labor that can be redirected elsewhere.
 Benefits of Choosing Compaction Over Traditional Waste Management Bins
Besides labor savings, having a customer-facing trash compactor improves the customer’s perception of your organization business with one glance.  We are proud to help facilitate your sustainability efforts through our ecotrash® line of compactors.   The eco-friendly logo on each unit shows your commitment to the environment and makes people feel good about their choice to patronize your company. However, the benefit goes far beyond what they can see.
 By replacing a single garbage can with a trash compactor, you could prevent 7,500 plastic bags from ending up in landfills. This reduces the negative impact plastic bags have on Although plastic bags are essential to contain the trash, they have physical, moisture, and oxygen barriers that slow the decomposition of solid waste in landfills. Compaction also reduces the number of trips trash haulers must make to retrieve  and haul trash to a landfill. Since these trucks average only three miles per gallon of fuel, reducing the number of trips can save over 3,000 miles per truck per year.
Why Compaction Technologies?
We are proud to have created a solution that is environmentally friendly, efficient, and cost effective. As a finalist in the 2016 BOLD Awards sponsored by the Association for Corporate Growth (ACG), we appreciate that our efforts have not gone unrecognized. Each year, ACG chooses to honor organizations that are daring, inventive, and bold while demonstrating excellence in corporate growth, imagination, and leadership.  Additionally, in 2014 we were recognized by AHE (Association for the Healthcare Environment) as an Innovation Award Nominee.  These awards highlight our efforts to bring forward new technology to save labor and be more sustainable in trash collection efforts of QSRs, Mall Food Courts, College Dining Halls, Event and Stadiums, Healthcare Facilities, and any high use restrooms.  We invite you to see for yourselves what a difference ecotrash trash compaction by Compaction Technologies can make for your company’s image and bottom line.

Project Management
When it comes to earth moving, speed is critical. However, accuracy can never be sacrificed and quality project management services are needed. Precise haul routes and cycle times are essential to a timely execution of the available machine power. Planning of these precise haul routes begins in the preliminary stages of the project. We will often meet with clients and general contractors early on to provide cost saving advice in the planning of a project. Collaboration among the Owner, Consulting Engineer and the A&L Services, Inc. team can result in significant cost savings and an expedited project completion. With several dirt work machines in motion at one time, our experienced site foremen monitor and direct assets seamlessly at all times based on the required cuts and fills. When material is placed accurately with GPS and dual-grade laser enabled equipment, it reduces the amount of fine grading required. The focus of all site foremen is on efficient and effective soil movement, moisture control, and compaction.
Through the combination of technology and experience, our customers have come to rely on A&L Services, Inc. to deliver their sites ready to build, on budget, and in a timely fashion. A&L Services, Inc. is the dirt contractor of choice for soil compaction, wetlands mitigation, deep ripping, excavating, and complete site development and project management in northern California.
