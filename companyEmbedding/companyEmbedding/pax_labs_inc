Vapor Tips and Getting Started 
PAX was designed to be easy to use with little to no learning curve. Whether you are new to using PAX or have tried it before, read on for Pro Tips from our knowledgeable tech and support team. Vapor feels different for everyone, so the most important tip we can give you is experiment to find what works for you. 


Setting the temperature +


Most PAXers like to start on the low or medium temperature setting and work their way up to the highest temperature before finishing. 



Filling the oven +



If not already shredded, grind your material into small pieces. A moderate grind is perfect.
Because PAX utilizes conduction heating, you’ll want to pack your oven contents firmly to increase the surface area of your material.
Tamp the contents down until your oven is halfway full at minimum. You can fill the oven all the way too, just make sure none of your material is above the edge of the oven.
Tamp down again before replacing your oven lid.
 



Turning on PAX +



Turn your PAX on by pushing down on the mouthpiece and gently releasing your thumb.
The mouthpiece is spring loaded so if you push down hard and release quickly your mouthpiece will pop up.
 



Drawing on PAX +


While PAX is pulsing purple, indicating it’s heating up you should know the following:

PAX does the work for you and creates vapor in the oven through direct contact, gently heating your material.
Drawing a lot of air through the device won’t create more vapor, you will just be inhaling hot air. Instead, allow the vapor to form in the oven to produce bigger clouds.
A firm, but gentle 2-3 second draw should be enough to clear the oven of vapor. Remember to give PAX a few seconds in between your next draw to heat your material again and create more vapor in the oven.
When you start to taste less and see less vapor, adjust the temperature setting to high to make the most of your oven contents.
You can tell the ovenload is finished if no more vapor is being produced.
“Sip it. Don’t Rip it”
 



Screen Placement +



The PAX's screen plays a critical role in the quality of your vapor.
If you notice a change in the quality of your vapor, your screen is probably due for a cleaning.
You’ll also want to make sure the oven screen is inserted properly.
 



Turning PAX off +



Lightly push down about half-way until you feel the mouthpiece click into place. Release your finger gently.
The mouthpiece sits on top of a spring and as you push down about half-way, a clasp grabs the metal ring that sits just under the plastic mouthpiece.
There’s a good chance on your first try, you’ll push down too far and miss the clasp, causing the spring to bottom out and pop up the mouthpiece.
After you’ve become familiar with the motion, you’ll be able to close the mouthpiece quickly and easily.

"Although the PAX 2 is sleek and discreet, it gets far too hot to enjoy vaporizing for an extended period of time. I find myself using the unit for just a few draws before it becomes intolerable."

"We were a bit disappointed with the battery life, draw resistance and the amount of maintenance necessary to get great, consistent vapor out of this unit, especially for how much it costs. If you’re looking for higher quality vapor or an easy to clean and maintain unit, you should take a look at the Prima vaporizer for its equally stylish exterior, removable vapor pathway and some of the best vapor we’ve tasted in a while."

"The Pax 2 lives up to the reputation of the older brother - the original Pax. What makes it so good is how everything comes together- from the design, to performance, and reliability. It is ultra stealth, and delivers the best tasting vapor at it's class."

"Overall the Pax 2 is a great improvement over the original Pax. They eliminated nearly all the cleaning problems with the new redesigned mouthpieces and added in some innovative features to make it more efficient."








The Cannabist

"The Pax 2 draws well and is able to produce consistent flavor profiles. It may take some getting used to with the four heat settings, but I believe this to be one of the best functioning devices on the cannabis market."

"Overall, the Pax 2 is a great improvement on an already great vaporizer. It’s small, light, and very easily portable. If you’re looking for a portable vape that will last you a long time, has great battery life, and vapes very well, get the Pax 2."








Gizmodo

"If you’ve ever used a robust vaporizer like the Volcano, you’re probably used to thick, milky vapor that fills the room. It’s hard to get that kind of experience with the Pax 2, though fiddling with the four different heat settings provides some versatility."

"It’s a very well-rounded, good looking, good performing vape. It has also proven to be very reliable, I’ve received an extremely low number of defect complaints with this one."








Engadget

"While the Pax 2 doesn't heat instantly like the Firefly or offer an aromatherapy function like the Arizer, its combination of ease-of-use, portability, impressive battery life and vapor quality make it well worth checking out."

PAX Labs (formerly Ploom[2]) is an electronic cigarette company founded in 2007 which markets PAX vaporizers and the JUUL electronic cigarette.[3]

History[edit]
The company was founded by James Monsees and Adam Bowen in 2007 under the name Ploom.[2] The company currently has distribution in the United States and Canada and has received $46.7 million in "series C" funding from various sources.[4][5]
The company has been involved with Japan Tobacco International.[2] The Pax by Ploom was the first release of the Pax series. Next, now Pax Labs, Inc., introduced the Pax 2 including the following changes: no moving parts to maintain, smaller and lighter, larger oven, and longer battery life. Pax 2 can be used with loose-leaf tobacco or cannabis.[6] November 2016, the Pax 3 was released, featuring compatibility with both extracts and plant matter, new tools and accessories, and a complementary smart phone app. Also, Pax Labs introduced an extract based vaporizer called the Era the same month. Pax Era operates by heating a concentrated cannabis liquid held in very small containers.[7]
Ari Atkins, Pax Labs' R&D engineer, said "We don’t think a lot about addiction here because we’re not trying to design a cessation product at all."[8] Later he mentioned "anything about health is not on our mind."[8]
JUUL[edit]




JUUL vaporizer.


On June 1, 2015, the company introduced JUUL a type of e-cigarette which uses nicotine salts found in leaf-based tobacco.[9] PAX Labs has been given a US patent for their nicotine salt liquid preparation used in JUUL.[10] The e-cigarette is described as being shaped like a USB-drive.[11] The e-cigarette uses nicotine salts found in leaf-based tobacco to create an experience more like smoking than other e-cigarettes on the market.[9] The device recharges using a magnetic USB deck.[12] Each cartridge (also called JUULpod) contains around the amount of nicotine as one pack of cigarettes.[11] Each cartridge delivers approximately 200 hits.[12] Juul attempts to deliver a nicotine peak in five minutes, similar to a traditional cigarette.[13]
Joel Johnson of co.design describe the nicotine intake as "eye-widening" and its aesthetics as "demure".[14] Upon initial release Ben Radding of Men's Fitness called JUUL the "iPhone of E-cigs", but said the e-cigarette required getting use to.[13] John Schachter, director of state communications for Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, voiced concern regarding the JUUL advertising campaign as a result of the youth of the men and women portrayed in the campaign, particularly when accompanied with the design.[15] "We're seeing more and more irresponsible marketing of unregulated products such as e-cigarettes," Mr. Schachter conveyed in a statement regarding the JUUL campaign.[15] CEO, Tyler Goldman of PAX Labs, said to Fortune that "JUUL should not be used by those under the legal age, nor should any nicotine products, as stated by the U.S. Surgeon General."[16]

History[edit]
The company was founded by James Monsees and Adam Bowen in 2007 under the name Ploom.[2] The company currently has distribution in the United States and Canada and has received $46.7 million in "series C" funding from various sources.[4][5]
The company has been involved with Japan Tobacco International.[2] The Pax by Ploom was the first release of the Pax series. Next, now Pax Labs, Inc., introduced the Pax 2 including the following changes: no moving parts to maintain, smaller and lighter, larger oven, and longer battery life. Pax 2 can be used with loose-leaf tobacco or cannabis.[6] November 2016, the Pax 3 was released, featuring compatibility with both extracts and plant matter, new tools and accessories, and a complementary smart phone app. Also, Pax Labs introduced an extract based vaporizer called the Era the same month. Pax Era operates by heating a concentrated cannabis liquid held in very small containers.[7]
Ari Atkins, Pax Labs' R&D engineer, said "We don’t think a lot about addiction here because we’re not trying to design a cessation product at all."[8] Later he mentioned "anything about health is not on our mind."[8]
JUUL[edit]




JUUL vaporizer.


On June 1, 2015, the company introduced JUUL a type of e-cigarette which uses nicotine salts found in leaf-based tobacco.[9] PAX Labs has been given a US patent for their nicotine salt liquid preparation used in JUUL.[10] The e-cigarette is described as being shaped like a USB-drive.[11] The e-cigarette uses nicotine salts found in leaf-based tobacco to create an experience more like smoking than other e-cigarettes on the market.[9] The device recharges using a magnetic USB deck.[12] Each cartridge (also called JUULpod) contains around the amount of nicotine as one pack of cigarettes.[11] Each cartridge delivers approximately 200 hits.[12] Juul attempts to deliver a nicotine peak in five minutes, similar to a traditional cigarette.[13]

PAX Labs, Inc. Presents at 2017 ICR Conference, Jan-09-2017 01:10 PM. Venue: JW Marriott Orlanbeado Grande Lakes, Orlando, Florida, United States.


PAX Labs, Inc. Announces PAX Era and PAX 3
Sep 22 16
PAX Labs, Inc. announced PAX Era, a new vapor platform for concentrates, and PAX 3, the latest version of the company's premium vaporizer with over one million units sold to date. The Era and PAX 3 launches further cement PAX Labs' position as the market leader in providing premium vapor experiences. With these two new products, consumers can now enjoy the PAX experience across different types of consumable materials, from loose-leaf to concentrates. The vaporization technology company also announced the release of the PAX Vapor app, which ensures compatible devices provide the smartest, most customizable experiences. The vaporization category is undergoing significant growth across multiple categories, with much of this being fueled by new technologies. With its unmatched and proprietary heat-not-burn technology, superior functionality and performance, and relentless commitment to design, PAX Labs continues to be at the forefront of growth in the vaporization category. Heat control technology in PAX Era Pods provides superior flavor and consistent vapor quality, and Pods are engineered to prevent leaking and clogging. Era Pods, built from food grade polycarbonate, feature PAX's proprietary SimpleClick design, allowing consumers to quickly and easily change between pod varieties without screwing in threaded cartridges. The PAX Era device is compatible only with Era Pods, which are sold separately. PAX Era is Bluetooth® enabled, allowing consumers to connect to the new PAX Vapor app. Through the app, consumers can customize flavor and vapor volume by setting precise temperatures, down to a single degree, on their Era devices. Consumers can also customize LED color themes, access interactive games, and lock their device. The PAX Vapor app provides over-the-air firmware updates to make Era and other Bluetooth® enabled PAX devices smarter over time. Additional features will be released later this year. PAX 3 is designed with a mirror-polished anodized aluminum shell and comes in Black, Gold, Silver and limited edition Rose Gold. PAX 3 is meticulously engineered with the quality materials and components and comes with a 10-year warranty with ongoing customer support and service. PAX 3 retails for $274.99 and will be live in mid-October.

As CEO, Goldman will be responsible for continuing to build the company's platform to deliver premium, non-smoking experiences to fulfill unmet consumer demand. Goldman's initial focuses will be on meeting the growing demand for JUUL, expanding the PAX portfolio to address additional consumer segments, leveraging the company's innovative technology to continue improving vapor experiences for both PAX and JUUL consumers, and expanding the PAX Labs team to support the company's fast growth.

This Silicon Valley Company Just Raised $47 Million to Smoke Cigarette Makers


Vaporizer company Pax Labs has closed a funding round from heavyweight investors and released a new product aimed at crushing competitors in the e-cigarette space.

Pax Labs, a San Francisco-based vaporizer company, announced a whopping $46.7 million Series C round on Wednesday led by investors including Fidelity Management & Research Company and Sivia Capital.
Fidelity declined to comment about its investment, but Pax's success as wooing such an established institutional investor is a clear sign that vaping has become a serious growth business. According to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, about 10 percent of U.S adults now use electronic cigarettes and or other vaporizing devices, four times the estimated number in 2013. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog estimates the U.S. vaporizer market will grow to $3.5 billion by the end of the year, up from $2.5 billion in 2014.
Pax Labs used to be named Ploom, but sold the Ploom name and its ModelTwo vaporizer to Japanese Tobacco International earlier this year after a three-year partnership. Founded in 2007 by Stanford graduate design students James Monsees (now the CEO) and Adam Bowen (now CTO), Pax has seen sales grow 200 percent over the past two years and has sold more than 500,000 units of its eponymous flagship product: a portable loose leaf vaporizer that looks more like a mobile electronic device than a vapor delivery system. Monsees and Bowen says Pax will use the new funding to expand beyond the U.S. and Canada.
Racing to replace the cigarette
On June 1, Pax Labs released its newest product, the Juul, a sleek electronic cigarette the company sells along with its liquid nicotine cartridges. Inside the SD card-sized cartridges--which are available at 10,000 retail locations around the U.S., as well as by monthly subscription on Pax's website--is a proprietary blend of nicotine liquid that Pax Labs chemists reverse-engineered from the tobacco plant. Compared to competitors' nicotine liquids, Bowen says, Pax's has a bigger punch that is more satisfying to people who are switching over from cigarettes.
The Juul, Pax Lab's e-cigarette, launched June 1 with four flavors of nicotine liquid--"tabaac", "miint," "fruut," and "bruule." CREDIT: Courtesy Company
"It's 10 times as much nicotine as other e-cigarettes on the market, which sounds crazy high but it's actually what you get per puff from a cigarette," Bowen says. "[Other] e-cigarettes can't go that high."
Monsees and Bowen say that the e-cigarette industry's biggest problem is that most smokers aren't satiated by e-cigs and go back to conventional cigarettes. Additionally, as the Reuters/Ipsos poll found, about 75 percent of people who vape nicotine continue to smoke cigarettes. The founders hope that because the Juul's liquid delivers similar nicotine satisfaction to that of a cigarette, the product will get people to give up smoking. (Most researchers believe e-cigs will prove to be less harmful than cigarettes, and various studies have found no evidence that vaporizing liquid nicotine causes cancer or heart disease. Still, the long-term health effects of vaping remain unclear.)
A future in cannabis?
Pax Labs has never marketed its products to marijuana users. But thanks to their portability and how well they vaporize THC from cannabis flowers, the Pax loose leaf vaporizer and the recently released Pax2 have been heartily adopted by legions of marijuana users. The cult following the Pax has created has blossomed into a community of technology-minded cannabis users who congregate on a subsection of Reddit.

The rising popularity of THC concentrates could be a huge opportunity for Pax Labs. While the Juul is a closed system, the Pax2 can be filled with whatever material the consumer wants to pack in it. Monsees and Bowen, who have somewhat accidentally become the godfathers of arguably the best portable, high-end and high-tech pot vaporizer on the market, know their products' potential in the cannabis industry.
"Pax is currently a tobacco product. But the industry and the regulatory landscape is shifting. We're very much aware of that and we would love for this technology to applied as broadly as possible," Monsees says. "That was the concept from day one. We did not want to build a tobacco company; it was to build the greatest vaporization company possible."
But when asked if they have a THC oil cartridge waiting to be deployed in Colorado or other markets where recreational marijuana is legal, the vape kings say not yet.
"We are experimenting with the technologies for other markets, potentially for the cannabis market. But we will only ever do that in places where we can get full legal compliance for federal, state, and local level," Monsees says. "We do not have a product announcement at this point, but certainly the future is bright to bring technologies that open up the landscape."

                    Finally, Realistic Practice Tests for the PAX-PNwith Detailed Explanations for Every Question!
                
















                                                     Thank you for these wonderful PAX tests!  I failed the PAX three times before I discovered you website.I took all your pracitce tests and this time I passed!!!

I start nursing school in 2 months.  Thanks again!
                                                     -- Natalie C., Florida



                                                        Thanks so much!!! I wouldn't have been able to get through 
                                                        this without the help I got from your tests.  I always panic when go 
                                                        to take a test, but after taking all of your tests I was relaxed and 
                                                        focused when it came time to take the actual exam. I can not thank you 
                                                        enough!
                                                    -- Jane



                                                        I was very apprehensive about taking my exam since I am 
                                                        squeamish with any kind of testing. By using your testing prep, I can 
                                                        tell you that I went into the test with a lot of ease and confidence. I 
                                                        would not have been ready for the kind of questions that were on the test. 
                                                        I just wish I knew about this program years ago when I took my other exams and 
                                                        was not as prepared as I would have been if I used your product. 
                                                        Thank you so much!

Top 10 reasons PAXpractice.com is #1









PAXpractice.com was created to focus solely on  the  NLN PAX-PN (Practical Nurse)  test.  All practice test questions parallel the topics covered on the real test, are in the right proportion, 
                                                    as outlined in National League for Nursing's published NLN PAX-PN (Practical Nurse) test blueprints.
                                                                  


                                           

		
                                        	Our practice tests are designed to have a similar look-and-feel of the real test. The number of questions and the time limit for each practice exam are just like the real thing.  So when you take the actual test, you will already be completely familiar with its navigation and behavior.                   


                                           

		
                                        	We offer a total of 15  full-length practice tests.  Each full-length practice test has 160 questions.  That's a total of 2,400 practice questions to prepare you for the real test!                   


                                           

		
                                        	The low cost!  The cost of ordering 5 practice tests is less than the cost of taking the real NLN PAX-PN (Practical Nurse)  test.  In other words, it would cost you less money to order  5  practice tests, than if you failed the real test and had to retake it.  Now that is a bargain!                   


                                           

		
                                        	If you have to stop while taking one of our tests, you can continue right where you left off.  When you continue the test, you will start exactly where you were, and with the same amount of time you had remaining.                   


                                           

		
                                        	After you complete a test, we provide your raw score (how many you answered correctly) and our estimate of the NLN score you would receive if you were taking the real test.                    


                                           

		
                                        	As you complete your practice tests, we show you which questions you answered correctly, which ones you answered incorrectly, and provide detailed step-by-step explanations for every single question on the test!                   


                                           


As a fully accredited member of the Better Business Bureau, we uphold the highest level of business standards.  You can rest assured that we maintain all of the BBB Standards for Trust


		
                                        	Because the tests are web-based, there is no software to install.  Our practice tests are available to you 24-hours a day. No matter where you are, you can take our practice tests on any computer with access to the internet.
