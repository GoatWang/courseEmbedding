Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

Navios South American Logistics Inc. Inaugurates Iron Ore Transshipment and Storage Facility
BY GlobeNewswire— 9:25 AM ET 04/03/2017


MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay, April  03, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Navios South American Logistics Inc. ("Navios Logistics"), a subsidiary of Navios Maritime Holdings Inc. (NM) , announced the inauguration of its newly completed iron ore transshipment and storage facility in the Nueva Palmira Free Zone, Uruguay on Thursday March 30, 2017. 
Present at the inauguration was the Board of Directors and executive team of Navios Logistics as well as representatives from a number of branches of the government of Uruguay, including the Minister of Transport and Public Works, Mr. Victor Rossi, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Rodolfo Nin Novoa.Ms. Angeliki Frangou, Chairman of Navios Logistics, said, "We celebrated the culmination of a four-year effort by inaugurating our world-class iron ore transshipment and storage facility. The new facility represents a significant investment in essential infrastructure for the region and a critical component of the export supply chain of Navios Logistics's customers.  With the completion of the iron ore facility, we have about 70 acres available for further expansion.”Ms. Frangou continued, “Our state-of-the art facility can transship 10 million tons per year, with a loading rate of 3,900 tons per hour, can accommodate simultaneous loading of ocean-going vessels and unloading barges, and has an initial storage capacity of not less than 700,000 tons of iron ore. The facilities include a new pier for loading ocean-going vessels, a new pier for unloading river barges, and a new mooring location for barge convoys. When the iron ore facility is fully operational, we expect to double the number of our employees to a total of 320 people.”Mr. Claudio Lopez, Chief Executive Officer of Navios Logistics, added, “We operate on about 150 acres in a perfect location, at the mouth of the river, where commodities can be transshipped through Capesize vessels. The iron ore storage and transshipment facility will provide a significant additional service we can offer our customers. We expect that this facility will allow us to expand our service both through barge transportation to the facility as well as through transshipment and storage."Navios Logistics has a 20-year commitment to provide Vale International S.A. with storage and transshipment of iron ore and other commodities for a minimum of 4.0 million tons annually.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.

Our warehouse is equipped with state of the art information
systems as well of infrastructure allows us to handle the most diverse variety
of products.
Our Services

Our professionals offer their experience to advice and
handle the most difficult tasks, from large “one-time” projects to repetitive
services. 
In large projects, we have the experience of handling the
transportation door-to-door of large manufacturing plants, mining equipment,
truck fleets, oil rigs, large scale air conditioner units, tanks and in
general, large and heavy equipment that requires special handling, complex
coordination, professional planning and accurate execution. 
Our activities are oriented in four groups of customers:

Customers Located in the United States Importing from
  overseas.
Customers Located in the Unite States Exporting.
International Customers importing from the United States.
International Customers Exporting to the United States.

For each situation we have a group of professionals that
have the knowledge and experience to advise our customers the most economical
and efficient method to handle that operation.

access the North American market and also for North American companies to
access their international customers, most frequently Latin America. We execute
their instructions and act as an extension of their operation in the market.
Importers to the United States usually request
the use of the INCOTERMS “DDP” (Duties,
Delivery Paid), in other words: door-to-door. The property of the imported good
is transferred to the buyer at his designated location. Our organization can
execute the complete process, including providing “Importer of record” and,
when required, represent the customer in the “FDA” (“Food and Drug
Administration”) registration process.
3PL Third Party Logistics

When optimizing the supply and demand, you often realize
that your customer needs do not mach with your ability to deliver. We can help
you closing this gap providing local warehousing and distribution, giving you
the sense of a “virtual warehouse” to fulfill your customer needs.
We can be as the “Importer or Records” or have your customer
to do so. We can, then, deliver your products “Just-In-Time”, access multiple
distribution centers or tailor the process as per your customer needs. We have
extensive experience in this area, ask us and our specialists will help you.
In exports, we can hold your inventory and proceed to ship
as needed; we will act and be like an extension of your operation.
Cross-Docking is a
logistics technique that eliminates the put away, storage, and order picking
functions of a warehouse while still allowing it to serve its receiving and shipping
functions. It enables firms to eliminate inventory costs and reduce
transportation costs, often at the same time.
Simply put, cross-docking moves imported product into
domestic equipment or moves domestic product into export equipment. It is becoming
more and more common in today’s logistics operations.
 
Handling of Pound or Products?

Maybe both…
The international flow of goods requires the use of multiple
steam-companies, airlines and other means of transportation.  The service is
measured by weight or by volume. The transport company product is the “box”,
“pallet” and/or the unit of transportation. The content is not their main
concern. We know that for you as a shipper or as a consignee, your concern is
your product. Our information systems as well the communication with our
customers is in their language and not in terms like “on-hands”, “airway bills”
or “bill-of-lading”. We keep track of all the references associated to the
cargo for future references.
Storage and Distribution

We service all the international Sea-ports and Airports in
the United States. We have access to distributions centers shipping and or
receiving products in the most convenient locations to minimize cost. We can
arrange and provide deliveries “JIT” (Just in Time) reducing inventory levels
and ate the same time, increase the level of service.
We can be you warehouse space in South Florida, secured,
accurate and professionally managed. See our warehouse offer.
What is Logistics?

That part of Supply chain process involving planning
implementation, efficient and effective flow of information and goods between a
point of origin and the point of consumption tailor-made according to customers
requirements
The difference between a logistic provider and a cargo
provider is that a good logistics provider deals with your “products”
and a cargo provider handles your pallets, kilos and volume. 
Our repetitive customers are the best proof that our service
is consistent and high quality. When requiring special handling and high
dedication, our group of professionals will be there to help you.
 
Consulting and Planning

Before you face a Supply Chain Management solution, a group
of professionals will analyze your needs and go through three basic steps:
Analysis
Will collect all the information about the current process,
taking notes on the strength and weakness, drawing the flow of goods, materials
and assessing the levels of information available,
Project
After the Analysis phase, we will design a working model
with your management and employees, proposing methods to optimize your current
process and placing you Supply Chain in a competitive and profitable stage.
Implementation
After the proposal approval, we will put our resources to
work, delivering the solution, coordinating the complex network that will
create the new optimized Supply Chain that will reduce your logistics cost.
