University of California -  Los Angeles


                  UCLA's primary purpose as a public research university is the creation, dissemination, preservation and application of knowledge for the betterment of our global society. To fulfill this mission, UCLA is committed to academic freedom in its fullest terms: We value open access to information, free and lively debate conducted with mutual respect for individuals, and freedom from intolerance. In all of our pursuits, we strive at once for excellence and diversity, recognizing that openness and inclusion produce true quality. These values underlie our three institutional responsibilities.

Learning and teaching at UCLA are guided by the belief that undergraduate, graduate and professional school students and their teachers belong to a community of scholars. This community is dedicated to providing students with a foundational understanding of a broad range of disciplines followed by the opportunity for in-depth study in a chosen discipline. All members of the community are engaged together in discovering and advancing knowledge and practice. Learning occurs not only in the classroom but also through engagement in campus life and in communities and organizations beyond the university.

United States Air Force


                  The mission of the United States Air Force is to fly, fight and win … in air, space and cyberspace.

To achieve that mission, the Air Force has a vision of Global Vigilance, Reach and Power. That vision orbits around three core competencies: developing Airmen, technology to war fighting and integrating operations. These core competencies make our six distinctive capabilities possible.
Air and Space Superiority

With it, joint forces can dominate enemy operations in all dimensions: land, sea, air and space.
Global Attack

Because of technological advances, the Air Force can attack anywhere, anytime and do so quickly and with greater precision than ever before.
Rapid Global Mobility

Being able to respond quickly and decisively anywhere we're needed is key to maintaining rapid global mobility.
Precision Engagement

The essence lies in the ability to apply selective force against specific targets because the nature and variety of future contingencies demand both precise and reliable use of military power with minimal risk and collateral damage.
Information Superiority

The ability of joint force commanders to keep pace with information and incorporate it into a campaign plan is crucial.
Agile Combat Support

Deployment and sustainment are keys to successful operations and cannot be separated. Agile combat support applies to all forces, from those permanently based to contingency buildups to expeditionary forces.
Core Values

The Air Force bases these core competencies and distinctive capabilities on a shared commitment to three values: Integrity first, Service before self, and Excellence in all we do.

Randolph Pohlman to Leave Dean Position at Nova Southeastern University’s Business School







Tweet



FT. LAUDERDALE-DAVIE, Fla. – Randolph A. Pohlman, Ph.D., has announced that he will leave his position as dean of the H. Wayne Huizenga School of Business and Entrepreneurship at Nova Southeastern University (NSU) in Fort Lauderdale to return to the faculty. Pohlman will take sabbatical leave in July 2009 and return to the Huizenga School in January 2010 to serve on the faculty. A national search will be conducted for Pohlman’s successor.
Pohlman is in his 14th year as dean of the Huizenga School. During his tenure, the school has grown from 1,300 students to more than 6,000 and boasts the largest Master of Business Administration program in Florida. Pohlman also directed the school’s first major capital campaign that led to the construction of the Carl DeSantis Building, a five-story, 261,000-square-foot facility that opened as home to the Huizenga School in 2004.
“Dr. Pohlman has been instrumental in the growth and success of the Huizenga School,” said NSU President Ray Ferrero, Jr. “Thanks to his leadership, our faculty is able to provide business students the practical skills and knowledge they need to begin or advance a career or even start their own business. We are sorry to lose Randy as dean but look forward to having him returning to teach our students.”
In addition to serving as dean, Pohlman has written two  books: Understanding the Bottom Line and Value Driven Management. He is also active in the South Florida community, serving as a trustee and member of the Board of Governors for the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce and the Greater Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce.
Prior to joining the Huizenga School in July of 1995, Pohlman served as a senior executive at Koch Industries, the largest privately owned company in the United States. He also previously served as dean of the College of Business Administration at Kansas State University.

Description

                    "Maximize profits! Create shareholder wealth! These are the values driving many businesses today. Whipped into a frenzy by the single-minded pursuit of these goals, companies often end up sacrificing good judgment, value, and, ultimately, the very success they were striving to achieve. This sad trend can be reversed with "Value Driven Management". Instead of focusing solely on profits or shareholder wealth, value driven management is aimed at creating and sustaining value over time - by recognizing and using eight "value drivers" to guide the organization's leadership, management, and decision-making processes. Beneficial to both organizations as a whole and individuals, the innovative philosophy of "Value Driven Management" will help readers to: realize that economic value is only one aspect of value, important but not the paramount objective; build an organization where the values of employees are in sync with organizational values; establish a value-driven culture throughout the organization; use value-driven management concepts to solve complex problems; manage their self-development; and, increase their job satisfaction, and more".show more

Randolph Pohlman













                    
                    Dr. Randolph A. Pohlman is Dean Emeritus and Professor at Nova Southeastern University. His undergraduate, Masters and Ph.D. have all emphasized Finance and Organizational Behavior. He served in the United States Air force as an officer after receiving his Masters degree. After his Ph.D., he went to Kansas State University, his alma mater, in a faculty position, then to UCLA in 1983 as a visiting research scholar, returning the following year to become the dean at Kansas State. In 1990, he went to Koch Industries as a senior executive, which had a major impact in solidifying his beliefs in the importance of successful work and its impact on ones life. Dr. Pohlman has an extensive consulting and research background. He lives with his wife Jeanne and has two daughters: Tina Pohlman and Lisa Bergeron. Lisa and her husband, Adam, have given Dr. Pohlman and his wife two wonderful grandsons: Zach and Mike. Dr. Pohlman is an avid golfer. He is also a blues guitar player and singer, and can often be seen jamming with the Pitbull of Blues Band.NOTE: If you are a guitar player and wonder what guitar I am playing in the picture above, it is a HitchHiker, made by my friend Nokie Edwards.
