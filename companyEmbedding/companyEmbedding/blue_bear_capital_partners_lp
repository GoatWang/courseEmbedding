Introduction — BEAR CAPITAL PARTNERS






































                
                  BEAR CAPITAL PARTNERS
                
              













Bear Capital Partners (BCP) was formed to meet the
current needs of the Multi-Family real estate market.  Ronald L. Meer was appointed President because his guidance and leadership has previously led to significant
value appreciation for his investors as a result of:1.       Successful rehabs of tired or poorly
functioning properties2.       Re-positioning of inadequately
or incorrectly marketed properties3.       Acquisition of properties which
represented excellent prospects for value creation and4.       New construction/development
opportunities utilizing proven unique product designs in markets with pent up
demand for new multi-family properties.BCP’s motto is best expressed through the following formula:















Ron Meer has been successful because he believes in the ever ending need for strong Multi-Family assets in the portfolio of his investors.  Throughout his career, Ron has served his investors well by applying the aforementioned formula for success, hard work and the ability to put strong work teams together in design, marketing, property management, construction and finance. Such teams represent a blend of inside employees, outside contracted professionals and talented subcontractors/vendors.  Moreover, his teams are always anchored with strong marketing, exceptional operational and strategically focused staff, who think ‘outside the box’."There is one thing that is a certainty about investing in Real Estate,” according to Ron.  “When you look at the increases in population in the United States due to a higher birth rate than the current death rate, the influx of new citizens from immigration and because of a very difficult SFH lender environment, there is a ton of pent up demand."







The demand for Multi-Family product by consumers will not be satisfied for years to come and this is acutely true in markets where there is job creation or job migration taking place.”  As the population changes to follow the job migration, to look for lower priced housing or to seek a lifestyle away from the social problems, we will be there to meet the need for new housing opportunities for potential residents.While there was significant overbuilding of Retail and Single Family Residential properties in 2003 through 2007, and again perhaps in 2012 and 2013, Multi-Family real estate remains at historically high occupancies.  Moreover, many rental opportunities which heretofore had not been seen in the marketplace, revealed themselves during the past two years due to the large addition changes made by portfolio owners and, in certain markets, special servicers. Most of this inventory has been foreclosed and resold in most markets.   As families displaced by the foreclosure process and the difficulty of new loan qualification look for housing, apartment rental properties have become their short term focus to house their families.  Multi-Family apartment communities where there are superior amenities and facilities to support their families have become their preferred and the most commonly accepted solution to their housing displacement.






Source: US Census Bureau



The indicators for Apartment homes are dramatic with the trends showing huge decreases in Vacancies through 2012 even with of record amounts of new product coming online in 2013 and 2014.






                                                                           Source:  Marcus & Millichap Research



The obvious trend in 1998 through 2002 cannot be ignored and this trend appears to be poised to repeat itself in 2013 through 2017.  Housing starts for apartment homes are surging yet there just isn't enough new product coming online to meet the demand for new housing just from the birth rate and foreclosure issues alone.Whether you are a Multi-Family Property Owner, Investor or Vendor looking to find a successful team to work with in providing the products provided by our Company, Bear Capital Partners represents an excellent choice to meet your needs.

Enterprise Products Partners L.P.: The Bear Case From a Bull
A look at some of the risks that bullish investors should keep in mind.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Jul 11, 2017 at 11:11AM
            
            





It's no secret that I believe Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) is an excellent company to own for the long term. Fueling that bullishness is the fact that the pipeline giant has a rock-solid business model and visible growth prospects on the horizon thanks to the $8.6 billion of capital projects it has lined up. These factors should enable the company to continue to grow its distribution to investors. 
That said, just because I'm bullish on the company doesn't mean I don't pay attention to bearish arguments. Quite the opposite, in fact, since I have a growing portion of my net worth invested in the company, which is at risk if bears are right. That's why I think it's a good idea to review their case so that investors know full well the risks involved when investing in Enterprise Products Partners.

Its access to cheap capital might dry up
Enterprise Products Partners is one of the most fiscally conservative master limited partnerships (MLPs) in the sector. By keeping its leverage ratio around 4.0 times or less, the company has earned one of the highest credit ratings among MLPs. Furthermore, it also maintains a large margin of safety on its distribution, averaging more than 1.2 times coverage last year, allowing it to retain $675 million of cash flow to finance growth projects. Because of that strong financial profile, it has never had any issues accessing the money it needs to fund expansion.
That said, the company typically needs to raise a boatload of outside capital to finance these projects. Last year, for example, it spent nearly $3.9 billion on capex. Since it only generated $709 million in excess cash for the year, it needed to issue roughly $3.2 billion of debt and equity to bridge the gap. While it didn't have any trouble raising that money last year, a deep credit market crisis in the future could make it hard for Enterprise to obtain the cash it needs to finance growth projects at acceptable rates.
That was the case for several of its rivals during the recent oil market downturn. For example, ONEOK's (NYSE:OKE) former MLP needed to secure $1 billion in bank financing early last year so it could refinance an upcoming bond maturity after longer-term funding options became prohibitively expensive. ONEOK's affiliate expected that the move would eliminate its need to access the public debt and equity markets until well into 2017, which bought it time while it waited for the capital markets to open back up. While Enterprise Products Partners avoided a similar fate last year, it did issue twice as much equity to finance growth projects as it usually does to keep its leverage metrics low, which shows that it's not completely immune to market dislocations.

Opposition to new pipeline projects intensifies
Enterprise Products Partners has a long history of completing its growth projects on time and on budget. That's one reason why the company has been able to increase its distribution to investors in each of the last 52 quarters. Meanwhile, with $8.6 billion of capital projects under construction, Enterprise Products Partners should be able to keep that streak going for at least the next few years. 
That said, Enterprise has been one of the lucky ones since it hasn't run into any major issues completing new projects. Rivals Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE:ETP) and Williams Partners (NYSE:WPZ), on the other hand, have run into several unforeseen issues in recent years that have delayed major expansion projects. In Energy Transfer Partners' case, it encountered opposition that tried to block its attempts to finish the $4.78 billion Bakken Pipeline System, which ended up delaying its in-service date by more than six months, costing it millions in added expenses and cash flow. Meanwhile, Williams Partners experienced a delay in receiving approval for its $3 billion Atlantic Sunrise project and was denied a permit for its nearly $1 billion Constitution Pipeline due to opposition to those projects. 
Given the increasing worries about climate change, opposition to new oil and gas projects will likely continue rising in the years ahead. That could eventually impact Enterprise Products Partners' growth plans by either causing a lengthy delay of a critical project or even forcing the company to cancel a project due to issues receiving permits. A string of costly delays or project cancellations could end up halting the company's distribution growth streak. 





Investor takeaway
Bulls like me love Enterprise Products Partners' ability to leverage its vast portfolio of fee-based assets and deliver steady income growth over the long term. That said, for the company to continue growing, it needs access to cheap capital and the ability to move forward with its expansion projects without facing any significant delays or unforeseen expenses. Given the issues its peers have had in the recent past, these aren't risks that bulls should take lightly. However, because the company is more conservative than most rivals, it does have a greater cushion to withstand a setback. That's why I remain confident that it can continue to grow at a healthy rate for years to come.
