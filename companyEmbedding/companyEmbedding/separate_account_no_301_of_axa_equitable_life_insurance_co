Variable Annuities

The opportunity for market appreciation with tax-deferral






























Variable annuities provide the opportunity for market appreciation — through a variety of investment options — with tax-deferral and future income. Variable annuities are designed for people willing to take on more risk in exchange for greater growth potential. While there is risk associated with a variable annuity, many offer guarantees of principal and downside protection at an additional cost and depending on contract rider availability. However, these guarantees do not apply to the investment performance or amounts held in the variable investment options.













Investment Edge®
Defers current taxes when trying to accumulate wealth and provides tax-efficient distributions, adding powerful tax advantages to a diversified portfolio.


BENEFITSDiversificationTax-efficient Tax deferralDeath Benefit





Retirement Cornerstone®
A single tax-deferred platform comprised of two separate accounts with distinct features that help address different goals - offering the ability to not only accumulate, but also protect retirement income.


BENEFITSInvestment opportunityGuaranteed incomeDeath benefit guarantees





Structured Capital Strategies®
Several investment options, some of which allow participation in the upside potential of indices, up to a cap, that track certain domestic, international and commodities markets, and which have a built-in partial protection feature.
 


BENEFITSUpside potential up to a capPartial protectionTax deferral





The Accumulator® Series
A long-term retirement product that allows the ability to invest for growth potential on a tax-deferred basis. Also provides for guaranteed benefits through optional riders available for an additional fee.


BENEFITSInvestment Lifetime incomeDeath benefit






















Important Note AXA believes that education is a key step toward addressing your financial goals, and we've designed this material to serve simply as an informational and educational resource.  Accordingly, the information on this website does not offer or constitute investment advice and makes no direct or indirect recommendation of any particular product or of the appropriateness of any particular investment-related option.  Your needs, goals and circumstances are unique, and they require the individualized attention of your financial professional.
Annuities are long-term financial products designed for retirement purposes. In essence, annuities are contractual agreements in which payment(s) are made to an insurance company, which agrees to pay out an income or a lump sum amount at a later date. There are contract limitations and fees and charges associated with annuities, administrative fees, and charges for optional benefits. A financial professional can provide cost information and complete details. Variable annuities are subject to fluctuation in value and market risk, including loss of principal.
Withdrawals from annuities are subject to normal income tax treatment and if taken prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty. Withdrawals may also be subject to a contractual withdrawal charge.
Please consider the charges, risk, expenses, and investment objectives carefully before purchasing a variable annuity. For a prospectus containing this and other information, please contact a financial professional. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (NY,NY).
Variable annuities are issued by AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (NY, NY) and co-distributed by affiliates AXA Distributors, LLC and AXA Advisors, LLC (members FINRA, SIPC).GE-92925 (10/2016)

Henry Hyde leaves the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York to start his own firm, then known as Equitable Life Assurance Society of America. In its tenth year, Equitable writes more new business than any other company in the world.



The company's new headquarters is the first office building with steam elevators, paving the way for future skyscrapers. By 1879, it will expand to be the tallest office building in the world at that time.



Equitable markets the first joint and survivor annuity and pioneers the practice of paying death claims immediately. Miss Ray Wilner appointed Equitable's first woman agency manager.



Equitable supported the American College in launching the CLU professional designation program. Equitable started new agent training classes in 1902.



Equitable introduces its first line of individual variable annuity products and in 1976 pioneers variable life insurance, an investment-oriented policy that commands significant market share.



With a $1 billion investment from the AXA Group, Equitable completes the largest-ever conversion from a mutual to a stock company at that time and soon becomes a member of the Global AXA Group.



AXA celebrates its eighth consecutive year as the #1 insurance brand in the world as measured by the Interbrand annual report.

Tax-favored payout alternatives.

the contract does not provide additional benefits

The fee table below will help you understand the various charges and expenses   
that apply under your Certificate. The table reflects Fund charges you will     
directly incur under the Certificate, as well as charges and expenses of the    
Portfolios that you will bear indirectly. Charges for taxes, such as state or   
local premium taxes, and enrollment fees may also apply. Each of the charges and
expenses, including an annuity administrative charge, is further discussed under
"Charges and Expenses" later in this prospectus. For a complete description of  
Portfolio charges and expenses, please see the attached prospectuses for The    
Hudson River Trust and EQ Advisors Trust. In the fee table, we refer to The     
Hudson River Trust as "HRT," and to EQ Advisors Trust as "EQAT." The Fund       
charges shown in the table are expressed as an annual percentage of daily net   
assets, in each Fund. The Hudson River Trust and EQ Advisors Trust annual       
expenses are shown as a percentage of average daily net assets in each          
Portfolio.

(1)   The annual amount of management and advisory fees applicable to the       
Alliance Money Market Portfolio and Alliance Intermediate Government
   Securities Portfolio is, in each case, limited to 0.35% of the value of
the Portfolio's average daily net assets. This limitation is a      
    Certificate right for participants who enrolled prior to May 1, 1987 and
   cannot be changed without their consent. Equitable Life has voluntarily
agreed to impose this limitation for all other participants in those
  Portfolios and reserves the right to discontinue the limitation at any
  time. Absent this limitation, the management and advisory fees for the
    Alliance Intermediate Government Securities Portfolio would be 0.50% and
   for the Alliance Money Market Portfolio would be 0.35%, the same as the
limitation. See " Charges and Expenses-Expense Limitations."        

(2)   The investment management and advisory fee for each Portfolio of The      
    Hudson River Trust may vary from year to year depending upon the average
 daily net assets of the respective Portfolios. The maximum investment
   management fee and advisory fees for each Portfolio, however, cannot be
 increased without a vote of the Portfolio's shareholders. The amounts
    shown in the Table under "Fund Annual Expenses" and under "HRT Portfolio
 Annual Expenses" for the Alliance Money Market, Alliance Intermediate
Government Securities, Alliance Balanced and Alliance Common Stock  
     Funds/Portfolios, when added together, are limited by the Certificates to
   1% of the value of the Alliance Money Market option's average daily net
assets and 1.5% of the value of the Alliance Common Stock, Alliance 
Intermediate Government Securities and Alliance Balanced Funds'     
respective average daily net assets. For the Alliance High Yield,   
Alliance Aggressive Stock and Alliance Global Funds, Equitable Life 
applies a voluntary combined Fund/Portfolio expense limitation at an
   effective annual rate of 1.5% of average daily net assets of each Fund.

(1)   The Funds purchase Class IB shares of EQ Advisors Trust which are subject 
 to fees imposed under distribution plans adopted by EQ Advisors Trust
     pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Rule
    12b-1 plans provide that EQ Advisors Trust, in behalf of each Portfolio,
may pay annually up to 0.25% of the average daily net assets of a   
  Portfolio attributable to its Class IB shares for activities primarily
intended to result in the sale of the Class IB shares.              

(2)   The maximum investment management and advisory fees for each Portfolio    
    cannot be increased without a vote of that Portfolio's shareholders. The
amounts shown as "Other Expenses" will fluctuate from year to year  
 depending on actual expenses, however, EQ Financial Consultants, Inc.
("EQ Financial"), EQ Advisors Trust's manager, has entered into an  
    expense limitation agreement with respect to each Portfolio, pursuant to
     which EQ Financial has agreed to waive or limit its fees and assume other
    expenses. Under the expense limitation agreement, total annual operating
expenses of each Portfolio (other than interest, taxes, brokerage   
  commissions, capitalized expenditures, extraordinary expenses and Rule
    12b-1 plan fees) are limited for the respective average daily net assets
  of each Portfolio as follows: 0.60% for MFS Emerging Growth Companies;
   0.30% for BT Equity 500 Index; and 0.95% for Lazard Small Cap Value and
T. Rowe Price International Stock.                                  

     Absent the expense limitation, "Other Expenses" for 1998 on an annualized
     basis would have been: 0.24% for MFS Emerging Growth Companies, 0.33% for
  BT Equity 500 Index, 0.49% for Lazard Small Cap Value and 0.40% for T.
Rowe Price International Stock.                                     

   Each Portfolio may at a later date make a reimbursement to EQ Financial
for any of the management fees waived or limited and other expenses 
assumed and paid by EQ Financial pursuant to the expense limitation 
   agreement provided that, among other things, such Portfolio has reached
     sufficient size to permit such reimbursement to be made and provided that
the Portfolio's current annual operating expenses do not exceed the 
operating expense limit determined for such Portfolio.              

EXAMPLES                                                                        

The examples below show the expenses that a hypothetical participant would pay, 
assuming a $1,000 contribution is invested in one of the Funds listed, and a 5% 
annual return on assets(1). The expenses are the same whether or not the        
participant withdraws amounts held in any of the Funds. For purposes of the     
examples, the participant service charge is computed by applying a charge of $12
to the average number of participants for the year, divided by average assets   
for each Fund for the same period.                                              

These examples should not be considered a representation of past or future      
expenses for each Fund or Portfolio. Actual expenses may be greater or less than
those shown below. Similarly, the annual rate of return assumed in the examples 
is not an estimate or guarantee of future investment performance.

(1)   The amount accumulated from the $1,000 contribution could not be paid in  
the form an annuity at the end of any of the periods shown in the   
   examples. This is because the minimum amount applied must be $2,000 and
the initial annuity payment must be at least $20. See "Certificate  
     Provisions-Retirement Benefits." In some cases, charges for state premium
or other taxes will be deducted from the amount applied.            

If you elect an annuity payout option under which we deduct a $350 annuitization
fee:                                                                            

Assuming an annuity payout option could be issued, the expenses shown in        
the above example would, in each case, be increased by $4.43 based on the       
average amount applied to annuity payout options in 1998.                       

CHARGE FOR WITHDRAWALS OR TRANSFERS FROM GRAS. We impose a charge of 7% of the  
amount withdrawn or transferred (including the amount of the withdrawal charge),
but not more than the accumulated interest, on the amount withdrawn or          
transferred, from any GRA. The charge does not apply to your contributions or at
maturity of the GRA, among other exceptions.                                    

ANNUITIZATION FEE. If you elect the fixed annuity benefit available under your  
Certificate we will deduct a charge of up to $350 at the time we provide that   
benefit. The charge may be greater if, at that time, we offer more favorable    
annuity purchase rates for the same benefit.

Contributions must be in the form of a check drawn on a bank in the U.S.        
clearing through the Federal Reserve System, in U.S. dollars and made payable   
to Equitable Life. We do not accept third party checks endorsed to us except    
for rollover contributions, tax-free exchanges or trustee checks that involve   
no refund. All checks are subject to collection. We reserve the right to reject 
a payment if it is received in an unacceptable form.                            

We do not monitor whether contributions exceed limitations in the Internal      
Revenue Code. However, we reserve the right to refuse contributions that we     
believe to exceed those limitations.                                            

You make contributions under a Regular IRA or Roth IRA Certificate by sending   
your payment directly to us. For TSA, SEP or SIMPLE IRA Certificates, your      
employer sends contributions to us on your behalf. Payroll deduction amounts    
will be automatically transferred to us for allocation to the investment options
as you direct.                                                                  

We invest your contributions on the date we receive them, provided they are     
accompanied by a properly completed instructions form. If the date of receipt is
not a Business Day, we invest your contributions on the next Business Day.      

Initial contributions must be accompanied by an application and any other form  
we require to process the payments. We may retain your initial contribution for 
five Business Days while we attempt to obtain any information that is missing or
unclear. If we cannot obtain the information we require within the five Business
Days, our Processing Office will inform you or your employer of the             
circumstances and return the contribution unless you or your employer           
specifically consent to our retaining your contribution until we receive the    
required information.                                                           

OUR "BUSINESS DAY" GENERALLY IS ANY DAY ON WHICH THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE    
AND EQUITABLE LIFE IS OPEN FOR TRADING AND GENERALLY ENDS AT 4 P.M. EASTERN     
TIME. WE MAY, HOWEVER, CLOSE DUE TO EMERGENCY CONDITIONS.                       
DISCONTINUANCE AND RESUMPTION OF CONTRIBUTIONS                                  

If contributions are discontinued your participation under a Certificate will   
remain in effect and contributions may be resumed at any time. However, under   
SEP and SIMPLE Certificates, contributions may not be resumed. We reserve the   
right to close a participant's account and terminate the Certificate if no      
contributions are made within 120 days of the issue date of a Certificate.      

We also reserve the right to close a participant's account and pay any account  
balance if contributions are discontinued for at least three years from the date
of the last contribution, and either (1) the account balance does not exceed    
$2,000 or (2) the annuity which the existing account balance would purchase at  
the participant's retirement date would be less than $20 per month based on the 
current annuity rates in effect under the Certificate.

GUARANTEED RATE ACCOUNTS 

You can allocate contributions to the GRAs that provide principal and interest  
guarantees. These amounts become part of our general account assets. We discuss 
our general account under "More Information."                                   

Currently, we offer GRAs with guarantee periods of one and three years. We may  
offer additional or different guarantee periods in the future.                  

New one-year and three-year guarantee periods are offered each calendar quarter.
We announce a fixed interest rate for each guarantee period at least 10 days    
before the beginning of the quarter. Interest rates are set according to our    
procedures at the time. Thus, different interest rates may apply to different   
amounts in the GRAs. All interest rates are effective interest rates, reflecting
daily compounding and the deduction of the participant service charge. The      
guaranteed annual rate of interest will never be less than 3%.                  

At the end of a guarantee period (the maturity date), unless you instruct us    
otherwise, we will automatically contribute the accumulated amount to a new     
guarantee period of similar duration. If we are offering no guarantee period of 
a similar duration, we will transfer the amount to the maturity period of the   
shortest duration we then offer.                                                

You may allocate amounts in maturing guarantee periods to one or more other     
[investment options] by using the AIM System. We must receive instructions      
before the maturity date. We will apply those instructions to all maturing      
guarantee periods until we receive other instructions.                          

The amount of your contributions to the GRAs is guaranteed by us (before        
deduction of any participant service charge). However, withdrawals and transfers
out of a guarantee period before a maturity date, may be subject to a withdrawal
charge. See "Charges and Expenses." For futher information regarding the GRAs,  
please see "The Guaranteed Rate Accounts" in the SAI.                           

ALLOCATING YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS                                                   

You may allocate your contributions to one or more, or all, of the Funds or     
GRAs. Allocations must be in whole percentages, which you may change at any time
in writing or by telephone using our AIM System. Changes are effective on the   
date we receive all necessary information. Allocation changes have no effect on 
amounts already invested.                                                       

OUR ACCOUNT INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (AIM SYSTEM)                           

Participants may use our automated AIM System to transfer between investment    
options, obtain account information, change the allocation of future            
contributions and maturing GRAs and hear investment performance information. To 
use the AIM System, you must have a touch-tone telephone. We assign a personal  
security code ("PSC") number to you after we receive your completed enrollment  
form.                                                                           

We have established procedures to reasonably confirm the genuineness of         
instructions communicated to us by telephone when using the AIM System. The     
procedures require personal identification information, including your PSC      
number, prior to acting on telephone instructions, and providing written        
confirmation of the transfers. Thus, we will not be liable for following        
telephone instructions we reasonably believe to be genuine.                     

A transfer request will be effective on the Business Day we receive the request.
We will confirm all transfers in writing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YOUR RIGHT TO CANCEL WITHIN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS 

If for any reason you are not satisfied with your Certificate, you may return it
to us for a refund. To exercise this cancellation right, you must mail the      
Certificate directly to our Processing Office within 10 days after you receive  
it. In some states, this "free look" period may be longer.                      

Your refund will equal your contributions under the Certificate or, if greater, 
with respect to contributions allocated to the Funds, your account value,       
computed on the date we receive your Certificate.                               

We follow these same procedures if you change your mind before you receive your 
Certificate, but after you make a contribution. Please see "Tax Information" for
possible consequences of canceling your Certificate.                            

If you fully convert an existing Regular IRA Certificate to a Roth IRA          
Certificate, you may cancel your Roth IRA Certificate and return to a Regular   
IRA Certificate by following the instructions in the request for full conversion
form available from our Processing Office.

DETERMINING YOUR CERTIFICATE'S VALUE                                            

                                                                              14

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We credit the full amount of your contributions under your Certificate. At any  
time, the value of your Certificate is the "account balance" in the Funds and   
the GRAs to which you have allocated contributions. These amounts are subject to
certain fees and charges that are reflected in your account balance, as         
applicable. See "Charges and Expenses."                                         

We refer to the amount of the account balance attributable to the GRAs as their 
"cash value." The cash value of a GRA guarantee period reflects a withdrawal    
charge, as described below.                                                     

YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE IN THE FUNDS                                               

Your contributions to one or more of the Funds are, in turn, invested in shares 
of a corresponding Portfolio. The value of your interest in each Fund is        
measured by "units" that are purchased with your contributions. Your units will 
increase or decrease in value as though you had invested in the corresponding   
Portfolio's shares directly. Your account balance, however, will decrease by the
amount of the fees and charges that we deduct under the Certificate. Your       
account balance will also decrease by the dollar amount of any withdrawals that 
you make.                                                                       

We determine the number of units of a Fund you purchase by dividing the amount  
of your contribution by the Fund's unit value for the Business Day on which we  
receive your contribution. On any day, the value of your interest in a Fund     
equals the number of units credited to your Certificate under that Fund,        
multiplied by the value for one unit. The number of your units in any Fund does 
not change unless you make additional contributions, make a withdrawal, or      
transfer amounts between investment options.                                    

YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE IN THE GRAS                                                

Your account balance in the GRAs, represented by their cash value, is equal to  
your contributions and transfers to those options, plus accrued interest, less  
withdrawals and transfers out of the GRAs and charge deductions. The cash value 
of your GRAs will be less any withdrawal charge that applies on withdrawals,    
including transfers, from any of your GRA guarantee periods prior to maturity.  
Thus, if you withdrew an amount from a GRA period, before the maturity date, we 
would pay you the cash value. Please see "The Guaranteed Rate Accounts" in the  
SAI for more information.

TRANSFERRING YOUR MONEY AMONG INVESTMENT OPTIONS                                

                                                                              15

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At any time before the date annuity benefit payments begin, you can transfer    
some or all of your account balance among the investment options. Withdrawals or
transfers from the GRAs before a maturity date are restricted and may be subject
to a withdrawal charge. See "Charges and Expenses."                             

You may request a transfer by telephone using our AIM System. Transfer requests 
should specify:                                                                 

o  your Social Security number,                                                 

o  the amounts or percentages to be transferred, and                            

o  the investment options to and from which the amounts are to be transferred.  

We will make transfers involving the Funds as of the Business Day we receive    
your transfer request and all necessary information.                            

Transfers are permitted to and from the guarantee periods of the GRAs, but      
transfers may not be made from one guarantee period to another, nor during the  
"open period" in calendar quarters when new guarantee periods are offered for   
GRAs. In the case of trustee-to-trustee transfers during the open period, we    
will impose a withdrawal charge. Transfers from a GRA guarantee period, like    
withdrawals, may be subject to a withdrawal charge.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WITHDRAWING YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE                                                

You can withdraw your account balance at any time before annuity benefits begin.
Withdrawals from the GRAs will be withdrawals of cash value, giving effect to   
any withdrawal charge. No withdrawal charge applies to withdrawals from any of  
the Funds.                                                                      

Partial withdrawals under a periodic distribution option are subject to certain 
restrictions that we describe below under "Choosing Your Retirement Payout
Options." Distributions under TSA Certificates may also be subject to certain   
restrictions. For the tax consequences and restrictions relating to withdrawals 
see "Tax Information" below and in the SAI.                                     

We will consider withdrawal requests that result in a total remaining account   
balance of less than $100 as a request to surrender your Certificate, unless you
tell us otherwise.                                                              

Your request for a withdrawal should be in writing on our specified form. For a 
partial withdrawal, you must specify the investment options from which you want 
to take the withdrawal. Otherwise, we will withdraw from each investment option 
on a pro rata basis. If you request a full surrender, you must also send us your
Certificate with the request. When we receive the information we require, the   
withdrawal or full surrender will become effective. If we receive only partial  
information, our Processing Office will contact you for complete instructions   
before processing your request.                                                 

SURRENDERING YOUR CERTIFICATE TO RECEIVE YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE                   

You may surrender your Certificate to receive your account balance at any time  
before you begin to receive annuity payments. For a surrender to be effective,  
we must receive your written request on our prescribed form at our Processing   
Office. We will determine your account balance on the date we receive the       
required information. All benefits under the Certificate will terminate as of   
that date.                                                                      

You may receive your account balance in a single sum payment or apply all or    
part of it to one or both of the annuity payout options described under         
"Choosing Your Annuity Payout Options" below. For the tax consequences of       
surrenders, see "Tax Information" below and in the SAI.                         

WHEN TO EXPECT PAYMENTS                                                         

Generally, we will fulfill requests for payments upon a withdrawal or surrender 
within seven calendar days after the date we receive all necessary information  
and documents we require in the circumstances. We may postpone such payments or 
application of proceeds for any period during which:                            

(1) the New York Stock Exchange is closed or restricts trading,                 

(2) sales of securities or determination of the fair value of a Fund's assets is
not reasonably practicable because of an emergency, or                  

(3) the SEC, by order, permits us to defer payment to protect persons remaining 
in the Funds.                                                           

CHOOSING YOUR RETIREMENT PAYOUT OPTIONS 

When you are ready to receive retirement benefits you have a choice of several  
options:                                                                        

o  Single sum benefit payment.                                                  

o  Periodic distribution option.                                                

o  Fixed full cash refund annuity.                                              

o  Other forms of annuities we may offer.                                       

If you choose a single sum benefit payment, your account value in the Funds and 
cash value in the GRAs will be applied to provide the benefit. The cash value   
may reflect a withdrawal charge.                                                

The same amounts will be applied to provide a periodic distribution option or   
the fixed full cash refund annuity under the Certificate, or any other optional 
fixed annuity we may offer. However, if you elect a periodic distribution or    
annuity, no withdrawal charge will be imposed on amounts derived from the GRAs.

ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTIONS                                                          

You can choose from among the following annuity payout options:                 

FULL CASH REFUND ANNUITY. This is the "normal form of annuity benefit." It      
provides a fixed annuity for the lifetime of the annuitant. The participant's   
beneficiary will receive a cash refund if, at the participant's death, the total
annuity payments do not equal the amount that we applied to provide the annuity.
This refund equals the difference between the amount applied to purchase the    
annuity and the annuity payments actually received.                             

Once fixed payments begin, the amount of each payment does not change. We       
determine the minimum amount from tables in the Certificate that show monthly   
payments for each $1,000 applied (after deduction of any applicable tax charges 
and the annuitization fee). If our group annuity rates for payment of proceeds  
or our rate for single premium immediate annuities then in effect produces a    
larger payment, we pay the larger benefit. We may change the amount of monthly  
payments shown in Certificates for new participants.                            

PERIODIC DISTRIBUTION OPTION. An annuity option that pays out your entire       
account balance in monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual installment        
payments over a period of at least three years, as you or your beneficiary      
choose. The payout period may not generally exceed applicable life expectancy   
limitations, as described in "Tax Information" in the SAI.                      

To calculate the amount of each payment, you specify a dollar amount or a time  
period. If a time period, we determine the amount of a payment by dividing the  
remaining account balances by the number of remaining payments. We make         
withdrawals pro-rata from each investment option. Currently, we distribute      
periodic payments from the GRAs without withdrawal charges. We retain the right 
to suspend these distributions from the GRAs in the future.                     

We require an initial monthly payment of at least $50 under the periodic        
distribution option. After payments begin, you may continue to transfer amounts 
among the investment options, according to our rules. By written notice, you may
make a partial withdrawal or elect to stop the periodic distribution payments   
and receive your remaining account balance in a single sum.                     

OTHER ANNUITIES OR OPTIONAL RETIREMENT BENEFITS. You may elect forms of fixed   
annuities, other than the normal form of annuity benefit, we offer, including   
joint and survivor annuities. Payments under life or joint life annuities that  
do not specify a minimum distribution period terminate with the death of the    
last surviving annuitant.                                                       

You may specify a minimum distribution period under which benefits continue to a
beneficiary. You may not specify a minimum distribution period that is greater  
than your life expectancy or the life expectancy of the beneficiary. If the     
beneficiary is someone other than your spouse, payments to the surviving        
beneficiary are limited as the Proposed Treasury Regulations provide.           

Once a life annuity takes effect, the annuitant may not redeem or change it to  
any other form of benefit. If payment under an annuity continues to a           
beneficiary, the beneficiary will have the right to redeem the annuity for its  
commuted value. An annuity payout is available only if the amount applied to pay
the annuity is $2,000 or more and results in an initial payment of at least $20.

If you are participating under a TSA program and have not chosen a retirement   
benefit the normal form of annuity will be provided unless the TSA provides     
otherwise. Under certain TSAs you may be required to elect a joint and survivor 
annuity payout unless your spouse consents in writing to a different election.  

You can choose the date annuity payments are to begin. This is your "retirement 
date." If you do not advise us of your retirement date, we will assume that it  
is the date you attain age 65. You can change your retirement date in writing,  
but the date must be the first day of a calendar month. Also, that date may not 
be later than the date applicable for the type of qualified plan in which you   
use the Certificate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have not already selected a form of annuity payout, we will send you a   
form on which you may do so or confirm that the normal form of annuity is to be 
provided. We will send the form six months before your retirement date. Your    
account balance will remain invested until we receive your instructions. Once   
you have selected a payout option and payments have begun, you may make no      
further change.                                                                 

The amount of the annuity payments will depend on:                              

o  the amount applied to purchase the annuity,                                  

o  the type of payout option you choose, and,                                   

o  in the case of a life annuity, your age (or your and your joint annuitant's  
ages) and in certain instances, gender.

CHARGES AND EXPENSES 

                                                                              19

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHARGES THAT EQUITABLE LIFE DEDUCTS                                             

We deduct the charges described below during the accumulation period, or if you 
elect either the fixed annuity option or the periodic distribution option. We   
will not increase these charges for the life of your Certificate, except as     
noted.                                                                          

PARTICIPANT SERVICE CHARGE 

On the last day of each calendar quarter, we charge your account balance to     
reimburse us for certain administration expenses under the Certificates, such as
salaries and other overhead costs, travel, legal, actuarial and accounting      
costs. The charge is up to $15 per year for SEP and SIMPLE IRA Certificates, and
up to $30 per year for Regular IRA, Roth IRA, and TSA Certificates. We deduct   
these charges from the amounts held in the investment options in accordance with
our administrative procedures then in effect.                                   

The participant service charge applicable to a Certificate depends on several   
factors. It will vary depending on:                                             

o  whether contributions are made by payroll deduction or direct contribution,  

o  the number of participants contributing through the same payroll deduction   
facility or group, and the total contributions that we receive from an    
affiliated group, and the nature of the group purchasing the Certificates,
   and the extent to which an employer provides services that we would otherwise
provide, and other circumstances that may have an impact on administrative
expenses.                                                                 

We reserve the right to change the participant service charge on advance written
notice, or to impose the charge on a less or more frequent basis. In no case,   
will the charge exceed $30 per year.                                            

ADMINISTRATION CHARGE                                                           

We impose a daily charge at the annual rate of 0.25% of the net assets of each  
Fund. The charge is to reimburse us for administration expenses not covered by  
the participant service charge. We reflect this charge in the computation of    
unit values for each Fund.                                                      

OTHER EXPENSES 

We also charge certain additional costs and expenses directly to the Funds.     
These include, among other things, certain expenses we incur in the operation of
the Funds, taxes, interest, SEC charges, and certain related expenses including 
printing of registration statements and amendments, outside auditing and legal  
expenses and recordkeeping.                                                     

We reflect these expenses in the unit values for each Fund.                     

CHARGES FOR STATE PREMIUM AND OTHER APPLICABLE TAXES                            

We deduct a charge for applicable taxes such as state premium taxes that your   
state may impose. If an annuity option is elected, we may deduct the charge from
the amount applied to provide the annuity or from contributions. If the periodic
distribution is elected we will deduct the charge from each payment when made.  
No charge is applied if you elect a single sum payment. The current tax charge  
varies by state and ranges from 0% to 2%.                                       

EXPENSES THAT THE TRUSTS INCUR                                                  

The Hudson River Trust and EQ Advisors Trust incur the following types of fees  
and expenses:                                                                   

o  Investment advisory fees ranging from 0.25% to 0.80%.                        

o  12b-1 fees of 0.25% applicable to Class IB shares of EQ Advisors Trust.      

o  Operating expenses, such as trustees' fees, independent auditors' fees, legal
counsel fees, administrative service fees, custodian fees, and liability  
insurance.                                                                

o  Investment-related expenses, such as brokerage commissions.

These expenses are reflected in the daily share price of each Portfolio. For    
more information about the calculation of these expenses, including applicable  
expense limitations, please refer to the prospectuses of the Trusts.            

CERTAIN EXPENSE LIMITATIONS                                                     

We will reimburse the Funds named below for certain expenses they incur in any  
calendar year, as follows:                                                      

ALLIANCE MONEY MARKET, ALLIANCE COMMON STOCK, ALLIANCE INTERMEDIATE GOVERNMENT  
SECURITIES AND ALLIANCE BALANCED FUNDS                                          

The types of expenses included are:                                             

o  Investment advisory fees and certain other expenses attributable to assets of
  the Funds invested of the corresponding Portfolio of The Hudson River Trust.

o  Administration expenses that the Funds bear directly.                        

The expenses subject to reimbursement do not include the following Portfolio    
expenses: interest, taxes, brokerage, and extraordinary expenses permitted by   
appropriate state regulatory authorities.                                       

The annual expense limitations, above which we will reimburse the Funds, are:   

o  1% of the Alliance Money Market Fund's average daily net assets.             

o  1.5% of the Alliance Common Stock, Alliance Intermediate Government          
   Securities, and Alliance Balanced Funds' respective average daily net assets.

We cannot change these expense limitations without the participant's consent.   

ALLIANCE HIGH YIELD, ALLIANCE AGGRESSIVE STOCK AND ALLIANCE GLOBAL FUNDS        

We reimburse these Funds for their aggregate expenses in excess of 1.5% of the  
value of their respective average daily net assets. We may change this voluntary
expense limitation at our discretion.                                           

ALLIANCE MONEY MARKET AND ALLIANCE INTERMEDIATE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES FUNDS     

If the amount of the respective management fees charged to the related          
Portfolios exceeds 0.35% of their average daily net asset value, we will        
reimburse the corresponding Funds for such excess. This expense limitation is a 
contractual right for participants who enrolled before May 1, 1987, and cannot  
be changed without the consent of those participants. We have voluntarily agreed
to put in place this expense limitation for participants who enrolled after     
May 1, 1987, and we reserve the right to discontinue this voluntary limitation  
at any time.                                                                    

LIFE ANNUITY ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE                                              

If you elect the fixed annuity option under the Certificate, at retirement we   
will deduct up to $350 from the amount applied to purchase the annuity. This    
amount is designed to reimburse us for administrative expenses we incur in      
processing the application for the annuity and issuing each monthly payment. The
specific amount of the charge will depend on your date of enrollment. We may    
give you a better annuity purchase rate than those currently guaranteed in the  
Certificates. In that case, the annuity administrative charge may be greater    
than $350, unless we otherwise provide in your Certificate.                     

SEP AND SIMPLE ENROLLMENT FEE                                                   

We charge a non-refundable fee of $25 upon the enrollment of each Participant in
a SEP or SIMPLE IRA. We collect the fee from the employer, or we deduct it from 
the first contribution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GUARANTEED RATE ACCOUNTS WITHDRAWAL CHARGE                                      

We impose a charge on withdrawals or transfers before the maturity of a GRA     
guarantee period. The charge is 7% of the amount withdrawn or transferred from  
the guarantee period, or, if less, the accumulated interest. The charge,        
however, does not apply:                                                        

o  at maturity of the GRA guarantee period;                                     

o  to withdrawals due to death or disability;                                   

o  when the periodic distribution installment option is elected; or             

o  when an annuity retirement option is elected.                                

However, the withdrawal charge applies to any other pre-maturity withdrawals at 
retirement.

PAYMENT OF DEATH AND DISABILITY BENEFIT                                         

                                                                              22

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YOUR BENEFICIARY AND PAYMENT OF DEATH BENEFIT                                   

You designate your beneficiary when you apply for your Certificate. You may     
change your designation by writing to our Processing Office. You may be limited 
as to the beneficiary you can designate in TSA Certificate.                     

The death benefit is equal to your account balance. We determine the amount of  
the death benefit as of the date we receive satisfactory proof of death and any 
required instructions as to the method of payment.                              

WHEN THE PARTICIPANT DIES BEFORE DISTRIBUTIONS BEGIN                            

If you die before distributions begin, we will pay the death benefit to your    
beneficiary.                                                                    

If the designated beneficiary is your surviving spouse, the distribution of the 
account balance may begin at the earlier of (a) the date you would have attained
age 70 1/2 or (b) the date the surviving spouse elects payment to commence.     
Depending on your election, we will pay the death benefit as a single sum, in   
periodic installments, as an annuity or as a combination of the three. If no    
death benefit election is in effect, the beneficiary may elect a single sum or  
an alternate form of benefit payment.                                           

WHEN THE PARTICIPANT DIES AFTER THE RETIREMENT DATE                             

If you die after distributions begin, the amount and payment mode of the        
distributions may continue to the beneficiary on the same basis as before your  
death, subject to minimum distribution rules.                                   

DISABILITY PAYMENT                                                              

In the case of disability (refer to your certificate for a definition of        
disability) before your retirement date, we will pay you the account balance.   
TSA plans may be subject to certain restrictions.

TAX INFORMATION 

                                                                              23

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TAX CHANGES                                                                     

Federal income tax rules include the United States laws in the Internal Revenue 
Code and Treasury Department Regulations, and Internal Revenue Service          
interpretations of the Internal Revenue Code. These tax rules may change. We    
cannot predict whether, when, or how these rules could change. Any change could 
affect Contracts purchased before the change.                                   

TAX-SHELTERED ANNUITY ARRANGEMENTS (TSAS)                                       

If you are an employee of a public educational institution or a tax-exempt      
organization described in Code Section 501(c)(3), your employer may purchase a  
TSA for you. Contributions to the TSA, whether they are made by your salary     
reduction or non-elective employer contributions, are not taxable to you,       
subject to annual limitations. Annuity payments, withdrawals or surrenders of   
the TSA are generally taxable to you. Premature withdrawals may be subject to an
additional 10% penalty on the taxable amount. In addition, amounts attributable 
to salary reduction contributions cannot be distributed before your age 59 1/2, 
death, disability, separation from service or hardship. In the event of         
hardship, only the salary reduction contributions can be distributed.           

INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES (REGULAR AND ROTH IRAs)                         

You may make compensation-based contributions, subject to annual limitations, to
individual retirement arrangements. For both Regular and Roth IRAs, you must    
have compensation at least equal to the amount of the contribution. Generally,  
$2,000 is the maximum amount of annual contributions you may make to all of your
Regular and Roth IRAs. You may deduct all or a part of your contribution to a   
Regular IRA depending on your income for the year.                              

You may make contributions to a Regular IRA until the year you reach age 70 1/2.
You may make contributions to a Roth IRA even after age 70 1/2, if you have     
compensation and your income is within specified federal income tax limits.     
These limits do not apply to rollover or custodian-to-custodian contributions   
into either kind of IRA. You and your nonworking spouse can together contribute,
annually, an aggregate maximum of $4,000 to Regular and Roth IRAs for you and   
your spouse (but no more than $2,000 to any one IRA certificate).               

Income credited to Regular IRAs is generally not taxable until you get a        
distribution from the Certificate. Distributions from Regular IRAs are generally
fully taxable as ordinary income. Roth IRA distributions are not taxable until  
all contributions to all of your Roth IRAs are recovered. After recovery of     
contributions, distributions are taxable. Beginning in 2003, in certain         
circumstances, Roth IRA distributions may be eligible to be fully non taxable.  
The taxable portion of certain early withdrawals from Regular and Roth IRAs may 
be subject to an additional 10% Federal income tax penalty.                     

IRAs UNDER SIMPLIFIED EMPLOYEE PENSION PLANS (SEPS AND SIMPLES)                 

An employer can establish a SEP for its employees and can make contributions to 
a SEP for each eligible employee. A Regular IRA funding a SEP is like other     
IRAs. If you are an eligible employee, you own the SEP. Most of the rules       
applicable to Regular IRAs also apply. One major difference is the amount of    
permissible contributions. Under contribution limits effective in 1999, an      
employer can annually contribute an amount for an employee up to the lesser of  
$24,000 or 15% of the employee's compensation. The employer makes this          
determination without taking into account its contribution to the employee's    
SEP. This limit may be subject to cost of living changes in future years.       

An eligible employer may establish a "SIMPLE" plan to contribute to special     
individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities for its       
employees (SIMPLE IRAs). A SIMPLE IRA is a form of IRA, which the employee owns.
Generally, the rules applicable to Regular IRAs discussed above apply, with     
certain differences, as follows:                                                

o  the employee salary reduction contribution is limited (up to $6,000 in 1999)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o  the employer must make contributions, generally a dollar-for-dollar, up to 3%
of the employee's compensation or a 2% non-elective contribution to all   
eligible employees;                                                       

o  employees who have not participated in the employer's SIMPLE IRA plan for at 
least two full years may be subject to an increased penalty tax on        
withdrawals or transfers of SIMPLE IRA funds.                             

Further discussion of tax aspects of TSA, Regular IRA, Roth IRA, SEP and SIMPLE 
IRA contributions, distributions and other matters is available in the SAI.

ABOUT EQUITABLE LIFE                                                            

We are The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States ("Equitable    
Life"), a stock life insurance company that issues the Certificates. We are a   
New York corporation and have been doing business since 1859. Equitable Life is 
a wholly owned subsidiary of The Equitable Companies, Inc., whose majority      
shareholder is AXA, a French insurance holding company. As a majority           
shareholder, and under its other arrangements with Equitable Life's parent, AXA 
exercises significant influence over the operations and capital structure of    
Equitable Life and its parent. Equitable Life's related companies, however, have
no legal responsibility to pay amounts that Equitable Life owes under the       
Certificates. During 1999, the Equitable Companies, Inc. plans to change its    
name to AXA Financial, Inc.                                                     

We manage over $347.5 billion in assets as of December 31, 1998. For over 100   
years we have been among the largest insurance companies in the United States.  
We are licensed to sell life insurance and annuities in all fifty states, the   
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our home office 
is located at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10104.                  

ABOUT SEPARATE ACCOUNT NO. 301                                                  

Each Fund is a subaccount of our Separate Account No. 301. We established       
Separate Account No. 301 in 1981 under special provisions of the New York       
Insurance Law. These provisions prevent creditors from any other business we    
conduct from reaching the assets we hold in our Separate Account No. 301 for    
owners of our variable annuity contracts, including the Certificates. The       
results of Separate Account No. 301's operations are accounted for without      
regard to our other operations. We are the legal owner of all of the assets in  
Separate Account No. 301 and may withdraw any amounts that exceed our reserves  
and other liabilities with respect to the Funds under our contracts.            

Separate Account No. 301 is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 
and is classified by that act as a "unit investment trust." The SEC, however,   
does not manage or supervise Equitable or Separate Account No. 301.             

Each subaccount (Fund) within Separate Account No. 301 invests solely in Class  
IA or Class IB shares, respectively, issued by the corresponding Portfolio of   
The Hudson River Trust and EQ Advisors Trust.                                   

We reserve the right, subject to compliance with laws that apply, to:           

(1) to add Funds to, or to remove Funds from, Separate Account No. 301, or to   
add other separate accounts;                                            

(2) combine any two or more Funds;                                              

(3) transfer the assets we determine to be the shares of the class of contracts 
to which the Certificates belong from any Fund to another Fund;         

(4) operate Separate Account No. 301 or any Fund as a management investment     
    company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (in which case, charges and
   expenses that otherwise would be assessed against an underlying mutual fund
would be assessed against Separate Account No. 301 or a Fund directly); 

(5) deregister Separate Account No. 301 under the Investment Company Act of     
1940;                                                                   

(6) restrict or eliminate any voting rights as to Separate Account No. 301; and 

(7) cause one or more Funds to invest some or all of their assets in one or more
other trusts or investment companies.                                   

ABOUT THE HUDSON RIVER TRUST AND EQ ADVISORS TRUST                              

Both of the Trusts are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and  
are classified as "open-end management investment companies," more commonly     
called mutual funds. Each Trust issues different series of shares relating to a 
different Portfolio of the Trust.                                               

The Trusts do not impose sales charges or "loads" for buying and selling their  
shares. All dividends and other distributions on a Trust's shares are reinvested
in full. The Board of Trustees of each Trust may establish additional

Portfolios or eliminate existing Portfolios at any time. More detailed          
information about the Trusts, their investment objectives, policies,            
restrictions, risks, expenses, the Rule 12b-1 plan relating to the Class IB     
shares of EQ Advisors Trust and other aspects of their operations, appears in   
their attached prospectuses, or in their SAIs, which are available upon request.

PROPOSED SUBSITUTION OF PORTFOLIOS. We are asking the SEC to approve the        
subsitution of 14 newly created Portfolios of the Eq Advisors Trust for The     
Hudson River Trust Portfolios currently available under the variable investment 
options (the "Substitution"). The EQ Advisors Trust Portfolios will have        
substantially identical investment objectives, strategies, and policies as those
of The Hudson River Trust Portfolios they would replace. The assets of any      
Portfolio of The Hudson River Trust underlying your contract would be           
transferred to the substituted EQ Advisors Trust Portfolio.                     

We believe that this Substitution will be in your best interest because you     
would have a single set of investment options with similar advisory structures. 
You also will have a single EQ Advisors Trust prospectus for all the Portfolios,
rather than the two separate prospectuses you now receive. EQ Financial         
Consultants Inc. will be the manager of the new EQ Advisors Trust Portfolios,   
and Alliance Capital Management L.P. will continue to provide the day-to-day    
advisory services to each of the new Portfolios.                                

You should note that:                                                           

o  No action is required on your part. You will not need to vote a proxy, file  
a new election, or take any other action if the SEC approves the          
Substitution.                                                             

o  The elections you have on file for allocating your account value and         
contributions will remain unchanged until you direct us otherwise.        

o  We will bear all expenses directly relating to the Substitution transaction. 

o  The management fees for the new Portfolios will be the same as those for the 
corresponding Portfolios of The Hudson River Trust. Certain of the new EQ 
Advisor Trust Portfolios may have slightly higher expense ratios.         

o  On the effective date of the Substitution transaction, your account value    
(i.e., the units you own) in the variable investment options will be the  
same as before the transaction.                                           

o  The Substitution will have no tax consequences for you.                      

Please review the EQ Advisors Trust prospectus that accompanies this prospectus.
It contains more information about the Trust, including its management          
structure, advisory arrangements, and general fees and expenses that will be of 
interest to you.                                                                

Subject to SEC approval, we expect the Substitution to be completed in the fall 
of 1999. It will affect everyone who has a balance in The Hudson River Trust    
Portfolios at that time. Of course, you may transfer your account value among   
the investment options, as usual.                                               

We will notify you when we receive SEC approval, and again when the Substitution
is complete.                                                                    

ABOUT THE GENERAL ACCOUNT                                                       

Our general account supports all of our policy and contract guarantees,         
including those that apply to the guaranteed rate options, and our general      
obligations.                                                                    

The general account is subject to regulation and supervision by the Insurance   
Department of the State of New York and to the insurance laws and regulations of
all jurisdictions where we are authorized to do business. Because of exemptions 
and exclusionary provisions that apply, interests in the general account have   
not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The general account is not
an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.                 

We have been advised that the staff of the SEC has not reviewed the portions of 
this prospectus that relate to the general account. The disclosure, however, may
be subject to certain provisions of the federal securities laws relating to the 
accuracy and completeness of statements made in prospectuses.                   

DATES AND PRICES AT WHICH CERTIFICATE EVENTS OCCUR                              

We describe below the general rules for when, and at what prices, events under  
your Certificate will occur. Other portions of this prospectus describe         
circumstances that may cause exceptions. We generally do not repeat those       
exceptions below.                                                               

BUSINESS DAY 

Our Business Day is generally any day that the New York Stock Exchange is open  
for trading. Our Business Day ends at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time for purposes of   
determining the date when we apply contributions and process any other          
transaction requests. We will apply contributions and process any other         
transaction requests when we receive them along with all the required           
information.                                                                    

If your contribution, transfer or any other transaction request, containing all 
the required information, reaches us on a non-Business Day or after 4:00 on a   
Business Day, we will use the next Business Day.                                

CONTRIBUTIONS AND TRANSFERS                                                     

o  We invest contributions allocated to the Funds at the value next determined  
after the close of the Business Day.                                      

o  Contributions allocated to a GRA will receive the interest rate for that GRA 
in effect for that Business Day.                                          

o  We will make transfers to or from Funds at the value next determined after   
the close of the Business Day.                                            

o  Transfers to a GRA will be based on the interest rate for that GRA in effect 
for the Business Day of the transfer.                                     

ABOUT YOUR VOTING RIGHTS                                                        

As the owner of the shares of The Hudson River Trust and EQ Advisors Trust, we  
have the right to vote on certain matters involving the Portfolios, such as:    

o  The election of Trustees.                                                    

o  The ratification of independent auditors selected for each Trust.            

o  Any other matters described in the prospectuses for the Trusts or requiring a
shareholders' vote under the Investment Company Act of 1940.              

We will give Certificate owners the opportunity to instruct us how to vote the  
number of shares attributable to their Certificates if a shareholder vote is    
taken. If we do not receive instructions in time from all Certificate owners, we
will vote the shares of a Portfolio for which no instructions have been received
in the same proportion as we vote shares of that Portfolio for which we have    
received instructions. We will also vote any shares that we are entitled to vote
directly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

because of amounts we have in a Portfolio in the same proportions that          
Certificate owners vote.                                                        

VOTING RIGHTS OF OTHERS                                                         

Currently, we control each Trust. EQ Advisors Trust shares are sold only to our 
separate accounts and an affiliated qualified plan trust. The Hudson River Trust
shares are held by other separate accounts of ours and by separate accounts of  
insurance companies unaffiliated with us. Shares held by these separate accounts
will probably be voted according to the instructions of the owners of insurance 
policies and contracts issued by those insurance companies. While this will     
dilute the effect of the voting instructions of the Certicate owners, we        
currently do not foresee any disadvantages because of this. The Hudson River    
Trust Board of Trustees intends to monitor events in order to identify any      
material irreconcilable conflicts that may arise and to determine what action,  
if any, should be taken in response. If we believe that a response to any of    
those events insufficiently protects our Certificate owners, we will see to it  
that appropriate action is taken.                                               

SEPARATE ACCOUNT NO. 301 VOTING RIGHTS                                          

If actions relating to Separate Account No. 301 require Certificate owner       
approval, Certificate owners will be entitled to one vote for each unit they    
have in the Funds. We will cast votes attributable to any amounts we have in the
Funds in the same proportion as votes cast by Certificate owners.               

CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW                                                       

The voting rights we describe in this prospectus are created under applicable   
federal securities laws. To the extent that those laws or the regulations       
published under those laws eliminate the necessity to submit matters for        
approval by persons having voting rights in separate accounts of insurance      
companies, we reserve the right to proceed in accordance with those laws or     
regulations.                                                                    

ABOUT THE GROUP ANNUITY CONTRACTS 

The Certificates are issued under group annuity contracts between us and Chase  
Manhattan Bank, N.A. ("Chase"), whose sole purpose is to serve as a party to the
group annuity contracts. Chase has no responsibility for the administration of  
any of the retirement programs described in this prospectus, for payments to the
investment options or to Participants, or for any other duties other than to

If a retirement program funded by the Certificates is found not to qualify under
the Internal Revenue Code, we may terminate the Certificate and pay the         
participant, plan trustees or other designated person, the account balance. We  
will, however, make a deduction for any federal income tax payable by us because
of the non-qualification.                                                       

ABOUT OUR YEAR 2000 PROGRESS                                                    

Equitable Life relies upon various computer systems in order to administer your 
Certificate and operate the investment options. Some of these systems belong to 
service providers who are not affiliated with Equitable Life.                   

In 1995, Equitable Life began addressing the question of whether its computer   
systems would recognize the Year 2000 before, on or after January 1, 2000, and  
Equitable Life has identified those of its systems critical to business         
operations that were not Year 2000 compliant. By year end 1998, the work of     
modifying or replacing non-compliant systems was substantially completed.       
Equitable Life has begun comprehensive testing of its Year 2000 compliance and  
expects that the testing will be substantially completed by June 30, 1999.      
Equitable Life has contacted third-party services providers to seek             
confirmations that they are acting to address the Year 2000 issue with the goal 
of avoiding any material adverse effect on services provided to policyowners and
on operations of the investment options. Most third-party service providers have
provided Equitable Life confirmations of their Year 2000 compliance. Equitable  
Life believes it is on

schedule for substantially all such systems and services, including those       
considered to be mission-critical, to be confirmed as Year 2000 compliant,      
renovated, replaced or the subject of contingency plans, by June 30, 1999,      
except for one investment accounting system which is scheduled to be replaced by
August 31, 1999 and confirmed as Year 2000 compliant by September 30, 1999.     
Additionally, Equitable Life will be supplementing its existing business        
continuity and disaster recovery plans to cover certain categories of           
contingencies that could arise as a result of Year 2000 related failures. Year  
2000 specific contingency plans are anticipated to be in place by June 30, 1999.

There are many risks associated with Year 2000 issues, including the risk that  
Equitable Life's computer systems will not operate as intended. Additionally,   
there can be no assurance that the systems of third parties will be Year 2000   
compliant. Any significant unresolved difficulty related to the Year 2000       
compliance initiatives could result in an interruption in, or a failure of,     
normal business operations and, accordingly, could have a material adverse      
effect on our ability to administer your policy and operate the investment      
options.                                                                        

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the foregoing Year 2000 discussion is a 
"Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure" within the meaning of The Year 2000 Information
and Readiness Disclosure Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1 (1998).                          

ABOUT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS                                                         

Equitable Life and its affiliates are parties to various legal proceedings. In  
our view, none of these proceedings is likely to have a material adverse effect 
upon Separate Account No. 301, our ability to meet our obligations under the    
Certificates, or the distribution of the Certificates.                          

ABOUT OUR INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS                                               

The financial statements of Separate Account No. 301 as of December 31, 1998 and
for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 1998, and the        
financial statements of Equitable Life as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998 have been so      
included in the Statement of Additional Information (SAI), and incorporated by  
reference in the Prospectus, in reliance upon the reports of                    
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, given upon their authority 
as experts in accounting and auditing.                                          

TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP, COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENTS, LOANS, AND BORROWING            

You cannot assign or transfer ownership of a Regular IRA, Roth IRA, TSA, SEP, or
SIMPLE Certificate except by surrender to us. Loans are not available and you   
cannot assign Regular IRA, Roth IRA, TSA, SEP, and SIMPLE Certificates as       
security for a loan or other obligation.                                        

You may direct the transfer of account balances under your Regular IRA, Roth    
IRA, TSA, SEP, or SIMPLE Certificate to another similar arrangement. We can     
impose a withdrawal charge if one applies.                                      

UNDERWRITER                                                                     

EQ Financial Consultants, Inc. ("EQ Financial"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of   
Equitable Life, performs all sales functions for the Certificates and may be    
deemed to be the principal underwriter of Separate Account No. 301. EQ Financial
is registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. 
EQ Financial's principal business address is 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New
York, NY 10104. During 1999, EQ Financial plans to change its name to AXA       
Advisors, Inc. The offering of the Certificates is intended to be continuous. We
have paid no underwriting commissions during any of the last three fiscal years 
with respect to units of interest under the Certificates.

REPORTS AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION                                              

Before payments start under your Certificate, we will send you, at least        
annually, a report showing as of a specified date: (1) the number of units you  
have credited to each Fund, (2) the unit values, (3) your account balance in    
each Fund and GRA and the total balance and (4) the cash values of your GRAs.   
Similar reports will be sent to you if you are receiving payments under the     
periodic distribution option. All transactions will be individually confirmed.  

As required by the Investment Company Act of 1940, each participant will be     
sent, semi-annually, a report containing financial statements and a list of the 
securities held by each Portfolio.                                              

As permitted by the SEC's rules, we omitted certain portions of the registration
statement filed with the SEC from this prospectus and SAI. You may obtain the   
omitted information by: (1) requesting a copy of the registration statement from
the SEC's principal office in Washington, D.C., and paying prescribed fees, or  
(2) by accessing the EDGAR Database at the SEC's web site at http://www.sec.gov.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE                                                          

                                                                              30

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We provide the following tables to show two different measurements of the       
investment performance of the Funds. We include these tables because they may be
of general interest to you. THE RESULTS SHOWN REFLECT PAST PERFORMANCE. THEY DO 
NOT INDICATE HOW THE FUNDS MAY PERFORM IN THE FUTURE. THEY ALSO DO NOT REPRESENT
THE RESULTS EARNED BY ANY PARTICULAR INVESTOR. YOUR RESULTS WILL DIFFER.        

Tables 1 and 2 show the rates of return of the Funds on a year-by-year and an   
annualized basis. These tables take into account all asset-based charges under  
the Certificate, but do not reflect the participant service charge. The results 
shown are based on the actual historical investment experience of the Portfolio 
in which the Fund invests. All rates of return presented are time-weighted and  
include reinvestment of investment income, including interest and dividends.    

BENCHMARKS                                                                      

Table 2 compares the performance of the Funds to market indices that serve as   
benchmarks. Market indices are not subject to any charges for investment        
advisory fees, brokerage commission or other operating expenses typically       
associated with a managed portfolio. Also, they do not reflect any Certificate  
charges. Comparisons with these benchmarks, therefore, may be of limited use. We
include them because they are widely known and may help you to understand the   
universe of securities from which each Portfolio is likely to select its        
holdings. Benchmark data reflect the reinvestment of dividend income. The       
benchmarks include:

TAX INFORMATION 

This section of the SAI discusses the current federal income tax rules that     
generally apply to the retirement programs described in the prospectus. The tax 
rules can differ, depending on the type of program, whether Regular IRA, Roth   
IRA, TSA, SEP IRA, or SIMPLE IRA. Therefore, we discuss the tax aspects of each 
type of Certificate separately.                                                 

We cannot provide detailed information on all tax aspects of the Certificates.  
Moreover, the tax aspects that apply to a particular participant's Certificate  
may vary depending on the facts applicable to that person. We do not discuss    
state income and other state taxes, federal income tax and withholding rules    
for non-U.S. taxpayers, or federal gift and estate taxes. Transfers of the      
Certificates, rights under the Certificates, or payments under the Certificates 
may be subject to gift or estate taxes. You should not rely only on this        
document, but should consult your tax adviser before you purchase.              

Federal income tax rules include the United States laws in the Internal Revenue 
Code, and Treasury Department Regulations and Internal Revenue Service          
interpretations of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain retirement plans may also 
be subject to The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended   
("ERISA"), which The Department of Labor ("DOL") administers. These rules may   
change. We cannot predict whether, when, or how these rules could change. Any   
change could affect Certificates purchased before the change.                   

TAX SHELTERED ANNUITY ARRANGEMENTS (TSAS)                                       

An employer eligible to maintain a TSA plan (also referred to as a "403(b)"     
plan, program, or arrangement) for its employees may make contributions to an   
annuity contract purchased for the benefit of the employee. These               
contributions, if properly made, will not be currently taxable compensation to  
the employee. Moreover, the employee will not be taxed on the earnings in the   
annuity contract until he/she takes distributions.                              

Two different types of employers are eligible to maintain 403(b) plans: public  
schools and specified tax-exempt organizations under Section 501(c)(3) of the   
Code.                                                                           

CONTRIBUTIONS TO TSAS                                                           

Annual Contributions to TSAs                                                

Annual contributions to TSAs made through the employer's payroll are limited.   
(Tax-free transfer or tax-deferred rollover contributions from another 403(b)   
arrangement are not subject to these annual contribution limits.)               

Commonly, some or all of the contributions to the TSA are made under a salary   
reduction agreement between the employee and the employer. These contributions  
are called "salary reduction" or "elective deferral" contributions. However, a  
TSA can also be wholly or partially funded through nonelective employer         
contributions or after-tax employee contributions. To determine the permissible 
annual contribution to the participant's TSA, a participant generally must      
calculate tentative annual contributions under several formulas.                

Generally, this contribution limit is the lowest of the following:              

 o    the annual "maximum exclusion allowance" for the employee in Section
403(b)(2) of the Code,                                        

o    the annual limit under Section 415 of the Code on employer         
contributions to defined contribution plans and               

o    the annual limit on all elective deferrals.                        

If contributions to a TSA exceed the applicable limit in any year, the excess   
will be taxable to the employee as ordinary income. In certain situations, we   
may distribute excess contributions to avoid tax penalties.                     

SAI-2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The annual maximum exclusion allowance for the employee under Section 403(b)(2) 
of the Code is 20% of includable compensation times years of service minus      
previous contributions to all qualified plans, 403(b) plans and Section 457     
plans the participant participates with this employer.                          

The annual limit under Section 415 of the Code on employer contributions to     
defined contribution plans is the lesser of $30,000 or 25% of compensation,     
disregarding compensation over $160,000 in 1999.                                

In 1999, the annual limit on all salary reduction or elective deferral          
contributions for an employee under all plans of any employer is generally      
$10,000. Note, however, that the maximum salary reduction contribution by an    
employee who participates in both a TSA arrangement and a Section 457 plan is   
the lower maximum allowed under Section 457 of the Code. In 1999, this maximum  
is $8,000.                                                                      

Any excess deferral contributions not withdrawn by April 15 after the year of   
the deferral may cause the contract to fail TSA rules.                          

Special provisions may allow "catch-up" contributions to compensate for smaller 
contributions in prior years.                                                   

ROLLOVER OR DIRECT TRANSFER CONTRIBUTIONS TO TSAS                               

You may make rollover contributions to your TSA Certificate from TSAs under     
Section 403(b) of the Code (including custodial accounts under Section          
403(b)(7) of the Code). See "Tax Deferred Rollovers and Transfers" below for a  
description of rollovers. With appropriate written documentation, we will       
accept rollover contributions from "conduit IRAs" for TSA funds. See "Regular   
Individual Retirement Annuities" below for a description of "Conduit IRAs."     

We will also accept direct transfer of TSA funds under Revenue Ruling 90-24 if: 

    o    you provide us with acceptable documentation as to the source of funds,
and                                                           

o    the Certificate that receives the funds has provisions at least as 
restrictive as the source Certificate.                        

DISTRIBUTIONS FROM TSAS                                                         
WITHDRAWAL LIMITATIONS                                                      

You may not be able to withdraw or take payments from all or part of your TSA   
until you:                                                                      

o    attain age 59 1/2,                                                 

o    die,                                                               

o    are disabled (special Federal income tax definition),              

   o    separate from service with the employer who provided the TSA funds, or

  o    suffer a financial hardship. (Hardship withdrawals are limited to the
   amount of your salary reduction contributions, without earnings.)

These restrictions apply to salary reduction (elective deferral) contributions  
and earnings on those contributions.                                            

These restrictions do not apply to the value of your TSA Certificate as of      
December 31, 1988 attributable to salary reduction contributions and earnings.  
If you directly transfer any amounts to this Certificate you must properly      
notify us in writing at our Processing Office of your December 31, 1988 account 
balance. Otherwise, we will view all amounts transferred as subject to          
restrictions.                                                                   

TAX TREATMENTS OF DISTRIBUTIONS FROM TSAS                                       

Amounts held under TSAs are generally not subject to Federal income tax until   
benefits are distributed.                                                       

 SAI-3

P-->49741st Page of 114TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 41st
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributions include withdrawals and annuity payments from your TSA. Death     
benefits paid to a beneficiary are also taxable distributions. Unless an        
exception applies, amounts distributed from TSAs are includible as ordinary     
income. If you have made after-tax contributions you will have a tax basis in   
your Certificate which will be recovered tax-free. You may have a tax basis in  
the Certificate if the employer made contributions that were included in your   
gross income in the year of the employer's contribution, for example.           

The amount of any partial distribution from a TSA before the annuity starting   
date is generally taxable as ordinary income to you except to the extent the    
distribution is a withdrawal of your basis. Distributions are generally pro     
rata withdrawals of tax basis and earnings on that tax basis.                   

If you elect an annuity distribution, the nontaxable portion of each payment is 
(1) your tax basis in the contract divided by (2) an expected return determined 
under IRS tables. The balance of each payment is taxable. The entire amount of  
the payments you receive after you recover your tax basis is taxable. If you    
die before recovering your tax basis and the annuity has a refund feature, the  
beneficiary of the refund may recover the remaining tax basis as payments are   
made. If you (and your beneficiary under a joint and survivor annuity) die      
before recovering the entire basis of the annuity, a deduction is allowed on    
your (or your beneficiary's) final tax return.                                  

EARLY DISTRIBUTION PENALTY TAX 

Distributions from a TSA will be subject to an additional 10% penalty tax,      
unless the distribution occurs on or after you:                                 

o    die,                                                               

o    are disabled (special Federal income tax definition),              

o    reach age 59 1/2                                                   

o    separate from service and elect a payout over your life or life    
         expectancy (or joint and survivor lives or life expectancies of you and
your beneficiary)                                             

o    separate from service after age 55 (any form of payout), or        

o    use the distribution to pay certain extraordinary medical expenses 
(special Federal income tax definition).                      

TAX DEFERRED ROLLOVERS AND TRANSFERS 

You may roll over an "eligible rollover distribution" into another eligible     
retirement plan, either as a direct rollover or as a rollover you do yourself   
within 60 days after you receive the distribution. To the extent that a         
distribution is rolled over, it remains tax deferred.                           

A distribution from a TSA may be rolled over to another TSA that will accept    
rollover contributions, or to a Regular IRA. Death benefits received by a       
spousal beneficiary may be rolled over only to a Regular IRA.                   

The taxable portion of most distributions will be eligible for rollover.        
However, Federal income tax rules exclude certain distributions from rollover   
treatment, including (1) periodic payments for life or for a period of 10 years 
or more, (2) hardship withdrawals, and (3) any required minimum distributions.  
We discuss eligible rollover distributions in greater detail under "Federal and
State Income Tax Withholding and Information Reporting," below, including rules 
requiring 20% income tax withholding on certain distributions from TSAs.        

Amounts held under TSAs may be directly transferred (under Revenue Ruling       
90-24) to another TSA issuer in a tax-free transaction, if the successor TSA    
contains the same or greater restrictions as the original TSA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS 

The Required Minimum Distribution rules discussed below under "Traditional
Individual Retirement Annuities (Regular IRAs)--Required Minimum Distributions" 
apply to TSAs, with this difference:                                            

When you have to take the first required minimum distribution:                  

The minimum distribution rules force TSA participants to start computing and    
taking annual distributions from their TSAs by a required date. When minimum    
distributions must begin depends on, among other things, your age and           
retirement status. Generally, you must take the first required minimum          
distribution with respect to the calendar year in which you turn age 70 1/2. You
may be entitled to delay commencement of required minimum distributions for all 
or part of your account balance until after age 70 1/2. These exceptions apply  
to the following individuals:                                                   

o    For TSA participants who have not retired from service with the    
      employer who provided the funds for the TSA by the calendar year the
       participant turns age 70 1/2, the Required Beginning Date for minimum
     distributions is extended to April 1 following the calendar year of
retirement.                                                   

o    TSA plan participants may also delay commencement to age 75 of the 
     portion of their account balance attributable to their December 31,
1986 TSA account balance, even if retired at age 70 1/2.      

IRAs                                                                            

GENERAL DISCUSSION OF IRAs                                                      

"IRA" stands for individual retirement arrangement and the two basic types of   
such arrangements, individual retirement accounts and individual retirement     
annuities. In an individual retirement account, a trustee or custodian holds    
the assets for the benefit of the IRA owner. The assets can include mutual      
funds and certificates of deposit. In an individual retirement annuity, an      
insurance company issues an annuity contract that serves as the IRA.            

There are several types of IRAs, as follows:                                    

o    "Regular IRAs," typically funded on a pre-tax basis;               

  o    Roth IRAs, first available in 1998, funded on an after-tax basis; and

o    SEP-IRAs and SIMPLE-IRAs, issued and funded in connection with     
employer-sponsored retirement plans.                          

Regardless of the type of IRA, your ownership interest in the IRA cannot be     
forfeited. You or your beneficiaries who survive you are the only ones who can  
receive the IRA's benefits or payments.                                         

You can hold your IRA assets in as many different accounts and annuities as you 
would like, as long as you meet the rules for setting up and making             
contributions to IRAs. However, if you own multiple IRAs, you may be required   
to aggregate IRA values or contributions for tax purposes. For further          
information about individual retirement arrangements, you can read Internal     
Revenue Service Publication 590 (Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)).    
This Publication is usually updated annually, and can be obtained from any IRS  
district office or the IRS Website (www.irs.ustreas.gov).                       

The Equitable 300+ Series IRAs are designed to qualify as "individual           
retirement annuities" under Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. This   
SAI and the prospectus contain the information that the Internal Revenue        
Service ("IRS") requires you to have before you purchase an IRA. This section   
of the SAI covers some of the special tax rules that apply to IRAs. The next    
section covers Roth IRAs. We do not discuss Education IRAs in this SAI because  
they are not available in individual retirement annuity form.                   

We have received favorable opinion letters from the IRS approving the form of   
Group Individual Retirement Annuity No. 301-10,001-93 as a Regular IRA. The     
Roth IRA endorsement is issued pursuant to an IRS Form and is deemed approved   
as to form. This IRS approval is a determination only as to the

form of the annuity. It does not represent a determination of the merits of the 
annuity as an investment. The IRS approval does not address every feature       
possibly available under the Equitable 300+ Series IRAs.                        

Cancellation                                                                

You can cancel an Equitable 300+ Series IRA Certificate by following the        
directions under "Your Right to Cancel within a Certain Number of Days" in the  
prospectus. You can cancel an Equitable 300+ Series Roth IRA certificate issued 
as a result of a full conversion of an Equitable 300+ Series Regular IRA        
certificate by following the instructions in the request for full conversion    
form. The form is available from our Processing Office or your registered       
representative. If you cancel a Regular IRA or Roth IRA certificate, we may     
have to withhold tax, and we must report the transaction to the IRS. A          
Certificate cancellation could have unfavorable tax impact.                     

You must also use our form to recharacterize Roth IRA Certificates as Regular   
IRAs and vice versa.                                                            

TRADITIONAL INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES (REGULAR IRAs)                      

Contributions to Regular IRAs                                               

Individuals may make three different types of contributions to a Regular IRA:   

o    "regular" contributions out of earned income or compensation;      

o    tax-free "rollover" contributions; or                              

o    direct custodian-to-custodian transfers from other Regular IRAs    
("direct transfers").                                         

Limits on Contributions                                                     

Generally, $2,000 is the maximum amount of regular contributions that you may   
make to all IRAs (including Roth IRAs) in any taxable year. When your earnings  
are below $2,000, your earned income or compensation for the year is the most   
you can contribute. This $2,000 limit does not apply to rollover contributions  
or direct custodian-to-custodian transfers into a Regular IRA. You have to stop 
making Regular IRA contributions for the tax year in which you reach age 70 1/2 
or any tax year after that.                                                     

Special Rules for Spouses                                                   

If you are married and file a joint income tax return, you and your spouse may  
aggregate your compensation to determine the permissible amount of              
contributions to Regular IRAs (and Roth IRAs discussed below). Even if one      
spouse has no compensation or compensation under $2,000, married individuals    
filing jointly can contribute up to $4,000 for any taxable year to any          
combination of Regular IRAs and Roth IRAs. (Any contributions to Roth IRAs      
reduce the ability to contribute to Regular IRAs and vice versa.) The maximum   
amount may be less if earned income is less and the other spouse has made IRA   
contributions. No more than a combined total of $2,000 can be contributed       
annually to either spouse's Traditional and Roth IRAs. Each spouse owns his or  
her Regular IRAs and Roth IRAs even if contributions were funded by the other   
spouse. A working spouse age 70 1/2 or over can contribute up to the lesser of  
$2,000 or 100% of "earned income" to a Regular IRA for a nonworking spouse      
until the year in which the nonworking spouse reaches age 70 1/2.               

Deductibility of Contributions                                              

The amount of Regular IRA contributions that you can deduct for a tax year      
depends on whether you are covered by an employer-sponsored tax-favored         
retirement plan, as defined under special federal income tax rules. Your W-2    
form will indicate whether or not you are covered by such a retirement plan.    

IF YOU ARE NOT COVERED BY A RETIREMENT PLAN DURING ANY PART OF THE YEAR, you    
can make fully deductible contributions to your Regular IRAs for each tax year  
up to $2,000 or, if less, your earned income.

IF YOU ARE COVERED BY A RETIREMENT PLAN DURING ANY PART OF THE YEAR, and your   
adjusted gross income ("AGI") is BELOW THE LOWER DOLLAR FIGURE IN A PHASE-OUT   
RANGE, you can make fully deductible contributions to your Regular IRAs for     
each tax year up to $2,000 or, if less, your earned income.                     

IF YOU ARE COVERED BY A RETIREMENT PLAN DURING ANY PART OF THE YEAR, and your   
AGI falls within a PHASE-OUT range, you can make PARTIALLY DEDUCTIBLE           
CONTRIBUTIONS to your Regular IRAs.                                             

IF YOU ARE COVERED BY A RETIREMENT PLAN DURING ANY PART OF THE YEAR, and your   
AGI falls ABOVE THE HIGHER FIGURE IN THE PHASE-OUT RANGE, you may not deduct    
any of your contribution to your Regular IRAs.                                  

If you are single and covered by a retirement plan during any part of the       
taxable year, the deduction for IRA contributions phases out with AGI between   
$31,000 and $41,000 in 1999. This range will increase every year until 2005     
when the range is $50,000-$60,000.                                              

If you are married and file a joint return, and you are covered by a retirement 
plan during any part of the taxable year, the deduction for Regular IRA         
contributions phases out with AGI between $51,000 and $61,000 in 1999. This     
range will increase every year until 2007 when the range is $80,000-$100,000.   

Married individuals filing separately and living apart at all times are not     
considered married for purposes of this deductible contribution calculation.    
Generally, the active participation in an employer-sponsored retirement plan of 
an individual is determined independently for each spouse. Where spouses have   
"married filing jointly" status, however, the maximum deductible Regular IRA    
contribution for an individual who is not an active employee (but whose spouse  
is an active participant) is phased out for taxpayers with AGI of between       
$150,000 and $160,000.                                                          

To determine the deductible amount of the contribution in 1999, you determine   
AGI and subtract $31,000 if you are single, or $51,000 if you are married and   
file a joint return with your spouse. The resulting amount is your Excess AGI.  
You then determine the limit on the deduction for Regular IRA contributions     
using the following formula:                                                    

                                                                [Download Table]
                                                                               
($10,000-Excess AGI)     times     $2,000               Equals     the Adjusted
  Divided by             x         (or earned           =          deductible  
  $10,000                          income, if less)                contribution
                                                                   limit       

Nondeductible Contributions                                                 

If you are not eligible to deduct part or all of the Regular IRA contribution,  
you may still make nondeductible contributions on which earnings will           
accumulate on a tax-deferred basis. The combined deductible and nondeductible   
contributions to your Regular IRA (or the nonworking spouse's Regular IRA) may  
not, however, exceed the maximum $2,000 per person limit. See "Excess
Contributions" below. You must keep your own records of deductible and          
nondeductible contributions in order to prevent double taxation on the          
distribution of previously taxed amounts. See "Withdrawals, Payments and
Transfer of Funds Out of Regular IRAs" below.                                   

If you are making nondeductible contributions in any taxable year, or you have  
made nondeductible contributions to a Regular IRA in prior years and are        
receiving distributions from any Regular IRA, you must file the required        
information with the IRS. Moreover, if you are making nondeductible Regular IRA 
contributions, you must retain all income tax returns and records pertaining to 
such contributions until interests in all Regular IRAs are fully distributed.   

When You Can Make Contributions                                             

If you file your tax returns on a calendar year basis like most taxpayers, you  
have until the April 15 return filing deadline (without extensions) of the      
following calendar year to make your Regular IRA contributions for a tax year.

Excess Contributions                                                        

Excess contributions to Regular IRAs are subject to a 6% excise tax for the     
year in which made and for each year after until withdrawn. The following are   
excess contributions to Regular IRAs:                                           

o    "regular" contributions of more than $2,000;                       

o    "regular" contributions of more than earned income for the year, if
that amount is under $2,000;                                  

o    "regular" contributions to a Regular IRA made after you reach age  
70 1/2; and                                                   

 o    rollover contributions of amounts that are not eligible to be rolled
   over (for example, after-tax contributions to a qualified plan or
minimum distributions required to be made after age 70 1/2).  

You can avoid the excise tax by withdrawing an excess contribution (rollover or 
"regular") before the due date (including extensions) for filing your federal   
income tax return for the year. If it is an excess "regular" Regular IRA        
contribution, you cannot take a tax deduction for the amount withdrawn. The     
excess contribution withdrawn is not includable in income and is not subject to 
the 10% additional penalty tax on early distributions (discussed below under    
"Early Distribution Penalty Tax"). You do have to withdraw any earnings         
attributable to the excess contribution. The withdrawn earnings would be        
includable in your gross income and could be subject to the 10% penalty tax.    

Even after the due date for filing your return, you may withdraw an excess      
rollover contribution, without income inclusion or 10% penalty, if (1) the      
rollover was from a qualified retirement plan to a Regular IRA, (2) the excess  
contribution was due to incorrect information that the plan provided, and (3)   
you took no tax deduction for the excess contribution.                          

ROLLOVERS AND TRANSFERS 

You may make rollover contributions to a Regular IRA from these sources:        

o    qualified plans;                                                   

o    TSAs (including Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b)(7) custodial  
accounts); and                                                

o    other Regular IRAs.                                                

You may also recharacterize Roth IRA funds as Regular IRA funds, in accordance  
with special federal income tax rules, if you use the forms we prescribe.       

Any amount contributed to a Regular IRA after you attain age 70 1/2 must be net 
of your required minimum distribution for the year in which the rollover or     
direct transfer contribution is made.                                           

ROLLOVERS FROM QUALIFIED PLANS OR TSAS                                          

There are two ways to do rollovers:                                             

o    Do it yourself                                                     

     You actually receive a distribution that can be rolled over and you
         roll it over to a Regular IRA within 60 days after the date you receive
         the funds. The distribution from your qualified plan or TSA will be net
       of 20% mandatory federal income tax withholding. If you want, you can
    replace the withheld funds yourself and roll over the full amount.

o    Direct rollover                                                    

        You tell your qualified plan trustee or TSA issuer/custodian/fiduciary
      to send the distribution directly to your Regular IRA issuer. Direct
        rollovers are not subject to mandatory federal income tax withholding.

All distributions from a TSA or qualified plan are eligible rollover            
distributions, unless the distribution is:                                      

o    only after-tax contributions you made to the plan;                 

 o    "required minimum distributions" after age 70 1/2 or separation from
service;                                                      

 SAI-8

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o    a hardship withdrawal;                                             

  o    substantially equal periodic payments made at least annually for your
life (or life expectancy) or the joint lives (or joint life   
expectancies) of you and your designated beneficiary;         

    o    substantially equal periodic payments made for a specified period of 10
years or more;                                                

 o    if you have contributed too much, corrective distributions which fit
specified technical tax rules;                                

o    a loan that is treated as a deemed distribution;                   

o    a death benefit payment to a beneficiary who is not your surviving 
spouse; and                                                   

   o    a qualified domestic relations order distribution to a beneficiary who
is not your current spouse or former spouse.                  

ROLLOVERS FROM REGULAR IRAs TO REGULAR IRAs                                     

You may roll over amounts from one Regular IRA to one or more of your other     
Regular IRAs if you complete the transaction within 60 days after you receive   
the funds. You may make such a rollover only once in every 12-month period for  
the same funds. Trustee-to-trustee or custodian-to-custodian direct transfers   
are not rollover transactions. You can make these more frequently than once in  
every 12-month period.                                                          

The surviving spouse beneficiary of a deceased individual can roll over or      
directly transfer an inherited Regular IRA to one or more other Regular IRAs.   
Also, in some cases, Regular IRAs can be transferred on a tax-free basis        
between spouses or former spouses as a result of a court ordered divorce or     
separation decree.                                                              

WITHDRAWALS, PAYMENTS AND TRANSFERS OF FUNDS OUT OF REGULAR IRAs                

No Federal Income Tax Law Restrictions on Withdrawals                       

You can withdraw any or all of your funds from a Regular IRA at any time. You   
do not need to wait for a special event like retirement.                        

Taxation of Payments                                                        

Earnings in Regular IRAs are not taxable until you or your beneficiary receives 
them. Taxable payments or distributions include withdrawals from your           
Certificate, surrender of your Certificate and annuity payments from your       
Certificate. Death benefits are also taxable. Except as discussed below, the    
amount of any distribution from a Regular IRA is fully taxable as ordinary      
income.                                                                         

If you have ever made nondeductible IRA contributions to any Regular IRA (it    
does not have to be to this particular Regular IRA Certificate), those          
contributions are recovered tax free when you get distributions from any        
Regular IRA. You must keep permanent tax records of all of your nondeductible   
contributions to Regular IRAs. At the end of any year in which you have         
received a distribution from any Regular IRA, you compute the nontaxable        
portion of the distribution as follows:                                         

    o    divide (1) your total nondeductible Regular IRA contributions (less any
 amounts previously withdrawn tax free) by (2) the total account
      balances of all Regular IRAs you own at the end of the year plus all
Regular IRA distributions made during the year;               

  o    multiply this amount by all distributions from the Regular IRA during
the year.                                                     

In addition, a distribution is not taxable if:                                  

o    the amount received is a withdrawal of excess contributions, as    
described under "Excess Contributions" above;                 

  o    the entire amount received is rolled over to another Regular IRA (see
"Rollovers and Transfers" above); or                          

 SAI-9

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o    in certain limited circumstances, where the Regular IRA acts as a  
         "conduit," you roll over the entire amount into a qualified plan or TSA
        that accepts rollover contributions. To get this "conduit" Regular IRA
treatment:                                                    

     o    the source of funds you used to establish the Regular IRA must
        have been a rollover contribution from a qualified plan, and

     o    the entire amount received from the Regular IRA (including any
           earnings on the rollover contribution) must be rolled over into
       another qualified plan within 60 days of the date received.

Similar rules apply in the case of a TSA.                                       

You may lose conduit treatment, if you make an eligible rollover distribution   
contribution to a Regular IRA and you commingle this contribution with other    
contributions. In that case, you may not be able to roll over these eligible    
rollover distribution contributions and earnings to another qualified plan (or  
TSA) at a future date.                                                          

Distributions from a Regular IRA are not eligible for favorable five-year       
averaging available through 1999 (or, in some cases, ten-year averaging and     
long-term capital gain treatment available) to certain distributions from       
qualified plans.                                                                

REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS 

Lifetime Required Minimum Distributions                                     

You must start taking annual distributions from your Regular IRAs beginning at  
age 70 1/2.                                                                     

When you have to take the first required minimum distribution               

The first required minimum distribution is for the calendar year in which you   
turn age 70 1/2. You have the choice to take this first required minimum        
distribution during the calendar year you actually reach age 70 1/2, or to      
delay taking it until the first three-month period in the next calendar year    
(January 1 -- April 1). Distributions must start no later than your "Required   
Beginning Date," which is April 1st of the calendar year after the calendar     
year in which you turn age 70 1/2. If you choose to delay taking the first      
annual minimum distribution, then you will have to take two minimum             
distributions in that year, the delayed one for the first year and the actual   
one for that year. Once minimum distributions begin, they must be made at some  
time each year.                                                                 

How you can calculate required minimum distributions                        

There are two approaches to taking required minimum distributions,              
"account-based" or "annuity-based." If you choose an "account-based" method,    
you divide the value of your Regular IRA as of December 31st of the past        
calendar year by a life expectancy factor from IRS tables. This gives you the   
required minimum distribution amount for that particular IRA for that year. If  
you choose an account-based method, the required minimum distribution amount    
will vary each year as the account value and your life expectancy factors       
change. If you choose an "annuity-based" method, you do not have to do annual   
calculations. You apply the account value to an annuity payout for your life or 
the joint lives of you and a designated beneficiary, or for a period certain    
not extending beyond applicable life expectancies.                              

If you pick an account-based method, you have a choice of life expectancy       
factors, depending on whether you choose a method based only on your life       
expectancy, or the joint life expectancies of you and another individual. You   
can decide to "recalculate" your life expectancy every year by using your       
current life expectancy factor. You can decide instead to use the "term         
certain" method, where you reduce your life expectancy by one every year after  
the initial year. If your spouse is your designated beneficiary for figuring    
out annual account-based required minimum distributions, you can also annually  
"recalculate" your spouse's life expectancy if you want. If you choose someone  
who is not your spouse as your

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

designated beneficiary for the purpose of figuring out annual account-based     
required minimum distributions, you have to use the "term certain" method of    
calculating that person's life expectancy. If you pick a nonspouse designated   
beneficiary, you may also have to do another special calculation.               

If you pick an account-based method, you can later apply your Regular IRA funds 
to a life annuity-based payout. You can only do this if you already chose to    
recalculate your life expectancy annually (and your spouse's life expectancy if 
you select a spousal joint annuity). For example, if you anticipate selecting a 
form of life annuity payout after you are age 70 1/2, you must have elected to  
recalculate life expectancies.                                                  

Whether you have to pick the same method to calculate your required minimum 
distributions for all of your Regular IRAs and other retirement plans.      

You can choose a different method and a different beneficiary for each of your  
Regular IRAs and other retirement plans. For example, you can choose an annuity 
payout from one IRA, a different annuity payout from a qualified plan, and an   
account-based annual withdrawal from another IRA.                               

If you take more than you need to for any year.                             

The correct required minimum distribution amount for your Regular IRAs is       
calculated on a year-by-year basis. There are no carry-back or carry-forward    
provisions. Also, you cannot apply required minimum distribution amounts you    
take from your qualified plans to the amounts you have to take from your        
Regular IRAs and vice-versa. However, the IRS will let you figure out the       
required minimum distribution for each Regular IRA that you maintain, using the 
method that you picked for that particular IRA. You can add these required      
minimum distribution amount calculations together. As long as the total amount  
you take out every year satisfies your overall Regular IRA required minimum     
distribution amount, you may choose to take your annual required minimum        
distribution from any one or more Regular IRAs that you own.                    

If you take less than you need to for any year.                             

Your IRA could be disqualified, and you could have to pay tax on the entire     
value. Even if your IRA is not disqualified, you could have to pay a 50%        
penalty tax on the shortfall (required amount for Regular IRAs less amount      
actually taken). It is your responsibility to meet the required minimum         
distribution rules. We will remind you when our records show that your age      
70 1/2 is approaching. If you do not select a method with us, we will assume you
are taking your required minimum distribution from another Regular IRA that you 
own.                                                                            

Required minimum distribution payments after you die.                       

If you die after either (1) the start of annuity payments, or (2) your Required 
Beginning Date, your beneficiary must receive payment of the remaining values   
in the certificate at least as rapidly as under the distribution method before  
your death. In some circumstances, your surviving spouse may elect to become    
the owner of the Regular IRA and halt distributions until he or she reaches age 
70 1/2.                                                                         

If you are using the recalculation method for determining life expectancy, the  
payments to a beneficiary may accelerate after your death.                      

If you die before your Required Beginning Date and before annuity payments      
begin, federal tax rules require complete distribution of your entire value in  
the Certificate within five years after your death. Payments to a designated    
beneficiary over the beneficiary's life or over a period certain that does not  
extend beyond the beneficiary's life expectancy are also permitted, if these    
payments start within one year of your death. A surviving spouse beneficiary    
can also (1) delay starting any payments until you would have attained 70 1/2 or
(2) roll over your Regular IRA into his or her own Regular IRA.

PAYMENTS TO A BENEFICIARY AFTER YOUR DEATH                                      

Regular IRA death benefits are taxed the same as Regular IRA distributions.     

BORROWING AND LOANS ARE PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS                                 

You cannot get loans from a Regular IRA. You cannot use a Regular IRA as        
collateral for a loan or other obligation. If you borrow against your IRA or    
use it as collateral, its tax-favored status will be lost as of the first day   
of the tax year in which this prohibited event occurs. If this happens, you     
must include in federal gross income for that year an amount equal to the fair  
market value of the Regular IRA Certificate as of the first day of that tax     
year, less the amount of any nondeductible contributions not previously         
recovered. Also, the early distribution penalty tax of 10% will apply if you    
have not reached age 59 1/2 before the first day of that tax year.              

EARLY DISTRIBUTION PENALTY TAX 

A penalty tax of 10% of the taxable portion of a distribution applies to        
distributions from a Regular IRA made before you reach age 59 1/2. The extra    
penalty tax does not apply if the distribution is covered by an exception. No   
penalty tax applies to pre-age 59 1/2 distributions made:                       

o    on or after your death;                                            

o    because you are disabled (special federal income tax definition);  

o    used to pay certain extraordinary medical expenses (special federal
income tax definition);                                       

o    used to pay medical insurance premiums for unemployed individuals  
(special federal income tax definition);                      

o    used to pay certain first-time home buyer expenses (special federal
income tax definition);                                       

  o    used to pay certain higher education expenses (special federal income
tax definition); or                                           

o    in the form of substantially equal periodic payments made at least 
      annually over your life (or your life expectancy), or over the joint
         lives of you and your beneficiary (or your joint life expectancy) using
an IRS-approved distribution method.                          

ROTH INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES (ROTH IRAs)                                

This section of the SAI covers some of the special tax rules that apply to Roth 
IRAs. If the rules are the same as those that apply to Regular IRAs, we will    
refer you to the same topic under "Regular IRAs."                               

The Equitable 300+ Series Roth IRA Certificate is designed to qualify as a Roth 
individual retirement annuity under Sections 408A and 408(b) of the Internal    
Revenue Code.                                                                   

Contributions to Roth IRAs                                                      

Individuals may make four different types of contributions to a Roth IRA:       

o    "regular" after-tax contributions out of earnings;                 

o    taxable "rollover" contributions from Regular IRAs ("conversion"   
       contributions); tax-free rollover contributions from other Roth IRAs;
     or tax-free direct custodian-to-custodian transfers from other Roth
IRAs ("direct transfers").                                    

REGULAR CONTRIBUTIONS TO ROTH IRAs                                              

Limits on regular Contributions:                                            

Generally, $2,000 is the maximum amount that you may contribute to all IRAs     
(including Roth IRAs) in any taxable year. This $2,000 limit does not apply to  
rollover contributions or direct custodian-to--                                 

SAI-12

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

custodian transfers into a Roth IRA. Any contributions to Roth IRAs reduce the  
ability to contribute to Regular IRAs and vice versa. When your earnings are    
below $2,000, your earned income or compensation for the year is the most you   
can contribute. If you are married and file a joint income tax return, you and  
your spouse may combine your compensation to determine the amount of regular    
contributions you are permitted to make to Roth IRAs and Regular IRAs. See the  
discussion above under Regular IRAs.                                            

With a Roth IRA, you can make regular contributions when you reach 70 1/2, as   
long as you have sufficient earnings. But, you cannot make contributions for    
any year that:                                                                  

  o    your federal income tax filing status is "married filing jointly" and
your adjusted gross income is over $160,000; or;              

o    your federal income tax filing status is "single" and your adjusted
gross income is over $110,000.                                

However, you can make regular Roth IRA contributions in reduced amounts when:   

  o    your federal income tax filing status is "married filing jointly" and
  your adjusted gross income is between $150,000 and $160,000; or,

o    your federal income tax filing status is "single" and your adjusted
gross income is between $95,000 and $110,000.                 

If you are married and filing separately and your adjusted gross income is      
between $0 and $10,000 the amount of regular contribution you are permitted to  
make is phased out. If your adjusted gross income is more than $10,000 you      
cannot make a regular Roth IRA contribution.                                    

When you can make Contributions                                             

Same as Regular IRAs.                                                           

Deductibility of Contributions                                              

Roth IRA contributions are not tax-deductible.                                  

ROLLOVERS AND DIRECT TRANSFERS                                                  

You may make rollover contributions to a Roth IRA from only two sources:        

o    another Roth IRA ("tax-free rollover contribution"); or            

 o    another Regular IRA, including a SEP-IRA or SIMPLE-IRA, in a taxable
"conversion" rollover ("conversion contribution").            

You may not make contributions to a Roth IRA from a qualified plan under        
Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a tax-sheltered arrangement     
under Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. You may make direct transfer 
contributions to a Roth IRA only from another Roth IRA.                         

The difference between a rollover transaction and a direct transfer transaction 
is the following: In a rollover transaction you actually take possession of the 
funds rolled over, or constructively receive them in the case of a change from  
one type of plan to another. In a direct transfer transaction, you never take   
possession of the funds, but direct the first Roth IRA custodian, trustee, or   
issuer to transfer the first Roth IRA funds directly to Equitable, as the Roth  
IRA issuer. You can make direct transfer transactions only between identical    
plan types (for example, Roth IRA to Roth IRA). You can also make rollover      
transactions between identical plan types. However, you can only use rollover   
transactions between different plan types (for example, Regular IRA to Roth     
IRA).                                                                           

You may make both Roth IRA to Roth IRA rollover transactions and Roth IRA to    
Roth IRA direct transfer transactions. This can be accomplished on a completely 
tax-free basis. However you may make Roth IRA to Roth IRA rollover transactions 
only once in any 12-month period for the same funds. Trustee-to-trustee or      
custodian-to-custodian direct transfers can be made more frequently than once a 
year. Also, if you send us the rollover contribution to apply it to a Roth IRA, 
you must do so within 60 days after you receive the proceeds from the original  
IRA to get rollover treatment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The surviving spouse beneficiary of a deceased individual can roll over or      
directly transfer an inherited Roth IRA to one or more other Roth IRAs. In some 
cases, Roth IRAs can be transferred on a tax-free basis between spouses or      
former spouses because of a court-ordered divorce or separation decree.         

CONVERSION CONTRIBUTIONS TO ROTH IRAs                                           

In a conversion rollover transaction, you withdraw (or are deemed to withdraw)  
all or a portion of funds from a Regular IRA you maintain and convert it to a   
Roth IRA within 60 days after you receive (or are deemed to receive) the        
Regular IRA proceeds. Unlike a rollover from a Regular IRA to another Regular   
IRA, the conversion rollover transaction is not tax exempt. Instead, the        
distribution from the Regular IRA is generally fully taxable. For this reason,  
we are required to withhold 10% federal income tax from the amount converted    
unless you elect out of such withholding. (If you have ever made nondeductible  
regular contributions to any Regular IRA--whether or not it is the Regular IRA  
you are converting--a pro rata portion of the distribution is tax exempt.)      

There is, however, no early distribution penalty tax on the Regular IRA         
withdrawal that you are converting to a Roth IRA, even if you are under age     
59 1/2.                                                                         

You cannot make conversion contributions to a Roth IRA for any taxable year in  
which your adjusted gross income exceeds $100,000. (For this purpose, you       
compute your adjusted gross income without the gross income stemming from the   
Regular IRA conversion.) You also cannot make conversion contributions to a     
Roth IRA for any taxable year in which your federal income tax filing status is 
"married filing separately."                                                    

Finally, you cannot make conversion contributions to a Roth IRA to the extent   
that the funds in your Regular IRA are subject to the annual required minimum   
distribution rule applicable to Regular IRAs beginning at age 70 1/2.           

WITHDRAWALS, PAYMENTS AND TRANSFERS OF FUNDS OUT OF ROTH IRAs                   

You can withdraw any or all of your funds from a Roth IRA at any time without   
restriction. You do not need to wait for a special event like retirement.       

DISTRIBUTIONS FROM ROTH IRAs                                                    

Distributions include withdrawals from your Certificate, surrender of your      
Certificate and annuity payments from your Certificate. Death benefits are also 
distributions.                                                                  

The following distributions from Roth IRAs are free of income tax:              

o    rollovers from a Roth IRA to another Roth IRA;                     

o    direct transfers from a Roth IRA to another Roth IRA;              

o    "qualified distributions" from Roth IRAs; and                      

   o    return of excess contributions or amounts recharacterized to a Regular
IRA.                                                          

Qualified Distributions from Roth IRAs                                      

A qualified distribution from a Roth IRA is any distribution made (1) after the 
five-taxable year period beginning with the first taxable year for which you    
made any contribution to any Roth IRA (whether or not the one from which the    
distribution is being made) and (2) for one of the following reasons:           

o    you reach age 59 1/2;                                              

o    you die;                                                           

o    you become disabled (special federal income tax definition); or    

SAI-14

P-->49752nd Page of 114TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 52nd
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o    your distribution is a "qualified first-time homebuyer distribution"
      (special federal income tax definition; $10,000 lifetime total limit
      for these distributions from all of your Traditional and Roth IRAs).

It is not possible to have a tax-free qualified distribution from a Roth IRA    
before 2003 because of the five year aging requirement.                         

Nonqualified Distributions from Roth IRAs                                   

Distributions from Roth IRAs that are not qualified distributions are           
potentially taxable as ordinary income. Nonqualified distributions receive      
return-of-investment-first treatment. Only the difference between the amount of 
the distribution and the amount of contributions to all of your Roth IRAs is    
taxable. You have to reduce the amount of contributions to all of your Roth     
IRAs to reflect any previous tax-free recoveries.                               

You must keep your own records of regular and conversion contributions to all   
Roth IRAs to assure appropriate taxation. You may have to file information on   
your contributions to and distributions from any Roth IRA on your tax return.   
You may have to retain all income tax returns and records pertaining to such    
contributions and distributions until your interests in all Roth IRAs are       
distributed.                                                                    

Like Regular IRAs, taxable distributions from a Roth IRA are not eligible for   
favorable five-year averaging available through 1999 (or, in some cases,        
ten-year averaging and long-term capital gain treatment available) to certain   
distributions from qualified plans.                                             

REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS AFTER YOUR DEATH                                 

If you die before we have distributed the entire amount of your Roth IRA to     
you, federal tax rules require complete distribution of your entire value in    
the Certificate within five years after your death. Payments to a designated    
beneficiary over the beneficiary's life or over a period certain that does not  
extend beyond the beneficiary's life expectancy are also permitted, if these    
payments start within one year of your death. If your surviving spouse is the   
designated beneficiary required minimum distributions need not be made until    
after the surviving spouse's death.                                             

PAYMENTS TO A BENEFICIARY AFTER YOUR DEATH                                      

Distributions to a beneficiary generally receive the same tax treatment as if   
the distribution had been to you.                                               

BORROWING AND LOANS ARE PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS                                 

You cannot get loans from a Roth IRA. You cannot use a Roth IRA as collateral   
for a loan or other obligation. If you borrow against your Roth IRA or use it   
as collateral, its tax-favored status will be lost as of the first day of the   
tax year in which this prohibited event occurs. If this happens, you must       
include in federal gross income for that year an amount equal to the fair       
market value of the Roth IRA Certificate as of the first day of that tax year,  
less the amount of any nondeductible contributions not previously recovered.    
Also, the early distribution penalty tax of 10% will apply if you have not      
reached age 59 1/2 before the first day of that tax year.                       

EXCESS CONTRIBUTIONS 

Excess contributions to Roth IRAs are subject to a 6% excise tax for the year   
in which made and for each year after until withdrawn. The following are excess 
contributions to Roth IRAs:                                                     

o    "regular" contributions of more than $2,000;                       

o    "regular" contributions of more than earned income for the year, if
that amount is under $2,000; and                              

SAI-15

P-->49753rd Page of 114TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 53rd
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 o    rollover contributions of amounts that are not eligible to be rolled
over (for example, conversion rollovers from a Regular IRA for
     individuals with adjusted gross income in excess of $100,000 in the
conversion year.)                                             

You can withdraw or recharacterize any contribution to a Roth IRA before the    
due date (including extensions) for filing your federal income tax return for   
the tax year. If you do this, you must also withdraw or recharacterize any      
earnings attributable to the contribution.                                      

EARLY DISTRIBUTION PENALTY TAX 

A penalty tax of 10% of the taxable portion of a distribution applies to        
distributions from a Roth IRA made before you reach age 59 1/2. The extra       
penalty tax does not apply if the distribution is covered by an exception. No   
penalty tax applies to pre-age 59 1/2 distributions made:                       

o    on or after your death;                                            

o    because you are disabled (special federal income tax definition);  

o    used to pay certain extraordinary medical expenses (special federal
income tax definition);                                       

o    used to pay medical insurance premiums for unemployed individuals  
(special federal income tax definition);                      

o    used to pay certain first-time home buyer expenses (special federal
income tax definition);                                       

  o    used to pay certain higher education expenses (special federal income
tax definition); or                                           

o    in the form of substantially equal periodic payments made at least 
      annually over your life (or your life expectancy), or over the joint
         lives of you and your beneficiary (or your joint life expectancy) using
an IRS-approved distribution method.                          

Special penalty rules may apply to amounts withdrawn attributable to 1998       
conversion rollovers.                                                           

IRAs UNDER SIMPLIFIED EMPLOYEE PENSION PLANS (SEP)                              

When an employer establishes a SEP for its employees, it can contribute to a    
Regular IRA certificate for each eligible employee. The employee may also       
contribute to that SEP certificate. A SEP IRA Certificate is a form of Regular  
IRA Certificate, owned by the employee-participant and most of the rules        
applicable to Regular IRAs discussed above apply. A major difference is the     
amount of permissible contributions.                                            

Under 1999 statutory limits, an employer can annually contribute an amount for  
an employee up to the lesser of $24,000 or 15% of the employee's compensation,  
which is determined without the employer's contribution to the SEP. The $24,000 
maximum may be adjusted for cost of living changes in future years. These       
limits may be reduced by contributions the employer makes to other qualified    
plans. The employer must contribute for each employee who has reached age 21    
and has worked for the employer during at least three of the preceding five     
years. The employer does not have to contribute for employees who (1) earn less 
than $400 in 1999, (2) are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or (3)  
are non-resident aliens who receive no earned income from sources within the    
United States.                                                                  

Employers make their contributions under a written program that provides for    
(1) withdrawals, (2) contributions under an allocation formula, and (3)         
contributions that bear a uniform relationship to actual compensation, not      
greater than $160,000 in 1999. Contributions cannot discriminate in favor of    
highly compensated employees. An employer may integrate contributions to the    
SEP with Social Security. Call our toll-free number for assistance.             

SIMPLE IRAs                                                                     

An eligible employer may establish a "SIMPLE" plan to make contributions to     
special individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities for   
its employees ("SIMPLE IRAs"). A SIMPLE IRA is a form of regular IRA owned by   
the employee. Generally, the rules applicable to Regular IRAs,

discussed above, apply. There are differences in the amount and type of         
permissible contributions. Also, employees who have not participated in the     
employer's SIMPLE IRA plan for at least two full years may be subject to an     
increased penalty tax on withdrawals of SIMPLE IRA funds.                       

The employer cannot maintain any other qualified plan, SEP or TSA arrangement   
if it makes contributions under a SIMPLE IRA plan. (Eligible employers may      
maintain EDC plans.)                                                            

An employer establishing a SIMPLE plan should consult its tax advisor           
concerning the various technical rules applicable to establishing and           
maintaining SIMPLE IRA plans. For example, the definition of employee's         
"compensation" varies depending on whether it appears in the context of         
employer eligibility, employee participation, and employee or employer          
contributions.                                                                  

Participation must be open to all employees who (1) received at least $5,000 in 
compensation from the employer in any two preceding years (they do not have to  
be consecutive years) and (2) are reasonably expected to receive at least       
$5,000 in compensation during the year. (Certain collective bargaining unit and 
alien employees may be excluded.)                                               

The only permitted contributions to a SIMPLE IRA are (1) contributions under a  
salary reduction agreement entered into between the employer and the            
participating employee and (2) required employer contributions (employer        
matching contributions or employer nonelective contributions). (Direct transfer 
and rollover contributions from other SIMPLE IRAs, but not Regular IRAs, may    
also be made.) Salary reduction contributions can be any percentage of          
compensation (or a specific dollar amount, if the employer's plan permits) but  
are limited to $6,000 in 1999. The $6,000 elective deferral limit may be        
indexed for cost of living adjustments in future years.                         

The employer is required to make matching contributions on behalf of each       
eligible employee in an amount equal to the salary reduction contributions, up  
to 3% of the employee's compensation or a 2% non-elective contribution to all   
eligible employees. The employer must also follow the notification and filing   
requirements outlined in the SIMPLE IRA model amendment, to avoid               
non-discrimination tests.                                                       

Amounts contributed to SIMPLE IRAs are not currently taxable to employees. Only 
the employer can deduct SIMPLE IRA contributions, not the employee. An employee 
eligible to participate in a SIMPLE IRA is an active participant in an employer 
plan and thus may not be able to deduct all or a portion of regular             
contributions to his/her own IRA.                                               

As with Regular IRAs in general, contributions and earnings accumulate tax      
deferred until withdrawn and are then fully taxable. There are no withdrawal    
restrictions applicable to SIMPLE IRAs. However, because of the level of        
employer involvement, SIMPLE IRA plans are subject to ERISA. See "ERISA
Matters" below. The same 10% penalty on taxable early withdrawals that applies  
to Regular IRAs applies to SIMPLE IRAs, subject to the same exceptions for      
death, disability and attainment of age 59 1/2. For employees who have not      
participated in the employer's SIMPLE IRA for two full years, that penalty is   
25%.                                                                            

Amounts withdrawn from a SIMPLE IRA can be rolled over to another SIMPLE IRA,   
to a Regular IRA or a Roth IRA (if under the conversion rollover rules          
discussed above). No rollovers from a SIMPLE IRA to any other type of IRA are   
permitted for individuals under age 59 1/2 who have not participated in the     
employer's SIMPLE IRA plan for two full years. For such employees, any amounts  
withdrawn from a SIMPLE IRA are taxable and subject to a 25% additional tax     
penalty with the exceptions noted in the preceding paragraph.                   

FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING AND INFORMATION REPORTING 

We must withhold federal income tax from distributions from annuity contracts.  
You may be able to elect out of this income tax withholding in some cases.      
Generally, we do not have to withhold if your distributions are not taxable.    
The rate of withholding will depend on the type of distribution and, in certain 
cases, the amount of your distribution. Any income tax withheld is a credit     
against your income tax liability. If you do not have sufficient income tax     
withheld or do not make sufficient estimated income tax payments, you may incur 
penalties under the estimated income tax rules.                                 

SAI-17

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You must file your request not to withhold in writing before the payment or     
distribution is made. Our Processing Office will provide forms for this         
purpose. You cannot elect out of withholding unless you provide us with your    
correct Taxpayer Identification Number and a United States residence address.   
You cannot elect out of withholding if we are sending the payment out of the    
United States.                                                                  

You should note the following special situations:                               

o    We might have to withhold on amounts we pay under a free look or   
cancellation.                                                 

o    We are generally required to withhold on conversion rollovers of   
      Regular IRAs to Roth IRAs, as the deemed withdrawal from the Regular
IRA is taxable.                                               

   o    We are required to withhold on the gross amount of a distribution from
        a Roth IRA unless you elect out of withholding. This may result in tax
        being withheld even though the Roth IRA distribution is not taxable in
whole or in part.                                             

Special withholding rules apply to foreign recipients and United States         
citizens residing outside the United States. We do not discuss these rules      
here. Certain states have indicated that state income tax withholding will also 
apply to payments from the Certificates made to residents. In some states, you  
may elect out of state withholding, even if federal withholding applies.        
Generally, we will consider an election out of federal withholding to be an     
election out of state withholding. If you need more information concerning a    
particular state or any required forms, call our Processing Office at the       
toll-free number.                                                               

FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING ON PERIODIC ANNUITY PAYMENTS                     

We withhold differently on "periodic" and "non-periodic" payments. For a        
periodic annuity payment, for example, unless you specify a different number of 
withholding exemptions, we withhold assuming that you are married and claiming  
three withholding exemptions. If you do not give us your correct Taxpayer       
Identification Number, we withhold as if you are single with no exemptions.     

Based on the assumption that you are married and claiming three withholding     
exemptions, if you receive less than $14,700 in periodic annuity payments in    
1999 your payments will generally be exempt from federal income tax             
withholding. You could specify a different choice of withholding exemption or   
request that we withhold tax. Your withholding election remains effective       
unless and until you revoke it. You may revoke or change your withholding       
election at any time.                                                           

FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING ON NON-PERIODIC ANNUITY PAYMENTS (WITHDRAWALS)   

For a non-periodic distribution (total surrender or partial withdrawal), we     
withhold generally at a flat 10% rate. We apply that rate to the taxable amount 
in the case of nonqualified Certificates, and to the payment amount in the case 
of IRAs and Roth IRAs).                                                         

You cannot elect out of withholding if the payment is an "eligible rollover     
distribution" from a TSA. If a non-periodic distribution from a TSA is not an   
"eligible rollover distribution" then the 10% withholding rate applies.         

MANDATORY WITHHOLDING FROM TSAS                                                 

Unless you have the distribution go directly to the new plan, eligible rollover 
distributions from TSAs are subject to mandatory 20% withholding. An eligible   
rollover distribution from a TSA can be rolled over to another TSA or a Regular 
IRA. All distributions from a TSA are eligible rollover distributions unless    
they are on the following list of exceptions:                                   

o    any after-tax contributions you made to the plan;                  

  o    any distributions that are "required minimum distributions" after age
70 1/2 or separation from service;                            

o    hardship withdrawals;                                              

SAI-18

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o    substantially equal periodic payments made at least annually for your
         life (or life expectancy) or the joint lives (or joint life expectancy)
of you and your designated beneficiary;                       

    o    substantially equal periodic payments made for a specified period of 10
years or more;                                                

 o    if you have contributed too much, corrective distributions which fit
specified technical tax rules;                                

o    a death benefit payment to a beneficiary who is not your surviving 
spouse; and                                                   

   o    a qualified domestic relations order distribution to a beneficiary who
is not your current spouse or former spouse.                  

A death benefit payment to your surviving spouse, or a qualified domestic       
relations order distribution to your current or former spouse, may be a         
distribution subject to a mandatory 20% withholding.                            

ERISA MATTERS 

Certain TSAs and SIMPLE IRAs may be subject to some or all rules applicable to  
ERISA plans. For TSAs subject to ERISA (but not SIMPLE IRAs), you need spousal  
consent to make a withdrawal or other distribution under the Certificate. In    
addition, unless you and your spouse elect otherwise, the retirement benefits   
payable under the plan or arrangement must be in the form of a qualified joint  
and survivor annuity ("QJSA"). A QJSA is an annuity payable for your life, with 
a survivor annuity for the life of your spouse. The amount payable to your      
spouse must be at least one-half of the amount payable to you during your       
lifetime. In addition, your beneficiary must be your spouse, unless your spouse 
consents in writing to the designation of a different beneficiary.              

Section 404(c) of ERISA and the related DOL regulation excuses a plan fiduciary 
from liability for investment losses due to your investment decisions. Thus, in 
situations to which Section 404(c) and the related DOL regulation apply, you    
can make and you are responsible for the results of your own investment         
decisions. Section 404(c) plans must provide, among other things that a broad   
range of investment choices are available to plan participants and              
beneficiaries and must provide such plan participants and beneficiaries with    
enough information to make informed investment decisions. Compliance with the   
Section 404(c) regulation is completely voluntary by the plan sponsor. The      
Equitable 300+ Series TSA and SIMPLE IRA programs provide the broad range of    
investment choices and information needed in order to meet the requirements of  
the Section 404(c) regulation. If the plan is intended to be a Section 404(c)   
plan, it is, however, the plan sponsor's responsibility to see that the         
requirements of the DOL regulation are met. Equitable Life will not be          
responsible if a plan fails to meet the requirements of Section 404(c).         

IMPACT OF TAXES TO EQUITABLE                                                    

The Certificates provide that we may charge Separate Account No. 301 for taxes. 
We do not now, but may in the future set up reserves for such taxes.            

THE GUARANTEED RATE ACCOUNTS 

Contributions to a guaranteed rate account, or GRA, become part of our general  
account, which supports all of our insurance and annuity guarantees as well as  
our general obligations.                                                        

THE GUARANTEES                                                                  

We credit contributions to a GRA with interest at a fixed rate for each         
guarantee period. We guarantee the amount of the contribution (before deduction 
of any applicable participant service charge). The effective annual guaranteed  
interest rate will always be at least 3%.                                       

Currently, we offer GRAs with new one-year and three-year guarantee periods     
each calendar quarter. We express the fixed interest rate as an effective       
annual interest rate, and apply it to contributions made                        

SAI-19

P-->49757th Page of 114TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 57th
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

throughout the calendar quarter, or "open period," for each guarantee period.   
We may close a guarantee period offered during an open period. In that case, we 
may offer a new guaranteed rate [for the same guarantee period] for the         
remainder of the open period.                                                   

We reserve the right to close a guarantee period being offered at any time      
based on market conditions. Subsequent interest rate changes will not affect    
contributions made during the open period. All guarantee periods of the same    
duration that are opened during an open period mature on the same day. After    
the last day of the open period we will apply no further contributions to those 
guarantee periods. In accordance with instructions, we will allocate            
contributions to guarantee periods during the next open period at the new       
interest rates for that subsequent open period. You may obtain the new          
guaranteed rates by calling us at the number listed on the front of this SAI.   

CONTRIBUTIONS 

We credit contributions to a GRA until maturity of a guarantee period with the  
interest rate in effect on the date of receipt. We express the rate as an       
effective annual rate, reflecting daily compounding and the deduction of the    
participant service charge.                                                     

Your written request for a change in the percentage of contributions that you   
allocate to a GRA guarantee period becomes effective on the date that we        
receive it. Alternatively, you may make allocation or contribution instructions 
by telephone through the AIM System.                                            

WITHDRAWALS AND TRANSFERS                                                       

Amounts in the GRAs will be withdrawn or transferred on a last-in, first-out    
basis, unless you specify otherwise. All [other] amounts withdrawn or           
transferred will be subject to a withdrawal charge as discussed under "Charges
and Expenses" in the prospectus. We will deduct the withdrawal charge from (1)  
the remaining amounts in your guarantee period after we process the withdrawal  
or transfer payment, or (2) the amount you withdrew or transferred if remaining 
amounts are insufficient.                                                       

EXAMPLE OF WITHDRAWAL CHARGE                                                    

You contribute $2,000 GRA on January 1, allocating the contribution to a        
three-year guarantee period with a guaranteed interest rate of 4%. On December  
31, you make a premature withdrawal of $1,000 from that GRA guarantee period.   
The maximum participant service charge applicable is $30 per year ($7.50 per    
quarter). We will calculate the withdrawal charge as follows:

HOW WE DETERMINE UNIT VALUES 

Unit values for the Funds are determined at the end of each Business Day.       

The unit value of any Fund for any Business Day is equal to the unit value for  
the preceding business day multiplied by the "net investment factor" for that   
Fund on that Business Day.                                                      

A net investment factor for each Fund is determined every Business Day as       
follows:                                                                        

o    First, we take the value of the shares held by the Fund in the     
         corresponding Portfolio of The Hudson River Trust or EQ Advisors Trust,
        at the close of business that day (before giving effect to any amounts
 allocated to or withdrawn from the Fund for that day). For this
  purpose, we use the share value reported to us by the Portfolio.

   o    Then, we divide this amount by the value of the amounts in the Fund at
   the close of business on the preceding Business Day (after giving
effect to any amounts allocated or withdrawn for that day).   

  o    Finally, we subtract any daily charge for fees or expenses payable by
the Fund.                                                     

ILLUSTRATION OF CHANGES IN UNIT VALUES                                          

Generally, if on a particular Business Day investment income and realized and   
unrealized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized capital losses and any  
expense charges, the unit value would be greater than the value for the         
previous period.                                                                

For example, assume that at the close of trading on a Monday, the value of a    
Fund's assets is $2,500,000, and the unit value is $10. If on the next Business 
Day, Tuesday, the investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains   
exceed realized and unrealized losses by $7,500, and the daily accrual for      
expenses charged to the Trust is $50, the unit value for that day would be      
calculated as follows:                                                          

                                                        [Enlarge/Download Table]
                                                                                        
1. Unit value for Monday ................................................... $        10
2. Value of assets at close of business on Monday .........................  $ 2,500,000
3. Excess of investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains                
   over realized and unrealized losses ..................................... $     7,500
4. Daily accrual for expenses (administration charges and certain expenses              
   borne directly by the Funds) charged to the Investment Fund ............. $        50
5. Value of assets, less charge for expenses, at close of business day On               
   Tuesday, ((2) + (3) -- (4)) ............................................. $ 2,507,450
6. Net investment factor ((5) divided by (2)) ..............................     1.00298
7. Unit value for Tuesday ((1) x (6)) ...................................... $   10.0298

If, on the other hand, the realized and unrealized losses exceeded investment   
income and realized and unrealized capital gains on that day by $7,500, the     
unit value for Tuesday would have been $9.9698.                                 

ALLIANCE MONEY MARKET FUND YIELD INFORMATION 

The Alliance Money Market Fund calculates yield information for seven-day       
periods. The seven-day current yield calculation is based on a hypothetical     
account balance with one unit at the beginning of the period. To determine the  
seven-day rate of return, the net change in the unit value is computed by       
subtracting the unit value at the beginning of the period from a unit value,    
exclusive of capital changes, at the end of the period.                         

The net change will be reduced by the average administrative charge factor      
(explained below). This reduction is made to recognize the deduction of the     
participant service charge, which is not reflected in

the unit value. See "Charges and Expenses--Participant Service Charge" in the   
prospectus. Unit values reflect all other accrued expenses of the Alliance      
Money Market Fund.                                                              

The adjusted net change is divided by the unit value at the beginning of the    
period to obtain the adjusted base period rate of return. This seven-day        
adjusted base period is multiplied return by 365/7 to produce an annualized     
seven-day current yield figure that we carry to the nearest one-hundredth of    
one percent.                                                                    

The actual dollar amount of the participant service charge that we deduct from  
the Alliance Money Market Fund will vary for each participant depending upon    
how the participant allocates the account balance among the investment options. 
To determine the effect of the participant service charge on the yield, we      
start with the total dollar amount of the charges deducted from the Fund on the 
last day of the prior quarter. This amount is multiplied by 7/91.25 to produce  
an average participant service charge factor which is used in all weekly yield  
computations for the ensuing quarter. The average administrative charge is then 
divided by the number of Alliance Money Market Fund Units as of the end of the  
prior calendar quarter, and we deduct the resulting quotient from the net       
change in Unit Value for the seven-day period.                                  

The effective yield is obtained by modifying the current yield to give effect   
to the compounding nature of the Alliance Money Market Fund's investments, as   
follows: compounding the unannualized adjusted base period return by adding one 
to the adjusted base period return, raising the sum to a power equal to 365     
divided by 7, and subtracting one from the result, i.e., effective yield =      
(base period return + 1) 365/7 -- 1.                                            

The Alliance Money Market Fund yields will fluctuate daily. Accordingly, yields 
for any given period are not necessarily representative of future results. In   
addition, the value of Units of the Alliance Money Market Fund will fluctuate   
and not remain constant.                                                        

The Alliance Money Market Fund yields reflect charges that are not normally     
reflected in the yields of other investments and therefore may be lower when    
compared with yields of other investments. You should not compare Alliance      
Money Market Fund yields to the return on fixed rate investments that guarantee 
rates of interest for specified periods, such as the Guaranteed Rate Accounts   
or bank deposits. You should not compare the yield to the yield of money market 
funds made available to the general public. Those yields usually are calculated 
on the basis of a constant $1 price per share, and those funds pay out earnings 
in dividends that accrue on a daily basis.                                      

The seven-day current yield for the Alliance Money Market Fund was 4.23% for    
the period ended December 31, 1998. The effective yield for that period was     
4.32%. Because these yields reflect the deduction of Separate Account No. 301   
expenses, including the participant service charge, they are lower than the     
corresponding yield figures for the Alliance Money Market Portfolio, which      
reflect only the deduction of Trust-level expenses.

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities and the   
related statements of operations and of changes in net assets present fairly,   
in all material respects, the financial position of the Alliance Money Market   
Fund, Alliance Intermediate Government Securities Fund, Alliance High Yield     
Fund, Alliance Growth & Income Fund, Alliance Common Stock Fund, Alliance       
Global Fund, Alliance Aggressive Stock Fund, Alliance Conservative Investors    
Fund, Alliance Growth Investors Fund and Alliance Balanced Fund ("Hudson River  
Trust funds") and the T. Rowe Price International Stock Fund, MFS Emerging      
Growth Companies Fund, Lazard Small Cap Value Fund and BT Equity 500 Index Fund 
("EQ Advisors Trust funds"), separate investment funds of The Equitable Life    
Assurance Society of the United States ("Equitable Life") Separate Account No.  
301 at December 31, 1998 and the results of each of their operations and        
changes in each of their net assets for the periods indicated, in conformity    
with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are   
the responsibility of Equitable Life's management; our responsibility is to     
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We        
conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of  
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence   
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing   
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and 
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our    
audits, which included confirmation of shares owned in The Hudson River Trust   
and in The EQ Advisors Trust at December 31, 1998 with the transfer agent,      
provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. The unit value      
information presented in Note 5 for the year ended December 31, 1992 and for    
each of the periods indicated prior thereto, were audited by other independent  
accountants whose report dated February 16, 1993 expressed an unqualified       
opinion on the financial statements containing such information.

THE EQUITABLE LIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES                       
SEPARATE ACCOUNT NO. 301                                                        
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
DECEMBER 31, 1998 

1. General                                                                      

The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States (Equitable Life)
Separate Account No. 301 (the Account) is organized as a unit investment  
trust, a type of investment company, and is registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The     
Account is used to fund benefits under certain group annuity contracts and
 certificates (Contracts) in connection with individual retirement annuities
 and tax-sheltered annuity arrangements. The Account has fourteen investment
 funds (Funds): Alliance Money Market Fund, Alliance Intermediate Government
Securities Fund, Alliance High Yield Fund, Alliance Growth & Income Fund, 
Alliance Common Stock Fund, Alliance Global Fund, T. Rowe Price           
International Stock Fund, Alliance Aggressive Stock Fund, MFS Emerging    
Growth Companies Fund, Alliance Conservative Investors Fund, Alliance     
Growth Investors Fund, Alliance Balanced Fund, Lazard Small Cap Value Fund
and BT Equity 500 Index Fund. The assets in each Fund are invested in     
shares of a corresponding portfolio (Portfolio) of a mutual fund, Class IA
shares of The Hudson River Trust (HRT) or Class IB shares of EQ Advisors  
 Trust (EQAT) (collectively known as the Trusts). Class IA and IB shares are
offered by the Trusts at net asset value. Both classes of shares are      
subject to fees for investment management and advisory services and other 
Trust expenses. Class IB shares are subject to distribution fees imposed  
under a distribution plan adopted pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940   
act. These fees are reflected in the net asset value of the shares. The   
Trusts are open-ended, diversified, management investment companies that  
invest separate accounts assets of insurance companies. Each Portfolio has
separate investment objectives.                                           

 EQ Financial Consultants ("EQFC") is a wholly owned subsidiary of Equitable
Life. Alliance Capital Management L.P. ("Alliance"), a publicly traded    
limited partnership, is indirectly majority-owned subsidiary of Equitable.

EQFC earns fees from both Trusts under distribution agreements held with  
the Trusts. EQFC also earns fees under the investment management agreement
with the EQ Advisors Trust. Alliance earns fees under an investment       
advisory agreement with the HR Trust.                                     

The assets of the Account are the property of Equitable Life. The net     
assets of the Account are not chargeable with liabilities arising out of  
any other business Equitable Life may conduct. The excess of assets over  
reserves and other contract liabilities, if any, in the Account may be    
transferred to Equitable Life's General Account.                          

2. Significant Accounting Policies                                              

The accompanying financial statements are prepared in conformity with     
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of       
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make  
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and  
 liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and      
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from    
those estimates.                                                          

Investments are made in shares of the Trusts and are valued at the net    
 asset values per share of the respective Portfolios. The net asset value is
determined by the Trusts using the market or fair value of the underlying 
assets of the Portfolio, less liabilities.                                

Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Dividends are     
recorded by HR Trust as income at the end of each quarter and by EQ Trust 
in the fourth quarter on the ex-dividend date. Realized gains and losses  
include gains and losses on redemptions of Trust shares (determined on the
identified cost basis) and Trust distributions representing the net       
realized gains on Trust investment transactions are distributed by the    
Trusts at the end of each year. Dividends and capital gain

SEPARATE ACCOUNT NO. 301                                                        
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)                                    
DECEMBER 31, 1998 

distributions are automatically reinvested on the ex-dividend date.       

No Federal income tax based on net investment income or realized and      
 unrealized capital gains is currently applicable to Contracts participating
in the Account by reason of applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue 
Code and no Federal income tax payable by Equitable Life is expected to   
affect the unit value of Contracts participating in the Account.          
Accordingly, no provision for income taxes is required. Equitable Life    
reserves the right to charge the Account for taxes and to establish       
reserves for taxes.                                                       

3. Asset Charges                                                                

The following charges are made directly against the assets of the Account 
and are reflected daily in the computation of the unit values of the      
Contracts:                                                                

o  Administrative fees are charged at an effective annual rate of 0.25%   
of the net assets of each Fund.                                     

o  Direct operating expenses are paid to cover expenses attributable to   
the operations of each Fund.                                        

Under the Contracts, Equitable Life reimburses the Alliance Money Market  
Fund, the Alliance Common Stock Fund, the Alliance Intermediate Government
Securities Fund and the Alliance Balanced Fund for the excess of the      
aggregate expense charges of each Fund (including investment advisory fees
and certain other Trust expenses attributable to assets of such Fund      
invested in a Portfolio of the Trust and the asset-based charges of the   
 Fund, as described above) which during any calendar year exceed 1.5% of the
average daily net assets of the Alliance Common Stock Fund, the Alliance  
Intermediate Government Securities Fund and the Alliance Balanced Fund and
1.0% of the Alliance Money Market Fund. In addition, Equitable life       
voluntarily reimburses the Alliance High Yield Fund, the Alliance         
Aggressive Stock Fund and the Alliance Global Fund for aggregate expenses 
in excess of 1.5% of each Fund's average daily net assets. The above      
expense reimbursement is disclosed in the statements of operation as      
Reimbursement for excess expense limitation. This voluntary expense       
limitation may be discontinued by Equitable Life at its discretion.       

Also, if the annual amount of management fees applicable to the Alliance  
Money Market Portfolio and the Alliance Intermediate Government Securities
Portfolio exceeds 0.35% of the average daily net asset value of either    
Portfolio, Equitable Life will reimburse the related Fund for such excess.
This expense limitation is a contractual right for Participants who       
enrolled prior to May 1, 1987 and cannot be changed without the consent of
those Participants. Equitable Life has voluntarily agreed to impose this  
expense limitation for Participants who enrolled after May 1, 1987 and    
reserves the right to discontinue this at any time.                       

A quarterly Participant Service Charge is made for each participant at the
end of each calendar quarter before retirement benefits begin.            
Participant's unit balances are reduced and proceeds are credited to      
Equitable Life in payment of the participant's service charge which will  
not exceed $30 per year.                                                  

4. Contributions and Withdrawals:                                               

Contributions allocated to the Account are not subject to sales expense.  
 Participants may transfer all or part of the cash value under the Contracts
from one Fund to another subject to certain limitations. Transfers to and 
from the Guaranteed Interest Account of Equitable Life's General Account  
and the Account may be made subject to certain limitations.               

 Full or partial withdrawals, including withdrawals of excess contributions,
may be made by participants.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of                                    
The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States                       

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the  
related consolidated statements of earnings, of shareholder's equity and        
comprehensive income and of cash flows present fairly, in all material          
respects, the financial position of The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the 
United States and its subsidiaries ("Equitable Life") at December 31, 1998 and  
1997, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the  
three years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the              
responsibility of Equitable Life's management; our responsibility is to express 
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our  
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing       
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material           
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the          
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and     
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our    
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.              

    As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Equitable
Life changed its method of accounting for long-lived assets in 1996.

principally by Equitable Life and its wholly owned life insurance subsidiaries, 
Equitable of Colorado ("EOC"), and, prior to December 31, 1996, Equitable       
Variable Life Insurance Company ("EVLICO"). Effective January 1, 1997, EVLICO   
was merged into Equitable Life, which continues to conduct the Company's        
insurance business. Equitable Life's investment management business, which      
comprises the Investment Services segment, is conducted principally by Alliance 
Capital Management L.P. ("Alliance"), in which Equitable Life has a 57.7%       
ownership interest, and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc. ("DLJ"), an          
investment banking and brokerage affiliate in which Equitable Life has a 32.5%  
ownership interest.  AXA ("AXA"), a French holding company for an international 
group of insurance and related financial services companies, is the Holding     
Company's largest shareholder, owning approximately 58.5% at December 31, 1998  
(53.4% if all securities convertible into, and options on, common stock were to 
be converted or exercised).                                                     

The Insurance segment offers a variety of traditional, variable and   
interest-sensitive life insurance products, disability income, annuity          
products, mutual fund and other investment products to individuals and small    
groups. It also administers traditional participating group annuity contracts   
with conversion features, generally for corporate qualified pension plans, and  
association plans which provide full service retirement programs for            
individuals affiliated with professional and trade associations. This segment   
includes Separate Accounts for individual insurance and annuity products.       

The Investment Services segment includes Alliance, the results of DLJ 
which are accounted for on an equity basis, and, through June 10, 1997,         
Equitable Real Estate Investment Management, Inc. ("EREIM"), a real estate      
investment management subsidiary which was sold. Alliance provides diversified  
investment fund management services to a variety of institutional clients,      
including pension funds, endowments, and foreign financial institutions, as     
well as to individual investors, principally through a broad line of mutual     
funds. This segment includes institutional Separate Accounts which provide      
various investment options for large group pension clients, primarily deferred  
benefit contribution plans, through pooled or single group accounts. DLJ's      
businesses include securities underwriting, sales and trading, merchant         
banking, financial advisory services, investment research, venture capital,     
correspondent brokerage services, online interactive brokerage services and     
asset management. DLJ serves institutional, corporate, governmental and         
individual clients both domestically and internationally. EREIM provided real   
estate investment management services, property management services, mortgage   
servicing and loan asset management, and agricultural investment management.    

2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                   

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation                       

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in    
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") which require 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts   
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities   
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues    
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from      
those estimates.                                                                

    The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Equitable Life and its wholly owned life insurance subsidiary (collectively,    
the "Insurance Group"); non-insurance subsidiaries, principally Alliance and    
EREIM (see Note 5); and those partnerships and joint ventures in which          
Equitable Life or its subsidiaries has control and a majority economic interest 
(collectively, including its consolidated subsidiaries, the "Company"). The     
Company's investment in DLJ is reported on the equity basis of accounting.      
Closed Block assets, liabilities and results of operations are presented in the 

F-6

consolidated financial statements as single line items (see Note 7). Unless     
specifically stated, all other footnote disclosures contained herein exclude    
the Closed Block related amounts.                                               

  All significant intercompany transactions and balances except those with
the Closed Block and discontinued operations (see Note 8) have been eliminated  
in consolidation. The years "1998," "1997" and "1996" refer to the years ended  
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Certain reclassifications have  
been made in the amounts presented for prior periods to conform these periods   
with the 1998 presentation.                                                     

Closed Block                                                                

On July 22, 1992, Equitable Life established the Closed Block for the 
benefit of certain individual participating policies which were in force on     
that date. The assets allocated to the Closed Block, together with anticipated  
revenues from policies included in the Closed Block, were reasonably expected   
to be sufficient to support such business, including provision for payment of   
claims, certain expenses and taxes, and for continuation of dividend scales     
payable in 1991, assuming the experience underlying such scales continues.      

 Assets allocated to the Closed Block inure solely to the benefit of the
Closed Block policyholders and will not revert to the benefit of the Holding    
Company. No reallocation, transfer, borrowing or lending of assets can be made  
between the Closed Block and other portions of Equitable Life's General         
Account, any of its Separate Accounts or any affiliate of Equitable Life        
without the approval of the New York Superintendent of Insurance (the           
"Superintendent"). Closed Block assets and liabilities are carried on the same  
basis as similar assets and liabilities held in the General Account. The excess 
of Closed Block liabilities over Closed Block assets represents the expected    
future post-tax contribution from the Closed Block which would be recognized in 
income over the period the policies and contracts in the Closed Block remain in 
force.                                                                          

Discontinued Operations                                                     

Discontinued operations include the Group Non-Participating Wind-Up   
Annuities ("Wind-Up Annuities") and the Guaranteed Interest Contract ("GIC")    
lines of business. An allowance was established for the premium deficiency      
reserve for Wind-Up Annuities and estimated future losses of the GIC line of    
business. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance each quarter and     
believes the allowance for future losses at December 31, 1998 is adequate to    
provide for all future losses; however, the quarterly allowance review          
continues to involve numerous estimates and subjective judgments regarding the  
expected performance of Discontinued Operations Investment Assets. There can be 
no assurance the losses provided for will not differ from the losses ultimately 
realized. To the extent actual results or future projections of the             
discontinued operations differ from management's current best estimates and     
assumptions underlying the allowance for future losses, the difference would be 
reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings in discontinued            
operations. In particular, to the extent income, sales proceeds and holding     
periods for equity real estate differ from management's previous assumptions,   
periodic adjustments to the allowance are likely to result (see Note 8).        

Accounting Changes                                                          

In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 131, "Disclosures      
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information". SFAS No. 131          
establishes standards for public companies to report information about          
operating segments in annual and interim financial statements issued to         
shareholders. It also specifies related disclosure requirements for products    
and services, geographic areas and major customers. Generally, financial        
information must be reported using the basis management uses to make operating  
decisions and to evaluate business performance. The Company implemented SFAS    
No. 131 effective December 31, 1998 and continues to identify two operating     
segments to reflect its major businesses: Insurance and Investment Services.    
While the segment descriptions are the same as those previously reported,       
certain amounts have been reattributed between the two reportable segments.     
Prior period comparative segment information has been restated.

In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
("AICPA") issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs  
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use," which requires    
capitalization of external and certain internal costs incurred to obtain or     
develop internal-use computer software during the application development       
stage. The Company applied the provisions of SOP 98-1 prospectively effective   
January 1, 1998. The adoption of SOP 98-1 did not have a material impact on the 
Company's consolidated financial statements. Capitalized internal-use software  
is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the     
software.                                                                       

 The Company implemented SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," as of January
1, 1996. SFAS No. 121 requires long-lived assets and certain identifiable       
intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in            
circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be             
recoverable. Effective with SFAS No. 121's adoption, impaired real estate is    
written down to fair value with the impairment loss being included in           
investment gains (losses), net. Before implementing SFAS No. 121, valuation     
allowances on real estate held for the production of income were computed using 
the forecasted cash flows of the respective properties discounted at a rate     
equal to the Company's cost of funds. Adoption of the statement resulted in the 
release of valuation allowances of $152.4 million and recognition of impairment 
losses of $144.0 million on real estate held for production of income. Real     
estate which management intends to sell or abandon is classified as real estate 
held for sale. Valuation allowances on real estate held for sale continue to be 
computed using the lower of depreciated cost or estimated fair value, net of    
disposition costs. Initial adoption of the impairment requirements of SFAS No.  
121 to other assets to be disposed of resulted in a charge for the cumulative   
effect of an accounting change of $23.1 million, net of a Federal income tax    
benefit of $12.4 million, due to the writedown to fair value of building        
improvements relating to facilities vacated in 1996.                            

New Accounting Pronouncements                                               

In October 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 134, "Accounting for        
Mortgage-Backed Securities Retained after the Securitization of Mortgage Loans  
Held for Sale by a Mortgage Banking Enterprise," which amends existing          
accounting and reporting standards for certain activities of mortgage banking   
enterprises and other enterprises that conduct operations that are              
substantially similar to the primary operations of a mortgage banking           
enterprise. This statement is effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning  
after December 15, 1998. This statement is not expected to have a material      
impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.                      

In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," which establishes accounting and reporting 
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivatives embedded in 
other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires all derivatives to be  
recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in    
the fair value of a derivative depends on its intended use. Derivatives not     
used in hedging activities must be adjusted to fair value through earnings.     
Changes in the fair value of derivatives used in hedging activities will,       
depending on the nature of the hedge, either be offset in earnings against the  
change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged   
or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item affects       
earnings. For all hedging activities, the ineffective portion of a derivative's 
change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.                

 SFAS No. 133 requires adoption in fiscal years beginning after June 15,
1999 and permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter       
following issuance of the statement. Retroactive application to financial       
statements of prior periods is prohibited. The Company expects to adopt SFAS    
No. 133 effective January 1, 2000. Adjustments resulting from initial adoption  
of the new requirements will be reported in a manner similar to the cumulative  
effect of a change in accounting principle and will be reflected in net income  
or accumulated other comprehensive income based upon existing hedging           
relationships, if any. Management currently is assessing the impact of          
adoption. However, Alliance's adoption is not expected to have a significant    
impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheet or statement of earnings.    
Also, since most of DLJ's derivatives are carried at fair values, the Company's 
consolidated earnings and financial position are not expected to be             
significantly affected by DLJ's adoption of the new requirements.

  In late 1998, the AICPA issued SOP 98-7, "Deposit Accounting: Accounting
for Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts that Do Not Transfer Insurance Risk".   
This SOP, effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999, provides    
guidance to both the insured and insurer on how to apply the deposit method of  
accounting when it is required for insurance and reinsurance contracts that do  
not transfer insurance risk. The SOP does not address or change the             
requirements as to when deposit accounting should be applied. SOP 98-7 applies  
to all entities and all insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not         
transfer insurance risk except for long-duration life and health insurance      
contracts. This SOP is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's  
consolidated financial statements.                                              

   In December 1997, the AICPA issued SOP 97-3, "Accounting by Insurance and
Other Enterprises for Insurance-Related Assessments". SOP 97-3 provides         
guidance for assessments related to insurance activities and requirements for   
disclosure of certain information. SOP 97-3 is effective for financial          
statements issued for periods beginning after December 31, 1998. Restatement of 
previously issued financial statements is not required. SOP 97-3 is not         
expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial      
statements.                                                                     

Valuation of Investments                                                    

Fixed maturities identified as available for sale are reported at     
estimated fair value. Fixed maturities, which the Company has both the ability  
and the intent to hold to maturity, are stated principally at amortized cost.   
The amortized cost of fixed maturities is adjusted for impairments in value     
deemed to be other than temporary.                                              

    Valuation allowances are netted against the asset categories to which they
apply.                                                                          

    Mortgage loans on real estate are stated at unpaid principal balances, net
of unamortized discounts and valuation allowances. Valuation allowances are     
based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the      
loan's original effective interest rate or the collateral value if the loan is  
collateral dependent. However, if foreclosure is or becomes probable, the       
measurement method used is collateral value.                                    

 Real estate, including real estate acquired in satisfaction of debt, is
stated at depreciated cost less valuation allowances. At the date of            
foreclosure (including in-substance foreclosure), real estate acquired in       
satisfaction of debt is valued at estimated fair value. Impaired real estate is 
written down to fair value with the impairment loss being included in           
investment gains (losses), net. Valuation allowances on real estate held for    
sale are computed using the lower of depreciated cost or current estimated fair 
value, net of disposition costs. Depreciation is discontinued on real estate    
held for sale. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 121, valuation allowances on   
real estate held for production of income were computed using the forecasted    
cash flows of the respective properties discounted at a rate equal to the       
Company's cost of funds.                                                        

Policy loans are stated at unpaid principal balances.                 

Partnerships and joint venture interests in which the Company does not
have control or a majority economic interest are reported on the equity basis   
of accounting and are included either with equity real estate or other equity   
investments, as appropriate.                                                    

Common stocks are carried at estimated fair value and are included in 
other equity investments.                                                       

Short-term investments are stated at amortized cost which approximates
fair value and are included with other invested assets.                         

 Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, amounts due from banks
and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three 
months or less.                                                                 

   All securities are recorded in the consolidated financial statements on a
trade date basis.                                                               

Net Investment Income, Investment Gains, Net and Unrealized Investment Gains  
(Losses)                                                                      

Net investment income and realized investment gains (losses)          
(collectively, "investment results") related to certain participating group     
annuity contracts which are passed through to the contractholders are reflected 
as interest credited to policyholders' account balances.                        

F-9 

P-->49786th Page of 114TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 86th
Realized investment gains (losses) are determined by specific         
identification and are presented as a component of revenue. Changes in          
valuation allowances are included in investment gains (losses).                 

Unrealized investment gains and losses on equity securities and fixed 
maturities available for sale held by the Company are accounted for as a        
separate component of accumulated comprehensive income, net of related deferred 
Federal income taxes, amounts attributable to discontinued operations,          
participating group annuity contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs     
("DAC") related to universal life and investment-type products and              
participating traditional life contracts.                                       

Recognition of Insurance Income and Related Expenses                        

    Premiums from universal life and investment-type contracts are reported as
deposits to policyholders' account balances. Revenues from these contracts      
consist of amounts assessed during the period against policyholders' account    
balances for mortality charges, policy administration charges and surrender     
charges. Policy benefits and claims that are charged to expense include benefit 
claims incurred in the period in excess of related policyholders' account       
balances.                                                                       

Premiums from participating and non-participating traditional life and
annuity policies with life contingencies generally are recognized as income     
when due. Benefits and expenses are matched with such income so as to result in 
the recognition of profits over the life of the contracts. This match is        
accomplished by means of the provision for liabilities for future policy        
benefits and the deferral and subsequent amortization of policy acquisition     
costs.                                                                          

For contracts with a single premium or a limited number of premium    
payments due over a significantly shorter period than the total period over     
which benefits are provided, premiums are recorded as income when due with any  
excess profit deferred and recognized in income in a constant relationship to   
insurance in force or, for annuities, the amount of expected future benefit     
payments.                                                                       

 Premiums from individual health contracts are recognized as income over
the period to which the premiums relate in proportion to the amount of          
insurance protection provided.                                                  

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs                                           

The costs of acquiring new business, principally commissions,         
underwriting, agency and policy issue expenses, all of which vary with and are  
primarily related to the production of new business, are deferred. DAC is       
subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss          
recognition testing at the end of each accounting period.                       

    For universal life products and investment-type products, DAC is amortized
over the expected total life of the contract group (periods ranging from 25 to  
35 years and 5 to 17 years, respectively) as a constant percentage of estimated 
gross profits arising principally from investment results, mortality and        
expense margins and surrender charges based on historical and anticipated       
future experience, updated at the end of each accounting period. The effect on  
the amortization of DAC of revisions to estimated gross profits is reflected in 
earnings in the period such estimated gross profits are revised. The effect on  
the DAC asset that would result from realization of unrealized gains (losses)   
is recognized with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income in       
consolidated shareholder's equity as of the balance sheet date.                 

 For participating traditional life policies (substantially all of which
are in the Closed Block), DAC is amortized over the expected total life of the  
contract group (40 years) as a constant percentage based on the present value   
of the estimated gross margin amounts expected to be realized over the life of  
the contracts using the expected investment yield. At December 31, 1998, the    
expected investment yield, excluding policy loans, generally ranged from 7.29%  
grading to 6.5% over a 20 year period. Estimated gross margin includes          
anticipated premiums and investment results less claims and administrative      
expenses, changes in the net level premium reserve and expected annual          
policyholder dividends. The effect on the amortization of DAC of revisions to   
estimated gross margins is reflected in earnings in the period such estimated   
gross margins are revised. The effect on the DAC asset that would result from   
realization of unrealized gains (losses) is recognized with an offset to        
accumulated comprehensive income in consolidated shareholder's equity as of the 
balance sheet date.

For non-participating traditional life and annuity policies with life 
contingencies, DAC is amortized in proportion to anticipated premiums.          
Assumptions as to anticipated premiums are estimated at the date of policy      
issue and are consistently applied during the life of the contracts. Deviations 
from estimated experience are reflected in earnings in the period such          
deviations occur. For these contracts, the amortization periods generally are   
for the total life of the policy.                                               

For individual health benefit insurance, DAC is amortized over the    
expected average life of the contracts (10 years for major medical policies and 
20 years for disability income ("DI") products) in proportion to anticipated    
premium revenue at time of issue.                                               

Policyholders' Account Balances and Future Policy Benefits                  

Policyholders' account balances for universal life and investment-type
contracts are equal to the policy account values. The policy account values     
represents an accumulation of gross premium payments plus credited interest     
less expense and mortality charges and withdrawals.                             

For participating traditional life policies, future policy benefit    
liabilities are calculated using a net level premium method on the basis of     
actuarial assumptions equal to guaranteed mortality and dividend fund interest  
rates. The liability for annual dividends represents the accrual of annual      
dividends earned. Terminal dividends are accrued in proportion to gross margins 
over the life of the contract.                                                  

  For non-participating traditional life insurance policies, future policy
benefit liabilities are estimated using a net level premium method on the basis 
of actuarial assumptions as to mortality, persistency and interest established  
at policy issue. Assumptions established at policy issue as to mortality and    
persistency are based on the Insurance Group's experience which, together with  
interest and expense assumptions, includes a margin for adverse deviation. When 
the liabilities for future policy benefits plus the present value of expected   
future gross premiums for a product are insufficient to provide for expected    
future policy benefits and expenses for that product, DAC is written off and    
thereafter, if required, a premium deficiency reserve is established by a       
charge to earnings. Benefit liabilities for traditional annuities during the    
accumulation period are equal to accumulated contractholders' fund balances and 
after annuitization are equal to the present value of expected future payments. 
Interest rates used in establishing such liabilities range from 2.25% to 11.5%  
for life insurance liabilities and from 2.25% to 13.5% for annuity liabilities. 

During the fourth quarter of 1996 a loss recognition study of         
participating group annuity contracts and conversion annuities ("Pension Par")  
was completed which included management's revised estimate of assumptions, such 
as expected mortality and future investment returns. The study's results        
prompted management to establish a premium deficiency reserve which decreased   
earnings from continuing operations and net earnings by $47.5 million ($73.0    
million pre-tax).                                                               

    Individual health benefit liabilities for active lives are estimated using
the net level premium method and assumptions as to future morbidity,            
withdrawals and interest. Benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated  
using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to     
claim terminations, expenses and interest.                                      

During the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company completed a loss       
recognition study of the DI business which incorporated management's revised    
estimates of future experience with regard to morbidity, investment returns,    
claims and administration expenses and other factors. The study indicated DAC   
was not recoverable and the reserves were not sufficient. Earnings from         
continuing operations and net earnings decreased by $208.0 million ($320.0      
million pre-tax) as a result of strengthening DI reserves by $175.0 million and 
writing off unamortized DAC of $145.0 million related to DI products issued     
prior to July 1993. The determination of DI reserves requires making            
assumptions and estimates relating to a variety of factors, including morbidity 
and interest rates, claims experience and lapse rates based on then known facts 
and circumstances. Such factors as claim incidence and termination rates can be 
affected by changes in the economic, legal and regulatory environments and work 
ethic. While management believes its Pension Par and DI reserves have been      
calculated on a reasonable basis and are adequate, there can be no assurance    
reserves will be sufficient to provide for future liabilities.

Claim reserves and associated liabilities for individual DI and major 
medical policies were $938.6 million and $886.7 million at December 31, 1998    
and 1997, respectively. Incurred benefits (benefits paid plus changes in claim  
reserves) and benefits paid for individual DI and major medical policies        
(excluding reserve strengthening in 1996) are summarized as follows:

Policyholders' Dividends                                                    

The amount of policyholders' dividends to be paid (including those on 
policies included in the Closed Block) is determined annually by Equitable      
Life's board of directors. The aggregate amount of policyholders' dividends is  
related to actual interest, mortality, morbidity and expense experience for the 
year and judgment as to the appropriate level of statutory surplus to be        
retained by Equitable Life.                                                     

At December 31, 1998, participating policies, including those in the  
Closed Block, represent approximately 19.9% ($49.3 billion) of directly written 
life insurance in force, net of amounts ceded.                                  

Federal Income Taxes                                                        

The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return with the   
Holding Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Current Federal income taxes 
are charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be        
payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year.  
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the          
difference between financial statement carrying amounts and income tax bases of 
assets and liabilities using enacted income tax rates and laws.                 

Separate Accounts                                                           

 Separate Accounts are established in conformity with the New York State
Insurance Law and generally are not chargeable with liabilities that arise from 
any other business of the Insurance Group. Separate Accounts assets are subject 
to General Account claims only to the extent the value of such assets exceeds   
Separate Accounts liabilities.                                                  

    Assets and liabilities of the Separate Accounts, representing net deposits
and accumulated net investment earnings less fees, held primarily for the       
benefit of contractholders, and for which the Insurance Group does not bear the 
investment risk, are shown as separate captions in the consolidated balance     
sheets. The Insurance Group bears the investment risk on assets held in one     
Separate Account; therefore, such assets are carried on the same basis as       
similar assets held in the General Account portfolio. Assets held in the other  
Separate Accounts are carried at quoted market values or, where quoted values   
are not available, at estimated fair values as determined by the Insurance      
Group.                                                                          

  The investment results of Separate Accounts on which the Insurance Group
does not bear the investment risk are reflected directly in Separate Accounts   
liabilities. For 1998, 1997 and 1996, investment results of such Separate       
Accounts were $4,591.0 million, $3,411.1 million and $2,970.6 million,          
respectively.                                                                   

Deposits to Separate Accounts are reported as increases in Separate   
Accounts liabilities and are not reported in revenues. Mortality, policy        
administration and surrender charges on all Separate Accounts are included in   
revenues.

    For publicly traded fixed maturities and equity securities, estimated fair
value is determined using quoted market prices. For fixed maturities without a  
readily ascertainable market value, the Company determines an estimated fair    
value using a discounted cash flow approach, including provisions for credit    
risk, generally based on the assumption such securities will be held to         
maturity. Estimated fair values for equity securities, substantially all of     
which do not have a readily ascertainable market value, have been determined by 
the Company. Such estimated fair values do not necessarily represent the values 
for which these securities could have been sold at the dates of the             
consolidated balance sheets. At December 31,

    Corporate bonds held to maturity with an amortized cost and estimated fair
value of $125.0 million are due in one year or less.                            

 Bonds not due at a single maturity date have been included in the above
table in the year of final maturity. Actual maturities will differ from         
contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay   
obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.                       

The Insurance Group's fixed maturity investment portfolio includes    
corporate high yield securities consisting of public high yield bonds,          
redeemable preferred stocks and directly negotiated debt in leveraged buyout    
transactions. The Insurance Group seeks to minimize the higher than normal      
credit risks associated with such securities by monitoring concentrations in    
any single issuer or a particular industry group. Certain of these corporate    
high yield securities are classified as other than investment grade by the      
various rating agencies, i.e., a rating below Baa or National Association of    
Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") designation of 3 (medium grade), 4 or 5 (below 
investment grade) or 6 (in or near default). At December 31, 1998,              
approximately 15.1% of the $18,336.1 million aggregate amortized cost of bonds  
held by the Company was considered to be other than investment grade.           

In addition, the Insurance Group is an equity investor in limited     
partnership interests which primarily invest in securities considered to be     
other than investment grade.                                                    

Fixed maturity investments with restructured or modified terms are not
material.

At December 31, 1998 and 1997, mortgage loans on real estate with     
scheduled payments 60 days (90 days for agricultural mortgages) or more past    
due or in foreclosure (collectively, "problem mortgage loans on real estate")   
had an amortized cost of $7.0 million (0.2% of total mortgage loans on real     
estate) and $23.4 million (0.9% of total mortgage loans on real estate),        
respectively.                                                                   

  The payment terms of mortgage loans on real estate may from time to time
be restructured or modified. The investment in restructured mortgage loans on   
real estate, based on amortized cost, amounted to $115.1 million and $183.4     
million at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Gross interest income on   
restructured mortgage loans on real estate that would have been recorded in     
accordance with the original terms of such loans amounted to $10.3 million,     
$17.2 million and $35.5 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Gross     
interest income on these loans included in net investment income aggregated     
$8.3 million, $12.7 million and $28.2 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996,           
respectively.                                                                   

Impaired mortgage loans (as defined under SFAS No. 114) along with the
related provision for losses were as follows:

  Impaired mortgage loans without provision for losses are loans where the
fair value of the collateral or the net present value of the expected future    
cash flows related to the loan equals or exceeds the recorded investment.       
Interest income earned on loans where the collateral value is used to measure   
impairment is recorded on a cash basis. Interest income on loans where the      
present value method is used to measure impairment is accrued on the net        
carrying value amount of the loan at the interest rate used to discount the     
cash flows. Changes in the present value attributable to changes in the amount  
or timing of expected cash flows are reported as investment gains or losses.    

  During 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively, the Company's average recorded
investment in impaired mortgage loans was $161.3 million, $246.9 million and    
$552.1 million. Interest income recognized on these impaired mortgage loans     
totaled $12.3 million, $15.2 million and $38.8 million ($.9 million, $2.3       
million and $17.9 million recognized on a cash basis) for 1998, 1997 and 1996,  
respectively.                                                                   

  The Insurance Group's investment in equity real estate is through direct
ownership and through investments in real estate joint ventures. At December
31, 1998 and 1997, the carrying value of equity real estate held for sale       
amounted to $836.2 million and $1,023.5 million, respectively. For 1998, 1997   
and 1996, respectively, real estate of $7.1 million, $152.0 million and $58.7   
million was acquired in satisfaction of debt. At December 31, 1998 and 1997,    
the Company owned $552.3 million and $693.3 million, respectively, of real      
estate acquired in satisfaction of debt.                                        

Depreciation of real estate held for production of income is computed 
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the           
properties, which generally range from 40 to 50 years. Accumulated depreciation 
on real estate was $374.8 million and $541.1 million at December 31, 1998 and   
1997, respectively. Depreciation expense on real estate totaled $30.5 million,  
$74.9 million and $91.8 million for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

  Writedowns of fixed maturities amounted to $101.6 million, $11.7 million
and $29.9 million for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively, and writedowns of      
equity real estate subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 121 amounted to       
$136.4 million for 1997. In the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company             
reclassified $1,095.4 million depreciated cost of equity real estate from real  
estate held for the production of income to real estate held for sale.          
Additions to valuation allowances of $227.6 million were recorded upon these    
transfers. Additionally, in fourth quarter 1997, $132.3 million of writedowns   
on real estate held for production of income were recorded.                     

    For 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively, proceeds received on sales of fixed
maturities classified as available for sale amounted to $15,961.0 million,      
$9,789.7 million and $8,353.5 million. Gross gains of $149.3 million, $166.0    
million and $154.2 million and gross losses of $95.1 million, $108.8 million    
and $92.7 million, respectively, were realized on these sales. The change in    
unrealized investment gains (losses) related to fixed maturities classified as  
available for sale for 1998, 1997 and 1996 amounted to $(331.7) million, $513.4 
million and $(258.0) million, respectively.                                     

For 1998, 1997 and 1996, investment results passed through to certain 
participating group annuity contracts as interest credited to policyholders'    
account balances amounted to $136.9 million, $137.5 million and $136.7 million, 
respectively.                                                                   

 On June 10, 1997, Equitable Life sold EREIM (other than its interest in
Column Financial, Inc.) ("ERE") to Lend Lease Corporation Limited ("Lend        
Lease"), a publicly traded, international property and financial services       
company based in Sydney, Australia. The total purchase price was $400.0 million 
and consisted of $300.0 million in cash and a $100.0 million note which was     
paid in 1998. The Company

recognized an investment gain of $162.4 million, net of Federal income tax of   
$87.4 million as a result of this transaction. Equitable Life entered into      
long-term advisory agreements whereby ERE continues to provide substantially    
the same services to Equitable Life's General Account and Separate Accounts,    
for substantially the same fees, as provided prior to the sale.                 

Through June 10, 1997 and for the year ended December 31, 1996,       
respectively, the businesses sold reported combined revenues of $91.6 million   
and $226.1 million and combined net earnings of $10.7 million and $30.7         
million.                                                                        

In 1996, Alliance acquired the business of Cursitor Holdings L.P. and 
Cursitor Holdings Limited (collectively, "Cursitor") for approximately $159.0   
million. The purchase price consisted of $94.3 million in cash, 1.8 million of  
Alliance's publicly traded units ("Alliance Units"), 6% notes aggregating $21.5 
million payable ratably over four years, and additional consideration to be     
determined at a later date but currently estimated to not exceed $10.0 million. 
The excess of the purchase price, including acquisition costs and minority      
interest, over the fair value of Cursitor's net assets acquired resulted in the 
recognition of intangible assets consisting of costs assigned to contracts      
acquired and goodwill of approximately $122.8 million and $38.3 million,        
respectively. The Company recognized an investment gain of $20.6 million as a   
result of the issuance of Alliance Units in this transaction. On June 30, 1997, 
Alliance reduced the recorded value of goodwill and contracts associated with   
Alliance's acquisition of Cursitor by $120.9 million. This charge reflected     
Alliance's view that Cursitor's continuing decline in assets under management   
and its reduced profitability, resulting from relative investment               
underperformance, no longer supported the carrying value of its investment. As  
a result, the Company's earnings from continuing operations before cumulative   
effect of accounting change for 1997 included a charge of $59.5 million, net of 
a Federal income tax benefit of $10.0 million and minority interest of $51.4    
million. The remaining balance of intangible assets is being amortized over its 
estimated useful life of 20 years. At December 31, 1998, the Company's          
ownership of Alliance Units was approximately 56.7%.                            

Net unrealized investment gains (losses), included in the consolidated
balance sheets as a component of accumulated comprehensive income and the       
changes for the corresponding years, are summarized as follows:

  At December 31, 1998 and 1997, problem mortgage loans on real estate had
an amortized cost of $5.1 million and $8.1 million, respectively, and mortgage  
loans on real estate for which the payment terms have been restructured had an  
amortized cost of $26.0 million and $70.5 million, respectively.                

Impaired mortgage loans (as defined under SFAS No. 114) along with the
related provision for losses were as follows:

    During 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Closed Block's average recorded investment
in impaired mortgage loans was $85.5 million, $110.2 million and $153.8         
million, respectively. Interest income recognized on these impaired mortgage    
loans totaled $4.7 million, $9.4 million and $10.9 million ($1.5 million, $4.1  
million and $4.7 million recognized on a cash basis) for 1998, 1997 and 1996,   
respectively.                                                                   

Valuation allowances amounted to $11.1 million and $18.5 million on   
mortgage loans on real estate and $15.4 million and $16.8 million on equity     
real estate at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. As of January 1, 1996, 
the adoption of SFAS No. 121 resulted in the recognition of impairment losses   
of $5.6 million on real estate held for production of income. Writedowns of     
fixed maturities amounted to $3.5 million and $12.8 million for 1997 and 1996,  
respectively. Writedowns of equity real estate subsequent to the adoption of    
SFAS No. 121 amounted to $28.8 million for 1997.                                

 In the fourth quarter of 1997, $72.9 million depreciated cost of equity
real estate held for production of income was reclassified to equity real       
estate held for sale. Additions to valuation allowances of $15.4 million were   
recorded upon these transfers. Additionally, in fourth quarter 1997, $28.8      
million of writedowns on real estate held for production of income were         
recorded.                                                                       

    Many expenses related to Closed Block operations are charged to operations
outside of the Closed Block; accordingly, the contribution from the Closed      
Block does not represent the actual profitability of the Closed Block           
operations. Operating costs and expenses outside of the Closed Block are,       
therefore, disproportionate to the business outside of the Closed Block.

The Company's quarterly process for evaluating the allowance for future
losses applies the current period's results of the discontinued operations      
against the allowance, re-estimates future losses and adjusts the allowance, if 
appropriate. Additionally, as part of the Company's annual planning process     
which takes place in the fourth quarter of each year, investment and benefit    
cash flow projections are prepared. These updated assumptions and estimates     
resulted in a release of allowance in 1998 and strengthening of allowance in    
1997 and 1996.                                                                  

  In the fourth quarter of 1997, $329.9 million depreciated cost of equity
real estate was reclassified from equity real estate held for production of     
income to real estate held for sale. Additions to valuation allowances of $79.8 
million were recognized upon these transfers. Additionally, in fourth quarter   
1997, $92.5 million of writedowns on real estate held for production of income  
were recognized.

Short-term Debt                                                             

    Equitable Life has a $350.0 million bank credit facility available to fund
short-term working capital needs and to facilitate the securities settlement    
process. The credit facility consists of two types of borrowing options with    
varying interest rates and expires in September 2000. The interest rates are    
based on external indices dependent on the type of borrowing and at December
31, 1998 range from 5.23% to 7.75%. There were no borrowings outstanding under  
this bank credit facility at December 31, 1998.                                 

Equitable Life has a commercial paper program with an issue limit of  
$500.0 million. This program is available for general corporate purposes used   
to support Equitable Life's liquidity needs and is supported by Equitable       
Life's existing $350.0 million bank credit facility. At December 31, 1998,      
there were no borrowings outstanding under this program.                        

During July 1998, Alliance entered into a $425.0 million five-year    
revolving credit facility with a group of commercial banks which replaced a     
$250.0 million revolving credit facility. Under the facility, the interest      
rate, at the option of Alliance, is a floating rate generally based upon a      
defined prime rate, a rate related to the London Interbank Offered Rate         
("LIBOR") or the Federal Funds Rate. A facility fee is payable on the total     
facility. During September 1998, Alliance increased the size of its commercial  
paper program from $250.0 million to $425.0 million. Borrowings from these two  
sources may not exceed $425.0 million in the aggregate. The revolving credit    
facility provides backup liquidity for commercial paper issued under Alliance's 
commercial paper program and can be used as a direct source of borrowing. The   
revolving credit facility contains covenants which require Alliance to, among   
other things, meet certain financial ratios. As of December 31, 1998, Alliance  
had commercial paper outstanding totaling $179.5 million at an effective        
interest rate of 5.5% and there were no borrowings outstanding under Alliance's 
revolving credit facility.                                                      

Long-term Debt                                                              

Several of the long-term debt agreements have restrictive covenants   
related to the total amount of debt, net tangible assets and other matters. The 
Company is in compliance with all debt covenants.                               

  The Company has pledged real estate, mortgage loans, cash and securities
amounting to $640.2 million and $1,164.0 million at December 31, 1998 and 1997, 
respectively, as collateral for certain short-term and long-term debt.          

   At December 31, 1998, aggregate maturities of the long-term debt based on
required principal payments at maturity for 1999 and the succeeding four years  
are $322.8 million, $6.9 million, $1.7 million, $1.8 million and $2.0 million,  
respectively, and $668.0 million thereafter.

    The deferred Federal income taxes impacting operations reflect the net tax
effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and     
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income    
tax purposes. The sources of these temporary differences and the tax effects of 
each are as follows:

11) REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS                                                      

The Insurance Group assumes and cedes reinsurance with other insurance
companies. The Insurance Group evaluates the financial condition of its         
reinsurers to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer        
insolvencies. Ceded reinsurance does not relieve the originating insurer of     
liability. The effect of reinsurance (excluding group life and health) is       
summarized as follows:

 Beginning in May 1997, the Company began reinsuring on a yearly renewal
term basis 90% of the mortality risk on new issues of certain term, universal   
and variable life products. During 1996, the Company's retention limit on joint 
survivorship policies was increased to $15.0 million. Effective January 1,
1994, all in force business above $5.0 million was reinsured. The Insurance     
Group also reinsures the entire risk on certain substandard underwriting risks  
as well as in certain other cases.                                              

   The Insurance Group cedes 100% of its group life and health business to a
third party insurance company. Premiums ceded totaled $1.3 million, $1.6        
million and $2.4 million for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Ceded death and 
disability benefits totaled $15.6 million, $4.3 million and $21.2 million for   
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Insurance liabilities ceded totaled $560.3   
million and $593.8 million at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.         

12) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS                                                      
The Company sponsors qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans
covering substantially all employees (including certain qualified part-time     
employees), managers and certain agents. The pension plans are                  
non-contributory. Equitable Life's benefits are based on a cash balance formula 
or years of service and final average earnings, if greater, under certain       
grandfathering rules in the plans. Alliance's benefits are based on years of    
credited service, average final base salary and primary social security         
benefits. The Company's funding policy is to make the minimum contribution      
required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").      

Components of net periodic pension cost (credit) for the qualified and
non-qualified plans are as follows:

   The discount rate and rate of increase in future compensation levels used
in determining the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations     
were 7.0% and 3.83%, respectively, at December 31, 1998 and 7.25% and 4.07%,    
respectively, at December 31, 1997. As of January 1, 1998 and 1997, the         
expected long-term rate of return on assets for the retirement plan was 10.25%. 

    The Company recorded, as a reduction of shareholders' equity an additional
minimum pension liability of $28.3 million and $17.3 million, net of Federal    
income taxes, at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, primarily            
representing the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation of the qualified  
pension plan over the accrued liability.                                        

The pension plan's assets include corporate and government debt       
securities, equity securities, equity real estate and shares of group trusts    
managed by Alliance.                                                            

 Prior to 1987, the qualified plan funded participants' benefits through
the purchase of non-participating annuity contracts from Equitable Life.        
Benefit payments under these contracts were approximately $31.8 million, $33.2  
million and $34.7 million for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.                

The Company provides certain medical and life insurance benefits      
(collectively, "postretirement benefits") for qualifying employees, managers    
and agents retiring from the Company (i) on or after attaining age 55 who have  
at least 10 years of service or (ii) on or after attaining age 65 or (iii)      
whose jobs have been abolished and who have attained age 50 with 20 years of    
service. The life insurance benefits are related to age and salary at           
retirement. The costs of postretirement benefits are recognized in accordance   
with the provisions of SFAS No. 106. The Company continues to fund              
postretirement benefits costs on a pay-as-you-go basis and, for 1998, 1997 and  
1996, the Company made estimated postretirement benefits payments of $28.4      
million, $18.7 million and $18.9 million, respectively.

 Since January 1, 1994, costs to the Company for providing these medical
benefits available to retirees under age 65 are the same as those offered to    
active employees and medical benefits will be limited to 200% of 1993 costs for 
all participants.                                                               

   The assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated
postretirement benefits obligation was 8.0% in 1998, gradually declining to     
2.5% in the year 2009, and in 1997 was 8.75%, gradually declining to 2.75% in   
the year 2009. The discount rate used in determining the accumulated            
postretirement benefits obligation was 7.0% and 7.25% at December 31, 1998 and  
1997, respectively.                                                             

  If the health care cost trend rate assumptions were increased by 1%, the
accumulated postretirement benefits obligation as of December 31, 1998 would be 
increased 4.83%. The effect of this change on the sum of the service cost and   
interest cost would be an increase of 4.57%. If the health care cost trend rate 
assumptions were decreased by 1% the accumulated postretirement benefits        
obligation as of December 31, 1998 would be decreased by 5.6%. The effect of    
this change on the sum of the service cost and interest cost would be a         
decrease of 5.4%.                                                               

13) DERIVATIVES AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS                         

Derivatives                                                                 

 The Insurance Group primarily uses derivatives for asset/liability risk
management and for hedging individual securities. Derivatives mainly are        
utilized to reduce the Insurance Group's exposure to interest rate              
fluctuations. Accounting for interest rate swap transactions is on an accrual   
basis. Gains and losses related to interest rate swap transactions are          
amortized as yield adjustments over the remaining life of the underlying hedged 
security. Income and expense resulting from interest rate swap activities are   
reflected in net investment income. The notional amount of matched interest     
rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, was $880.9  
million and $1,353.4 million. The average unexpired terms at December 31, 1998  
ranged from 1 month to 4.3 years. At December 31, 1998, the cost of terminating 
swaps in a loss position was $8.0 million. Equitable Life has implemented an    
interest rate cap program designed to hedge crediting rates on                  
interest-sensitive individual annuities contracts. The outstanding notional     
amounts at December 31, 1998 of contracts purchased and sold were $8,450.0      
million

and $875.0 million, respectively. The net premium paid by Equitable Life on     
these contracts was $54.8 million and is being amortized ratably over the       
contract periods ranging from 1 to 5 years. Income and expense resulting from   
this program are reflected as an adjustment to interest credited to             
policyholders' account balances.                                                

    Substantially all of DLJ's activities related to derivatives are, by their
nature trading activities which are primarily for the purpose of customer       
accommodations. DLJ enters into certain contractual agreements referred to as   
derivatives or off-balance-sheet financial instruments involving futures,       
forwards and options. DLJ's derivative activities consist of writing            
over-the-counter ("OTC") options to accommodate its customer needs, trading in  
forward contracts in U.S. government and agency issued or guaranteed securities 
and in futures contracts on equity-based indices, interest rate instruments and 
currencies and issuing structured products based on emerging market financial   
instruments and indices. DLJ's involvement in swap contracts and commodity      
derivative instruments is not significant.                                      

Fair Value of Financial Instruments                                         

The Company defines fair value as the quoted market prices for those  
instruments that are actively traded in financial markets. In cases where       
quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using present 
value or other valuation techniques. The fair value estimates are made at a     
specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments     
about the financial instrument, including estimates of the timing and amount of 
expected future cash flows and the credit standing of counterparties. Such      
estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from         
offering for sale at one time the Company's entire holdings of a particular     
financial instrument, nor do they consider the tax impact of the realization of 
unrealized gains or losses. In many cases, the fair value estimates cannot be   
substantiated by comparison to independent markets, nor can the disclosed value 
be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument.                          

Certain financial instruments are excluded, particularly insurance    
liabilities other than financial guarantees and investment contracts. Fair      
market value of off-balance-sheet financial instruments of the Insurance Group  
was not material at December 31, 1998 and 1997.                                 

    Fair values for mortgage loans on real estate are estimated by discounting
future contractual cash flows using interest rates at which loans with similar  
characteristics and credit quality would be made. Fair values for foreclosed    
mortgage loans and problem mortgage loans are limited to the estimated fair     
value of the underlying collateral if lower.                                    

    Fair values of policy loans are estimated by discounting the face value of
the loans from the time of the next interest rate review to the present, at a   
rate equal to the excess of the current estimated market rates over the current 
interest rate charged on the loan.                                              

 The estimated fair values for the Company's association plan contracts,
supplementary contracts not involving life contingencies ("SCNILC") and         
annuities certain, which are included in policyholders' account balances, and   
guaranteed interest contracts are estimated using projected cash flows          
discounted at rates reflecting expected current offering rates.                 

The estimated fair values for variable deferred annuities and single  
premium deferred annuities ("SPDA"), which are included in policyholders'       
account balances, are estimated by discounting the account value back from the  
time of the next crediting rate review to the present, at a rate equal to the   
excess of current estimated market rates offered on new policies over the       
current crediting rates.                                                        

Fair values for long-term debt are determined using published market  
values, where available, or contractual cash flows discounted at market         
interest rates. The estimated fair values for non-recourse mortgage debt are    
determined by discounting contractual cash flows at a rate which takes into     
account the level of current market interest rates and collateral risk. The     
estimated fair values for recourse mortgage debt are determined by discounting  
contractual cash flows at a rate based upon current interest rates of other     
companies with credit ratings similar to the Company. The Company's carrying    
value of short-term borrowings approximates their estimated fair value.

14) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES                                      
The Company has provided, from time to time, certain guarantees or    
commitments to affiliates, investors and others. These arrangements include     
commitments by the Company, under certain conditions: to make capital           
contributions of up to $142.9 million to affiliated real estate joint ventures; 
and to provide equity financing to certain limited partnerships of $287.3       
million at December 31, 1998, under existing loan or loan commitment            
agreements.                                                                     

Equitable Life is the obligor under certain structured settlement     
agreements which it had entered into with unaffiliated insurance companies and  
beneficiaries. To satisfy its obligations under these agreements, Equitable     
Life owns single premium annuities issued by previously wholly owned life       
insurance subsidiaries. Equitable Life has directed payment under these         
annuities to be made directly to the beneficiaries under the structured         
settlement agreements. A contingent liability exists with respect to these      
agreements should the previously wholly owned subsidiaries be unable to meet    
their obligations. Management believes the satisfaction of those obligations by 
Equitable Life is remote.                                                       

   The Insurance Group had $24.7 million of letters of credit outstanding at
December 31, 1998.                                                              

15) LITIGATION                                                                  

Major Medical Insurance Cases                                               

Equitable Life agreed to settle, subject to court approval, previously
disclosed cases involving lifetime guaranteed renewable major medical insurance 
policies issued by Equitable Life in five states. Plaintiffs in these cases     
claimed that Equitable Life's method for determining premium increases breached 
the terms of certain forms of the policies and was misrepresented. In certain   
cases plaintiffs also claimed that Equitable Life misrepresented to             
policyholders that premium increases had been approved by insurance             
departments, and that it determined annual rate increases in a manner that      
discriminated against the policyholders.

In December 1997, Equitable Life entered into a settlement agreement, 
subject to court approval, which would result in creation of a nationwide class 
consisting of all persons holding, and paying premiums on, the policies at any  
time since January 1, 1988 and the dismissal with prejudice of the pending      
actions and the resolution of all similar claims on a nationwide basis. Under   
the terms of the settlement, which involves approximately 127,000 former and    
current policyholders, Equitable Life would pay $14.2 million in exchange for   
release of all claims and will provide future relief to certain current         
policyholders by restricting future premium increases, estimated to have a      
present value of $23.3 million. This estimate is based upon assumptions about   
future events that cannot be predicted with certainty and accordingly the       
actual value of the future relief may vary. In October 1998, the court entered  
a judgment approving the settlement agreement and, in November, a member of the 
national class filed a notice of appeal of the judgment. In January 1999, the   
Court of Appeals granted Equitable Life's motion to dismiss the appeal.         

Life Insurance and Annuity Sales Cases                                      

   A number of lawsuits are pending as individual claims and purported class
actions against Equitable Life and its subsidiary insurance companies Equitable 
Variable Life Insurance Company ("EVLICO," which was merged into Equitable Life 
effective January 1, 1997) and The Equitable of Colorado, Inc. ("EOC"). These   
actions involve, among other things, sales of life and annuity products for     
varying periods from 1980 to the present, and allege, among other things, sales 
practice misrepresentation primarily involving: the number of premium payments  
required; the propriety of a product as an investment vehicle; the propriety of 
a product as a replacement of an existing policy; and failure to disclose a     
product as life insurance. Some actions are in state courts and others are in   
U.S. District Courts in varying jurisdictions, and are in varying stages of     
discovery and motions for class certification.                                  

In general, the plaintiffs request an unspecified amount of damages,  
punitive damages, enjoinment from the described practices, prohibition against  
cancellation of policies for non-payment of premium or other remedies, as well  
as attorneys' fees and expenses. Similar actions have been filed against other  
life and health insurers and have resulted in the award of substantial          
judgments, including material amounts of punitive damages, or in substantial    
settlements. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with        
certainty, particularly in the early stages of an action, The Equitable's       
management believes that the ultimate resolution of these cases should not have 
a material adverse effect on the financial position of The Equitable. The       
Equitable's management cannot make an estimate of loss, if any, or predict      
whether or not any such litigation will have a material adverse effect on The   
Equitable's results of operations in any particular period.                     

Discrimination Case                                                         

    Equitable Life is a defendant in an action, certified as a class action in
September 1997, in the United States District Court for the Northern District   
of Alabama, Southern Division, involving alleged discrimination on the basis of 
race against African-American applicants and potential applicants in hiring     
individuals as sales agents. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment and         
affirmative and negative injunctive relief, including the payment of back-pay,  
pension and other compensation. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be    
predicted with certainty, The Equitable's management believes that the ultimate 
resolution of this matter should not have a material adverse effect on the      
financial position of The Equitable. The Equitable's management cannot make an  
estimate of loss, if any, or predict whether or not such matter will have a     
material adverse effect on The Equitable's results of operations in any         
particular period.                                                              

Alliance Capital                                                            

 In July 1995, a class action complaint was filed against Alliance North
American Government Income Trust, Inc. (the "Fund"), Alliance and certain other 
defendants affiliated with Alliance, including the Holding Company, alleging    
violations of Federal securities laws, fraud and breach of fiduciary duty in    
connection with the Fund's investments in Mexican and Argentine securities. The 
original complaint was dismissed in 1996; on appeal, the dismissal was          
affirmed. In October 1996, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an       
amended complaint, alleging the Fund failed to hedge against currency risk      
despite

representations that it would do so, the Fund did not properly disclose that it 
planned to invest in mortgage-backed derivative securities and two Fund         
advertisements misrepresented the risks of investing in the Fund. In October    
1998, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued an order granting 
plaintiffs' motion to file an amended complaint alleging that the Fund          
misrepresented its ability to hedge against currency risk and denying           
plaintiffs' motion to file an amended complaint containing the other            
allegations. Alliance believes that the allegations in the amended complaint,   
which was filed in February 1999, are without merit and intends to defend       
itself vigorously against these claims. While the ultimate outcome of this      
matter cannot be determined at this time, Alliance's management does not expect 
that it will have a material adverse effect on Alliance's results of operations 
or financial condition.                                                         

DLJSC                                                                       

 DLJSC is a defendant along with certain other parties in a class action
complaint involving the underwriting of units, consisting of notes and warrants 
to purchase common shares, of Rickel Home Centers, Inc. ("Rickel"), which filed 
a voluntary petition for reorganization pursuant to Chapter 11 of the           
Bankruptcy Code. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive      
damages from DLJSC, as an underwriter and as an owner of 7.3% of the common     
stock, for alleged violation of Federal securities laws and common law fraud    
for alleged misstatements and omissions contained in the prospectus and         
registration statement used in the offering of the units. DLJSC is defending    
itself vigorously against all the allegations contained in the complaint.       
Although there can be no assurance, DLJ's management does not believe that the  
ultimate outcome of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on      
DLJ's consolidated financial condition. Due to the early stage of this          
litigation, based on the information currently available to it, DLJ's           
management cannot predict whether or not such litigation will have a material   
adverse effect on DLJ's results of operations in any particular period.         

 DLJSC is a defendant in a purported class action filed in a Texas State
Court on behalf of the holders of $550 million principal amount of subordinated 
redeemable discount debentures of National Gypsum Corporation ("NGC"). The      
debentures were canceled in connection with a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization 
for NGC consummated in July 1993. The litigation seeks compensatory and         
punitive damages for DLJSC's activities as financial advisor to NGC in the      
course of NGC's Chapter 11 proceedings. Trial is expected in early May 1999.    
DLJSC intends to defend itself vigorously against all the allegations contained 
in the complaint. Although there can be no assurance, DLJ's management does not 
believe that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will have a material       
adverse effect on DLJ's consolidated financial condition. Based upon the        
information currently available to it, DLJ's management cannot predict whether  
or not such litigation will have a material adverse effect on DLJ's results of  
operations in any particular period.                                            

   DLJSC is a defendant in a complaint which alleges that DLJSC and a number
of other financial institutions and several individual defendants violated      
civil provisions of RICO by inducing plaintiffs to invest over $40 million in   
The Securities Groups, a number of tax shelter limited partnerships, during the 
years 1978 through 1982. The plaintiffs seek recovery of the loss of their      
entire investment and an approximately equivalent amount of tax-related         
damages. Judgment for damages under RICO are subject to trebling. Discovery is  
complete. Trial has been scheduled for May 17, 1999. DLJSC believes that it has 
meritorious defenses to the complaints and will continue to contest the suits   
vigorously. Although there can be no assurance, DLJ's management does not       
believe that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will have a material       
adverse effect on DLJ's consolidated financial condition. Based upon the        
information currently available to it, DLJ's management cannot predict whether  
or not such litigation will have a material adverse effect on DLJ's results of  
operations in any particular period.                                            

DLJSC is a defendant along with certain other parties in four actions 
involving Mid-American Waste Systems, Inc. ("Mid-American"), which filed a      
voluntary petition for reorganization pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy  
Code in January 1997. Three actions seek rescission, compensatory and punitive  
damages for DLJSC's role in underwriting notes of Mid-American. The other       
action, filed by the Plan Administrator for the bankruptcy estate of            
Mid-American, alleges that DLJSC is liable as an underwriter for alleged        
misrepresentations and omissions in the prospectus for the notes, and liable as 
financial advisor to Mid-American for allegedly failing to advise Mid-American  
about its financial condition. DLJSC

Other Matters                                                               

 In addition to the matters described above, the Holding Company and its
subsidiaries are involved in various legal actions and proceedings in           
connection with their businesses. Some of the actions and proceedings have been 
brought on behalf of various alleged classes of claimants and certain of these  
claimants seek damages of unspecified amounts. While the ultimate outcome of    
such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management   
no such matter is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's     
consolidated financial position or results of operations.                       

16) LEASES                                                                      
The Company has entered into operating leases for office space and certain
other assets, principally data processing equipment and office furniture and    
equipment. Future minimum payments under noncancelable leases for 1999 and the  
succeeding four years are $98.7 million, $92.7 million, $73.4 million, $59.9    
million, $55.8 million and $550.1 million thereafter. Minimum future sublease   
rental income on these noncancelable leases for 1999 and the succeeding four    
years is $7.6 million, $5.6 million, $4.6 million, $2.3 million, $2.3 million   
and $25.4 million thereafter.                                                   

 At December 31, 1998, the minimum future rental income on noncancelable
operating leases for wholly owned investments in real estate for 1999 and the   
succeeding four years is $189.2 million, $177.0 million, $165.5 million, $145.4 
million, $122.8 million and $644.7 million thereafter.

18) INSURANCE GROUP STATUTORY FINANCIAL INFORMATION                             

   Equitable Life is restricted as to the amounts it may pay as dividends to
the Holding Company. Under the New York Insurance Law, the Superintendent has   
broad discretion to determine whether the financial condition of a stock life   
insurance company would support the payment of dividends to its shareholders.   
For 1998, 1997 and 1996, statutory net income (loss) totaled $384.4 million,    
$(351.7) million and $(351.1) million, respectively. Statutory surplus, capital 
stock and Asset Valuation Reserve ("AVR") totaled $4,728.0 million and $3,907.1 
million at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. No dividends have been     
paid by Equitable Life to the Holding Company to date.                          

At December 31, 1998, the Insurance Group, in accordance with various 
government and state regulations, had $25.6 million of securities deposited     
with such government or state agencies.                                         

   The differences between statutory surplus and capital stock determined in
accordance with Statutory Accounting Principles ("SAP") and total shareholders' 
equity on a GAAP basis are primarily attributable to: (a) inclusion in SAP of   
an AVR intended to stabilize surplus from fluctuations in the value of the      
investment portfolio; (b) future policy benefits and policyholders' account     
balances under SAP differ from GAAP due to differences between actuarial        
assumptions and reserving methodologies; (c) certain policy acquisition costs   
are expensed under SAP but deferred under GAAP and amortized over future        
periods to achieve a matching of revenues and expenses; (d) Federal income      
taxes are generally accrued under SAP based upon revenues and expenses in the   
Federal income tax return while under GAAP deferred taxes are provided for      
timing differences between recognition of revenues and expenses for financial   
reporting and income tax purposes; (e) valuation of assets under SAP and GAAP   
differ due to different investment valuation and depreciation methodologies, as 
well as the deferral of interest-related realized capital gains and losses on   
fixed income investments; and (f) differences in the accrual methodologies for  
post-employment and retirement benefit plans.                                   

19) BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION                                                
The Company's operations consist of Insurance and Investment Services. The
Company's management evaluates the performance of each of these segments        
independently and allocates resources based on current and future requirements  
of each segment. Management evaluates the performance of each segment based     
upon operating results adjusted to exclude the effect of unusual or             
non-recurring events and transactions and certain revenue and expense           
categories not related to the base operations of the particular business net of 
minority interest. Information for all periods is presented on a comparable     
basis.                                                                          

Intersegment investment advisory and other fees of approximately $61.8
million, $84.1 million and $129.2 million for 1998, 1997 and 1996,              
respectively, are included in total revenues of the Investment Services         
segment. These fees, excluding amounts related to discontinued operations of    
$.5 million, $4.2 million and $13.3 million for 1998, 1997 and 1996,            
respectively, are eliminated in consolidation.

(1) In certain states the 300+ Series contracts are individual contracts.       

(2) This investment option may be referred to as an "AXA Allocation Portfolio". 

You may allocate amounts to any of the Funds. They, in turn, invest in a        
corresponding securities portfolio ("Portfolio") of AXA Premier VIP Trust or EQ 
Advisors Trust (the "Trusts"). Your investment results in a Fund will depend on 
the investment experience of the related Portfolio and timing of transactions   
such as contributions and transfers. Each Fund is a subaccount of our Separate  
Account No. 301.                                                                

GUARANTEED RATE ACCOUNTS. You may allocate amounts to the GRAs which offer      
guarantees of principal, as well as interest at rates we set.                   

TYPES OF CONTRACTS. We offer the Certificates for use as:                       

o Regular IRAs or Roth IRAs                                                     

o Tax Sheltered Annuities ("TSAs")                                              

o Simplified Employee Pensions ("SEP")                                          

o Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees ("SIMPLE")                        

A registration statement relating to this offering has been filed with the      
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). A Statement of Additional           
Information ("SAI") dated May 1, 2008, which is part of the registration        
statement, is available free of charge upon request by writing to us or calling 
1-800-248-2138, our toll-free number (1-800-248-2138-0 in France, Italy, Korea,

reference into this prospectus. This prospectus and the SAI can also be obtained

Tax-favored payout alternatives.                                        

Because you are purchasing an annuity contract as an Individual Retirement      
Annuity ("IRA"), or to fund a qualified employer sponsored retirement           
arrangement, you should be aware that such annuities do not provide tax deferral
benefits beyond those already provided by the Internal Revenue Code. Before     
purchasing one of these annuities, you should consider whether its features and 
benefits beyond tax deferral meet your needs and goals. You may also want to    
consider the relative features, benefits and costs of these annuities with any  
other investment that you may use in connection with your retirement plan or    
arrangement. (For more information, see "Tax information", later in this        
prospectus and in the SAI).                                                     

MINIMUM CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS                                                    

o   AXA Equitable has no minimum (If you are contributing through an employer,  
the employer may have a minimum).                                       

ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY                                                            

o   Lump sum withdrawals (You may be subject to a withdrawal charge for certain 
   withdrawals or transfers from the GRAs. You may also incur income tax and a
penalty tax on any withdrawal.)                                         

PAYOUT ALTERNATIVES

The following tables describe the fees and expenses that you will pay when

is more fully described in "Charges and expenses" later in this prospectus.     

The first table describes fees and expenses that you will pay at the time of    
your initial contribution, if you take withdrawals or make transfers from the

your state, may also apply.

portfolio fees and expenses.

A proportionate share of all fees and expenses paid by a "Portfolio" that       
corresponds to any Fund of the Trusts to which monies are allocated also        
applies. The table below shows the lowest and highest total operating expenses  
as of December 31, 2007 charged by any of the Portfolios that apply periodically
during the time that you own the Policy. These fees and expenses are reflected  
in the Portfolio's net asset value each day. Therefore, they reduce the         
investment return of the Portfolio and the related Fund. Actual fees and        
expenses are likely to fluctuate from year to year. More detail concerning each 
Portfolio's fees and expenses is contained in the Trust prospectus for the      
Portfolio.

(1)   We charge a one time non-refundable enrollment fee of $25 for each        
participant in a SEP or SIMPLE IRA. Unless otherwise paid by your   
employer, we collect this fee from your initial contribution.       

(2)   We generally, where applicable, impose a charge on withdrawals or         
     transfers before the maturity of a GRA guarantee period. The charge is 7%
of the amount withdrawn or transferred, or, if less, the accumulated
interest. No withdrawal or transfer charge applies to amounts in the
Funds.                                                              

(3)   These expenses vary by Fund and will fluctuate from year to year based on 
   actual expenses. See the table that provides the expenses for each Fund
later in this section.                                              

(4)   This charge is to reimburse us for certain administrative charges. For SEP
   and SIMPLE IRA, the charge is up to $15 per year. For regular IRA, Roth
IRA and TSA Certificates, the charge is up to $30 per year. See     
"Participant service charge" in "Charges and expenses" later in this
prospectus for more information.                                    

(5)   The AXA Moderate Allocation variable investment option invests in a       
corresponding portfolio of AXA Premier VIP Trust. The AXA Moderate  
    Allocation portfolio in turn invests in shares of other portfolios of EQ
  Advisors Trust and AXA Premier VIP Trust and/or shares of unaffiliated
   portfolios (the "underlying portfolios"). Amounts shown reflect the AXA
      Moderate Allocation portfolio's pro rata share of the fees and expenses of
the various underlying portfolios in which it invests.              

(6)   AXA Equitable currently reimburses these Funds on a discretionary basis   
for their aggregate expenses in excess of 1.5% of the value of their
  respective average daily net assets. See "Certain expense limitations"
later in this prospectus.                                           

(7)   AXA Equitable will reimburse these Funds for certain expenses to the      
    extent they exceed 1.5% in any calendar year of the Fund's average daily
   net assets. See "Certain expense limitations" later in this prospectus.

(8)   AXA Equitable will reimburse the EQ/Money Market Fund for certain expenses
     to the extent they exceed 1.0% in any calendar year of the Fund's average
daily net assets. See "Certain expense limitations" later in this   
prospectus.                                                         

(9)   The management fees and administrative fees for each portfolio cannot be  
 increased without a vote of each Portfolio's shareholders. The annual
     amount of management fees applicable to the EQ/Money Market Portfolio and
EQ/AllianceBernstein Intermediate Government Securities Portfolio is
      limited to 0.35% of the value of the Portfolios' average daily net assets.
    This resulted in 0.15% reimbursement by AXA Equitable of management fees
      for the EQ/AllianceBernstein Intermediate Government Securities Fund. This
    limitation is a Certificate right for participants who enrolled prior to
May 1, 1987 and cannot be changed without their prior consent. AXA  
Equitable has voluntarily agreed to impose this limitation for      
 participants who enrolled after May 1, 1997 and reserves the right to
      discontinue the limitation at any time. See "Charges and expenses--Certain
expense limitations" later in this prospectus.                      

(10)  Applicable Portfolio shares are subject to fees imposed under the         
    distribution plan (the "Rule 12b-1 Plan") adopted by the Trusts pursuant
      to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. A "--"
 indicates that there is no Rule 12b-1 Plan in place for the portfolio
shown.                                                              

(11)  Other expenses shown are those incurred in 2007. The amounts shown as     
 "Other Expenses" will fluctuate from year to year depending on actual
expenses. See footnote (12) for any expense limitation agreement    
      information and "Certain Expense Limitations" under "Charges and expenses"
later in this prospectus.                                           

(12)  Each of these variable investment options invests in a corresponding      
      portfolio of one of the Trusts or other unaffiliated investment companies.
 Each portfolio, in turn, invests in shares of other portfolios of the
      Trusts and/or shares of unaffiliated portfolios ("underlying portfolios").
 Amounts shown reflect each portfolio's pro rata share of the fees and
     expenses of the underlying portfolio(s) in which it invests. The fees and
     expenses are based on the respective weighted investment allocation as of
   12/31/07. A "--" indicates that the listed portfolio does not invest in
underlying portfolios.                                              

(13)  The amounts shown reflect any fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements   
   that apply to each Portfolio. A "--" indicates that there is no expense
   limitation in effect, and "0.00%" indicates that the expense limitation
arrangement did not result in a fee waiver or reimbursement. AXA    
   Equitable, the manager of the AXA Premier VIP Trust and the EQ Advisors
 Trust, has entered into expense limitation agreements with respect to
      certain portfolios, which are effective through April 30, 2009 (unless the
Board of Trustees of AXA Premier VIP Trust or EQ Advisors Trust, as 
applicable, consents to an earlier revision or termination of this  
      arrangement). Under these Agreements, AXA Equitable has agreed to waive or
limit its fees and assume other expenses of certain portfolios, if  
      necessary, in an amount that limits such Portfolio's Total Annual Expenses
(exclusive of interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, capitalized   
      expenditures, expenses of the underlying portfolios in which the Portfolio
      invests and extraordinary expenses) to not more than the amounts specified
      in the agreements. Each portfolio may at a later date make a reimbursement
 to AXA Equitable for any of the management fees waived or limited and
    other expenses assumed and paid by AXA Equitable pursuant to the expense
limitation agreements provided that the portfolio's current annual  
   operating expenses do not exceed the operating expense limit determined
 for such portfolio. See the prospectus for each applicable underlying
     Trust for more information about the arrangements. In addition, a portion
 of the brokerage commissions of certain portfolios of AXA Premier VIP
    Trust and EQ Advisors Trust is used to reduce the applicable portfolio's
expenses. If the above table reflected both the expense limitation  
      arrangements, plus the portion of the brokerage commissions used to reduce
      portfolio expenses, the net expenses would be as shown in the table below:

EXAMPLES                                                                        

These examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the    
contract with the cost of investing in other variable annuity contracts. These  
costs include contract owner transaction expenses, contract fees, separate      
account annual expenses, and underlying trust fees and expenses.                

The examples below show the expenses that a hypothetical contract owner would   
pay in the situations illustrated and assumes the maximum charges applicable    
under the contract and that no amounts are allocated to the GRAs. Since there   
are no surrender charges in connection with amounts invested in the Funds, the  
expenses are the same whether or not the participant withdraws amounts held in  
any of the Funds.                                                               

The guaranteed rate accounts are not covered by the examples. However, the      
ongoing expenses do apply to the guaranteed rate accounts. These examples should
not be considered a representation of past or future expenses for each option.  
Actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown. Similarly, the annual  
rate of return assumed in the examples is not an estimate or guarantee of future
investment performance.                                                         

The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the contract for the time periods
indicated and that your investment has a 5% return each year. The example also  
assumes maximum contract charges and total annual expenses of the portfolios    
(before expense limitations) set forth in the previous charts. Although your    
actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs     
would be:

See "Tax information" later in this prospectus and in the SAI for a more        
detailed discussion of certain contribution and other limitations.              

OWNER AND ANNUITANT REQUIREMENTS                                                

The annuitant and the owner must be the same person.                            

HOW DO I MAKE MY CONTRIBUTIONS?                                                 

Contributions must be in the form of a check drawn on a bank in the U.S.,       
clearing through the Federal Reserve System, in U.S. dollars and made payable to
AXA Equitable. We do not accept third party checks endorsed to us except for    
rollover contributions, tax-free exchanges or trustee checks that involve no    
refund. All checks are subject to collection. We reserve the right to reject a  
payment if it is received in an unacceptable form.                              

We do not monitor whether contributions exceed limitations in the Internal      
Revenue Code. However, we reserve the right to refuse contributions that we     
believe to exceed those limitations.                                            

You make contributions under a Regular IRA or Roth IRA Certificate by sending   
your payment directly to us. For TSA, SEP or SIMPLE IRA Certificates, your      
employer sends contributions to us on your behalf. Payroll deduction amounts    
will be automatically transferred to us for allocation to the investment options
as you direct.                                                                  

We invest your contributions on the date we receive them, provided they are     
accompanied by a properly completed instruction form. If the date of receipt is 
not a business day, or after the close of a business day, we invest your        
contributions on the next business day.                                         

Initial contributions must be accompanied by an application and any other form  
we require to process the payments. We may retain your initial contribution for 
five business days while we attempt to obtain any information that is missing or
unclear. If we cannot obtain the information we require within the five business
days, our Processing Office will inform you or your employer of the             
circumstances and return the contribution unless you or your employer           
specifically consent to our retaining your contribution until we receive the    
required information.                                                           

Generally our "business day" is any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for 
trading and generally ends at 4 p.m. Eastern Time. A business day does not      
include a day we choose not to open due to emergency conditions. We may also    
close early due to emergency conditions.                                        

DISCONTINUANCE AND RESUMPTION OF CONTRIBUTIONS                                  

If contributions are discontinued your participation under a Certificate will   
remain in effect and contributions may be resumed at any time. However, under   
SEP and SIMPLE Certificates, contributions may not be resumed.                  

We also reserve the right to close a participant's account and pay any account  
balance if contributions are discontinued for at least three years from the date
of the last contribution, and either (1) the account balance does not exceed    
$2,000 or (2) the annuity which the existing account balance would purchase at  
the participant's retirement date would be less than $20 per month based on the 
current annuity rates in effect under the Certificate.                          

WHAT ARE MY INVESTMENT OPTIONS WITHIN THE CERTIFICATE?                          

We allocate your contributions among the investment options available under the 
Certificates according to your instructions. Your investment options are the    
Funds and the GRAs.                                                             

VARIABLE INVESTMENT FUNDS                                                       

Your investment results in any one of the Funds will depend on the investment   
performance of the underlying Portfolios. You can lose your principal when      
investing in the Funds. In periods of poor market performance, the net return,  
after charges and expenses, may result in negative yields, including for the    
EQ/Money Market Fund. Listed below are the currently available Portfolios, their
investment objectives, and their advisers. You can choose among Funds that      
invest in corresponding Portfolios.

PORTFOLIOS OF THE TRUSTS                                                        

The AXA Allocation Portfolio(s) offer participants a convenient opportunity to  
invest in other portfolios that are managed and have been selected for inclusion
in the AXA Allocation Portfolio(s) by AXA Equitable. AXA Equitable may promote  
the benefits of such portfolios to participants and/or suggest, incidental to   
the sale of this contract, that participants consider whether allocating some or
all of their account value to such portfolios is consistent with their desired  
investment objectives. In addition, due to the relative diversification of the  
underlying portfolios covering various asset classes and categories, the AXA    
Allocation Portfolio(s) may enable AXA Equitable to more efficiently manage AXA 
Equitable's financial risks associated with certain guaranteed features. Please 
see "Allocating your contributions" in "Certificate features" for more          
information about your role in managing your allocations.                       

AXA Equitable serves as the investment manager of the Portfolios of AXA Premier 
VIP Trust and EQ Advisors Trust. For some Portfolios, AXA Equitable has entered 
into sub-advisory agreements with investment advisers (the "sub-advisers") to   
carry out the day-to-day investment decisions for the Portfolios. As such, AXA  
Equitable oversees the activities of the sub-advisers with respect to the Trusts
and is responsible for retaining or discontinuing the services of those         
sub-advisers. The chart below indicates the sub-adviser(s) for each portfolio.

You should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses  
of the Portfolios carefully before investing. The prospectus for the Trusts     
contain this and other important information about the Portfolios. The          
prospectus should be read carefully before investing.                           

GUARANTEED RATE ACCOUNTS 

You can allocate contributions to the GRAs that provide principal and interest  
guarantees. These amounts become part of our general account assets. We discuss 
our general account under "More information" later in this prospectus.          

Currently, we offer GRAs with guarantee periods of one and three years. We may  
offer additional or different guarantee periods in the future.                  

New one-year and three-year guarantee periods are offered each calendar quarter.
We announce a fixed interest rate for each guarantee period at least 10 days    
before the beginning of the quarter. Interest rates are set according to our    
procedures at the time. Thus, different interest rates may apply to different   
amounts in the GRAs. All interest rates are effective interest rates, reflecting
daily compounding and the deduction of the participant service charge. The      
guaranteed annual rate of interest will never be less than 3%.                  

At the end of a guarantee period (the maturity date), unless you instruct us    
otherwise, we will automatically contribute the accumulated amount to a new     
guarantee period of similar duration. If we are offering no guarantee period of 
a similar duration, we will transfer the amount to the maturity period of the   
shortest duration we then offer.                                                

You may allocate amounts in maturing guarantee periods to one or more other     
investment options by using the AIM System (see below). We must receive         
instructions before the maturity date. We will apply those instructions to all  
maturing guarantee periods until we receive other instructions.                 

The amount of your contributions to the GRAs is guaranteed by us (before        
deduction of any participant service charge). However, withdrawals and transfers
out of a guarantee period before a maturity date, may be subject to a withdrawal
charge. See "Charges and expenses" later in this prospectus. For further        
information regarding the GRAs, please see "The Guaranteed Rate Accounts" in the
SAI.                                                                            

ALLOCATING YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS 

You may allocate your contributions to one or more, or all of the Funds or GRAs.
Allocations must be in whole percentages, which you may change at any time in   
writing or by telephone using our voice response system. (See "Our Account      
Investment Management System ("AIMS") below.) Changes are effective on the date 
we receive all necessary information. Allocation changes have no effect on      
amounts already invested.                                                       

The group annuity contract that covers the plan in which you participate is not 
an investment advisory account, and AXA Equitable is not providing any          
investment advice or managing the allocations under this contract. In the       
absence of a specific written arrangement to the contrary, you, as the          
participant under this contract, have the sole authority to make investment     
allocations and other decisions under the contract. Your Account Executive is   
acting as a broker-dealer registered representative, and may not be authorized  
to act as an investment advisor or to manage the allocations under your         
contract.                                                                       

OUR ACCOUNT INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ("AIMS")                               

Participants may use AIMS to transfer between investment options, obtain account
information, change the allocation of future contributions and maturing GRAs and
hear investment performance information. To use AIMS, you must have a touch-tone
telephone. We assign a personal security code ("PSC") number to you after we    
receive your completed enrollment form.                                         

We have established procedures to reasonably confirm the genuineness of         
instructions communicated to us by telephone when using AIMS. The procedures    
require personal identification information, including your PSC number, prior to
acting on telephone instructions, and providing written confirmation of the     
transfers. Thus, we will not be liable for following telephone instructions we  
reasonably believe to be genuine.                                               

A transfer request will be effective on the business day we receive the request 
if we receive it before the close of the business day. Otherwise the transfer   
request will be effective on the next business day. We will confirm all         
transfers in writing. We reserve the right to limit access to this service if we
determine that you are engaged in a disruptive transfer activity such as "market
timing." (See "Disruptive transfer activity" in "Transferring your money among  
investment options" later in this prospectus.)                                  

YOUR RIGHT TO CANCEL WITHIN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS 

If for any reason you are not satisfied with your Certificate, you may return it
to us for a refund. To exercise this cancellation right, you must mail the      
Certificate directly to our Processing Office within 10 days after you receive  
it. In some states, this "free look" period may be longer.                      

Your refund will equal your contributions under the Certificate or, if greater, 
with respect to contributions allocated to the Funds, your account value,       
computed on the date we receive your Certificate.                               

We follow these same procedures if you change your mind before you receive your 
Certificate, but after you make a contribution. Please see "Tax information"    
later in this prospectus and in the SAI for possible consequences of canceling  
your Certificate.                                                               

If you fully convert an existing Regular IRA Certificate to a Roth IRA          
Certificate, you may cancel your Roth IRA Certificate and return to a Regular   
IRA Certificate by following the instructions in the request for full conversion
form available from our Processing Office.

2. Determining your Certificate's value                                         

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We credit the full amount of your contributions under your Certificate. At any  
time, the value of your Certificate is the "account balance" in the Funds and   
the GRAs to which you have allocated contributions. These amounts are subject to
certain fees and charges that are reflected in your account balance, as         
applicable. See "Charges and expenses" later in this prospectus.                

We refer to the amount of the account balance attributable to the GRAs as their 
"cash value." The cash value of a GRA guarantee period reflects a withdrawal    
charge where applicable, as described below.                                    

YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE IN THE FUNDS                                               

Your contributions to one or more of the Funds are, in turn, invested in shares 
of a corresponding Portfolio. The value of your interest in each Fund is        
measured by "units" that are purchased with your contributions. Your units will 
increase or decrease in value as though you had invested in the corresponding   
Portfolio's shares directly. Your account balance, however, will decrease by the
amount of the fees and charges that we deduct under the Certificate. Your       
account balance will also decrease by the dollar amount of any withdrawals that 
you make.                                                                       

We determine the number of units of a Fund you purchase by dividing the amount  
of your contribution by the Fund's unit value for the business day on which we  
receive your contribution. On any day, the value of your interest in a Fund     
equals the number of units credited to your Certificate under that Fund,        
multiplied by the value for one unit. The number of your units in any Fund does 
not change unless you make additional contributions, make a withdrawal, or      
transfer amounts between investment options.                                    

YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE IN THE GRAS                                                

Your account balance in the GRAs, represented by their cash value, is equal to  
your contributions and transfers to those options, plus accrued interest, less  
withdrawals and transfers out of the GRAs and charge deductions. The cash value 
of your GRAs will be less any withdrawal charge that applies on withdrawals,    
including transfers, from any of your GRA guarantee periods prior to maturity.  
Thus, if you withdrew an amount from a GRA period, before the maturity date, we 
would pay you the cash value. Please see "The Guaranteed Rate Accounts" in the  
SAI for more information.

3. Transferring your money among investment options                             

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At any time before the date annuity benefit payments begin, you can transfer    
some or all of your account balance among the investment options. Withdrawals or
transfers from the GRAs before a maturity date are restricted and may be subject
to a withdrawal charge. See "Charges and expenses" later in this prospectus. In 
addition, we reserve the right to restrict transfers among the Funds, including 
limitations on the number, frequency, or dollar amount of transfers. Our current
transfer restrictions are set forth in the "Disruptive transfer activity"       
section below.                                                                  

You may request a transfer by telephone using AIMS. Transfer requests should    
specify:                                                                        

o your Social Security number,                                                  

o the amounts or percentages to be transferred, and                             

o the investment options to and from which the amounts are to be transferred.   

We will make transfers involving the Funds as of the business day we receive    
your transfer request and all necessary information if we receive your request  
before the close of the business day. Otherwise, we will make transfers         
involving the Funds on the next business day.                                   

Transfers are permitted to and from the guarantee periods of the GRAs, but      
transfers may not be made from one guarantee period to another, nor during the  
"open period" in calendar quarters when new guarantee periods are offered for   
GRAs. In the case of trustee-to-trustee transfers during the open period, we    
will impose a withdrawal charge if applicable. Transfers from a GRA guarantee   
period, like withdrawals, may be subject to a withdrawal charge.                

Please see "Allocating your contributions" in "Certificate features" for more   
information about your role in managing your allocations.                       

DISRUPTIVE TRANSFER ACTIVITY 

You should note that the contract is not designed for professional "market      
timing" organizations, or other organizations or individuals engaging in a      
market timing strategy. The contract is not designed to accommodate programmed  
transfers, frequent transfers or transfers that are large in relation to the    
total assets of the underlying portfolio.                                       

Frequent transfers, including market timing and other program trading or        
short-term trading strategies, may be disruptive to the underlying portfolios in
which the variable investment options invest. Disruptive transfer activity may  
adversely affect performance and the interests of long-term investors by        
requiring a portfolio to maintain larger amounts of cash or to liquidate        
portfolio holdings at a disadvantageous time or price. For example, when market 
timing occurs, a portfolio may have to sell its holdings to have the cash       
necessary to redeem the market timer's investment. This can happen when it is   
not advantageous to sell any securities, so the portfolio's performance may be  
hurt. When large dollar amounts are involved, market timing can also make it    
difficult to use long-term investment strategies because a portfolio cannot     
predict how much cash it will have to invest. In addition, disruptive transfers 
or purchases and redemptions of portfolio investments may impede efficient      
portfolio management and impose increased transaction costs, such as brokerage  
costs, by requiring the portfolio manager to effect more frequent purchases and 
sales of portfolio securities. Similarly, a portfolio may bear increased        
administrative costs as a result of the asset level and investment volatility   
that accompanies patterns of excessive or short-term trading. Portfolios that   
invest a significant portion of their assets in foreign securities or the       
securities of small- and mid-capitalization companies tend to be subject to the 
risks associated with market timing and short-term trading strategies to a      
greater extent than portfolios that do not. Securities trading in overseas      
markets present time zone arbitrage opportunities when events affecting         
portfolio securities values occur after the close of the overseas market but    
prior to the close of the U.S. markets. Securities of small- and                
mid-capitalization companies present arbitrage opportunities because the market 
for such securities may be less liquid than the market for securities of larger 
companies, which could result in pricing inefficiencies. Please see the         
prospectuses for the underlying portfolios for more information on how portfolio
shares are priced.                                                              

We currently use the procedures described below to discourage disruptive        
transfer activity. You should understand, however, that these procedures are    
subject to the following limitations: (1) they primarily rely on the policies   
and procedures implemented by the underlying portfolios; (2) they do not        
eliminate the possibility that disruptive transfer activity, including market   
timing, will occur or that portfolio performance will be affected by such       
activity; and (3) the design of market timing procedures involves inherently    
subjective judgments, which we seek to make in a fair and reasonable manner     
consistent with the interests of all policy and contract owners.                

We offer investment options with underlying portfolios that are part of AXA     
Premier VIP Trust and EQ Advisors Trust (together, the "trusts"). The trusts    
have adopted policies and procedures regarding disruptive transfer activity.    
They discourage frequent purchases and redemptions of portfolio shares and will 
not make special arrangements to accommodate such transactions. They aggregate  
inflows and outflows for each portfolio on a daily basis. On any day when a     
portfolio's net inflows or outflows exceed an established monitoring threshold, 
the trust obtains from us owner trading activity. The trusts currently consider 
transfers into and out of (or vice versa) the same variable investment option   
within a five business day period as potentially disruptive transfer activity.  
Each trust reserves the right to reject a transfer that it believes, in its sole
discretion, is disruptive (or potentially disruptive) to the management of one  
of its portfolios. Please see the prospectuses for the trusts for more          
information.                                                                    

When a contract owner is identified as having engaged in a potentially          
disruptive transfer under the contract for the first time, a letter is sent to  
the contract owner explaining that there is a policy against disruptive transfer
activity and that if such activity continues certain transfer

privileges may be eliminated. If and when the contract owner is identified a    
second time as engaged in potentially disruptive transfer activity under the    
contract, we currently prohibit the use of voice, fax and automated transaction 
services. We currently apply such action for the remaining life of each affected
contract. We or a trust may change the definition of potentially disruptive     
transfer activity, the monitoring procedures and thresholds, any notification   
procedures, and the procedures to restrict this activity. Any new or revised    
policies and procedures will apply to all contract owners uniformly. We do not  
permit exceptions to our policies restricting disruptive transfer activity.     

It is possible that the trusts may impose a redemption fee designed to          
discourage frequent or disruptive trading by contract owners. As of the date of 
this prospectus, the trusts had not implemented such a fee. If a redemption fee 
is implemented by a trust, that fee, like any other trust fee, will be borne by 
the contract owner.                                                             

Contract owners should note that it is not always possible for us and the       
underlying trusts to identify and prevent disruptive transfer activity. Our     
ability to monitor potentially disruptive transfer activity is limited in       
particular with respect to certain group contracts. Group annuity contracts may 
be owned by retirement plans that provide transfer instructions on an omnibus   
(aggregate) basis, which may mask the disruptive transfer activity of individual
plan participants, and/or interfere with our ability to restrict communication  
services. In addition, because we do not monitor for all frequent trading at the
separate account level, contract owners may engage in frequent trading which may
not be detected, for example, due to low net inflows or outflows on the         
particular day(s). Therefore, no assurance can be given that we or the trusts   
will successfully impose restrictions on all potentially disruptive transfers.  
Because there is no guarantee that disruptive trading will be stopped, some     
contract owners may be treated differently than others, resulting in the risk   
that some contract owners may be able to engage in frequent transfer activity   
while others will bear the effect of that frequent transfer activity. The       
potential effects of frequent transfer activity are discussed above.

4. Accessing your money                                                         

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WITHDRAWING YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE                                                

You can withdraw your account balance at any time before annuity benefits begin.
Withdrawals from the GRAs will be withdrawals of cash value, giving effect to   
any withdrawal charge. No withdrawal charge applies to withdrawals from any of  
the Funds.                                                                      

Partial withdrawals under a periodic distribution option are subject to certain 
restrictions that we describe below under "Choosing your retirement payout
options." Distributions under TSA Certificates may also be subject to certain   
restrictions. For the tax consequences and restrictions relating to withdrawals,
see "Tax information" later in this prospectus and in the SAI.                  

We will consider withdrawal requests that result in a total remaining account   
balance of less than $100 as a request to surrender your Certificate, unless you
tell us otherwise.                                                              

Your request for a withdrawal should be in writing on our specified form. For a 
partial withdrawal, you must specify the investment options from which you want 
to take the withdrawal. Otherwise, we will withdraw from each investment option 
on a pro rata basis. If you request a full surrender, you must also send us your
Certificate with the request. When we receive the information we require, the   
withdrawal or full surrender will become effective. If we receive only partial  
information, our Processing Office will contact you for complete instructions   
before processing your request.                                                 

SURRENDERING YOUR CERTIFICATE TO RECEIVE YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE                   

You may surrender your Certificate to receive your account balance at any time  
before you begin to receive annuity payments. For a surrender to be effective,  
we must receive your written request on our prescribed form at our Processing   
Office. We will determine your account balance on the date we receive the       
required information. All benefits under the Certificate will terminate as of   
that date.                                                                      

You may receive your account balance in a single sum payment or apply all or    
part of it to one or both of the annuity payout options described under         
"Choosing your retirement payout options" below. For the tax consequences of    
surrenders, see "Tax information" later in this prospectus and in the SAI.      

WHEN TO EXPECT PAYMENTS                                                         

Generally, we will fulfill requests for payments upon a withdrawal or surrender 
within seven calendar days after the date we receive all necessary information  
and documents we require in the circumstances. We may postpone such payments or 
application of proceeds for any period during which:                            

(1)  the New York Stock Exchange is closed or restricts trading,                

(2)  sales of securities or determination of the fair value of a Fund's assets  
is not reasonably practicable because of an emergency, or             

(3)  the SEC, by order, permits us to defer payment to protect persons remaining
in the Funds.                                                         

CHOOSING YOUR RETIREMENT PAYOUT OPTIONS 

When you are ready to receive retirement benefits you have a choice of several  
options:                                                                        

o Single sum benefit payment.                                                   

o Periodic distribution option.                                                 

o Fixed full cash refund annuity.                                               

o Other forms of annuities we may offer.                                        

If you choose a single sum benefit payment, your account value in the Funds and 
cash value in the GRAs will be applied to provide the benefit. The cash value   
may reflect a withdrawal charge.                                                

The same amounts will be applied to provide a periodic distribution option of at
least three years or the fixed full cash refund annuity under the Certificate,  
or any other optional fixed annuity we may offer. However, if you elect a       
periodic distribution or annuity, no withdrawal charge will be imposed on       
amounts derived from the GRAs.                                                  

ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTIONS                                                          

Depending upon the terms of your Certificate, you can choose from among the     
following annuity payout options:                                               

FULL CASH REFUND ANNUITY. This is the "normal form of annuity benefit." However,
in certain states* the normal form of annuity benefit is a 10 year period       
certain. For further information see below. It provides a fixed annuity for the 
lifetime of the annuitant. The participant's beneficiary will receive a cash    
refund if, at the participant's death, the total annuity payments do not equal  
the amount that we applied to provide the annuity. This refund equals the       
difference between the amount applied to purchase the annuity and the annuity   
payments actually received.                                                     

Once fixed payments begin, the amount of each payment does not change. We       
determine the minimum amount from tables in the Certificate that show monthly   
payments for each $1,000 applied (after deduction of any applicable tax charges 
and the annuitization fee). If our group annuity rates for payment of proceeds  
or our rate for single premium immediate annuities then in effect produces a    
larger payment, we pay the larger benefit. We may change the amount of monthly  
payments shown in Certificates for new participants.                            

TEN-YEAR PERIOD CERTAIN ANNUITY. An annuity that guarantees payments for 10     
years. The guarantee period may not exceed the annuitant's life expectancy. This
option does not guarantee payments for the rest of the annuitant's life. It does
not permit any repayment of the unpaid principal, so you cannot elect to receive
part of the payments as a single sum payment with the rest paid in monthly      
annuity payments. Currently, this payout option is available only as a fixed    
annuity.

P-->485BPOS20th "Page" of 141TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 20th
PERIODIC DISTRIBUTION OPTION. An annuity option that pays out your entire       
account balance in monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual installment        
payments over a period of at least three years, as you or your beneficiary      
choose. The payout period may not generally exceed applicable life expectancy   
limitations, as described in "Tax information" in the SAI.                      

To calculate the amount of each payment, you specify a dollar amount or a time  
period. If a time period, we determine the amount of a payment by dividing the  
remaining account balances by the number of remaining payments. We make         
withdrawals pro rata from each investment option. Currently, we distribute      
periodic payments from the GRAs without withdrawal charges. We retain the right 
to suspend these distributions from the GRAs in the future.                     

We require an initial monthly payment of at least $50 under the periodic        
distribution option. After payments begin, you may continue to transfer amounts 
among the investment options, according to our rules. By written notice, you may
make a partial withdrawal or elect to stop the periodic distribution payments   
and receive your remaining account balance in a single sum.                     

OTHER ANNUITIES OR OPTIONAL RETIREMENT BENEFITS. You may elect forms of fixed   
annuities, other than the normal form of annuity benefit, we offer, including   
joint and survivor annuities. Payments under life or joint life annuities that  
do not specify a minimum distribution period terminate with the death of the    
last surviving annuitant.                                                       

You may specify a minimum distribution period under which benefits continue to a
beneficiary. You may not specify a minimum distribution period that is greater  
than your life expectancy or the life expectancy of the beneficiary. If the     
beneficiary is someone other than your spouse, payments to the surviving        
beneficiary are limited as the Final Treasury Regulations provide.              

Once a life annuity takes effect, the annuitant may not redeem or change it to  
any other form of benefit. If payment under an annuity continues to a           
beneficiary, the beneficiary will have the right to redeem the annuity for its  
commuted value. An annuity payout is available only if the amount applied to pay
the annuity is $2,000 or more and results in an initial payment of at least $20.

If you are participating under a TSA program and have not chosen a retirement   
benefit the normal form of annuity will be provided unless the TSA provides     
otherwise. Under certain TSAs you may be required to elect a joint and survivor 
annuity payout unless your spouse consents in writing to a different election.  

You can choose the date annuity payments are to begin. This is your "retirement 
date." If you do not advise us of your retirement date, we will assume that it  
is the date you attain age 70-1/2. You can change your retirement date in       
writing, but the date must be the first day of a calendar month. Also, that date
may not be later than the date applicable for the type of qualified plan in     
which you use the Certificate.                                                  

If you have not already selected a form of annuity payout, we will send you a   
form on which you may do so or confirm that the normal form of annuity is to be 
provided. We will send the form six months before your retirement date. Your    
account balance will remain invested until we receive your instructions. Once   
you have selected a payout option and payments have begun, you may make no      
further change.                                                                 

The amount of the annuity payments will depend on:                              

o   the amount applied to purchase the annuity,                                 

o   the type of payout option you choose, and,                                  

o   in the case of a life annuity, your age (or your and your joint annuitant's 
ages) and in certain instances, gender.

5. Charges and expenses                                                         

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHARGES THAT AXA EQUITABLE DEDUCTS                                              

We deduct the charges described below during the accumulation period, or if you 
elect either the fixed annuity option or the periodic distribution option. We   
will not increase these charges for the life of your Certificate, except as     
noted.                                                                          

PARTICIPANT SERVICE CHARGE 

On the last day of each calendar quarter, we charge your account balance to     
reimburse us for certain administration expenses under the Certificates, such as
salaries and other overhead costs, travel, legal, actuarial and accounting      
costs. The charge is up to $15 per year for SEP and SIMPLE IRA Certificates, and
up to $30 per year for Regular IRA, Roth IRA, and TSA Certificates. We deduct   
these charges from the amounts held in the Funds in accordance with our         
administrative procedures then in effect.                                       

The participant service charge applicable to a Certificate depends on several   
factors. It will vary depending on:                                             

o   whether contributions are made by payroll deduction or direct contribution, 
and                                                                     

o   the number of participants contributing through the same payroll deduction  
facility or group, and the total contributions that we receive from an  
  affiliated group, and the nature of the group purchasing the Certificates,
and the extent to which an employer provides services that we would     
otherwise provide, and other circumstances that may have an impact on   
administrative expenses.                                                

We reserve the right to change the participant service charge on advance written
notice, or to impose the charge on a less or more frequent basis. In no case,   
will the charge exceed $30 per year.                                            

ADMINISTRATION CHARGE                                                           

We impose a daily charge at the annual rate of 0.25% of the net assets of each  
Fund. The charge is to reimburse us for administration expenses not covered by  
the participant service charge. We reflect this charge in the computation of    
unit values for each Fund.                                                      

PROGRAM-RELATED OTHER EXPENSES                                                  

We also charge certain additional costs and expenses directly to the Funds.     
These include, among other things, certain expenses we incur in the operation of
the Funds, taxes, interest, SEC charges, and certain related expenses including 
printing of registration statements and amendments, outside auditing and legal  
expenses and recordkeeping.                                                     

We reflect these expenses in the unit values for each Fund.                     

ANNUITY ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE                                                   

If you elect the fixed annuity option under the Certificate, at retirement we   
will deduct up to $350 from the amount applied to purchase the annuity. This    
amount is designed to reimburse us for administrative expenses we incur in      
processing the application for the annuity and issuing each monthly payment. The
specific amount of the charge will depend on your date of enrollment. We may    
give you a better annuity purchase rate than those currently guaranteed in the  
Certificates. In that case, the annuity administrative charge may be greater    
than $350, unless we otherwise provide in your Certificate.                     

SEP AND SIMPLE ENROLLMENT FEE                                                   

We charge a non-refundable fee of $25 upon the enrollment of each Participant in
a SEP or SIMPLE IRA. We collect the fee from the employer, or we deduct it from 
the first contribution.                                                         

GUARANTEED RATE ACCOUNTS WITHDRAWAL CHARGE                                      

We impose a charge (where applicable) on withdrawals or transfers before the    
maturity of a GRA guarantee period. The charge is 7% of the amount withdrawn or 
transferred during the guarantee period, or, if less, the accumulated interest. 
The charge, however, does not apply:                                            

o   at maturity of the GRA guarantee period,                                    

o   to withdrawals due to death or disability,                                  

o   when the periodic distribution installment option is elected, or            

o   when an annuity retirement option is elected.                               

However, the withdrawal charge applies to any other pre-maturity withdrawals at 
retirement.                                                                     

CHARGES FOR STATE PREMIUM AND OTHER APPLICABLE TAXES                            

We deduct a charge designed to approximate certain taxes that may be imposed on 
us such as state premium taxes in your state. Generally, we deduct the charge   
from the amount applied to provide the annuity payout option. If the periodic   
distribution is elected we will deduct the charge from each payment when made.  
No charge is applied if you elect a single sum payment. The current tax charge  
varies by state and ranges from 0% to 1%.                                       

CHARGES THE TRUSTS DEDUCT                                                       

The Trusts deduct the following types of fees and expenses:                     

o   Investment management fees ranging from 0.10% to 1.20%.                     

o   12b-1 fees of 0.25% applicable to Class IB/B shares (see "More information" 
later in this prospectus).                                              

o   Operating expenses, such as trustees' fees, independent auditors' fees,     
legal counsel fees, administrative service fees, custodian fees, and    
liability insurance.                                                    

o   Investment-related expenses, such as brokerage commissions.                 

These expenses are reflected in the daily share price of each Portfolio. For    
more information about the calculation of these expenses, including applicable  
expense limitations, please refer to the prospectus of the Trust.               

CERTAIN EXPENSE LIMITATIONS 

We will reimburse the Funds named below for certain expenses they incur in any  
calendar year, as follows:

6. Payment of death and disability benefit                                      

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YOUR BENEFICIARY AND PAYMENT OF DEATH BENEFIT                                   

You designate your beneficiary when you apply for your Certificate. You may     
change your designation by writing to our Processing Office. You may be limited 
as to the beneficiary you can designate in the TSA Certificate.                 

The death benefit is equal to your cash value. We determine the amount of the   
death benefit as of the date we receive satisfactory proof of death, any        
required instructions as to the method of payment and any other information we  
may require.                                                                    

WHEN THE PARTICIPANT DIES BEFORE DISTRIBUTIONS BEGIN                            

If you die before distributions begin, we will pay the death benefit to your    
beneficiary.                                                                    

If the designated beneficiary is your surviving spouse, the distribution of the 
account balance may begin at the earlier of (a) the date you would have attained
age 70-1/2 or (b) the date the surviving spouse elects payment to commence.     
Depending on your election, we will pay the death benefit as a single sum, in   
periodic installments, as an annuity or as a combination of the three. If no    
death benefit election is in effect, the beneficiary may elect a single sum or  
an alternate form of benefit payment.                                           

BENEFICIARY CONTINUATION OPTION                                                 

This feature permits a designated individual, on the Certificate owner's death, 
to maintain a Certificate with the deceased Certificate owner's name on it and  
receive distributions under the Certificate, instead of receiving the death     
benefit in a single sum. We make this option available to beneficiaries under   
Regular IRA, Roth IRA and SIMPLE IRA Certificates, subject to state             
availability. It is not available for TSA Certificates. Please contact our      
Processing Office for further information.                                      

This feature must be elected by September 30th of the year following the        
calendar year of your death and before any other inconsistent election is made. 
Beneficiaries who do not make a timely election will not be eligible for this   
option. If the election is made, then, as of the date we receive satisfactory   
proof of death, any required instructions, information and forms necessary to   
effect the beneficiary continuation option feature, we will process the request.

Generally, payments will be made once a year to the beneficiary over the        
beneficiary's life expectancy (determined in the calendar year after your death 
and determined on a term certain basis). These payments must begin no later than
December 31st of the calendar year after the year of your death. For sole       
spousal beneficiaries, payments may begin by December 31st of the calendar year 
in which you would have reached age 70-1/2, if such time is later. For Regular  
IRA Certificates only, if you die before your Required Beginning Date for       
required minimum distributions as discussed in "Tax information" later in this  
prospectus, the beneficiary may choose the "5-year rule" instead of annual      
payments over life expectancy. The 5-year rule is always available to           
beneficiaries under Roth IRA Certificates. If the beneficiary chooses this      
option, the beneficiary may take withdrawals as desired, but the entire account 
value must be fully withdrawn by December 31st of the calendar year which       
contains the fifth anniversary of your death.                                   

Under the beneficiary continuation option:                                      

o   The Certificate continues with your name on it for the benefit of your      
beneficiary.                                                            

o   This feature is only available if the beneficiary is an individual. Certain 
    trusts with only individual beneficiaries will be treated as individuals for
this purpose.                                                           

o   If there is more than one beneficiary, each beneficiary's share will be     
   separately accounted for. It will be distributed over the beneficiary's own
    life expectancy, if payments over life expectancy are chosen. Separate share
treatment is not available for trusts.                                  

o   The beneficiary may make transfers among the investment options but no      
additional contributions will be permitted.                             

o   The beneficiary may choose at any time to withdraw all or a portion of the  
account value and no withdrawal charges will apply.                     

o   Your beneficiary will have the right to name a beneficiary to receive any   
remaining interest in the Certificate.                                  

o   Upon the death of your beneficiary, the beneficiary he or she has named has 
    the option to either continue taking required minimum distributions based on
   the remaining life expectancy of the deceased beneficiary or to receive any
    remaining interest in the Certificate in a lump sum. The option elected will
be processed when we receive satisfactory proof of death, any required  
instructions for the method of payment and any required information and 
forms necessary to effect payment.                                      

WHEN THE PARTICIPANT DIES AFTER THE RETIREMENT DATE                             

If you die after distributions begin, the amount and payment mode of the        
distributions may continue to the beneficiary on the same basis as before your  
death, subject to minimum distribution rules.                                   

DISABILITY PAYMENT                                                              

In the case of disability (refer to your Certificate for a definition of        
disability) before your retirement date, we will pay you the cash value. TSA    
plans may be subject to certain restrictions.

7. Tax information                                                              

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TAX CHANGES                                                                     

Federal income tax rules include the United States laws in the Internal Revenue 
Code (the "Code") and Treasury Department Regulations and Internal Revenue      
Service ("IRS") interpretations of the Code. These tax rules may change. We     
cannot predict whether, when, or how these rules could change. Any change could 
affect Certificates purchased before the change. Congress may also consider     
proposals in the future to comprehensively reform or overhaul the United States 
tax and retirement systems, which if enacted, could affect the tax benefits of a
contract. We cannot predict what, if any, legislation will actually be proposed 
or enacted.                                                                     

We cannot provide detailed information on all tax aspects of the Certificates.  
Moreover, the tax aspects that apply to a particular person's Certificate may   
vary depending on the facts applicable to that person. We do not discuss state  
income and other state taxes, federal income tax and withholding rules for      
non-U.S. taxpayers, or federal gift and estate taxes. Transfers of the          
Certificate, rights or values under the Certificate or payments under the       
Certificate, for example, amounts due to beneficiaries, may be subject to       
federal or state gift, estate or inheritance taxes. You should not rely only on 
this document, but should consult your tax adviser before your purchase.        

BUYING A CONTRACT TO FUND A RETIREMENT ARRANGEMENT                              

Generally, there are two types of funding vehicles that are available for       
Individual Retirement Arrangements ("IRAs"): an individual retirement annuity   
contract such as the ones offered in this Prospectus, or a custodial or trusteed
individual retirement account. Similarly, a 403(b) plan can be funded through a 
403(b) annuity contract or a 403(b)(7) custodial account. Similarly an          
employer-sponsored individual retirement arrangement such as a SEP IRA, SARSEP  
IRA or SIMPLE IRA can be purchased in annuity or custodial account form. How    
these arrangements work, including special rules applicable to each, are        
described in the specific sections for each type of arrangement, below. You     
should be aware that the funding vehicle for a tax-qualified arrangement does   
not provide any tax deferral benefit beyond that already provided by the Code   
for all permissible funding vehicles. Before choosing an annuity contract,      
therefore, you should consider the annuity's features and benefits, such as     
selection of investment funds and choices of pay-out options, as well as the    
features and benefits of other permissible funding vehicles and the relative    
costs of annuities and other arrangements. You should be aware that cost may    
vary depending on the features and benefits made available and the charges and  
expenses of the investment options or funds that you elect.                     

Certain provisions of the Treasury Regulations on required minimum distributions
concerning the actuarial present value of additional contract benefits could    
increase the amount required to be distributed from individual retirement       
annuity contracts and annuity contracts funding 403(b) plans. Generally, these  
provisions will not apply to 300+ Series certificates because of the nature of  
the benefits provided under the certificate.                                    

Further discussion of tax aspects of TSA, Regular IRA, Roth IRA, SEP and SIMPLE 
IRA contributions, distributions and other matters is available in the SAI.     

TAX-SHELTERED ANNUITY ARRANGEMENTS ("TSAS")                                     

If you are an employee of a public educational institution or a tax-exempt      
organization described in Code Section 501(c)(3), your employer may purchase a  
403(b) contract (also referred to as a tax-sheltered annuity contract or "TSA") 
for you. Contributions to the TSA, whether they are made by your salary         
reduction or non-elective employer contributions, are typically not taxable to  
you at the time of deferral, subject to annual limitations. We do not accept    
designated Roth contributions to the 300+ Series contract. Subject to the terms 
of your employer's plan, you may be eligible to make contributions of funds     
rolled over from other eligible retirement plans, including 403(b) plans,       
Regular IRAs, qualified plans and governmental employer 457(b) plans. The types 
of contributions and limits are discussed in the SAI. Annuity payments,         
withdrawals from or surrenders of, the TSA are generally taxable to you.        
Premature withdrawals may be subject to an additional 10% penalty on the taxable
amount. In addition, amounts attributable to salary reduction contributions     
cannot be distributed before you reach age 59-1/2, die, become disabled as      
defined in the Code, sever from employment with the employer which provided the 
funds for the TSA or suffer hardship. In the event of hardship, only the salary 
reduction contributions can be distributed.                                     

Further discussion of TSA tax information including Regulations finalized in    
2007 is in the SAI.                                                             

INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES (REGULAR AND ROTH IRAS)                         

You may make compensation-based contributions, subject to annual limitations, to
individual retirement arrangements. For both Regular and Roth IRAs, you must    
have compensation at least equal to the amount of the contribution. Generally,  
$5,000 is the maximum amount of annual contributions you may make to all of your
Regular and Roth IRAs for the taxable year 2008. You may deduct all or a part of
your contribution to a Regular IRA depending on your income for the year. In    
some cases you may be eligible for a "Saver's Tax Credit."                      

If you are at least age 50 at any time during the calendar year for which the   
contribution is made, you may be eligible to make an additional "catch-up"      
contribution of up to $1,000 for that year.                                     

You may make contributions to a Regular IRA until the year you reach age 70-1/2.
You may make contributions to a Roth IRA even after age 70-1/2, if you have     
compensation and your income is within specified federal income tax limits.     
These limits do not apply to rollover or                                        

22  Tax information                                                             

P-->485BPOS25th "Page" of 141TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 25th
custodian-to-custodian contributions into either kind of IRA. For 2008, you and 
your nonworking spouse can together contribute, annually, an aggregate maximum  
of $10,000 to Regular and Roth IRAs for you and your spouse (but no more than   
$5,000 to any one IRA certificate).                                             

You may be able to contribute more if you are eligible to make catch-up         
contributions described above.                                                  

Income credited to Regular IRAs is generally not taxable until you get a        
distribution from the Certificate. Distributions from Regular IRAs are generally
fully taxable as ordinary income. Roth IRA distributions are not taxable until  
all contributions to all of your Roth IRAs are recovered. After recovery of     
contributions, distributions are taxable. In certain circumstances, Roth IRA    
distributions may be fully non-taxable. The taxable portion of certain early    
withdrawals from Regular and Roth IRAs may be subject to an additional 10%      
federal income tax penalty.                                                     

Further discussion of IRA tax information is in the SAI.                        

IRAS UNDER SIMPLIFIED EMPLOYEE PENSION PLANS (SEPS AND SIMPLES)                 

An employer can establish a SEP for its employees and can make contributions to 
a SEP for each eligible employee. A Regular IRA funding a SEP is like other     
IRAs. If you are an eligible employee, you own the SEP. Most of the rules       
applicable to Regular IRAs also apply. One major difference is the amount of    
permissible contributions. Under contribution limits effective for 2008, an     
employer can annually contribute an amount for an employee up to the lesser of  
$46,000 or 25% of the employee's compensation. The employer makes this          
determination without taking into account its contribution to the employee's    
SEP. This limit may be further adjusted for cost of living changes in future    
years.                                                                          

An eligible employer may establish a "SIMPLE" plan to contribute to special     
individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities for its       
employees (SIMPLE IRAs). A SIMPLE IRA is a form of IRA, which the employee owns.
Generally, the rules applicable to Regular IRAs discussed above apply, with     
certain differences, as follows:                                                

o   the employee salary reduction contribution is limited (up to $10,500 in     
    2008; this salary reduction limit may be further adjusted for cost of living
changes in future years;)                                               

o   if the plan permits, an individual at least age 50 at any time during 2008  
 can make up to $2,500 additional salary reduction contributions for 2008;

o   the employer must make contributions, generally a dollar-for-dollar match,  
    up to 3% of the employee's compensation or a 2% non-elective contribution to
all eligible employees; and                                             

o   employees who have not participated in the employer's SIMPLE IRA plan for at
least two full years may be subject to an increased penalty tax on      
withdrawals or transfers of SIMPLE IRA funds.

ABOUT AXA EQUITABLE                                                             

We are AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company ("AXA Equitable") (until 2004, The  
Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States), a New York stock life   
insurance corporation. We have been doing business since 1859. AXA Equitable is 
an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of AXA Financial, Inc., a holding company, 
which is itself an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of AXA SA ("AXA"). AXA is a
French holding company for an international group of insurance and related      
financial services companies. As the ultimate sole shareholder of AXA Equitable,
and under its other arrangements with AXA Equitable and AXA Equitable's parent, 
AXA exercises significant influence over the operations and capital structure of
AXA Equitable and its parent. AXA holds its interest in AXA Equitable through a 
number of other intermediate holding companies, including Oudinot               
Participations, AXA America Holdings, Inc. and AXA Equitable Financial Services,
LLC. AXA Equitable is obligated to pay all amounts that are promised to be paid 
under the contracts. No company other than AXA Equitable, however, has any legal
responsibility to pay amounts that AXA Equitable owes under the contracts.      

AXA Financial, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries managed approximately     
$888.6 billion in assets as of December 31, 2007. For more than 100 years AXA   
Equitable has been among the largest insurance companies in the United States.  
We are licensed to sell life insurance and annuities in all fifty states, the   
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our home office 
is located at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10104.                  

ABOUT SEPARATE ACCOUNT NO. 301                                                  

Each Fund is a subaccount of our Separate Account No. 301. We established       
Separate Account No. 301 in 1981 under special provisions of the New York       
Insurance Law. These provisions prevent creditors from any other business we    
conduct from reaching the assets we hold in our Separate Account No. 301 for    
owners of our variable annuity contracts, including the Certificates. The       
results of Separate Account No. 301's operations are accounted for without      
regard to our other operations. We are the legal owner of all of the assets in  
Separate Account No. 301 and may withdraw any amounts that exceed our reserves  
and other liabilities with respect to the Funds under our contracts. The amount 
of some of our obligations under the contracts is based on the assets in        
Separate Account No. 301. However, the obligations themselves are obligations   
of AXA Equitable.                                                               

Separate Account No. 301 is registered as a "unit investment trust" under the   
Investment Company Act of 1940. Although the Separate Account is registered,    
the SEC does not monitor the activity of Separate Account No. 301 on a daily    
basis. AXA Equitable is not required to register, and is not registered, as an  
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.                    

Each subaccount (Fund) within Separate Account No. 301 invests solely in Class  
IA/A or Class IB shares, respectively, issued by the corresponding Portfolio of 
the applicable Trust.                                                           

We reserve the right, subject to compliance with laws that apply, to:           

(1) add Funds to, or to remove Funds from, Separate Account No. 301, or to add  
other separate accounts;                                                

(2) combine any two or more Funds;                                              

(3) transfer the assets we determine to be the shares of the class of contracts 
to which the Certificates belong from any Fund to another Fund;         

(4) operate Separate Account No. 301 or any Fund as a management investment     
    company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (in which case, charges and
   expenses that otherwise would be assessed against an underlying mutual fund
would be assessed against Separate Account No. 301 or a Fund directly); 

(5) deregister Separate Account No. 301 under the Investment Company Act of     
1940;                                                                   

(6) restrict or eliminate any voting rights as to Separate Account No. 301;     

(7) cause one or more Funds to invest some or all of their assets in one or more
other trusts or investment companies; and                               

(8) to unilaterally change your contract in order to comply with any applicable 
  laws and regulations, including but not limited to changes in the Internal
Revenue Code, in Treasury regulations or in published rulings of the    
   Internal Revenue Service, ERISA and in Department of Labor regulations. Any
change in the contract must be in writing and made by our authorized    
officer. We will provide notice of any contract change.                 

ABOUT THE TRUSTS                                                                

AXA Premier VIP Trust and EQ Advisors Trust are registered under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940. They are classified as "open-end management investment     
companies," more commonly called mutual funds. Each Trust issues different      
shares relating to each Portfolio. AXA Equitable serves as the investment       
manager of the Trusts. As such, AXA Equitable oversees the activities of the    
investment advisers with respect to the Trusts and is responsible for retaining 
or discontinuing the services of those advisers.                                

The Trusts do not impose sales charges or "loads" for buying and selling their  
shares. All dividends and other distributions on Trust shares are reinvested in 
full. The Board of Trustees of each Trust may establish additional Portfolios or
eliminate existing Portfolios at any time. More detailed information about each 
Trust, its Portfolio investment objectives, policies, restrictions, risks,      
expenses, its Rule 12b-1 Plan relating to class 1B/B shares and other aspects of
its operations, appears in the prospectuses for each Trust, which accompany this
prospectus, or in their respective SAIs which are available upon request.

ABOUT THE GENERAL ACCOUNT                                                       

Our general account supports all of our policy and contract guarantees,         
including those that apply to the guaranteed rate options, and our general      
obligations.                                                                    

The general account is subject to regulation and supervision by the Insurance   
Department of the State of New York and to the insurance laws and regulations of
all jurisdictions where we are authorized to do business. Interests under the   
contracts in the general account have not been registered and are not required  
to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 because of exemptions and     
exclusionary provisions that apply. The general account is not required to      
register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and  
it is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act  
of 1940. The contract is a "covered security" under the federal securities laws.

We have been advised that the staff of the SEC has not reviewed the portions of 
this prospectus that relate to the general account. The disclosure with regard  
to general accounts, however, may be subject to certain provisions of the       
federal securities laws relating to the accuracy and completeness of statements 
made in prospectuses.                                                           

DATES AND PRICES AT WHICH CERTIFICATE EVENTS OCCUR                              

We describe below the general rules for when, and at what prices, events under  
your Certificate will occur. Other portions of this prospectus describe         
circumstances that may cause exceptions. We generally do not repeat those       
exceptions below.                                                               

BUSINESS DAY 

Our business day is generally any day that the New York Stock Exchange is open  
for trading. A business day does not include any day we choose not to open due  
to emergency conditions. We may also close early due to emergency conditions.   
Our business day generally ends at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time for purposes of      
determining the date when we apply contributions and process any other          
transaction requests. We will apply contributions and process any other         
transaction requests when we receive them along with all the required           
information.                                                                    

If your contribution, transfer or any other transaction request, containing all 
the required information, reaches us on a non-business day or after 4:00 p.m.,  
Eastern Time on a business day, we will use the next business day.              

CONTRIBUTIONS AND TRANSFERS                                                     

o   Contributions allocated to the Funds are invested at the unit value next    
determined after the receipt of the contribution.                       

o   Contributions allocated to a GRA will receive the interest rate for that GRA
in effect for that business day.                                        

o   Transfers to or from Funds will be made at the unit value next determined   
after the receipt of the transfer request.                              

o   Transfers to a GRA will be based on the interest rate for that GRA in effect
for the business day of the transfer.                                   

ABOUT YOUR VOTING RIGHTS                                                        

As the owner of the shares of the Trusts, we have the right to vote on certain  
matters involving the Portfolios, such as:                                      

o   The election of trustees.                                                   

o   The formal approval of independent auditors selected for the Trusts.        

o   Any other matters described in the prospectuses for the Trusts or requiring 
a shareholders' vote under the Investment Company Act of 1940.          

We will give Certificate owners the opportunity to instruct us how to vote the  
number of shares attributable to their Certificates if a shareholder vote is    
taken. If we do not receive instructions in time from all Certificate owners, we
will vote the shares of a portfolio for which no instructions have been received
in the same proportion as we vote shares of that portfolio for which we have    
received instructions. We will also vote any shares that we are entitled to vote
directly because of amounts we have in a Portfolio in the same proportions that 
Certificate owners vote.                                                        

VOTING RIGHTS OF OTHERS                                                         

The Trusts sell their shares to AXA Equitable separate accounts in connection   
with AXA Equitable's variable annuity and/or life insurance products, and to    
separate accounts of insurance companies, both affiliated and unaffiliated with 
AXA Equitable. AXA Premier VIP Trust and EQ Advisors Trust also sell their      
shares to the trustee of a qualified plan for AXA Equitable. We currently do not
foresee any disadvantages to our policyowners arising out of these arrangements.
However, the Board of Trustees or Directors of each Trust intends to monitor    
events to identify any material irreconcilable conflicts that may arise and to  
determine what action, if any, should be taken in response. If we believe that a
Board's response insufficiently protects our policyowners, we will see to it    
that appropriate action is taken to do so.                                      

SEPARATE ACCOUNT NO. 301 VOTING RIGHTS                                          

If actions relating to Separate Account No. 301 require Certificate owner       
approval, Certificate owners will be entitled to one vote for each unit they    
have in the Funds. We will cast votes attributable to any amounts we have in the
Funds in the same proportion as votes cast by Certificate owners.               

CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW                                                       

The voting rights we describe in this prospectus are created under applicable   
federal securities laws. To the extent that those laws or the regulations       
published under those laws eliminate the necessity to submit matters for        
approval by persons having voting rights in separate accounts of insurance      
companies, we reserve the right to proceed in accordance with those laws or     
regulations.                                                                    

ABOUT THE GROUP ANNUITY CONTRACTS                                               

The Certificates are issued under group annuity contracts between us and        
JPMorgan Chase Bank ("Chase"), whose sole purpose is to serve as a party to the 
group annuity contracts. Chase has no responsibility for the administration of  
any of the retirement programs described in this prospectus, for payments to the
investment options or to Participants, or for any other duties other than to    
serve as the group annuity contractholder.                                      

                                                            More information  25

IRS DISQUALIFICATION                                                            

If a retirement program funded by the Certificates is found not to qualify under
the Code, we may terminate the Certificate and pay the participant, plan        
trustees or other designated person, the account balance. We will, however, make
a deduction for any federal income tax payable by us because of the             
non-qualification.                                                              

ABOUT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS                                                         

AXA Equitable and its affiliates are parties to various legal proceedings. In   
our view, none of these proceedings would be considered material with respect to
a contract owner's interest in Separate Account No. 301, nor would any of these 
proceedings be likely to have a material adverse effect upon Separate Account   
No. 301, our ability to meet our obligations under the Certificates, or the     
distribution of the Certificates.                                               

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                            

The financial statements of Separate Account 301, as well as the consolidated   
financial statements of AXA Equitable, are in the SAI. The SAI is available free
of charge. You may request one by writing to our Processing Office or calling   
1-800-248-2138 or 1-800-248-2138-0 from France, Italy, Republic of Korea,       
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.                                            

TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP, COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENTS, LOANS, AND BORROWING            

You cannot assign or transfer ownership of a Regular IRA, Roth IRA, TSA, SEP, or
SIMPLE Certificate except by surrender to us. Loans are not available and you   
cannot assign Regular IRA, Roth IRA, TSA, SEP, and SIMPLE Certificates as       
security for a loan or other obligation.                                        

You may direct the transfer of account balances under your Regular IRA, Roth    
IRA, TSA, SEP, or SIMPLE Certificate to another similar arrangement. We can     
impose a withdrawal charge if one applies.                                      

DISTRIBUTION OF THE CERTIFICATES                                                

AXA Equitable performs all marketing and service functions under the            
Certificates. No sales commissions are paid with respect to units of interest in
Separate Account 301; however, incentive compensation is paid to AXA Equitable  
employees performing these functions, based upon sales and the amount of first  
year plan contributions, as discussed in the SAI. The offering of the units is  
continuous.                                                                     

REPORTS AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION                                              

Before payments start under your Certificate, we will send you, at least        
annually, a report showing as of a specified date: (1) the number of units you  
have credited to each Fund, (2) the unit values, (3) your account balance in    
each Fund and GRA and the total balance and (4) the cash values of your GRAs.   
Similar reports will be sent to you if you are receiving payments under the     
periodic distribution option. All transactions will be individually confirmed.  

As required by the Investment Company Act of 1940, each participant will be     
sent, semi-annually, a report containing financial statements and a list of the 
securities held by each Portfolio.                                              

As permitted by the SEC's rules, we omitted certain portions of the registration
statement filed with the SEC from this prospectus and SAI. You may obtain the   
omitted information by: (1) requesting a copy of the registration statement from
the SEC's principal office in Washington, D.C., and paying prescribed fees, or  
(2) by accessing the EDGAR Database at the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov.

TAX INFORMATION 

This section of the SAI discusses the current federal income tax rules that     
generally apply to the types of retirement plans or contracts described in the  
prospectus. The tax rules can differ, depending on the type of plan or          
contract, whether Regular IRA (also referred to as "traditional IRA") Roth IRA, 
TSA, SEP IRA, or SIMPLE IRA. Therefore, we discuss the tax aspects of each type 
of Certificate separately.                                                      

Federal income tax rules include the United States laws in the Internal Revenue 
Code ("Code"), and Treasury Department Regulations and Internal Revenue Service 
("IRS") interpretations of the Code. Certain retirement plans may also be       
subject to The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended      
("ERISA"), which The Department of Labor ("DOL") administers. These rules may   
change without notice. We cannot predict whether, when, or how these rules      
could change. Any change could affect Certificates purchased before the change. 
Congress may also consider proposals in the future to comprehensively reform or 
overhaul the United States tax and retirement systems, which, if enacted, could 
affect the tax benefits of a certificate. We cannot predict, what, if any,      
legislation will actually be proposed or enacted that may affect annuity        
contracts.                                                                      

We cannot provide detailed information on all tax aspects of the Certificates.  
Moreover, the tax aspects that apply to a particular participant's Certificate  
may vary depending on the facts applicable to that person. We do not discuss    
state income and other state taxes, federal income tax and withholding rules    
for non-U.S. taxpayers, or federal gift and estate taxes. Transfers of the      
Certificate, rights or values under the Certificate, or payments under the      
Certificate may be subject to federal or state gift, estate or inheritance      
taxes. You should not rely only on this document, but should consult your tax   
adviser before you purchase a Certificate.                                      

ADDITIONAL "SAVER'S CREDIT" FOR SALARY REDUCTION CONTRIBUTIONS TO CERTAIN PLANS 
OR A REGULAR IRA OR ROTH IRA                                                    

You may be eligible for a nonrefundable income tax credit for salary reduction  
contributions you make to a 403(b) TSA, SIMPLE IRA, SARSEP IRA, 401(k) plan or  
governmental employer 457(b) plan (also known as a governmental EDC plan), as   
well as contributions you make to a Regular IRA or Roth IRA. If you qualify,    
you may take this credit even though your salary reduction contribution is      
already excluded from tax or your Regular IRA contribution is already fully or  
partially deductible. To take advantage of this "saver's credit" you must be    
age 18 or over before the end of the taxable year for which the contribution is 
made. You cannot be a full-time student or claimed as a dependent on another's  
tax return, and your adjusted gross income cannot exceed $50,000 ($53,000,      
after cost of living adjustment for 2008). The amount of the tax credit you can 
get varies from 10% of your contribution to 50% of your contribution and        
depends on your income tax filing status and your adjusted gross income. The    
maximum annual contribution eligible for the saver's credit is $2,000. If you   
and your spouse file a joint return, and each of you qualifies, each is         
eligible for a maximum annual contribution of $2,000. Your saver's credit may   
also be reduced if you take or have taken a taxable distribution from any plan  
eligible for a saver's credit contribution -- even if you make a contribution   
to one plan and take the distribution from another plan -- during the "testing  
period." The "testing period" begins two years before the year for which you    
make the contribution and ends when your tax return is due for the year for     
which you make the contribution.                                                

TAX SHELTERED ANNUITY CONTRACTS (TSAS) 
GENERAL; SPECIAL EMPLOYER RULES                                                 

The following discussion reflects our current understanding of some of the      
special federal income tax rules applicable to annuity contracts used to fund   
employer plans under Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. We refer to   
these contracts as "403(b) annuity contracts" or "Tax Sheltered Annuity
contracts (TSAs)".                                                              

Final Regulations under Section 403(b)                                          

The IRS and the Treasury Department recently published final Treasury           
Regulations under Section 403(b) of the Code ("2007 Regulations"). As a result, 
there are significant revisions to the establishment and operation of plans and 
arrangements under Section 403(b) of the Code, and the contracts issued to fund 
such plans. These rules become fully effective on January 1, 2009, but various  
transition rules apply beginning in 2007. There are a number of uncertainties   
regarding the application of these rules. The 2007 Regulations raise a number   
of questions as to the effect of the 2007 Regulations on 403(b) TSA contracts   
issued prior to the effective date of the 2007 Regulations. The IRS has issued  
guidance intended to clarify some of these questions, and may issue further     
guidance in future years.                                                       

An employer eligible to maintain a 403(b) plan for its employees may make       
contributions to purchase a 403(b) funding vehicle for the benefit of the       
employee. These contributions, if properly made, will not be currently taxable  
compensation to the employee. Moreover, the employee will not be taxed on the   
earnings in the 403(b) funding vehicle until he/she takes distributions.        

Generally, there are two types of funding vehicles available to fund 403(b)     
plans: an annuity contract under Section 403(b)(1) of the Code or a custodial   
account that invests only in mutual funds and which is treated as an annuity    
contract under section 403(b)(7) of the Code. Both types of 403(b) arrangements 
qualify for tax deferral.                                                       

Two different types of employers are eligible to maintain 403(b) plans: public  
schools and specified tax-exempt organizations under Section 501(c)(3) of the   
Code.                                                                           

2

Employer plan requirement. The thrust of the 2007 Regulations is to eliminate   
informal Section 403(b) arrangements with minimal or diffuse employer oversight 
and to require employers purchasing annuity contracts for their employees under 
Section 403(b) of the Code to conform to other tax-favored, employer-based      
retirement plans with salary reduction contributions, such as Section 401(k)    
plans and governmental employer Section 457(b) plans. As of January 1, 2009,    
employers sponsoring 403(b) plans must have a written plan designating          
administrative responsibilities for various functions under the plan, and the   
plan in operation must conform to the plan terms. As part of this process, the  
sponsoring employer must also designate the insurance companies or mutual fund  
companies to which it will make contributions to purchase 403(b) annuity        
contracts or 403(b)(7) custodial accounts under its 403(b) plan. These          
companies are typically referred to as "approved providers" or "approved        
vendors" under the employer's 403(b) plan, although such terms are not used in  
the 2007 Regulations.                                                           

If AXA Equitable is not an approved provider under an employer's 403(b) plan,   
active participants in that employer's plan may have to transfer funds from     
their AXA Equitable TSA contracts to another 403(b) plan funding vehicle in a   
contract exchange under the same plan in order to retain 403(b) status for      
those funds.                                                                    

CONTRIBUTIONS TO TSAS                                                           
ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO TSAS MADE THROUGH THE EMPLOYER'S PAYROLL                

Annual contributions to TSAs made through the employer's payroll are limited.   
(If permitted by the plan, plan-to-plan direct transfer contributions from      
another 403(b) plan, contract exchanges under the same plan, and rollover       
contributions from another eligible retirement plan are not subject to these    
annual contribution limits.)                                                    

Commonly, some or all of the contributions to a TSA are made under a salary     
reduction agreement between the employee and the employer. These contributions  
are called "salary reduction" or "elective deferral" contributions and are      
generally made on a pre-tax basis. However, a TSA can also be wholly or         
partially funded through nonelective employer contributions or contributions    
treated as after-tax employee contributions. If the employer's plan permits, a  
participant may designate some or all of salary reduction contributions as      
"designated Roth contributions", which are made on an after-tax basis. We do    
not accept designated Roth contributions to this contract. The permissible      
annual contribution to the participant's TSA is calculated the same way as      
contributions to a 401(k) plan:                                                 

o The annual limit on employer and employee contributions to defined            
contribution plans is the lesser of $46,000 (after adjustment for cost of   
living changes for 2008) or 100% of compensation. (Compensation over        
$230,000 for 2008 is disregarded).                                          

o The annual limit on all salary reduction or elective deferral contributions   
under all employer plans you participate in is generally limited to         
$15,500 for 2008.                                                           

These limits may be further adjusted for cost of living charges in future       
years.                                                                          

Special provisions may allow certain participants with at least 15 years of     
service to make "catch-up" contributions to compensate for smaller              
contributions made in previous years. In addition, if the plan permits, an      
individual who is at least age 50 at any time during 2008 can make up to $5,000 
additional salary reduction contributions for 2008.                             

If contributions to a TSA exceed the applicable limit in any year, the excess   
will be taxable to the employee as ordinary income. In certain situations, we   
may distribute excess contributions to avoid tax penalties.                     

Any excess deferral contributions not withdrawn by April 15 after the year of   
the deferral may cause the contract to fail TSA rules.                          

ROLLOVER CONTRIBUTIONS TO TSAS                                                  

Rollover contributions. Federal tax law permits rollover contributions to be    
made to a TSA contract from these sources: qualified plans, governmental        
employer 457(b) plans and traditional IRAs, as well as other 403(b) plan        
funding vehicles. The recipient 403(b) plan must allow such contributions to be 
made.                                                                           

Generally, funds may be rolled over when a plan participant has a distributable 
event from an eligible retirement plan as a result of:                          

o termination of employment with the employer who provided the funds for the    
plan; or                                                                    

o reaching age 59-1/2 even if still employed; or                                

o disability (special federal income tax definition).                           

If your plan permits, any after-tax contributions you have made to a qualified  
plan or TSA may be directly rolled over to another qualified plan or TSA which  
agrees to do required separate accounting. This can only be done in a direct    
rollover, not a rollover you do yourself. After-tax contributions in a Regular  
IRA cannot be rolled over from the Regular IRA into a TSA. If the after-tax     
contributions are in a "designated Roth contribution account" under a 403(b)    
plan or 401(k) plan which permits designated Roth elective deferral             
contributions to be made, they can be rolled into another "designated Roth      
contribution account" under another 403(b) plan or 401(k) plan. They cannot be  
rolled into a non-Roth after-tax contribution account.                          

Before you decide to roll over your payment to another employer plan, you       
should check with the administrator of that plan about whether the plan accepts 
rollovers and, if so, the types of distributions it accepts. You should also    
check with the administrator of the receiving plan about any documents required 
to be completed before it will accept a rollover.                               

You should discuss with your tax advisor whether you should consider rolling    
over funds from one type of tax-qualified retirement plan to another, because   
the funds will generally be subject to the rules of the recipient plan. For     
example, funds in a governmental employer 457(b) plan are not subject to the    
additional 10% federal income tax penalty for premature distributions, but they 
may become subject to this penalty if you roll the funds to a non-governmental  
employer 457(b) plan such as a TSA and subsequently take a premature            
distribution. Further, in light of the restrictions on the ability to take      
distributions or loans from a 403(b) contract without plan or employer approval 
under the 2007 Regulations, a plan participant should consider carefully        
whether                                                                         

                                                                               3

to roll an eligible rollover distribution (which is no longer subject to        
distribution restrictions) to a 403(b) plan funding vehicle, or to traditional  
IRA instead.                                                                    

If the recipient plan separately accounts for funds rolled over from another    
eligible retirement plan, the IRS has ruled that an exception is available in   
certain situations to withdrawal restrictions that would otherwise apply to the 
rollover contribution funds in the recipient plan.                              

DIRECT TRANSFERS 

Limitations on individual initiated direct transfers. The 2007 Regulations      
revoke Revenue Ruling 90-24 (Rev. Rul. 90-24), effective January 1, 2009. Prior 
to the 2007 Regulations, Rev. Rul. 90-24 had permitted individual-initiated,    
tax-free direct transfers of funds from one 403(b) contract to another, without 
reportable taxable income to the individual. Under transitional rules in the    
2007 Regulations and other IRS published guidance, direct transfers made after  
September 24, 2007 may still be permitted with plan or employer approval as     
described below.                                                                

Direct transfer contributions. A tax-free direct transfer occurs when changing  
the 403(b) plan funding vehicle, even if there is no distributable event. Under 
a direct transfer a plan participant does not receive a distribution.           

The 2007 Regulations provide for two types of direct transfers between 403(b)   
funding vehicles: "plan-to-plan transfers" and "contract exchanges within the   
same 403(b) plan". 403(b) plans do not have to offer these options. A           
"plan-to-plan transfer" must meet the following conditions: (i) both the source 
403(b) plan and the recipient 403(b) plan permit plan-to-plan transfers; (ii)   
the transfer from one 403(b) plan to another 403(b) plan is made for a          
participant (or beneficiary of a deceased participant) who is an employee or    
former employee of the employer sponsoring the recipient 403(b) plan; (iii)     
immediately after the transfer the accumulated benefit of the participant (or   
beneficiary) whose assets are being transferred is at least equal to the        
participant's (or beneficiary's) accumulated benefit immediately before the     
transfer; (iv) the recipient 403(b) plan imposes distribution restrictions on   
transferred amounts at least as stringent as those imposed under the source     
403(b) plan; and (v) if the plan-to-plan transfer is not a complete transfer of 
the participant's (or beneficiary's) interest in the source 403(b) plan, the    
recipient 403(b) plan treats the amount transferred as a continuation of a pro  
rata portion of the participant's (or beneficiary's) interest in the source     
403(b) plan (for example with respect to the participant's interest in any      
after-tax employee contributions).                                              

A "contract exchange within the same 403(b) plan" must meet the following       
conditions: (i) the 403(b) plan under which the contract is issued must permit  
contract exchanges; (ii) immediately after the exchange the accumulated benefit 
of the participant (or beneficiary of a deceased participant) is at least equal 
to the participant's (or beneficiary's) accumulated benefit immediately before  
the exchange (taking into account the accumulated benefit of that participant   
(or beneficiary) under both section 403(b) contracts immediately before the     
exchange); (iii) the contract issued in the exchange is subject to distribution 
restrictions with respect to the participant that are not less stringent than   
those imposed on the contract being exchanged; and (iv) the employer sponsoring 
the 403(b) plan and the issuer of the contract issued in the exchange agree to  
provide each other with specified information from time to time in the future   
("an information sharing agreement"). The shared information is designed to     
preserve the requirements of Section 403(b), primarily to comply with loan      
requirements, hardship withdrawal rules, and distribution restrictions.         

TSA contracts issued by AXA Equitable pursuant to a Rev. Rul. 90-24 direct      
transfer where applications and all transfer paperwork were received by our     
processing office in good order prior to September 25, 2007 are "grandfathered" 
as to 403(b) status. However, future transactions such as loans and             
distributions under such "grandfathered" contracts may result in adverse tax    
consequences to the owner unless the contracts are or become part of the        
employer's 403(b) plan, or the employer enters into an information sharing      
agreement with us.                                                              

The amount of any rollover or direct transfer contributions made to a 403(b)    
annuity contract must be net of the required minimum distribution for the tax   
year in which the contract is issued if the owner is at least age 70-1/2 in the 
calendar year the contribution is made, and has retired from service with the   
employer who sponsored the plan or provided the funds to purchase the 403(b)    
annuity contract which is the source of the contribution.                       

DISTRIBUTIONS FROM TSAS                                                         

Depending on the terms of the plan and your employment status, you may have to  
get your employer's consent to take a withdrawal.                               

WITHDRAWAL RESTRICTIONS                                                         

You may not be able to withdraw or take payments from all or part of your TSA   
until you:                                                                      

o reach age 59-1/2,                                                             

o die,                                                                          

o are disabled (special Federal income tax definition),                         

o sever employment with the employer which provided the TSA funds, or           

o suffer a financial hardship. (Hardship withdrawals are limited to the amount  
of your salary reduction contributions, without earnings.)                  

These restrictions apply to salary reduction (elective deferral) contributions  
and earnings on those contributions. If any portion of the funds directly       
transferred to your TSA Certificate is attributable to amounts that you         
invested in a 403(b)(7) custodial account, such amounts, including earnings,    
are subject to withdrawal restrictions.                                         

These restrictions do not apply to the value of your TSA Certificate as of      
December 31, 1988 attributable to salary reduction contributions and earnings.  
If you directly transfer any amounts to this Certificate you must properly      
notify us in writing at our Processing Office of your December 31, 1988 account 
balance. Otherwise, we will view all amounts transferred as subject to          
restrictions.                                                                   

If the recipient plan separately accounts for funds rolled over from another    
eligible retirement plan, the IRS has ruled that an exception is available in   
certain situations to withdrawal restrictions that would otherwise apply to the 
rollover contribution funds in the recipient plan.

TAX TREATMENTS OF DISTRIBUTIONS FROM TSAS                                       

Amounts held under TSAs are generally not subject to Federal income tax until   
benefits are distributed.                                                       

Distributions include withdrawals and annuity payments. Death benefits paid to  
a beneficiary are also taxable distributions. Unless an exception applies,      
amounts distributed from TSAs are includible as ordinary income. Distributions  
from TSAs may be subject to 20% federal income tax withholding. See "Federal
and State Income Tax Withholding and Information Reporting" below. In addition, 
TSA distributions may be subject to additional tax penalties.                   

If you have made after-tax contributions you will have a tax basis in your      
Certificate which will be recovered tax-free. You may have a tax basis in the   
Certificate if the employer made contributions that were included in your gross 
income in the year of the employer's contribution, for example. Unless we have  
been provided acceptable documentation for the amounts of any after-tax         
contributions to your TSA, we assume that all amounts distributed from your TSA 
are pre-tax, and we withhold tax and report accordingly.                        

If certain timing and distribution event requirements are satisfied,            
distributions from a designated Roth contribution account under a 403(b) plan   
will be tax-free. The earliest a qualified distribution from a designated Roth  
contribution account could be made is 2011. Therefore, earnings attributable to 
a distribution from a designated Roth account may be includible in income.      

The amount of any partial distribution from a TSA before the annuity starting   
date is generally taxable as ordinary income to you except to the extent the    
distribution is a withdrawal of your basis. Distributions are generally pro     
rata withdrawals of tax basis and earnings on that tax basis. On a total        
surrender of your certificate, the amount received in excess of your tax basis, 
if any, is taxable.                                                             

If you elect an annuity distribution, the nontaxable portion of each payment is 
(1) your tax basis in the contract divided by (2) an expected return determined 
under IRS tables. The balance of each payment is taxable. The entire amount of  
the payments you receive after you recover your tax basis is taxable. If you    
die before recovering your tax basis and the annuity has a refund feature, the  
beneficiary of the refund may recover the remaining tax basis as payments are   
made. If you (and your beneficiary under a joint and survivor annuity) die      
before recovering the entire basis of the annuity, a deduction is allowed on    
your (or your beneficiary's) final tax return.                                  

EARLY DISTRIBUTION PENALTY TAX 

Distributions from a TSA will be subject to an additional 10% penalty tax,      
unless the distribution occurs on or after you:                                 

o die,                                                                          

o are disabled (special Federal income tax definition),                         

o reach age 59-1/2,                                                             

o separate from service and elect a payout over your life or life expectancy    
(or joint and survivor lives or life expectancies of you and your           
beneficiary) using an IRS-approved distribution method,                     

o separate from service after age 55 (any form of payout, but the separation    
from service must occur during or after the calendar year you reach 55),    
or                                                                          

o use the distribution to pay certain extraordinary medical expenses (special   
Federal income tax definition).                                             

TAX DEFERRED ROLLOVERS AND DIRECT TRANSFERS                                     

You may roll over any "eligible rollover distribution" from a TSA into another  
eligible retirement plan which agrees to accept the rollover. The rollover may  
be a direct rollover or a rollover you do yourself within 60 days after you     
receive the distribution. To the extent that a distribution is rolled over it   
remains tax-deferred.                                                           

You may roll over a distribution of pre-tax funds from a TSA to any of the      
following: a qualified plan, a governmental employer 457(b) plan, a Regular IRA 
or another 403(b) plan. A spousal beneficiary may also roll over death benefits 
to any of these. A non-spousal death beneficiary may be able to directly roll   
over death benefits to a new traditional inherited IRA under certain            
circumstances.                                                                  

Effective beginning in 2008, distributions from a 403(b) annuity contract can   
be rolled over to a Roth IRA. Such conversion rollover transactions are         
taxable. Any taxable portion of the amount rolled over will be taxed at the     
time of the rollover. Rollovers are subject to the Roth IRA conversion rules,   
which restrict conversions of traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs to taxpayers with   
adjusted gross income of no more than $100,000, whether single or married       
filing jointly. A surviving spouse might also be eligible to roll over a TSA    
death benefit to a Roth IRA in a taxable conversion rollover, beginning in      
2008.                                                                           

The recipient plan must agree to take the distribution. If you are rolling over 
from a TSA to a governmental employer 457(b) plan, the recipient governmental   
employer 457(b) plan must agree to separately account for the rolled-over       
funds.                                                                          

The taxable portion of most distributions will be eligible for rollover.        
However, Federal income tax rules exclude certain distributions from rollover   
treatment, including (1) periodic payments for life or for a period of 10 years 
or more, (2) hardship withdrawals, and (3) any required minimum distributions.  
We discuss eligible rollover distributions in greater detail under "Federal and
State Income Tax Withholding and Information Reporting," below, including rules 
requiring 20% income tax withholding on certain distributions from TSAs.        

Any non-Roth after-tax contributions you have made to a TSA may be directly     
rolled over to another qualified plan or TSA which agrees to do required        
separate accounting. This can only be done in a direct rollover, not a rollover 
you do yourself. You may roll over any non-Roth after-tax contributions you     
have made to a TSA to a Regular IRA (either in a direct rollover or a rollover  
you do yourself). When the recipient plan is a Regular IRA, you are responsible 
for recordkeeping and calculating the taxable amount of any distributions you   
take from that Regular IRA. After-tax contributions may not be rolled into a    
governmental employer 457(b) plan. Amounts attributable to "designated Roth     
contributions" under a 403(b) plan may be rolled over to another designated     
Roth contribution separate account under another 403(b) plan or 401(k) plan or  
a Roth IRA.                                                                     

                                                                               5

P-->485BPOS36th "Page" of 141TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 36th
Before you decide to roll over your payment to another employer plan, you       
should check with the administrator of that plan about whether the plan accepts 
rollovers and, if so, the types of distributions it accepts. You should also    
check with the administrator of the receiving plan about any documents required 
to be completed before it will accept a rollover. Generally the funds are       
subject to the rules of the recipient plan. If the recipient plan separately    
accounts for funds rolled over from another eligible retirement plan, the IRS   
has ruled that an exception is available in certain situations to withdrawal    
restrictions that would otherwise apply to the rollover contribution funds in   
the recipient plan. However, distributions from a governmental employer 457(b)  
plan are generally not subject to the additional 10% federal income tax penalty 
for pre-age 59-1/2 distributions, which applies to other types of retirement    
plans. If you roll over funds from an eligible retirement plan which is not a   
governmental employer 457(b) plan into a governmental employer 457(b) plan, and 
you later take a distribution from the recipient governmental employer 457(b)   
plan, those amounts generally remain subject to the penalty.                    

You should check if the recipient plan separately accounts for funds rolled     
over from another eligible retirement plan. The IRS has ruled that an exception 
is available in certain situations to withdrawal restrictions that would        
otherwise apply to the rollover contribution funds in the recipient plan.       

Direct transfers from one 403(b) annuity contract to another (whether under a   
plan-to-plan transfer, contract exchange under the same 403(b) plan, or under   
Rev. Rul. 90-24 prior to the 2007 Regulations) are not distributions.           

If there is a mandatory distribution provision in your employer's plan for      
certain small amounts and you do not designate an eligible retirement plan to   
receive such a mandatory distribution, Treasury Regulations require a Regular   
IRA be established on your behalf.                                              

REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS 

The Required Minimum Distribution rules discussed below under "Traditional
Individual Retirement Annuities (Regular IRAs)--Required minimum distributions" 
apply to TSAs, with this difference:                                            

When you have to take the first required minimum distribution:                  

The minimum distribution rules force TSA participants to start computing and    
taking annual distributions from their TSAs by a required date. When minimum    
distributions must begin depends on, among other things, your age and           
retirement status. Generally, you must take the first required minimum          
distribution with respect to the calendar year in which you turn age 70-1/2.    
You may be entitled to delay commencement of required minimum distributions for 
all or part of your account balance until after age 70-1/2. These exceptions    
apply to the following individuals:                                             

o For 403(b) plan participants who have not retired from service with the       
employer who provided the funds for the TSA by the calendar year the        
participant turns age 70-1/2, the Required Beginning Date for minimum       
distributions is extended to April 1 following the calendar year of         
retirement.                                                                 

o 403(b) plan participants may also delay commencement to age 75 of the portion 
of their account balance attributable to their December 31, 1986 TSA        
account balance, even if retired at age 70-1/2.                             

IRAS 
GENERAL DISCUSSION OF IRAS                                                      
"IRA" stands for individual retirement arrangement and the two basic types of   
such arrangements, individual retirement accounts and individual retirement     
annuities. In an individual retirement account, a trustee or custodian holds    
the assets funding the account for the benefit of the IRA owner. The assets     
typically include mutual funds and/or individual stocks and securities in a     
custodial account and bank certificates of deposit in a trusteed account. In an 
individual retirement annuity, an insurance company issues an annuity contract  
that serves as the IRA.                                                         

There are two basic types of IRAs, as follows:                                  

o "Regular IRAs," typically funded on a pre-tax basis including SEP-IRAs        
and SIMPLE IRAs issued and funded in connection with employer-sponsored     
retirement plans; and                                                       

o Roth IRAs, funded on an after-tax basis.                                      

Regardless of the type of IRA, your ownership interest in the IRA cannot be     
forfeited. You or your beneficiaries who survive you are the only ones who can  
receive the IRA's benefits or payments. All types of IRAs qualify for tax       
deferral, regardless of the funding vehicle selected.                           

You can hold your IRA assets in as many different accounts and annuities as you 
would like, as long as you meet the rules for setting up and making             
contributions to IRAs. However, if you own multiple IRAs, you may be required   
to aggregate IRA values or contributions for tax purposes. For further          
information about individual retirement arrangements, you can read Internal     
Revenue Service Publication 590 (Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)).    
This Publication is usually updated annually, and can be obtained from any IRS  
district office or the IRS website (www.irs.gov).                               

The AXA Equitable 300+ Series IRAs are designed to qualify as "individual       
retirement annuities" under Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. This   
SAI and the prospectus contain the information that the Internal Revenue        
Service ("IRS") requires you to have before you purchase an IRA. This section   
of the SAI covers some of the special tax rules that apply to IRAs. The next    
section covers Roth IRAs.                                                       

We have received an opinion letter from the IRS approving the respective forms  
of the AXA Equitable regular IRA, Roth IRA and SIMPLE IRA Certificates, for use 
as the applicable type of IRA. This IRS approval is a determination only as to  
the form of the annuity. It does not represent a determination of the merits of 
the annuity as an investment.                                                   

CANCELLATION                                                                    

You can cancel an AXA Equitable 300+ Series IRA Certificate by following the    
directions under "Your Right to Cancel within a Certain Number of Days" in the  
prospectus. You can cancel an AXA Equitable 300+ Series Roth IRA certificate    
issued as a result of a full conversion of an AXA Equitable 300+ Series Regular 
IRA certificate by following

the instructions in the request for full conversion form. The form is available 
from our Processing Office or your registered representative. If you cancel a   
Regular IRA or Roth IRA certificate, we may have to withhold tax, and we must   
report the transaction to the IRS. A Certificate cancellation could have an     
unfavorable tax impact.                                                         

You must also use our form to recharacterize Roth IRA Certificates as Regular   
IRAs and vice versa.                                                            

TRADITIONAL INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES (REGULAR IRAS) 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO REGULAR IRAS                                                   

Individuals may make three different types of contributions to purchase a       
Regular IRA or as subsequent contributions to an existing IRA:                  

o "regular" contributions out of earned income or compensation;                 

o tax-free "rollover" contributions; or                                         

o direct custodian-to-custodian transfers from other Regular IRAs ("direct
transfers").                                                                

LIMITS ON CONTRIBUTIONS 

The "maximum regular contribution amount" for any taxable year is the most that 
can be contributed to all of your IRAs (Regular and Roth) as regular            
contributions for the particular taxable year. The maximum regular contribution 
amount depends on age, earnings, and year, among other things. Generally,       
$5,000 is the maximum amount of regular contributions that you may make to all  
IRAs (including Roth IRAs). When your earnings are below $5,000, your earned    
income or compensation for the year is the most you can contribute. This limit  
does not apply to rollover contributions or direct custodian-to-custodian       
transfers into a Regular IRA. You have to stop making Regular IRA contributions 
for the taxable year in which you reach age 70-1/2 and any taxable year after   
that.                                                                           

If you are at least age 50 at any time during the taxable year for which you    
are making a regular contribution to your IRA, you may be eligible to make      
additional "catch-up contributions" of up to $1,000 to your Regular IRA.        

SPECIAL RULES FOR SPOUSES 

If you are married and file a joint income tax return, you and your spouse may  
combine your compensation to determine the permissible amount of regular        
contributions to Regular IRAs (and Roth IRAs discussed below). Even if one      
spouse has no compensation or compensation under $5,000, married individuals    
filing jointly can contribute up to $10,000 for 2008 to any combination of      
Regular IRAs and Roth IRAs. Any contributions to Roth IRAs reduce the ability   
to contribute to Regular IRAs and vice versa. The maximum amount may be less if 
earned income is less and the other spouse has made IRA contributions. No more  
than a combined total of $5,000 can be contributed annually to either spouse's  
Regular and Roth IRAs. Each spouse owns his or her Regular IRAs and Roth IRAs   
even if contributions were funded by the other spouse. A working spouse age     
70-1/2 or over can contribute up to the lesser of $5,000 or 100% of "earned     
income" to a Regular IRA for a nonworking spouse until the year in which the    
nonworking spouse reaches age 70-1/2. "Catch-up" contributions may be made as   
described above for spouses who are at least age 50 but under age 70-1/2 at any 
time during taxable year for which the contribution is being made.              

DEDUCTIBILITY OF CONTRIBUTIONS                                                  

The amount of regular contributions to a Regular IRA that you can deduct for a  
taxable year depends on whether you are covered by an employer-sponsored        
tax-favored retirement plan, as defined under special federal income tax rules. 
Your Form W-2 will indicate whether or not you are covered by such a retirement 
plan.                                                                           

If you are not covered by a retirement plan during any part of the year, you    
can make fully deductible contributions to your Regular IRAs for the taxable    
year up to the maximum amount discussed earlier in this section under "Limits
on contributions." That is, for 2007, your fully deductible contribution can be 
up to $5,000, or if less, your earned income. The dollar limit is $6,000 for    
people eligible to make age 50-70-1/2 catch-up contributions.                   

If you are covered by a retirement plan during any part of the year, and your   
adjusted gross income ("AGI") is below the lower dollar figure in a phase-out   
range, you can make fully deductible contributions to your Regular IRAs.        

If you are covered by a retirement plan during any part of the year, and your   
AGI falls within a phase-out range, you can make partially deductible           
contributions to your Regular IRAs.                                             

If you are covered by a retirement plan during any part of the year, and your   
AGI falls above the higher figure in the phase-out range, you may not deduct    
any of your contribution to your Regular IRAs.                                  

Cost of living indexing adjustments apply to the income limits to deductible    
contributions.                                                                  

If you are single and covered by a retirement plan during any part of the       
taxable year, the deduction for traditional IRA contributions phases out with   
AGI between $50,000 and $60,000 (for 2008, AGI between $53,000 and $63,000      
after adjustment).                                                              

If you are married and file a joint return, and you are covered by a retirement 
plan during any part of the taxable year, the deduction for traditional IRA     
contributions phases out with AGI between $80,000 and $100,000 (for 2008, AGI   
between $85,000 and $105,000 after adjustment).                                 

Married individuals filing separately and living apart at all times are not     
considered married for purposes of this deductible contribution calculation.    
Generally, the active participation in an employer-sponsored retirement plan of 
an individual is determined independently for each spouse. Where spouses have   
"married filing jointly" status, however, the maximum deductible traditional    
IRA contribution for an individual who is not an active participant (but whose  
spouse is an active participant) is phased out for taxpayers with an AGI        
between $150,000 and $160,000 (for 2008, AGI between $159,000 and $169,000      
after adjustment).                                                              

To determine the deductible amount of the contribution for 2008, for example,   
you determine AGI and subtract $53,000 if you are single, or                    

                                                                               7

$85,000 if you are married and file a joint return with your spouse. The        
resulting amount is your excess AGI. You then determine the limit on the        
deduction for traditional IRA contributions using the following formula:        

($10,000-excess AGI)     times    the maximum  Equals    the adjusted         
____________________       x        regular      =        deductible          
divided by $10,000              contribution            contribution        
                    for the year               limit

NONDEDUCTIBLE REGULAR CONTRIBUTIONS                                             

If you are not eligible to deduct part or all of the regular IRA contribution,  
you may still make nondeductible contributions on which earnings will           
accumulate on a tax-deferred basis. The combined deductible and nondeductible   
contributions to your Regular IRA (or the nonworking spouse's Regular IRA) may  
not, however, exceed the $5,000 maximum per person limit for the applicable     
taxable year. The dollar limit is $6,000 for people eligible to make age        
50-70-1/2 "catch-up" contributions. See "Excess contributions" below. You must  
keep your own records of deductible and nondeductible contributions in order to 
prevent double taxation on the distribution of previously taxed amounts. See    
"Withdrawals, Payments and Transfer of Funds Out of Regular IRAs" below.        

If you are making nondeductible contributions in any taxable year, or you have  
made nondeductible contributions to a Regular IRA in prior years and are        
receiving distributions from any Regular IRA, you must file the required        
information with the IRS. Moreover, if you are making nondeductible regular IRA 
contributions, you must retain all income tax returns and records pertaining to 
such contributions until interests in all Regular IRAs are fully distributed.   

WHEN YOU CAN MAKE REGULAR CONTRIBUTIONS                                         

If you file your tax returns on a calendar year basis like most taxpayers, you  
have until the April 15 return filing deadline (without extensions) of the      
following calendar year to make your regular IRA contributions for a tax year.  

ROLLOVER AND TRANSFER CONTRIBUTIONS TO REGULAR IRAS 

Rollover contributions may be made to a Regular IRA from these "eligible        
retirement plans":                                                              

o qualified plans;                                                              

o governmental employer 457(b) plans;                                           

o 403(b) plans; and                                                             

o other Regular IRAs.                                                           

Direct transfer contributions may only be made directly from one Regular IRA to 
another. Any amount contributed to a Regular IRA after you attain age 70-1/2    
must be net of your required minimum distribution for the year in which the     
rollover or direct transfer contribution is made.                               

ROLLOVERS FROM ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLANS OTHER THAN REGULAR IRAS 

Your plan administrator will tell you whether or not your distributions are     
eligible to be rolled over. Spousal beneficiaries and spousal alternate payees  
under qualified domestic relations orders may roll over funds on the same basis 
as the plan participant. A non-spousal death beneficiary may also be able to    
make a direct rollover to an inherited traditional IRA under certain            
circumstances.                                                                  

There are two ways to do rollovers:                                             

o Do it yourself                                                                

You actually receive a distribution that can be rolled over and you roll it 
over to a Regular IRA within 60 days after the date you receive the funds.  
The distribution from your eligible retirement plan will be net of 20%      
mandatory federal income tax withholding. If you want, you can replace the  
withheld funds yourself and roll over the full amount.                      

o Direct rollover                                                               

You tell the trustee or custodian of the eligible retirement plan to send   
the distribution directly to your Regular IRA issuer. Direct rollovers are  
not subject to mandatory federal income tax withholding.                    

All distributions from a qualified plan, 403(b) plan or governmental employer   
457(b) plan are eligible rollover distributions, unless the distribution is:    

o a "required minimum distribution" after age 70-1/2 or retirement from service 
with the employer;                                                          

o one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made at least        
annually for your life (or life expectancy) or the joint lives (or joint    
life expectancies) of you and your designated beneficiary;                  

o one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made for a specified 
period of 10 years or more;                                                 

o a hardship withdrawal;                                                        

o if you have contributed too much, a corrective distribution which fits        
specified technical tax rules;                                              

o a loan that is treated as a deemed distribution;                              

o a death benefit payment to a beneficiary who is not your surviving spouse;    
and                                                                         

o a qualified domestic relations order distribution to a beneficiary who is not 
your current spouse or former spouse.                                       

You should discuss with your tax advisor whether you should consider rolling    
over funds from one type of tax qualified retirement plan to another, because   
the funds will generally be subject to the rules of the recipient plan. For     
example, funds in a governmental employer 457(b) plan are not subject to the    
additional 10% federal income tax penalty for early distributions, but they may 
become subject to this penalty if you roll the funds to a non-governmental      
employer 457(b) plan such as a Regular IRA and subsequently take an early       
distribution.                                                                   

ROLLOVERS OF AFTER-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLANS OTHER THAN  
REGULAR IRAS                                                                    

Any non-Roth after-tax contributions you have made to a qualified plan or       
403(b) plan (but not a governmental employer 457(b) plan) may be rolled over to 
a Regular IRA (either in a direct rollover or a rollover you do yourself). When 
the recipient plan is a Regular IRA, you are responsible for recordkeeping and  
calculating the taxable amount of any distributions you take from the Regular   
IRA. See "Taxation of Payments" later in this section under "Withdrawals,
payments and transfers of funds out of Regular IRAs." Also, after-tax funds in  
a Regu-                                                                         

8

lar IRA cannot be rolled over from your Regular IRA into, or back into, a       
qualified plan, 403(b) plan or governmental employer 457(b) plan.               

ROLLOVERS FROM REGULAR IRAS TO REGULAR IRAS                                     

You may roll over amounts from one Regular IRA to one or more of your other     
Regular IRAs if you complete the transaction within 60 days after you receive   
the funds. You may make such a rollover only once in every 12-month period for  
the same funds. Trustee-to-trustee or custodian-to-custodian direct transfers   
are not rollover transactions. You can make these more frequently than once in  
every 12-month period.                                                          

SPOUSAL ROLLOVERS AND DIVORCE-RELATED TRANSFERS                                 

The surviving spouse beneficiary of a deceased individual can roll over funds   
from, or directly transfer funds from, an inherited Regular IRA to one or more  
other Regular IRAs. A non-spousal death beneficiary may also be able to make a  
direct rollover to an inherited traditional IRA under certain circumstances.    
Also, in some cases, Regular IRAs can be transferred on a tax-free basis        
between spouses or former spouses as a result of a court-ordered divorce or     
separation decree.                                                              

EXCESS CONTRIBUTIONS 

Excess contributions to Regular IRAs are subject to a 6% excise tax for the     
year in which made and for each year after until withdrawn. The following are   
excess contributions to Regular IRAs:                                           

o regular contributions of more than the maximum regular contribution amount    
for the applicable taxable year; or                                         

o "regular contributions" to a Regular IRA made after you reach age 70-1/2; and 

o rollover contributions of amounts that are not eligible to be rolled over     
(for example, minimum distributions required to be made after age 70-1/2).  

You can avoid the excise tax by withdrawing an excess contribution (rollover or 
regular) before the due date (including extensions) for filing your federal     
income tax return for the year. If it is an excess regular Regular IRA          
contribution, you cannot take a tax deduction for the amount withdrawn. The     
excess contribution withdrawn is not includable in income and is not subject to 
the 10% additional penalty tax on early distributions (discussed below under    
"Early Distribution Penalty Tax"). You do have to withdraw any earnings         
attributable to the excess contribution. The withdrawn earnings would be        
includable in your gross income and could be subject to the 10% penalty tax.    

Even after the due date for filing your return, you may withdraw an excess      
rollover contribution, without income inclusion or 10% penalty, if (1) the      
rollover was from an eligible retirement plan to a Regular IRA, (2) the excess  
contribution was due to incorrect information that the plan provided, and (3)   
you took no tax deduction for the excess contribution.                          

RECHARACTERIZATIONS                                                             

Amounts that have been contributed as Regular IRA funds may subsequently be     
treated as Roth IRA funds. Special federal income tax rules allow you to change 
your mind again and have amounts that are subsequently treated as Roth IRA      
funds, once again treated as Regular IRA funds. You do this by using the forms  
or documentation we prescribe. This is referred to as having "recharacterized"  
your contribution.                                                              

WITHDRAWALS, PAYMENTS AND TRANSFERS OF FUNDS OUT OF REGULAR IRAS 
NO FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW RESTRICTIONS ON WITHDRAWALS                           

You can withdraw any or all of your funds from a Regular IRA at any time. You   
do not need to wait for a special event like retirement.                        

TAXATION OF PAYMENTS 

Earnings in Regular IRAs are not taxable until you or your beneficiary receive  
them. Taxable payments or distributions include withdrawals from your           
Certificate, surrender of your Certificate and annuity payments from your       
Certificate. Death benefits are also taxable.                                   

Except as discussed below, the amount of any distribution from a Regular IRA    
must be included in your gross income as ordinary income. We report all         
payments from Regular IRA contracts on IRS Form 1099-R as fully taxable.        

If you have ever made nondeductible IRA contributions to any Regular IRA (it    
does not have to be to this particular Regular IRA Certificate), those          
contributions are recovered tax free when you get distributions from any        
Regular IRA. It is your responsibility to keep permanent tax records of all of  
your nondeductible contributions to Regular IRAs so that you can correctly      
report the taxable amount of any distribution on your own tax return. At the    
end of any year in which you have received a distribution from any Regular IRA, 
you compute the nontaxable portion of the distribution as follows:              

o divide (1) your total nondeductible Regular IRA contributions (less any       
amounts previously withdrawn tax free) by (2) the total account balances    
of all Regular IRAs you own at the end of the year plus all Regular IRA     
distributions made during the year;                                         

o multiply this amount by all distributions from the Regular IRA during the     
year.                                                                       

A distribution from a Regular IRA is not taxable if:                            

o the amount received is a withdrawal of excess contributions, as described     
under "Excess Contributions" above;                                         

o the entire amount received is rolled over to another Regular IRA or other     
eligible retirement plan which agrees to accept the funds. (See "Rollovers
from Eligible Retirement Plans other than Regular IRAs" under "Rollover
and Transfer Contributions to Regular IRAs" above.)                         

The following are eligible to receive rollovers of distributions from a Regular 
IRA: a qualified plan, a 403(b) plan or a governmental employer 457(b) plan.    
After-tax contributions in a Regular IRA cannot be rolled from your Regular IRA 
into, or back into, a qualified plan, 403(b) plan or governmental employer      
457(b) plan. Before you decide to roll over a distribution from a Regular IRA   
to another eligible retirement plan, you should check with the administrator of 
that plan about                                                                 

                                                                               9

P-->485BPOS40th "Page" of 141TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 40th
whether the plan accepts rollovers and, if so, the types it accepts. You should 
also check with the administrator of the receiving plan about any documents     
required to be completed before it will accept a rollover.                      

Distributions from a Regular IRA are not eligible for favorable ten-year        
averaging and long-term capital gain treatment available under limited          
circumstances for certain distributions from qualified plans. If you might be   
eligible for such tax treatment from your qualified plan, you may be able to    
preserve such tax treatment even though an eligible rollover from a qualified   
plan is temporarily rolled into a "conduit IRA" before being rolled back into a 
qualified plan. See your tax advisor.                                           

REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS 

Distributions must be made from Regular IRAs according to rules contained in    
the Code and Treasury Regulations. Certain provisions of the Treasury           
Regulations require that the actuarial present value of additional annuity      
contract benefits must be added to the dollar amount credited for purposes of   
calculating certain types of required minimum distributions from individual     
retirement annuity contracts. For this purpose additional annuity contract      
benefits may include, but are not limited to, guaranteed minimum income         
benefits and enhanced death benefits. This could increase the amount required   
to be distributed from these contracts. Currently we believe that these         
provisions would not apply to AXA Equitable 300+ Series certificates because of 
the type of benefits provided under the certificates. However, if you take      
annual withdrawals instead of annuitizing, please consult your tax adviser      
concerning applicability of these complex rules to your situation.              

LIFETIME REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS                                         

You must start taking annual distributions from your Regular IRAs for the year  
in which you turn age 70-1/2.                                                   

WHEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE FIRST LIFETIME REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION          

The first required minimum distribution is for the calendar year in which you   
turn age 70-1/2. You have the choice to take this first required minimum        
distribution during the calendar year you actually reach age 70-1/2, or to      
delay taking it until the first three-month period in the next calendar year    
(January 1 - April 1). Distributions must start no later than your "Required    
Beginning Date," which is April 1st of the calendar year after the calendar     
year in which you turn age 70-1/2. If you choose to delay taking the first      
annual minimum distribution, then you will have to take two minimum             
distributions in that year, the delayed one for the first year and the actual   
one for that year. Once minimum distributions begin, they must be made at some  
time each year.                                                                 

HOW YOU CAN CALCULATE REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS                            

There are two approaches to taking required minimum distributions,              
"account-based" or "annuity-based."                                             

ACCOUNT-BASED METHOD. If you choose an account-based method, you divide the     
value of your Regular IRA as of December 31st of the past calendar year by a    
number corresponding to your age from an IRS table. This gives you the required 
minimum distribution amount for that particular IRA for that year. If your      
spouse is your sole beneficiary and more than 10 years younger than you, the    
dividing number you use may be from another IRS table and may produce a smaller 
lifetime required minimum distribution amount. Regardless of the table used,    
the required minimum distribution amount will vary each year as the account     
value, the actuarial present value of additional annuity contract benefits, if  
applicable, and the divisor change. If you initially choose an account-based    
method, you may later apply your Regular IRA funds to a life annuity-based      
payout with any certain period not exceeding remaining life expectancy,         
determined in accordance with IRS tables.                                       

The IRS will let you figure out the account-based required minimum distribution 
for each Regular IRA that you maintain, using the method that you picked for    
that particular IRA. You can add these required minimum distribution amount     
calculations together. As long as the total amount you take out every year      
satisfies your overall Regular IRA required minimum distribution amount, you    
may choose to take your annual required minimum distribution from any one or    
more Regular IRAs that you own.                                                 

ANNUITY-BASED METHOD. If you choose an "annuity-based" method, you do not have  
to do annual calculations. You apply the account value to an annuity payout for 
your life or the joint lives of you and a designated beneficiary, or for a      
period certain not extending beyond applicable life expectancies, determined in 
accordance with IRS tables.                                                     

WHETHER YOU HAVE TO PICK THE SAME METHOD TO CALCULATE YOUR REQUIRED MINIMUM     
DISTRIBUTIONS FOR ALL OF YOUR REGULAR IRAS AND OTHER RETIREMENT PLANS           

You can choose a different method for each of your Regular IRAs and other       
retirement plans. For example, you can choose an annuity payout from one IRA, a 
different annuity payout from a qualified plan, and an account-based annual     
withdrawal from another IRA.                                                    

IF YOU TAKE MORE THAN YOU NEED TO FOR ANY YEAR                                  

The correct required minimum distribution amount for your Regular IRAs is       
calculated on a year-by-year basis. There are no carry-back or carry-forward    
provisions. Also, you cannot apply required minimum distribution amounts you    
take from your qualified plans to the amounts you have to take from your        
Regular IRAs and vice versa.                                                    

IF YOU TAKE LESS THAN YOU NEED TO FOR ANY YEAR                                  

Your IRA could be disqualified, and you could have to pay tax on the entire     
value. Even if your IRA is not disqualified, you could have to pay a 50%        
penalty tax on the shortfall (required amount for Regular IRAs less amount      
actually taken). It is your responsibility to meet the required minimum         
distribution rules. We will remind you when our records show that you are       
within the age group which must take lifetime required minimum distributions.   
If you do not select a method                                                   

10

with us, we will assume you are taking your required minimum distribution from  
another Regular IRA that you own.                                               

REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION PAYMENTS AFTER YOU DIE 

These could vary depending on whether you die before or after your Required     
Beginning Date for lifetime required minimum distribution payments, and the     
status of your beneficiary. The following assumes that you have not yet elected 
an annuity-based payout at the time of your death. If you elect an              
annuity-based payout, payments (if any) after your death must be made at least  
as rapidly as when you were alive.                                              

INDIVIDUAL BENEFICIARY. Regardless of whether your death occurs before or after 
your Required Beginning Date, an individual death beneficiary calculates annual 
post-death required minimum distribution payments based on the beneficiary's    
life expectancy using the "term certain method." That is, he or she determines  
his or her life expectancy using the IRS-provided life expectancy tables as of  
the calendar year after the owner's death and reduces that number by one each   
subsequent year.                                                                

If you die before your Required Beginning Date, the rules permit any individual 
beneficiary, including a spousal beneficiary, to elect instead to apply the     
"5-year rule." Under this rule, instead of annual payments having to be made    
beginning with the first in the year following the owner's death, the entire    
account must be distributed by the end of the calendar year which contains the  
fifth anniversary of the owner's death. No distribution is required before that 
fifth year.                                                                     

SPOUSAL BENEFICIARY. If you die after your Required Beginning Date, and your    
death beneficiary is your surviving spouse, your spouse has a number of         
choices. Post-death distributions may be made over your spouse's single life    
expectancy. Any amounts distributed after that surviving spouse's death are     
made over the spouse's life expectancy calculated in the year of his/her death, 
reduced by one for each subsequent year. In some circumstances, your surviving  
spouse may elect to become the owner of the Regular IRA and halt distributions  
until he or she reaches age 70-1/2, or roll over amounts from your Regular IRA  
into his/her own Regular IRA or other eligible retirement plan.                 

If you die before your Required Beginning Date, and the death beneficiary is    
your surviving spouse, the rules permit the spouse to delay starting payments   
over his/her life expectancy until the year in which you would have attained    
age 70-1/2.                                                                     

NON-INDIVIDUAL BENEFICIARY. If you die after your Required Beginning Date, and  
your death beneficiary is a non-individual, such as the estate, the rules       
permit the beneficiary to calculate post-death required minimum distribution    
amounts based on the owner's life expectancy in the year of death. However,     
note that we need an individual annuitant to keep an annuity certificate in     
force. If the beneficiary is not an individual, we must distribute amounts      
remaining in the annuity contract after the death of the original participant.  

If you die before your Required Beginning Date and the death beneficiary is a   
non-individual, such as the estate, the rules continue to apply the 5-year rule 
discussed above under "Individual beneficiary." Please note that we need an     
individual annuitant to keep an annuity certificate in force. If the            
beneficiary is not an individual, we must distribute amounts remaining in the   
annuity contract after the death of the original participant.                   

PAYMENTS TO A BENEFICIARY AFTER YOUR DEATH                                      

Regular IRA death benefits are taxed the same as Regular IRA distributions.     

BORROWING AND LOANS ARE PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS                                 

You cannot get loans from a Regular IRA. You cannot use a Regular IRA as        
collateral for a loan or other obligation. If you borrow against your IRA or    
use it as collateral, its tax-favored status will be lost as of the first day   
of the tax year in which this prohibited event occurs. If this happens, you     
must include in federal gross income for that year an amount equal to the fair  
market value of the Regular IRA Certificate as of the first day of that tax     
year, less the amount of any nondeductible contributions not previously         
recovered. Also, the early distribution penalty tax of 10% may apply if you     
have not reached age 59-1/2 before the first day of that tax year.              

EARLY DISTRIBUTION PENALTY TAX 

A penalty tax of 10% of the taxable portion of a distribution applies to        
distributions from a Regular IRA made before you reach age 59-1/2. The extra    
penalty tax does not apply if the distribution is covered by an exception. For  
example, no penalty tax applies to pre-age 59-1/2 distributions made:           

o on or after your death;                                                       

o because you are disabled (special federal income tax definition);             

o used to pay certain extraordinary medical expenses (special federal income    
tax definition);                                                            

o used to pay medical insurance premiums for unemployed individuals (special    
federal income tax definition);                                             

o used to pay certain first-time home buyer expenses (special federal income    
tax definition);                                                            

o used to pay certain higher education expenses (special federal income tax     
definition); or                                                             

o in the form of substantially equal periodic payments made at least annually   
over your life (or your life expectancy), or over the joint lives of you    
and your beneficiary (or your joint life expectancy) using an IRS-approved  
distribution method.                                                        

ROTH INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES (ROTH IRAS)                                

This section of the SAI covers some of the special tax rules that apply to Roth 
IRAs. If the rules are the same as those that apply to Regular IRAs, we will    
refer you to the same topic under "Regular IRAs."                               

                                                                              11

The AXA Equitable 300+ Series Roth IRA Certificate is designed to qualify as a  
Roth individual retirement annuity under Sections 408A(b) and 408(b) of the     
Internal Revenue Code.                                                          

CONTRIBUTIONS TO ROTH IRAS                                                      

Individuals may make four different types of contributions to a Roth IRA:       

o "regular" after-tax contributions out of earnings;                            

o taxable "rollover" contributions from Regular IRAs or other eligible          
retirement plans ("conversion rollover" contributions);                     

o tax-free rollover contributions from other Roth individual retirement         
arrangements; or                                                            

o tax-free direct custodian-to-custodian transfers from other Roth IRAs         
("direct transfers").                                                       

Beginning in 2008, direct rollover contributions may be made from eligible      
retirement plans to Roth IRAs under certain circumstances.                      

REGULAR CONTRIBUTIONS TO ROTH IRAS                                              

Limits on regular contributions. The "maximum regular contribution amount" for  
any taxable year is the most that can be contributed to all of your IRAs        
(Regular and Roth) as regular contributions for the particular taxable year.    
The maximum regular contribution amount depends on age, earnings, and year,     
among other things. Generally, $5,000 is the maximum amount that you may        
contribute to all IRAs (including Roth IRAs). This limit does not apply to      
rollover contributions or direct custodian-to-custodian transfers into a Roth   
IRA. Any contributions to Roth IRAs reduce the ability to contribute to Regular 
IRAs and vice versa. When your earnings are below $5,000, your earned income or 
compensation for the year is the most you can contribute. If you are married    
and file a joint income tax return, you and your spouse may combine your        
compensation to determine the amount of regular contributions you are permitted 
to make to Roth IRAs and Regular IRAs. See the discussion under "Special rules
for spouses"above under Regular IRAs.                                           

If you or your spouse are at least age 50 at any time during the taxable year   
for which you are making a regular contribution, you may be eligible to make    
additional catch-up contributions of up to $1,000.                              

With a Roth IRA, you can make regular contributions when you reach age 70-1/2,  
as long as you have sufficient earnings. But, you cannot make contributions,    
regardless of your age, for any year that your modified adjusted gross income   
exceeds the following amounts (indexed for cost of living adjustment):          

o    your federal income tax filing status is "married filing jointly" and      
  your modified adjusted gross income is over $160,000 (for 2008, $169,000
after adjustment); or                                                 

o    your federal income tax filing status is "single" and your modified        
adjusted gross income is over $110,000 (for 2008, $116,000 after      
adjustment).                                                          

However, you can make regular Roth IRA contributions in reduced amounts when:   

o    your federal income tax filing status is "married filing jointly" and      
   your modified adjusted gross income is between $150,000 and $160,000 (for
2008, between $159,000 and $169,000 after adjustment); or             

o    your federal income tax filing status is "single" and your modified        
  adjusted gross income is between $95,000 and $110,000 (for 2008, between
$101,000 and $116,000 after adjustment).                              

If you are married and filing separately and your modified adjusted gross       
income is between $0 and $10,000 the amount of regular contribution you are     
permitted to make is phased out. If your modified adjusted gross income is more 
than $10,000 you cannot make a regular Roth IRA contribution.                   

WHEN YOU CAN MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS                                                 

Same as Regular IRAs.                                                           

DEDUCTIBILITY OF CONTRIBUTIONS                                                  

Roth IRA contributions are not tax-deductible.                                  

ROLLOVERS AND DIRECT TRANSFERS                                                  

What is the difference between rollover and direct transfer transactions? The   
difference between a rollover transaction and a direct transfer transaction is  
the following: in a rollover transaction you actually take possession of the    
funds rolled over or are considered to have received them under tax law in the  
case of a change from one type of plan to another. In a direct transfer         
transaction, you never take possession of the funds, but direct the first Roth  
IRA custodian, trustee or issuer to transfer the first Roth IRA funds directly  
to the recipient Roth IRA custodian, trustee or issuer. You can make direct     
transfer transactions only between identical plan types (for example, Roth IRA  
to Roth IRA). You can also make rollover transactions between identical plan    
types. However, you can only make rollover transactions between different plan  
types (for example, traditional IRA to Roth IRA).                               

You may make rollover contributions to a Roth IRA from these sources only:      

o    another Roth IRA;                                                          

o    a traditional IRA, including a SEP-IRA or SIMPLE IRA (after a two-year     
   rollover limitation period for SIMPLE IRA funds), in a taxable conversion
rollover ("conversion rollover");                                     

o    a "designated Roth contribution account" under a 401(k) plan or            
a 403(b) plan (direct or 60-day); or                                  

o    from non-Roth accounts under another eligible retirement plan,             
    subject to limits specified below under "Conversion rollover contributions
to Roth IRAs."                                                        

You may make direct transfer contributions to a Roth IRA only from another Roth 
IRA.                                                                            

You may make both Roth IRA to Roth IRA rollover transactions and Roth IRA to    
Roth IRA direct transfer transactions. Both can be accomplished on a completely 
tax-free basis. However, you may make Roth IRA to Roth IRA rollover             
transactions only once in any 12-month period for the same funds.               
Trustee-to-trustee or custodian-to-custodian direct transfers can be made more  
frequently than once a                                                          

12

year. Also, if you send us the rollover contribution to apply it to a Roth IRA, 
you must do so within 60 days after you receive the proceeds from the original  
Roth IRA to get rollover treatment.                                             

The surviving spouse beneficiary of a deceased individual can roll over or      
directly transfer an inherited Roth IRA to one or more other Roth IRAs. In some 
cases, Roth IRAs can be transferred on a tax-free basis between spouses or      
former spouses as a result of a court-ordered divorce or separation decree.     

CONVERSION ROLLOVER CONTRIBUTIONS TO ROTH IRAS 

In a conversion rollover transaction, you withdraw (or are considered to have   
withdrawn) all or a portion of funds from a Regular IRA you maintain and        
convert it to a Roth IRA within 60 days after you receive (or are considered to 
have received) the Regular IRA proceeds. Beginning in 2008 amounts can also be  
rolled over from non-Roth accounts under another eligible retirement plan,      
including a Code Section 401(a) qualified plan, a 403(b) plan, and a            
governmental employer Section 457(b) plan. You must meet AGI limits specified   
below.                                                                          

Unlike a rollover from a Regular IRA to another Regular IRA, a conversion       
rollover transaction from a Regular IRA or other eligible retirement plan to a  
Roth IRA is not tax-free. Instead, the distribution from the Regular IRA or     
other eligible retirement plan is generally fully taxable. In the case of a     
Regular IRA conversion rollover for example, we are required to withhold 10%    
federal income tax from the amount treated as converted unless you properly     
elect out of such withholding. If you are converting all or part of a Regular   
IRA, and you have ever made nondeductible regular contributions to any Regular  
IRA -- whether or not it is the Regular IRA you are converting -- a pro rata    
portion of the distribution is tax free. Even if you are under age 59-1/2, the  
early distribution penalty tax does not apply to conversion rollover            
contributions to a Roth IRA.                                                    

The following rules apply until 2010: You cannot make conversion rollover       
contributions to a Roth IRA for any taxable year in which your modified         
adjusted gross income exceeds $100,000. (For this purpose, your modified        
adjusted gross income is computed without the gross income stemming from the    
conversion rollover. Modified adjusted gross income for this purpose excludes   
any lifetime required minimum distribution from a Regular IRA or other eligible 
retirement plan.) You also cannot make conversion contributions to a Roth IRA   
for any taxable year in which your federal income tax filing status is "married 
filing separately".                                                             

You cannot make conversion contributions to a Roth IRA to the extent that the   
funds in your Regular IRA or other eligible retirement plan are subject to the  
lifetime annual required minimum distribution rules.                            

You cannot convert and reconvert an amount during the same taxable year, or if  
later, during the 30-day period following a recharacterization. If you          
reconvert during either of these periods, it will be a failed Roth IRA          
conversion.                                                                     

The IRS and Treasury have recently issued Proposed and Temporary Treasury       
Regulations addressing the valuation of annuity contracts funding Regular IRAs  
in the conversion to Roth IRAs. Although these Regulations are not clear, they  
could require an individual's gross income on the conversion of a Regular IRA   
to Roth IRA to be measured using various actuarial methods and not as if the    
annuity contract funding the Regular IRA had been surrendered at the time of    
conversion. This could increase the amount reported as includible in certain    
circumstances.                                                                  

RECHARACTERIZATIONS                                                             

You may be able to treat a contribution made to one type of IRA as having been  
made to a different type of IRA. This is called recharacterizing the            
contribution.                                                                   

HOW TO RECHARACTERIZE. To recharacterize a contribution, you generally must     
have the contribution transferred from the first IRA (the one to which it was   
made) to the second IRA in a deemed trustee-to-trustee transfer. If the         
transfer is made by the due date (including extensions) for your tax return for 
the year during which the contribution was made, you can elect to treat the     
contribution as having been originally made to the second IRA instead of to the 
first IRA. It will be treated as having been made to the second IRA on the same 
date that it was actually made to the first IRA. You must report the            
recharacterization, and must treat the contribution as having been made to      
second IRA, instead of the first IRA, on your tax return for the year during    
which the contribution was made.                                                

The contribution will not be treated as having been made to the second IRA      
unless the transfer includes any net income allocable to the contribution. You  
can take into account any loss on the contribution while it was in the IRA when 
calculating the amount that must be transferred. If there was a loss, the net   
income you must transfer may be a negative amount.                              

No deduction is allowed for the contribution to the first IRA and any net       
income transferred with the recharacterized contribution is treated as earned   
in the second IRA. The contribution will not be treated as having been made to  
the second IRA to the extent any deduction was allowed with respect to the      
contribution to the first IRA.                                                  

For recharacterization purposes, a distribution from a Regular IRA that is      
received in one tax year and rolled over into a Roth IRA in the next year, but  
still within 60 days of the distribution from the Regular IRA, is treated as a  
contribution to the Roth IRA in the year of the distribution from the Regular   
IRA.                                                                            

Roth IRA conversion contributions from a SEP-IRA or SIMPLE IRA can be           
recharacterized to a SEP-IRA or SIMPLE IRA (including the original SEP-IRA or   
SIMPLE IRA). You cannot recharacterize back to the original plan a contribution 
directly rolled over from an eligible retirement plan which is not a Regular    
IRA.                                                                            

To recharacterize a contribution, you must provide us appropriate documentation 
and information we require.                                                     

The recharacterization of a contribution is not treated as a rollover for       
purposes of the 12-month limitation period described above. This rule           

                                                                              13

applies even if the contribution would have been treated as a rollover          
contribution by the second IRA if it had been made directly to the second IRA   
rather than as a result of a recharacterization of a contribution to the first  
IRA.                                                                            
WITHDRAWALS, PAYMENTS AND TRANSFERS OF FUNDS OUT OF ROTH IRAS                   

You can withdraw any or all of your funds from a Roth IRA at any time without   
restriction. You do not need to wait for a special event like retirement.       

DISTRIBUTIONS FROM ROTH IRAS                                                    

Distributions include withdrawals from your Certificate, surrender of your      
Certificate and annuity payments from your Certificate. Death benefits are also 
distributions.                                                                  

You must keep your own records of regular and conversion contributions to all   
Roth IRAs to assure appropriate taxation. You may have to file information on   
your contributions to and distributions from any Roth IRA on your tax return.   
You may have to retain all income tax returns and records pertaining to such    
contributions and distributions until your interests in all Roth IRAs are       
distributed.                                                                    

Like Regular IRAs, taxable distributions from a Roth IRA are not eligible for   
favorable ten-year averaging and long-term capital gain treatment available in  
limited cases for certain distributions from qualified plans.                   

The following distributions from Roth IRAs are free of income tax:              

o rollovers from a Roth IRA to another Roth IRA;                                

o direct transfers from a Roth IRA to another Roth IRA;                         

o qualified distributions from Roth IRAs; and                                   

o return of excess contributions or amounts recharacterized to a Regular IRA.   

QUALIFIED DISTRIBUTIONS FROM ROTH IRAS                                          

Qualified distributions from Roth IRAs made because of one of the following     
four qualifying events or reasons are not includable in income:                 

o you are age 59-1/2 or older;                                                  

o you die;                                                                      

o you become disabled (special federal income tax definition); or               

o your distribution is a "qualified first-time homebuyer distribution" (special 
federal income tax definition; $10,000 lifetime total limit for these       
distributions from all of your Regular and Roth IRAs).                      

You also have to meet a five-year aging period. A qualified distribution is any 
distribution made after the five-taxable-year period beginning with the first   
taxable year for which you made any contribution to any Roth IRA (whether or    
not the one from which the distribution is being made).                         

NONQUALIFIED DISTRIBUTIONS FROM ROTH IRAS                                       

Non-qualified distributions from Roth IRAs are distributions that do not meet   
both the qualifying event and five-year aging period tests described above. If  
you receive such a distribution, part of it may be taxable. For purposes of     
determining the correct tax treatment of distributions (other than the          
withdrawal of excess contributions and the earnings on them) there is a set     
order in which contributions (including conversion contributions) and earnings  
are considered to be distributed from your Roth IRA. The order of distributions 
is as follows:                                                                  

(1)    Regular contributions.                                                   

(2)    Conversion contributions, on a first-in-first-out basis (generally,      
total conversions from the earliest year first). These conversion 
contributions are taken into account as follows:                  

(a)   Taxable portion (the amount required to be included in      
 gross income because of conversion) first, and then the

(b)   Nontaxable portion.                                         

(3)    Earnings on contributions.                                               

Rollover contributions from other Roth IRAs are disregarded for this purpose.   

To determine the taxable amount distributed, distributions and contributions    
are aggregated or grouped together as follows:                                  

(1)    All distributions made during the year from all Roth IRAs you            
maintain--with any custodian or issuer--are added together.       

(2)    All regular contributions made during and for the year (contri           
  butions made after the close of the year, but before the due date of
your return) are added together. This total is added to the total 
undistributed regular contributions made in prior years.          

(3)    All conversion contributions made during the year are added              
together. For purposes of the ordering rules, in the case of any  
     conversion in which the conversion distribution is made in 2008 and the
     conversion contribution is made in 2009, the conversion contribution is
    treated as contributed prior to other conversion contributions made in
2009.                                                             

Any recharacterized contributions that end up in a Roth IRA are added to the    
appropriate contribution group for the year that the original contribution      
would have been taken into account if it had been made directly to the Roth     
IRA.                                                                            

Any recharacterized contribution that ends up in an IRA other than a Roth IRA   
is disregarded for the purpose of grouping both contributions and               
distributions. Any amount withdrawn to correct an excess contribution           
(including the earnings withdrawn) is also disregarded for this purpose.        

REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS DURING LIFE                                      

Lifetime required minimum distributions do not apply.                           

REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS AT DEATH                                         

Same as Regular IRA under "Required minimum distribution payments after you
die", assuming death before the Required Beginning Date.                        

PAYMENTS TO A BENEFICIARY AFTER YOUR DEATH                                      

Distributions to a beneficiary generally receive the same tax treatment as if   
the distribution had been to you.                                               

14

BORROWING AND LOANS ARE PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS                                 

You cannot get loans from a Roth IRA. You cannot use a Roth IRA as collateral   
for a loan or other obligation. If you borrow against your Roth IRA or use it   
as collateral, its tax-favored status will be lost as of the first day of the   
tax year in which this prohibited event occurs. If this happens, you must       
include in federal gross income for that year an amount equal to the fair       
market value of the Roth IRA Certificate as of the first day of that tax year,  
less the amount of any nondeductible contributions not previously recovered.    
Also, the early distribution penalty tax of 10% may apply if you have not       
reached age 59-1/2 before the first day of that tax year.                       

EXCESS CONTRIBUTIONS 

Excess contributions to Roth IRAs are subject to a 6% excise tax for the year   
in which made and for each year after until withdrawn. The following are excess 
contributions to Roth IRAs:                                                     

o "regular" contributions of more than the maximum regular contribution amount  
for the applicable taxable year; or                                         

o rollover contributions of amounts that are not eligible to be rolled over     
(for example, conversion rollovers from a Regular IRA for individuals with  
modified adjusted gross income in excess of $100,000 in the conversion      
year.)                                                                      

You can withdraw or recharacterize any contribution to a Roth IRA before the    
due date (including extensions) for filing your federal income tax return for   
the tax year. If you do this, you must also withdraw or recharacterize any      
earnings attributable to the contribution.                                      

EARLY DISTRIBUTION PENALTY TAX 

A penalty tax of 10% of the taxable portion of a distribution applies to        
distributions from a Roth IRA made before you reach age 59-1/2. The extra       
penalty tax does not apply if the distribution is covered by an exception. For  
example, no penalty tax applies to pre-age 59-1/2 distributions made:           

o on or after your death;                                                       

o because you are disabled (special federal income tax definition);             

o used to pay certain extraordinary medical expenses (special federal income    
tax definition);                                                            

o used to pay medical insurance premiums for unemployed individuals (special    
federal income tax definition);                                             

o used to pay certain first-time home buyer expenses (special federal income    
tax definition);                                                            

o used to pay certain higher education expenses (special federal income tax     
definition); or                                                             

o in the form of substantially equal periodic payments made at least annually   
over your life (or your life expectancy), or over the joint lives of you    
and your beneficiary (or your joint life expectancy) using an IRS-approved  
distribution method.                                                        

IRAS UNDER SIMPLIFIED EMPLOYEE PENSION PLANS (SEP)                              

When an employer establishes a SEP for its employees, it can contribute to a    
Regular IRA certificate for each eligible employee. The employee may also       
contribute to that SEP certificate. A SEP-IRA Certificate is a form of Regular  
IRA Certificate, owned by the employee-participant and most of the rules        
applicable to Regular IRAs discussed above apply. A major difference is the     
amount of permissible contributions. For 2008, an employer can annually         
contribute an amount for an employee up to the lesser of $46,000 or 25% of      
compensation. This amount may be further adjusted for cost of living changes in 
future years. The employer must contribute for each employee who has reached    
age 21 and has worked for the employer during at least three of the preceding   
five years. The employer does not have to contribute for employees who (1) earn 
less than $500, (2) are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or (3) are 
non-resident aliens who receive no earned income from sources within the United 
States.                                                                         

Employers make their contributions under a written program that provides for    
(1) withdrawals, (2) contributions under an allocation formula, and (3)         
contributions that bear a uniform relationship to actual compensation, not      
greater than $230,000 in 2008. Contributions cannot discriminate in favor of    
highly compensated employees. An employer may integrate contributions to the    
SEP with Social Security. Call our toll-free number for assistance.             

SIMPLE IRAS 

An eligible employer may establish a "SIMPLE" plan to make contributions to     
special individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities for   
its employees ("SIMPLE IRAs"). A SIMPLE IRA is a form of Regular IRA owned by   
the employee. Generally, the rules applicable to Regular IRAs, discussed above, 
apply. There are differences in the amount and type of permissible              
contributions. Also, employees who have not participated in the employer's      
SIMPLE IRA plan for at least two full years may be subject to an increased      
penalty tax on withdrawals of SIMPLE IRA funds.                                 

The employer cannot maintain any other qualified plan, SEP or TSA arrangement   
if it makes contributions under a SIMPLE IRA plan. (Eligible tax-exempt entity  
employers may maintain EDC plans under Section 457 of the Code.)                

An employer establishing a SIMPLE plan should consult its tax advisor           
concerning the various technical rules applicable to establishing and           
maintaining SIMPLE IRA plans. For example, the definition of employee's         
"compensation" varies depending on whether it appears in the context of         
employer eligibility, employee participation, and employee or employer          
contributions.                                                                  

Participation must be open to all employees who (1) received at least $5,000 in 
compensation from the employer in any two preceding years (they do not have to  
be consecutive years) and (2) are reasonably                                    

                                                                              15

P-->485BPOS46th "Page" of 141TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 46th
expected to receive at least $5,000 in compensation during the year. (Certain   
collective bargaining unit and alien employees may be excluded.)                

The only permitted contributions to a SIMPLE IRA are (1) contributions under a  
salary reduction agreement entered into between the employer and the            
participating employee and (2) required employer contributions (employer        
matching contributions or employer nonelective contributions). (Direct transfer 
and rollover contributions from other SIMPLE IRAs, but not Regular IRAs, may    
also be made.) Salary reduction contributions can be any percentage of          
compensation (or a specific dollar amount, if the employer's plan permits) but  
are limited to $10,500 in 2008. This limit may further be adjusted for cost of  
living changes in future years.                                                 

If the plan permits, an individual at least age 50 at any time during 2008 can  
make up to $2,500 additional salary reduction contributions for 2008.           

Generally, the employer is required to make matching contributions on behalf of 
each eligible employee in an amount equal to the salary reduction               
contributions, up to 3% of the employee's compensation. In certain              
circumstances, an employer may elect to make required employer contributions on 
an alternate basis. Employer matching contributions to a SIMPLE IRA for         
self-employed individuals are treated the same as matching contributions for    
employees. (They are not subject to the elective deferral limits.)              

Amounts contributed to SIMPLE IRAs are not currently taxable to employees. Only 
the employer can deduct SIMPLE IRA contributions, not the employee. An employee 
eligible to participate in a SIMPLE IRA is an active participant in an employer 
plan and thus may not be able to deduct all or a portion of regular             
contributions to his/her own IRA.                                               

As with Regular IRAs in general, contributions and earnings accumulate tax      
deferred until withdrawn and are then fully taxable. There are no withdrawal    
restrictions applicable to SIMPLE IRAs. However, because of the level of        
employer involvement, SIMPLE IRA plans are subject to ERISA. See "ERISA
Matters" below. The same 10% penalty on taxable early withdrawals that applies  
to Regular IRAs applies to SIMPLE IRAs, subject to the same exceptions for      
death, disability and attainment of age 59-1/2. For employees who have not      
participated in the employer's SIMPLE IRA for two full years, that penalty is   
25%.                                                                            

Amounts withdrawn from a SIMPLE IRA can be rolled over to another SIMPLE IRA,   
to a Regular IRA or a Roth IRA (if under the conversion rollover rules          
discussed above). No rollovers from a SIMPLE IRA to any other type of IRA are   
permitted for individuals under age 59-1/2 who have not participated in the     
employer's SIMPLE IRA plan for two full years. For such employees, any amounts  
withdrawn from a SIMPLE IRA are taxable and subject to a 25% additional tax     
penalty with the exceptions noted in the preceding paragraph.                   

FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING AND INFORMATION REPORTING 

We must withhold federal income tax from distributions from annuity contracts.  
You may be able to elect out of this income tax withholding in some cases.      
Generally, we do not have to withhold if your distributions are not taxable.    
The rate of withholding will depend on the type of distribution and, in certain 
cases, the amount of your distribution. Any income tax withheld is a credit     
against your income tax liability. If you do not have sufficient income tax     
withheld or do not make sufficient estimated income tax payments, you may incur 
penalties under the estimated income tax rules.                                 

You must file your request not to withhold in writing before the payment or     
distribution is made. Our Processing Office will provide forms for this         
purpose. You cannot elect out of withholding unless you provide us with your    
correct Taxpayer Identification Number and a United States residence address.   
You cannot elect out of withholding if we are sending the payment out of the    
United States.                                                                  

You should note the following special situations:                               

o We might have to withhold and/or report on amounts we pay under a free look   
or cancellation.                                                            

o We are generally required to withhold on conversion rollovers of Regular IRAs 
to Roth IRAs, as the deemed withdrawal from the Regular IRA is taxable.     

o We may be required to withhold on the gross amount of a distribution from a   
Roth IRA to the extent it is reasonable for us to believe that a            
distribution is includable in your gross income. This may result in tax     
being withheld even though the Roth IRA distribution is ultimately not      
taxable. You can elect out of withholding as described below.               

Special withholding rules apply to foreign recipients and United States         
citizens residing outside the United States. We do not discuss these rules here 
in detail. However, we may require additional documentation in the case of      
payments made to non-United States persons and United States persons living     
abroad prior to processing any requested transaction.                           

Certain states have indicated that state income tax withholding will also apply 
to payments from the Certificates made to residents. In some states, you may    
elect out of state withholding, even if federal withholding applies. Generally, 
we will consider an election out of federal withholding to be an election out   
of state withholding. If you need more information concerning a particular      
state or any required forms, call our Processing Office at the toll-free        
number.                                                                         

FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING ON PERIODIC ANNUITY PAYMENTS                     

We withhold differently on "periodic" and "non-periodic" payments. For a        
periodic annuity payment, for example, unless you specify a different number of 
withholding exemptions, we withhold assuming that you are married and claiming  
three withholding exemptions. If you do not give us your correct Taxpayer       
Identification Number, we withhold as if you are single with no exemptions.     

Based on the assumption that you are married and claiming three withholding     
exemptions, if you receive less than $18,720 in periodic annuity payments in    
2008 your payments will generally be exempt from federal income tax             
withholding. You could specify a different                                      

16

choice of withholding exemption or request that we withhold tax. Your           
withholding election remains effective unless and until you revoke it. You may  
revoke or change your withholding election at any time.                         

FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING ON NON-PERIODIC ANNUITY PAYMENTS (WITHDRAWALS)   

For a non-periodic distribution (total surrender or partial withdrawal), we     
withhold generally at a flat 10% rate. We apply that rate to the taxable amount 
in the case of nonqualified Certificates, and to the payment amount in the case 
of Regular IRAs (and Roth IRAs, where it is reasonable to assume an amount is   
includible in gross income).                                                    

You cannot elect out of withholding if the payment is an "eligible rollover     
distribution" from a TSA. If a non-periodic distribution from a TSA is not an   
"eligible rollover distribution" then the 10% withholding rate applies.         

MANDATORY WITHHOLDING FROM TSAS                                                 

Unless the distribution is directly rolled over to another eligible retirement  
plan, eligible rollover distributions from TSAs are subject to mandatory 20%    
withholding. An eligible rollover distribution from a TSA can be rolled over to 
another eligible retirement plan. All distributions from a TSA are eligible     
rollover distributions unless they are on the following list of exceptions:     

o any distributions that are "required minimum distributions" after age 70-1/2  
or retirement from service with the employer;                               

o substantially equal periodic payments made at least annually for the life (or 
life expectancy) or the joint lives (or joint life expectancy) of the plan  
participant (and designated beneficiary);                                   

o substantially equal periodic payments made for a specified period of 10 years 
or more;                                                                    

o hardship withdrawals;                                                         

o corrective distributions which fit specified technical tax rules;             

o a death benefit payment to a beneficiary who is not the plan participant's    
surviving spouse; and                                                       

o a qualified domestic relations order distribution to a beneficiary who is not 
the plan participant's current spouse or former spouse.                     

A death benefit payment to the plan participant's surviving spouse, or a        
qualified domestic relations order distribution to the plan participant's       
current or former spouse, may be a distribution subject to a mandatory 20%      
withholding.                                                                    

ERISA MATTERS 

Certain TSAs and SIMPLE IRAs may be subject to some or all rules applicable to  
ERISA plans. For TSAs subject to ERISA (but not SIMPLE IRAs), you need spousal  
consent to make a withdrawal or other distribution under the Certificate. In    
addition, unless you and your spouse elect otherwise, the retirement benefits   
payable under the plan or arrangement must be in the form of a qualified joint  
and survivor annuity ("QJSA"). A QJSA is an annuity payable for your life, with 
a survivor annuity for the life of your spouse. The amount payable to your      
spouse must be at least one-half of the amount payable to you during your       
lifetime. In addition, your beneficiary must be your spouse, unless your spouse 
consents in writing to the designation of a different beneficiary.              

Section 404(c) of ERISA and the related DOL regulation excuses a plan fiduciary 
from liability for investment losses due to your investment decisions. Thus, in 
situations to which Section 404(c) and the related DOL regulation apply, you    
can make and you are responsible for the results of your own investment         
decisions. Section 404(c) plans must provide, among other things that a broad   
range of investment choices are available to plan participants and              
beneficiaries and must provide such plan participants and beneficiaries with    
enough information to make informed investment decisions. Compliance with the   
Section 404(c) regulation is completely voluntary by the plan sponsor. The AXA  
Equitable 300+ Series TSA and SIMPLE IRA programs provide the broad range of    
investment choices and information needed in order to meet the requirements of  
the Section 404(c) regulation. If the plan is intended to be a Section 404(c)   
plan, it is, however, the plan sponsor's responsibility to see that the         
requirements of the DOL regulation are met. AXA Equitable will not be           
responsible if a plan fails to meet the requirements of Section 404(c).         

IMPACT OF TAXES TO AXA EQUITABLE                                                

The Certificates provide that we may charge Separate Account No. 301 for taxes. 
We do not now, but may in the future set up reserves for such taxes.            

THE GUARANTEED RATE ACCOUNTS 
Contributions to a Guaranteed Rate Account, or GRA, become part of our general  
account, which supports all of our insurance and annuity guarantees as well as  
our general obligations.                                                        

GUARANTEES                                                                      

We credit contributions to a GRA with interest at a fixed rate for each         
guarantee period. We guarantee the amount of the contribution (before deduction 
of any applicable participant service charge). The effective annual guaranteed  
interest rate will always be at least 3%.                                       

Currently, we offer GRAs with new one-year and three-year guarantee periods     
each calendar quarter. We express the fixed interest rate as an effective       
annual interest rate, and apply it to contributions made throughout the         
calendar quarter, or "open period," for each guarantee period. We may close a   
guarantee period offered during an open period. In that case, we may offer a    
new guaranteed rate for the same guarantee period for the remainder of the open 
period.                                                                         

We reserve the right to close a guarantee period being offered at any time      
based on market conditions. Subsequent interest rate changes will not affect    
contributions made during the open period. All guarantee periods of the same    
duration that are opened during an open period mature on the same day. After    
the last day of the open period we will apply no further contributions to those 
guarantee periods. In accordance with instructions, we will allocate            
contributions to guarantee periods during the next open period at the new       
interest rates for                                                              

                                                                              17

that subsequent open period. You may obtain the new guaranteed rates by calling 
us at the number listed on the front of this SAI.                               

CONTRIBUTIONS                                                                   

We credit contributions to a GRA until maturity of a guarantee period with the  
interest rate in effect on the date of receipt. We express the rate as an       
effective annual rate, reflecting daily compounding and the deduction of the    
participant service charge.                                                     

Your written request for a change in the percentage of contributions that you   
allocate to a GRA guarantee period becomes effective on the date that we        
receive it. Alternatively, you may make allocation or contribution instructions 
by telephone through AIMS.                                                      

WITHDRAWALS AND TRANSFERS                                                       

Amounts in the GRAs will be withdrawn or transferred on a last-in, first-out    
basis, unless you specify otherwise. Amounts withdrawn or transferred may be    
subject to a withdrawal charge, where applicable as discussed under "Charges    
and Expenses" in the prospectus. We will deduct the withdrawal charge from (1)  
the remaining amounts in your guarantee period after we process the withdrawal  
or transfer payment, or (2) the amount you withdrew or transferred if remaining 
amounts are insufficient.                                                       

EXAMPLE OF WITHDRAWAL CHARGE                                                    

You contribute $2,000 to a GRA on January 1, allocating the contribution to a   
three-year guarantee period with a guaranteed interest rate of 4%. On December  
31, you make a premature withdrawal of $1,000 from that GRA guarantee period.   
The maximum participant service charge applicable is $30 per year ($7.50 per    
quarter). We will calculate the withdrawal charge as follows:

HOW WE DETERMINE UNIT VALUES                                                    

Unit values for the Funds are determined at the end of each Business Day.       

The unit value of any Fund for any Business Day is equal to the unit value for  
the preceding business day multiplied by the "net investment factor" for that   
Fund on that Business Day.                                                      

A net investment factor for each Fund is determined every Business Day as       
follows:                                                                        

o First, we take the value of the shares held by the Fund in the corresponding  
Portfolio of the Trusts, at the close of business that day (before giving   
effect to any amounts allocated to or withdrawn from the Fund for that      
day). For this purpose, we use the share value reported to us by the        
Portfolio.                                                                  

o Then, we divide this amount by the value of the amounts in the Fund at the    
close of business on the preceding Business Day (after giving effect to     
any amounts allocated or withdrawn for that day).                           

o Finally, we subtract any daily charge for fees or expenses payable by the     
Fund.                                                                       

ILLUSTRATION OF CHANGES IN UNIT VALUES                                          

Generally, if on a particular Business Day investment income and realized and   
unrealized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized capital losses and any  
expense charges, the unit value would be greater than the value for the         
previous period.                                                                

For example, assume that at the close of trading on a Monday, the value of a    
Fund's assets is $2,500,000, and the unit value is $10. If on the next Business 
Day, Tuesday, the investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains   
exceed realized and unrealized losses by $7,500, and the daily accrual for      
expenses charged to the Trust is $50, the unit value for that day would be      
calculated as follows:                                                          

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.   Unit value for Monday .................................   $         10     
2.   Value of assets at close of business on Monday ........   $  2,500,000     
3.   Excess of investment income and realized and                               
unrealized capital gains over realized and                        
  unrealized losses ...................................   $      7,500
4.   Daily accrual for expenses (administration charges                         
and certain expenses borne directly by the

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors of                                                    
AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company                                            
and Contractowners of Separate Account No. 301                                  
of AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company:                                        

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities and the   
related statements of operations and of changes in net assets present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of each of the separate Variable  
Investment Options, as listed in Note 1 to such financial statements, of AXA    
Equitable Life Insurance Company ("AXA Equitable") Separate Account No. 301 at  
December 31, 2007, and the results of each of their operations and the changes  
in each of their net assets for each of the periods indicated therein, in       
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements are the responsibility of AXA Equitable's   
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial      
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial      
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting    
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and       
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial    
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates  
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of investments in The   
Trusts at December 31, 2007 by correspondence with the transfer agent of The    
Trusts, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

AXA EQUITABLE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY 
SEPARATE ACCOUNT NO. 301                                                        

Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2007                                                               

1.    Organization                                                              

AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (formerly The Equitable Life   
      Assurance Society of the United States) ("AXA Equitable") Separate Account
      No. 301 ("the Account") is organized as a unit investment trust, a type of
  investment company, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940
     Act"). The Account invests in shares of mutual funds of EQ Advisors Trust
   ("EQAT") and AXA Premier VIP Trust ("VIP") (collectively "The Trusts").
      The Trusts are open-ended diversified management investment companies that
 sell shares of a portfolio ("Portfolio") of a mutual fund to separate
      accounts of insurance companies. Each Portfolio of The Trusts has separate
    investment objectives. These financial statements and notes are those of
the Account.                                                        

The Account has 14 variable investment funds ("Funds"):

(1)   Formerly known as EQ/Mercury International Value              
(2)   Formerly known as EQ/MFS Emerging Growth Companies            
(3)   Formerly known as AXA Premier VIP                             

     Under applicable insurance law, the assets and liabilities of the Account
      are clearly identified and distinguished from AXA Equitable's other assets
     and liabilities. All Contracts are issued by AXA Equitable. The assets of
      the Account are the property of AXA Equitable. However, the portion of the
      Account's assets attributable to the Contracts will not be chargeable with
    liabilities arising out of any other business AXA Equitable may conduct.

      The Account is used to fund benefits under certain group annuity contracts
   and certificates ("Contracts") in connection with individual retirement
annuities and tax-sheltered annuity arrangements.                   

2.    Significant Accounting Policies                                           

 The accompanying financial statements are prepared in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
   (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
   reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
  assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
  reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.                   

    On September 15, 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
      Standard No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS No. 157"). SFAS No. 157
   establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a
   framework for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures
     about fair value measurements. It applies only to fair value measurements
      that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards. SFAS
 No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. AXA Equitable does not anticipate any
impact to the net assets of the Account, upon adoption.             

 Investments are made in shares of the Trust and are valued at the net
    asset values per share of the respective Portfolios. The net asset value
is determined by the Trust using the market or fair value of the    
underlying assets of the Portfolio less liabilities.                

  Investment transactions are recorded by the Account on the trade date.
Dividends and distributions of capital gains from the Trusts are    
automatically reinvested on the ex-dividend date. Realized gains and
losses include (1) gains and losses on redemptions of Trust shares  
 (determined on the identified cost basis) and (2) Trust distributions
 representing the net realized gains on Trust investment transactions.

    Receivable/payable for policy-related transactions represent amounts due
      to/from AXA Equitable's General Account predominately related to premiums,
surrenders and death benefits.                                      

     Payments received from contractowners represent participant contributions
     under the Contracts (but exclude amounts allocated to the guaranteed rate
   account, refiected in the General Account). Contractowners may allocate
amounts in their individual accounts to variable

Notes to Financial Statements (Continued)                                       

December 31, 2007                                                               

2.    Significant Accounting Policies (Concluded)                               

      investment funds, and/or to the guaranteed rate account of AXA Equitable's
  General Account. Transfers between funds including the guaranteed rate
  account, net, represents amounts that participants have directed to be
     moved among investment options, including permitted transfers to and from
  the guaranteed rate account. The net assets of any variable investment
 fund may not be less than the aggregate of the Contractowner accounts
 allocated to that variable investment fund. Additional assets are set
aside in AXA Equitable's General Account to provide for other policy
 benefits, as required by state insurance law. AXA Equitable's General
Account is subject to creditor rights.                              

Transfers for contract benefits and terminations are payments to    
    participants and beneficiaries made under the terms of the Contracts and
      amounts that participants have requested to be withdrawn and paid to them.
Included in Contract maintenance charges are administrative charges 
deducted quarterly under the Contracts.                             

The operations of the Account are included in the federal income tax
    return of AXA Equitable which is taxed as a life insurance company under
    the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. No federal income tax based
on net income or realized and unrealized capital gains is currently 
applicable to Contracts participating in the Account by reason of   
    applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and no federal income
tax payable by AXA Equitable is expected to affect the unit value of
 Contracts participating in the Account. Accordingly, no provision for
 income taxes is required. However, AXA Equitable retains the right to
     charge for any federal income tax which is attributable to the Account if
the law is changed.                                                 

3.    Purchases and Sales of Investments                                        

     The cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments for the year
ended December 31, 2007 were as follows:

    The assets in each Fund are invested in shares of a corresponding mutual
 fund portfolio of The Trusts. Shares are offered by The Trusts at net
     asset value. Shares in which the variable investment options are invested
  are in either one of two classes. Both classes are subject to fees for
     investment management and advisory services and other Trust expenses. One
  class of shares ("Class A shares") is not subject to distribution fees
      imposed pursuant to a distribution plan. The other class of shares ("Class
    B shares") are subject to distribution fees imposed under a distribution
    plan (herein, the "Rule 12b-1 Plans"). The Rule 12b-1 Plans provide that
    The Trusts, on behalf of each Portfolio, may charge annually up to 0.25%
 of the average daily net assets of a Fund attributable to its Class B
    shares in respect to activities primarily intended to result in the sale
     of Class B shares. These fees are reflected in the net asset value of the
shares.                                                             

AXA Equitable serves as investment manager of The Trusts and as such
receives management fees for services performed in its capacity as  
      investment manager of The Trusts. AXA Equitable oversees the activities of
     the investment advisors with respect to The Trusts and is responsible for
     retaining or discontinuing the services of those advisors. Fees generally
      vary depending on net asset levels of individual portfolios and range from
a low of 0.10% to a high of 1.20% of average daily net assets. AXA  
  Equitable as investment manager pays expenses for providing investment
      advisory services to the Portfolios, including the fees of the advisors of
  each Portfolio. In addition AXA Advisors LLC, ("AXA Advisors") and AXA
     Distributors, LLC ("Distributors"), affiliates of AXA Equitable, may also
receive distribution fees under Rule 12b-1 Plans as described above.

6.    Contractowners Charges                                                    

 The following charges are made directly against the net assets of the
    Account and are reflected daily in the computation of the unit values of
the Contracts:                                                      

      o     Administrative fees are charged at an effective annual rate of 0.25%
of the net assets of each Fund.                         
      o     Direct operating expenses are paid to cover expenses attributable to
      the operations of each Fund. Direct operating expenses include
charges for auditing, printing and mailing expenses.    

Under the Contracts, AXA Equitable reimburses EQ/Money Market,      
EQ/AllianceBernstein Common Stock, EQ/AllianceBernstein Intermediate
    Government Securities, and AXA Moderate Allocation for the excess of the
      aggregate expense charges of each Fund (including investment advisory fees
and certain other Trust expenses attributable to assets of such Fund
   invested in a Portfolio of the Trust and the asset-based charges of the
   Fund, as described above) which during any calendar year exceed 1.5% of
the average daily net assets of EQ/AllianceBernstein Common Stock,  
 EQ/AllianceBernstein Intermediate Government Securities, AXA Moderate
Allocation, and 1.0% of EQ/Money Market. In addition, AXA Equitable 
   voluntarily reimburses Multimanager High Yield, Multimanager Aggressive
    Equity, and EQ/AllianceBernstein International for aggregate expenses in
 excess of 1.5% of each Fund's average daily net assets. The voluntary
      expense limitation may be discontinued by AXA Equitable at its discretion.
The above expense reimbursement is disclosed in the Statements of   
Operations as Reduction for expense limitation.                     

     If the annual amount of management fees applicable to the EQ/Money Market
     Portfolio and the EQ/AllianceBernstein Intermediate Government Securities
  Portfolio exceeds 0.35% of the average daily net asset value of either
     Portfolio, AXA Equitable will reimburse the related Fund for such excess.
This expense limitation is a contractual right for Participants who 
      enrolled prior to May 1, 1987 and cannot be changed without the consent of
   those Participants. AXA Equitable has voluntarily agreed to impose this
  expense limitation for Participants who enrolled after May 1, 1987 and
reserves the right to discontinue this at any time. Any such        
  reimbursements are reflected in the net unit value of the Fund and are
included in the Statements of Operations as a Reduction for expense 
limitation.                                                         

      A quarterly Participant Service Charge is made for each participant at the
end of each calendar quarter before retirement benefits begin.      
    Participant's unit balances are reduced and proceeds are credited to AXA
   Equitable in payment of the participant's service charge which will not
exceed $30 per year.

Shown below is the Investment Income ratio throughout the periods indicated.
These amounts represent the dividends, excluding distributions of capital   
gains, received by the Account from the underlying mutual fund, net of trust
fees and expenses, divided by the average net assets. These ratios exclude  
  those expenses, such as asset charges, that result in direct reductions in the
unit values. The recognition of investment income by the Account is affected
 by the timing of the declaration of dividends by the underlying fund in which
the Account invests.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of                                    
AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company                                            

In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of other auditors, the      
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements
of earnings, of shareholder's equity and comprehensive income and of cash flows 
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AXA         
Equitable Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at        
December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash  
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in      
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's     
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial      
statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of    
AllianceBernstein L.P. and AllianceBernstein Holding L.P., subsidiaries of the  
Company, for the year ended December 31, 2005, whose statements reflect total   
revenues of thirty-six percent of the related consolidated total for the year   
ended December 31, 2005. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose  
reports thereon have been furnished to us, and our opinion expressed herein,    
insofar as it relates to the amounts included for AllianceBernstein L.P. and    
AllianceBernstein Holding L.P., is based solely on the reports of the other     
auditors. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the    
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).     
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material           
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the          
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and    
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our    
audits and the reports of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our     
opinion.                                                                        

As discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the   
Company changed its method of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on     
January 1, 2007, share-based compensation on January 1, 2006 and for defined    
benefit pension and other postretirement plans on December 31, 2006.

AXA EQUITABLE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1)      ORGANIZATION                                                            
AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company ("AXA Equitable," and collectively
        with its consolidated subsidiaries the "Company") is an indirect, wholly
owned subsidiary of AXA Financial, Inc. ("AXA Financial," and   
        collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries, "AXA Financial Group").
   AXA Financial is a wholly owned subsidiary of AXA, a French holding
     company for an international group of insurance and related financial
services companies.                                             

       The Company conducts operations in two business segments: the Insurance
      and Investment Management segments. The Company's management evaluates
     the performance of each of these segments independently and allocates
   resources based on current and future requirements of each segment.

Insurance                                                       
---------                                                       

   The Insurance segment offers a variety of traditional, variable and
       interest-sensitive life insurance products, variable and fixed-interest
      annuity products, mutual funds and other investment products and asset
management principally to individuals and small and medium size 
businesses and professional and trade associations. This segment
includes Separate Accounts for individual insurance and annuity 
products.                                                       

The Company's insurance business is conducted principally by AXA
      Equitable and its wholly owned life insurance subsidiary, AXA Life and
 Annuity Company ("AXA Life"), formerly The Equitable of Colorado.

Investment Management                                           
---------------------                                           

 The Investment Management segment is principally comprised of the
    investment management business of AllianceBernstein L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership, and its subsidiaries ("AllianceBernstein").
      AllianceBernstein provides research, diversified investment management
        and related services globally to a broad range of clients. Its principal
  services include: (a) institutional investment services, including
   unaffiliated corporate and public employee pension funds, endowment
     funds, domestic and foreign institutions and governments, by means of
   separately managed accounts, sub-advisory relationships, structured
       products, group trusts, mutual funds and other investment vehicles, (b)
    retail, servicing individual investors, primarily by means of retail
   mutual funds, sub-advisory relationships in respect of mutual funds
        sponsored by third parties, separately managed account programs that are
  sponsored by various financial intermediaries worldwide, and other
  investment vehicles, (c) private clients, including high-net-worth
      individuals, trusts and estates, charitable foundations, partnerships,
private and family corporations and other entities, by means of 
 separately managed accounts, hedge funds, mutual funds, and other
        investment vehicles, and (d) institutional research by means of in-depth
independent, fundamental research, portfolio strategy and       
       brokerage-related services. Principal subsidiaries of AllianceBernstein
include: SCB Inc., formally known as Sanford C. Bernstein, Inc. 
     ("Bernstein"), Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC ("SCB LLC"), Sanford C.
        Bernstein Limited ("SCBL") and SCB Partners, Inc. ("SCB Partners"). This
       segment includes institutional Separate Accounts principally managed by
   AllianceBernstein that provide various investment options for large
        group pension clients, primarily defined benefit and contribution plans,
through pooled or single group accounts.                        

 AllianceBernstein is a private partnership for Federal income tax
        purposes and, accordingly, is not subject to Federal and state corporate
      income taxes. However, AllianceBernstein is subject to a 4.0% New York
City unincorporated business tax ("UBT"). Domestic corporate    
   subsidiaries of AllianceBernstein are subject to Federal, state and
        local income taxes. Foreign corporate subsidiaries are generally subject
to taxes in the foreign jurisdictions where they are located.   

    In October 2000, AllianceBernstein acquired substantially all of the
assets and liabilities of SCB Inc (the "Bernstein Acquisition").
       Following a two-year lockout period that ended October 2002, the former
   Bernstein shareholders were permitted to exercise the right to sell
       private units in AllianceBernstein L.P. (the "AllianceBernstein Units")
     that were acquired in the Bernstein Acquisition to AXA Financial (the
     "AB Put"). On February 23, 2007, AXA Financial purchased a tranche of
      8.16 million AllianceBernstein Units pursuant to an exercise of the AB
    Put at a purchase price of approximately $745.7 million and recorded
additional

goodwill of $392.8 million and other intangible assets of $209.5
        million. After this purchase, AXA Financial Group's beneficial ownership
      in AllianceBernstein increased by approximately 3.0% to 63.3%. Through
      December 31, 2007, the Company acquired 32.7 million AllianceBernstein
      Units pursuant to the AB Put at the aggregate market price of $1,631.1
    million and recorded additional goodwill of $733.8 million and other
       intangible assets of $251.7 million. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
       Company's consolidated economic interest in AllianceBernstein was 45.5%
     and 45.6%, respectively. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, AXA Financial
   Group's beneficial ownership in AllianceBernstein was approximately
      63.2% and 60.3%, respectively. Minority interest subject to redemption
  rights on the consolidated balance sheets represents the remaining
private AllianceBernstein Units still held by former Bernstein  
shareholders. These 8.16 million private AllianceBernstein Units
      outstanding at December 31, 2007 may be sold to AXA Financial pursuant
     to the AB Put at the prevailing market price through October 2, 2009.

2)      SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                         

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation           
-----------------------------------------------------           

        The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in
      conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
    States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and
  assumptions (including normal, recurring accruals) that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial  
       statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
       reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
      accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments
necessary in the opinion of management to present fairly the    
   consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

       The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of AXA Equitable and its subsidiary engaged in insurance related
     businesses (collectively, the "Insurance Group"); other subsidiaries,
principally AllianceBernstein; and those investment companies,  
partnerships and joint ventures in which AXA Equitable or its   
    subsidiaries has control and a majority economic interest as well as
        those variable interest entities ("VIEs") that meet the requirements for
consolidation.                                                  

  At December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, the Insurance Group's
       General Account held $5.7 million and $5.8 million of investment assets
        issued by VIEs and determined to be significant variable interests under
    Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation ("FIN")
  46(R), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - Revised". At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, as reported in the    
       consolidated balance sheet, these investments included $4.7 million and
$4.7 million of fixed maturities (collateralized debt and loan  
obligations) and $1.0 million and $1.1 million of other equity  
      investments (principally investment limited partnership interests) and
        are subject to ongoing review for impairment in value. These VIEs do not
require consolidation because management has determined that the
        Insurance Group is not the primary beneficiary. These variable interests
        at December 31, 2007 represent the Insurance Group's maximum exposure to
       loss from its direct involvement with the VIEs. The Insurance Group has
 no further economic interest in these VIEs in the form of related
    guarantees, commitments, derivatives, credit enhancements or similar
instruments and obligations.                                    

      Management of AllianceBernstein has reviewed its investment management
       agreements and its investments in and other financial arrangements with
      certain entities that hold client assets under management to determine
        the entities that AllianceBernstein is required to consolidate under FIN
46(R). These include certain mutual fund products, hedge funds, 
structured products, group trusts and limited partnerships.     

    AllianceBernstein derived no direct benefit from client assets under
      management of these entities other than investment management fees and
cannot utilize those assets in its operations.                  

     AllianceBernstein has significant variable interests in certain other
VIEs with approximately $180.3 million in client assets under   
    management. However, these VIEs do not require consolidation because
   management has determined that AllianceBernstein is not the primary
  beneficiary. AllianceBernstein's maximum exposure to loss in these
    entities is limited to its investments in and prospective investment
management fees earned in these entities.                       

All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been
      eliminated in consolidation. The years "2007," "2006" and "2005" refer
  to the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

   prior periods to conform those periods to the current presentation.

Accounting Changes                                              
------------------                                              

        Effective January 1, 2007, and as more fully described in Note 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted FIN 48,  
    "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," an interpretation that
  clarifies the recognition criteria and measurement of the economic
       benefits associated with tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
     a tax return. Under FIN 48, a tax benefit is recognized only if it is
       "more likely than not" to be sustained based on the technical merits of
  the position, assuming examination by the taxing authority, and is
    required to be measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is
       more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement, taking
        into consideration the amounts and probabilities of potential settlement
outcomes. FIN 48 also addresses subsequent derecognition of tax 
  positions, changes in the measurement of recognized tax positions,
       accrual and classification of interest and penalties, and accounting in
       interim periods. In addition, annual disclosures with respect to income
 taxes have been expanded by FIN 48 and require the inclusion of a
        tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits
at the beginning and end of the reporting period. As a result of
adopting FIN 48, the Company recognized a $44.8 million         
    cumulative-effect adjustment that increased January 1, 2007 retained
earnings reflecting a decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax
benefits.                                                       

 On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the American Institute of
    Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Statement of Position ("SOP")
   05-1, "Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition
Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance
       Contracts". The SOP requires identification of transactions that result
      in a substantial change in an insurance contract. Transactions subject
     to review include internal contract exchanges, contract modifications
       via amendment, rider or endorsement and elections of benefits, features
or rights contained within the contract. If determined that a   
        substantial change has occurred, the related deferred policy acquisition
 costs ("DAC") and other related balances must be written off. The
    adoption of SOP 05-1 did not have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated results of operations or financial position.       

    On December 31, 2006, the Company implemented Statement of Financial
 Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for
  Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans," requiring
      employers to recognize the over or under funded status of such benefit
 plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet for reporting
  periods ending after December 15, 2006 and to recognize subsequent
   changes in that funded status as a component of other comprehensive
 income. The funded status of a plan is measured as the difference
      between plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation
        for pension plans or the benefit obligation for any other postretirement
   plan. SFAS No. 158 did not change the determination of net periodic
       benefit cost or its presentation in the statement of earnings. However,
      its requirements represent a significant change to previous accounting
      guidance that generally delayed recognition of certain changes in plan
     assets and benefit obligations in the balance sheet and only required
     disclosure of the complete funded status of the plans in the notes to
the financial statements.                                       

 As required by SFAS No. 158, the $449.5 million impact of initial
     adoption, net of income tax and minority interest, was reported as an
adjustment to the December 31, 2006 balance of accumulated other
comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated financial 
  statements. The consequent recognition of the funded status of its
      defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans at December 31,
2006 reduced total assets by approximately $684.2 million, due to the
     reduction of prepaid pension cost, and decreased total liabilities by
     approximately $234.7 million. The change in liabilities resulted from
       the $242.7 million decrease in income taxes payable partially offset by
        an increase of $12.0 million in benefit plan liabilities. See Note 12 of
   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

    SFAS No. 158 imposes an additional requirement, effective for fiscal
        years ending after December 15, 2008, to measure plan assets and benefit
    obligations as of the date of the employer's year-end balance sheet,
   thereby eliminating the option to elect an earlier measurement date
     alternative of not more than three months prior to that date, if used
   consistently each year. This provision of SFAS No. 158 will have no
       impact on the Company as it already uses a December 31 measurement date
for all of its plan assets and benefits obligations.            

     On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based
   Payment". To effect its adoption, the Company elected the "modified
  prospective method" of transition. Under this method, prior-period
        results were not restated. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), The
Company had elected to

   continue to account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
   Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees," and, as a result, the recognition of
 stock-based compensation expense generally was limited to amounts
  attributed to awards of restricted shares and various cash-settled
        programs such as stock appreciation rights. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the
     cost of all share-based payments to employees to be recognized in the
financial statements based on their fair values, resulting in   
compensation expense for certain types of the Company's         
        equity-classified award programs for which no cost previously would have
        been charged to net earnings under APB No. 25, most notably for employee
     options to purchase AXA American Depository Receipts ("ADRs") and AXA
      ordinary shares and for employee stock purchase plans prior to January
1, 2006. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006,
        consolidated earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and
minority interest were $63.1 million and $46.9 million lower and
        consolidated net earnings were $36.7 million and $29.9 million lower for
    2007 and 2006, respectively, than if these plans had continued to be
accounted for under APB No. 25.                                 

Under the modified prospective method, the Company applied the  
  measurement, recognition, and attribution requirements of SFAS No.
        123(R) to stock-based compensation awards granted, modified, repurchased
   or cancelled on or after January 1, 2006. In addition, beginning in
first quarter 2006, costs associated with unvested portions of  
      outstanding employee stock option awards at January 1, 2006 that prior
       to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) would have been reflected by the Company
  only in pro forma disclosures, were recognized in the consolidated
       statement of earnings over the awards' remaining future service-vesting
    periods. Liability-classified awards outstanding at January 1, 2006,
        such as performance units and stock appreciation rights, were remeasured
   to fair value. The remeasurement resulted in no adjustment to their
     intrinsic value basis, including the cumulative effect of differences
        between actual and expected forfeitures, primarily due to the de minimis
time remaining to expected settlement of these awards.          

       Effective with its adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company elected the
        "short-cut" transition alternative for approximating the historical pool
        of windfall tax benefits available in shareholder's equity at January 1,
2006 as provided by the FASB in FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. 
        123(R)-3, "Transition Election Related to Accounting For the Tax Effects
   of Share-Based Payment Awards". This historical pool represents the
  cumulative tax benefits of tax deductions for employee share-based
      payments in excess of compensation costs recognized under GAAP, either
   in the financial statements or in the pro forma disclosures. In the
       event that a shortfall of tax benefits occurs during a reporting period
      (i.e. tax deductions are less than the related cumulative compensation
  expense), the historical pool will be reduced by the amount of the
      shortfall. If the shortfall exceeds the amount of the historical pool,
     there will be a negative impact on the results of operations. In 2007
 and 2006, additional windfall tax benefits resulted from employee
exercises of stock option awards.                               

       On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 154,
        "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections," a replacement of APB No. 20,
      "Accounting Changes," and SFAS No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in
    Interim Financial Statements". SFAS No. 154 applies to all voluntary
    changes in accounting principle as well as to changes required by an
        accounting pronouncement that does not include transition provisions. To
        enhance comparability, this statement requires retrospective application
to prior periods' financial statements of changes in accounting 
principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the   
   period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. The
    cumulative effect of the change is reported in the carrying value of
        assets and liabilities as of the first period presented, with the offset
       applied to opening retained earnings. Each period presented is adjusted
      to show the period specific effects of the change. Only direct effects
       of the change will be retrospectively recognized; indirect effects will
   be recognized in the period of change. SFAS No. 154 carries forward
       without change APB No. 20's guidance for reporting the correction of an
 error and a change in accounting estimate as well as SFAS No. 3's
      provisions governing reporting accounting changes in interim financial
      statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not have an impact on the
Company's results of operations or financial position.          

New Accounting Pronouncements                                   
-----------------------------                                   

On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business 
     Combinations (revised 2007)". While retaining SFAS No. 141, "Business
      Combinations," requirement to use purchase accounting for all business
combinations, SFAS No. 141(R)'s new rules include the following:
        o    The acquirer will recognize 100% of the fair values of acquired
       assets and assumed liabilities (with few exceptions) upon
             initially obtaining control even if it has not acquired 100% of
the target company,

     o    Contingent considerations will be included in the purchase price
          consideration on a fair value basis while transaction costs will
be expensed as incurred, and                          
o    The requirements in SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs    
          Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," must be met at the
       acquisition date in order to accrue for a restructuring plan.
   SFAS No. 141(R) is to be applied prospectively to acquisitions that
    occur in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008; early
adoption is prohibited.                                         

       Also on December 4, 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling
       Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No.
51". SFAS No. 160 will:                                         
   o    Recharacterize minority interests, currently classified within
      liabilities, as noncontrolling interests to be reported as a
component of consolidated equity on the balance sheet,
    o    Include total income in net income, with separate disclosure on
          the face of the consolidated income statement of the attribution
         of income between controlling and noncontrolling interests, and
    o    Account for increases and decreases in noncontrolling interests
          as equity transactions with any difference between proceeds of a
          purchase or issuance of noncontrolling interests being accounted
          for as a change to the controlling entity's equity instead of as
           current period gains/losses in the consolidated income statement.
           Only when the controlling entity loses control and deconsolidates
a subsidiary will a gain or loss be recognized.       
       SFAS No. 160 is also effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning
on or after December 15, 2008 except for its specific transition
   provisions for retroactive adoption of the balance sheet and income
        statement presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority
     interests. Management currently is assessing the impacts of adoption,
including adjustments that will be required in the consolidated 
      financial statements to conform the presentations of minority interest
        in the equity and net income of AllianceBernstein and the recognition of
changes in the Company's ownership interest.                    

      In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option
        for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of
     FASB Statement No. 115". This statement permits entities to choose to
  measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
   value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing
entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported
       earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently
 without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. This
      statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity's first fiscal
       year that begins after November 15, 2007. Management has elected not to
adopt the fair value option as permitted by SFAS No. 159.       

      In June 2007, the AICPA issued SOP 07-1 "Clarification of the Scope of
     the Audit and Accounting Guide Investment Companies and Accounting by
Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments in 
        Investment Companies". The SOP provides guidance for determining whether
     an entity is within the scope of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide
     for Investment Companies (the "Guide"). The SOP addresses whether the
 specialized industry accounting principles of the Guide should be
        retained by a parent company in consolidation or by an investor that has
 the ability to exercise significant influence over the investment
        company and applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in
the entity. SOP 07-1 was to have been effective for fiscal years
        beginning after December 15, 2007. On February 12, 2008, the FASB issued
       FSP SOP 07-1-1 that indefinitely delays the effective date of SOP 07-1.
     The delay is intended to allow the Board time to consider a number of
significant issues relating to the implementation of SOP 07-1.  

On September 15, 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value
Measurements". SFAS No. 157 establishes a single authoritative  
        definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value,
     and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. It
    applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or
   permitted by other accounting standards, except for measurements of
  share-based payments and measurements that are similar to, but not
   intended to be, fair value. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial
     statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.
        The effect of adopting SFAS No. 157 due to the expected remeasurement of
the fair value of the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit ("GMIB")
        reinsurance asset on January 1, 2008 is expected to result in a one-time
  net increase in the range of $50-100 million in 2008 net earnings.

      On February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157-2 that defers the
      effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for all non-financial assets
    and non-financial liabilities (including goodwill and other intangible
     assets) except for those items that are recognized or disclosed at fair
value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least  
    annually). This deferral will delay until 2009 the application of SFAS
      No. 157 to the Company's annual impairment testing of goodwill and other
intangible assets.

Closed Block                                                    
------------                                                    

        As a result of demutualization, the Closed Block was established in 1992
      for the benefit of certain individual participating policies that were
     in force on that date. Assets, liabilities and earnings of the Closed
Block are specifically identified to support its participating  
policyholders.                                                  

       Assets allocated to the Closed Block inure solely to the benefit of the
    Closed Block policyholders and will not revert to the benefit of AXA
        Equitable. No reallocation, transfer, borrowing or lending of assets can
      be made between the Closed Block and other portions of AXA Equitable's
     General Account, any of its Separate Accounts or any affiliate of AXA
Equitable without the approval of the New York Superintendent of
     Insurance (the "Superintendent"). Closed Block assets and liabilities
       are carried on the same basis as similar assets and liabilities held in
the General Account.                                            

The excess of Closed Block liabilities over Closed Block assets 
       (adjusted to exclude the impact of related amounts in accumulated other
     comprehensive income) represents the expected maximum future post-tax
      earnings from the Closed Block that would be recognized in income from
       continuing operations over the period the policies and contracts in the
    Closed Block remain in force. As of January 1, 2001, the Company has
       developed an actuarial calculation of the expected timing of the Closed
Block earnings.                                                 

        If the actual cumulative earnings from the Closed Block are greater than
    the expected cumulative earnings, only the expected earnings will be
 recognized in net income. Actual cumulative earnings in excess of
   expected cumulative earnings at any point in time are recorded as a
        policyholder dividend obligation because they will ultimately be paid to
        Closed Block policyholders as an additional policyholder dividend unless
   offset by future performance that is less favorable than originally
   expected. If a policyholder dividend obligation has been previously
       established and the actual Closed Block earnings in a subsequent period
     are less than the expected earnings for that period, the policyholder
       dividend obligation would be reduced (but not below zero). If, over the
      period the policies and contracts in the Closed Block remain in force,
    the actual cumulative earnings of the Closed Block are less than the
      expected cumulative earnings, only actual earnings would be recognized
in income from continuing operations. If the Closed Block has   
   insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such
payments will be made from assets outside the Closed Block.     

        Many expenses related to Closed Block operations, including amortization
of DAC, are charged to operations outside of the Closed Block;  
  accordingly, net revenues of the Closed Block do not represent the
        actual profitability of the Closed Block operations. Operating costs and
        expenses outside of the Closed Block are, therefore, disproportionate to
the business outside of the Closed Block.                       

Investments                                                     
-----------                                                     

        The carrying values of fixed maturities identified as available for sale
     are reported at estimated fair value. Changes in estimated fair value
 are reported in comprehensive income. The amortized cost of fixed
       maturities is adjusted for impairments in value deemed to be other than
       temporary. The redeemable preferred stock investments reported in fixed
   maturities include real estate investment trusts ("REIT") perpetual
preferred stock, other perpetual preferred stock and redeemable 
     preferred stock. These securities may not have a stated maturity, may
    not be cumulative and do not provide for mandatory redemption by the
issuer.                                                         

      Mortgage loans on real estate are stated at unpaid principal balances,
net of unamortized discounts and valuation allowances. Valuation
       allowances are based on the present value of expected future cash flows
   discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate or on its
 collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent. However, if
    foreclosure is or becomes probable, the collateral value measurement
method is used.                                                 

        Impaired mortgage loans without provision for losses are loans where the
     fair value of the collateral or the net present value of the expected
    future cash flows related to the loan equals or exceeds the recorded
      investment. Interest income earned on loans where the collateral value
   is used to measure impairment is recorded on a cash basis. Interest
 income on loans where the present value method is used to measure
     impairment is accrued on the net carrying value amount of the loan at
 the interest rate used to discount the cash flows. Changes in the
present value attributable to changes in the amount or timing of
expected cash flows are reported as investment gains or losses.

    Real estate held for the production of income, including real estate
    acquired in satisfaction of debt, is stated at depreciated cost less
        valuation allowances. At the date of foreclosure (including in-substance
       foreclosure), real estate acquired in satisfaction of debt is valued at
        estimated fair value. Impaired real estate is written down to fair value
     with the impairment loss being included in Investment (losses) gains,
net.                                                            

     Depreciation of real estate held for production of income is computed
     using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
properties, which generally range from 40 to 50 years.          

     Valuation allowances are netted against the asset categories to which
they apply.                                                     

Policy loans are stated at unpaid principal balances.           

       Partnerships, investment companies and joint venture interests in which
  the Company has control and a majority economic interest (that is,
   greater than 50% of the economic return generated by the entity) or
      those that meet the requirements for consolidation under FIN 46(R) are
    consolidated; those in which the Company does not have control and a
majority economic interest and those that do not meet FIN 46(R) 
  requirements for consolidation are reported on the equity basis of
   accounting and are included either with equity real estate or other
equity investments, as appropriate.                             

   Equity securities include common stock and non-redeemable preferred
        stock classified as either trading or available for sale securities, are
carried at estimated fair value and are included in other equity
investments.                                                    

Trading securities, which include equity securities and fixed   
maturities, are carried at estimated fair value.                

      Corporate owned life insurance ("COLI") is purchased by the Company on
     the lives of certain key employees under which the Company or certain
subsidiaries of the Company are named as beneficiaries under the
      policies. COLI is carried at the cash surrender value of the policies.
    At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying value of COLI was $770.7
  million and $701.6 million, respectively, and is reported in Other
invested assets in the consolidated balance sheets.             

       Short-term investments are stated at amortized cost, which approximates
fair value, and are included with other invested assets.        

       Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, amounts due from banks
      and highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity
of three months or less.                                        

   All securities owned as well as United States government and agency
securities, mortgage-backed securities, futures and forwards    
       transactions are recorded in the consolidated financial statements on a
trade date basis.                                               

Derivatives                                                     
-----------                                                     

The Company primarily uses derivatives for asset/liability risk 
management, for hedging individual securities and certain equity
     exposures and to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on
       its long-term debt obligations. Various derivative instruments are used
        to achieve these objectives, including interest rate floors, futures and
interest rate swaps. None of the derivatives were designated as 
qualifying hedges under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities".                            

 The Insurance Group issues certain variable annuity products with
     Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit ("GMDB") and GMIB features. The risk
 associated with the GMDB feature is that under-performance of the
       financial markets could result in GMDB benefits, in the event of death,
      being higher than what accumulated policyholder account balances would
support. The risk associated with the GMIB feature is that      
under-performance of the financial markets could result in GMIB 
      benefits, in the event of election, being higher than what accumulated
   policyholders account balances would support. The Company currently
      utilizes a combination of futures contracts and interest rate swap and
     floor contracts to hedge such risks. However, for both GMDB and GMIB,
     the Company retains basis risk and risk associated with actual versus
        expected assumptions for mortality, lapse and election rate. The futures
        contracts are managed to correlate with changes in the value of the GMDB
 and GMIB feature that result from financial markets movements. In
     addition, the Company has purchased reinsurance contracts to mitigate
        the risks associated with the impact of potential market fluctuations on
   future policyholder elections of GMIB features contained in certain
       annuity contracts issued by the Company. Reinsurance contracts covering
 GMIB exposure are considered derivatives under SFAS No. 133, and,
    therefore, are required to be reported in the balance sheet at their
fair

    value. GMIB reinsurance fair values are reported in the consolidated
       balance sheets in Other assets. Changes in GMIB reinsurance fair values
       are reflected in Commissions, fees and other income in the consolidated
      statements of earnings. Since there is no readily available market for
     GMIB reinsurance contracts, the determination of their fair values is
based on models which involve numerous estimates and subjective 
       judgments including those regarding expected market rates of return and
       volatility, GMIB election rates, contract surrender rates and mortality
     experience. There can be no assurance that ultimate actual experience
   will not differ from management's estimates. See Note 8 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.                              

     Margins on individual insurance and annuity contracts are affected by
     interest rate fluctuations. If interest rates fall, credited interest
rates and dividends would be adjusted prospectively subject to  
        competitive pressures. In addition, policies are subject to minimum rate
   guarantees. To hedge exposure to lower interest rates for these and
other reasons, the Company may use interest rate floors.        

        The Company is exposed to equity market fluctuations through investments
       in Separate Accounts. The Company may enter into exchange traded equity
futures contracts to minimize such risk.                        

   The Company is exposed to counterparty risk attributable to hedging
      transactions entered into with counterparties. Exposure to credit risk
is controlled with respect to each counterparty through a credit
       appraisal and approval process. Each counterparty is currently rated A+
or better by Moody's and Standard and Poor's rating agencies.   

        All derivatives outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006 are recognized
on the balance sheet at their fair values and all outstanding   
        equity-based and treasury futures contracts were exchange-traded and are
net settled daily. All gains and losses on derivative financial 
     instruments other than the GMIB reinsurance contracts are reported in
Net investment income.                                          

    Net Investment Income, Investment (Losses) Gains, Net and Unrealized
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
Investment Gains (Losses)                                       
-------------------------                                       

 Net investment income and realized investment gains (losses), net
       (together, "investment results") related to certain participating group
     annuity contracts which are passed through to the contractholders are
  offset by amounts reflected as interest credited to policyholders'
account balances.                                               

        Realized investment gains (losses) are determined by identification with
       the specific asset and are presented as a component of revenue. Changes
      in the valuation allowances are included in Investment (losses) gains,
net.                                                            

        Realized and unrealized holding gains (losses) on trading securities are
reflected in Net investment income.                             

     Unrealized investment gains and losses on fixed maturities and equity
        securities available for sale held by the Company are accounted for as a
      separate component of accumulated comprehensive income, net of related
deferred income taxes, amounts attributable to certain pension  
    operations principally consisting of group non-participating wind-up
  annuity products ("Wind-up Annuities"), Closed Block policyholders
dividend obligation and DAC related to universal life and       
      investment-type products and participating traditional life contracts.

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments                       
-----------------------------------------                       

    The Company defines fair value as the quoted market prices for those
   instruments that are actively traded in financial markets. In cases
       where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated
 using present value or other valuation techniques. The fair value
  estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available
market information and judgments about the financial instrument,
    including estimates of the timing and amount of expected future cash
      flows and the credit standing of counterparties. Such estimates do not
        reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale
   at one time the Company's entire holdings of a particular financial
     instrument, nor do they consider the tax impact of the realization of
   unrealized gains or losses. In many cases, the fair value estimates
     cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets, nor can
the disclosed value be realized in immediate settlement of the  
instrument.

       Certain financial instruments are excluded from fair value disclosures,
      particularly insurance liabilities other than financial guarantees and
       investment contracts. Fair market values of off-balance-sheet financial
    instruments of the Insurance Group were not material at December 31,
2007 and 2006.                                                  

Fair values for mortgage loans on real estate are estimated by  
       discounting future contractual cash flows using interest rates at which
    loans with similar characteristics and credit quality would be made.
        Fair values for foreclosed mortgage loans and problem mortgage loans are
   limited to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral if
lower.                                                          

       The estimated fair values for the Company's association plan contracts,
       supplementary contracts not involving life contingencies ("SCNILC") and
annuities certain, which are included in policyholders' account 
balances, and guaranteed interest contracts are estimated using 
    projected cash flows discounted at rates reflecting expected current
offering rates.                                                 

  The fair values for variable deferred annuities and single premium
    deferred annuities, included in policyholders' account balances, are
      estimated as the discounted value of projected account values. Current
   account values are projected to the time of the next crediting rate
        review at the current crediting rates and are projected beyond that date
        at the greater of current estimated market rates offered on new policies
 or the guaranteed minimum crediting rate. Expected cash flows and
  projected account values are discounted back to the present at the
current estimated market rates.                                 

    Fair values for long-term debt are determined using published market
       values, where available, or contractual cash flows discounted at market
        interest rates. The estimated fair values for non-recourse mortgage debt
   are determined by discounting contractual cash flows at a rate that
 takes into account the level of current market interest rates and
     collateral risk. The estimated fair values for recourse mortgage debt
    are determined by discounting contractual cash flows at a rate based
  upon current interest rates of other companies with credit ratings
  similar to the Company. The Company's carrying value of short-term
borrowings approximates their estimated fair value.             

Recognition of Insurance Income and Related Expenses            
----------------------------------------------------            

       Premiums from universal life and investment-type contracts are reported
   as deposits to policyholders' account balances. Revenues from these
contracts consist of amounts assessed during the period against 
policyholders' account balances for mortality charges, policy   
        administration charges and surrender charges. Policy benefits and claims
  that are charged to expense include benefit claims incurred in the
period in excess of related policyholders' account balances.    

      Premiums from participating and non-participating traditional life and
    annuity policies with life contingencies generally are recognized in
      income when due. Benefits and expenses are matched with such income so
as to result in the recognition of profits over the life of the 
   contracts. This match is accomplished by means of the provision for
      liabilities for future policy benefits and the deferral and subsequent
amortization of policy acquisition costs.                       

  For contracts with a single premium or a limited number of premium
      payments due over a significantly shorter period than the total period
       over which benefits are provided, premiums are recorded as revenue when
 due with any excess profit deferred and recognized in income in a
  constant relationship to insurance in-force or, for annuities, the
amount of expected future benefit payments.                     

       Premiums from individual health contracts are recognized as income over
      the period to which the premiums relate in proportion to the amount of
insurance protection provided.                                  

DAC 
---                                                             

 Acquisition costs that vary with and are primarily related to the
acquisition of new and renewal insurance business, including    
commissions, underwriting, agency and policy issue expenses, are
        deferred. DAC is subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy
        issue and loss recognition testing at the end of each accounting period.

For universal life products and investment-type products, DAC is
 amortized over the expected total life of the contract group as a
       constant percentage of estimated gross profits arising principally from
        investment results, Separate Account fees, mortality and expense margins
and surrender charges based on historical and

    anticipated future experience, updated at the end of each accounting
       period. The effect on the amortization of DAC of revisions to estimated
   gross profits is reflected in earnings in the period such estimated
     gross profits are revised. A decrease in expected gross profits would
      accelerate DAC amortization. Conversely, an increase in expected gross
     profits would slow DAC amortization. The effect on the DAC asset that
        would result from realization of unrealized gains (losses) is recognized
  with an offset to accumulated comprehensive income in consolidated
shareholder's equity as of the balance sheet date.              

   A significant assumption in the amortization of DAC on variable and
   interest-sensitive life insurance and variable annuities relates to
        projected future Separate Account performance. Management sets estimated
       future gross profit assumptions related to Separate Account performance
       using a long-term view of expected average market returns by applying a
    reversion to the mean approach. In applying this approach to develop
      estimates of future returns, it is assumed that the market will return
       to an average gross long-term return estimate, developed with reference
to historical long-term equity market performance and subject to
        assessment of the reasonableness of resulting estimates of future return
   assumptions. For purposes of making this reasonableness assessment,
       management has set limitations as to maximum and minimum future rate of
     return assumptions, as well as a limitation on the duration of use of
      these maximum or minimum rates of return. Currently, the average gross
      long-term annual return estimate is 9.0% (6.7% net of product weighted
        average Separate Account fees), and the gross maximum and minimum annual
   rate of return limitations are 15.0% (12.7% net of product weighted
       average Separate Account fees) and 0.0% ((2.3%) net of product weighted
       average Separate Account fees), respectively. The maximum duration over
     which these rate limitations may be applied is 5 years. This approach
       will continue to be applied in future periods. If actual market returns
      continue at levels that would result in assuming future market returns
  of 15.0% for more than 5 years in order to reach the average gross
long-term return estimate, the application of the 5 year maximum
        duration limitation would result in an acceleration of DAC amortization.
    Conversely, actual market returns resulting in assumed future market
returns of 0.0% for more than 5 years would result in a required
  deceleration of DAC amortization. As of December 31, 2007, current
       projections of future average gross market returns assume a 1.8% return
  for 2008, which is within the maximum and minimum limitations, and
assume a reversion to the mean of 9.0% after 6 quarters.        

   In addition, projections of future mortality assumptions related to
      variable and interest-sensitive life products are based on a long-term
     average of actual experience. This assumption is updated quarterly to
      reflect recent experience as it emerges. Improvement of life mortality
      in future periods from that currently projected would result in future
   deceleration of DAC amortization. Conversely, deterioration of life
      mortality in future periods from that currently projected would result
     in future acceleration of DAC amortization. Generally, life mortality
experience has been improving in recent years.                  

      Other significant assumptions underlying gross profit estimates relate
to contract persistency and general account investment spread.  

       For participating traditional life policies (substantially all of which
       are in the Closed Block), DAC is amortized over the expected total life
   of the contract group as a constant percentage based on the present
        value of the estimated gross margin amounts expected to be realized over
 the life of the contracts using the expected investment yield. At
 December 31, 2007, the average rate of assumed investment yields,
excluding policy loans, was 6.5% grading to 6.25% over 10 years.
   Estimated gross margin includes anticipated premiums and investment
   results less claims and administrative expenses, changes in the net
     level premium reserve and expected annual policyholder dividends. The
       effect on the accumulated amortization of DAC of revisions to estimated
   gross margins is reflected in earnings in the period such estimated
        gross margins are revised. The effect on the DAC asset that would result
   from realization of unrealized gains (losses) is recognized with an
        offset to accumulated comprehensive income in consolidated shareholder's
equity as of the balance sheet date.                            

    For non-participating traditional life policies, DAC is amortized in
 proportion to anticipated premiums. Assumptions as to anticipated
       premiums are estimated at the date of policy issue and are consistently
   applied during the life of the contracts. Deviations from estimated
  experience are reflected in earnings in the period such deviations
      occur. For these contracts, the amortization periods generally are for
the total life of the policy.                                   

Contractholder Bonus Interest Credits                           
-------------------------------------                           

     Contractholder bonus interest credits are offered on certain deferred
        annuity products in the form of either immediate bonus interest credited
    or enhanced interest crediting rates. The interest crediting expense

F-18

P-->485BPOS86th "Page" of 141TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 86th
       associated with these contractholder bonus interest credits is deferred
    and amortized over the lives of the underlying contracts in a manner
 consistent with the amortization of DAC. Unamortized balances are
included in Other assets.                                       

Policyholders' Account Balances and Future Policy Benefits      
----------------------------------------------------------      

      Policyholders' account balances for universal life and investment-type
    contracts are equal to the policy account values. The policy account
        values represent an accumulation of gross premium payments plus credited
interest less expense and mortality charges and withdrawals.    

  AXA Equitable issues certain variable annuity products with a GMDB
feature, guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ("GMAB") and  
      guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits for life ("WBL"). AXA Equitable
 also issues certain variable annuity products that contain a GMIB
        feature which, if elected by the policyholder after a stipulated waiting
    period from contract issuance, guarantees a minimum lifetime annuity
      based on predetermined annuity purchase rates that may be in excess of
    what the contract account value can purchase at then-current annuity
       purchase rates. This minimum lifetime annuity is based on predetermined
     annuity purchase rates applied to a guaranteed minimum income benefit
        base. Reserves for GMDB and GMIB obligations are calculated on the basis
  of actuarial assumptions related to projected benefits and related
contract charges generally over the lives of the contracts using
      assumptions consistent with those used in estimating gross profits for
purposes of amortizing DAC. The determination of this estimated 
 liability is based on models which involve numerous estimates and
        subjective judgments, including those regarding expected market rates of
      return and volatility, contract surrender rates, mortality experience,
and, for contracts with the GMIB feature, GMIB election rates.  
       Assumptions regarding Separate Account performance used for purposes of
   this calculation are set using a long-term view of expected average
       market returns by applying a reversion to the mean approach, consistent
   with that used for DAC amortization. There can be no assurance that
       ultimate actual experience will not differ from management's estimates.

  For reinsurance contracts other than those covering GMIB exposure,
       reinsurance recoverable balances are calculated using methodologies and
       assumptions that are consistent with those used to calculate the direct
liabilities.                                                    

  For participating traditional life policies, future policy benefit
        liabilities are calculated using a net level premium method on the basis
        of actuarial assumptions equal to guaranteed mortality and dividend fund
 interest rates. The liability for annual dividends represents the
     accrual of annual dividends earned. Terminal dividends are accrued in
proportion to gross margins over the life of the contract.      

        For non-participating traditional life insurance policies, future policy
     benefit liabilities are estimated using a net level premium method on
   the basis of actuarial assumptions as to mortality, persistency and
       interest established at policy issue. Assumptions established at policy
        issue as to mortality and persistency are based on the Insurance Group's
experience that, together with interest and expense assumptions,
        includes a margin for adverse deviation. When the liabilities for future
        policy benefits plus the present value of expected future gross premiums
    for a product are insufficient to provide for expected future policy
benefits and expenses for that product, DAC is written off and  
       thereafter, if required, a premium deficiency reserve is established by
   a charge to earnings. Benefit liabilities for traditional annuities
        during the accumulation period are equal to accumulated contractholders'
      fund balances and, after annuitization, are equal to the present value
     of expected future payments. Interest rates used in establishing such
       liabilities range from 4.0% to 10.9% for life insurance liabilities and
from 2.35% to 8.7% for annuity liabilities.                     

    Individual health benefit liabilities for active lives are estimated
using the net level premium method and assumptions as to future 
     morbidity, withdrawals and interest. Benefit liabilities for disabled
  lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and
       experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.
    While management believes its disability income ("DI") reserves have
       been calculated on a reasonable basis and are adequate, there can be no
        assurance reserves will be sufficient to provide for future liabilities.

Policyholders' Dividends                                        
------------------------                                        

      The amount of policyholders' dividends to be paid (including dividends
       on policies included in the Closed Block) is determined annually by AXA
      Equitable's board of directors. The aggregate amount of policyholders'
 dividends is related to actual interest, mortality, morbidity and
        expense experience for the year and judgment as to the appropriate level
of statutory surplus to be retained by AXA Equitable.           

    At December 31, 2007, participating policies, including those in the
       Closed Block, represent approximately 3.8% ($28.43 billion) of directly
written life insurance in-force, net of amounts ceded.          

Separate Accounts                                               
-----------------                                               

       Generally, Separate Accounts established under New York State Insurance
 Law are not chargeable with liabilities that arise from any other
        business of the Insurance Group. Separate Accounts assets are subject to
  General Account claims only to the extent Separate Accounts assets
   exceed Separate Accounts liabilities. Assets and liabilities of the
Separate Accounts represent the net deposits and accumulated net
investment earnings less fees, held primarily for the benefit of
    contractholders, and for which the Insurance Group does not bear the
       investment risk. Separate Accounts' assets and liabilities are shown on
     separate lines in the consolidated balance sheets. Assets held in the
      Separate Accounts are carried at quoted market values or, where quoted
        values are not readily available, at estimated fair values as determined
    by the Insurance Group. The assets and liabilities of three Separate
      Accounts are presented and accounted for as General Account assets and
      liabilities due to the fact that not all of the investment performance
in those Separate Accounts is passed through to policyholders.  
   Investment assets in these Separate Accounts principally consist of
 fixed maturities that are classified as available for sale in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.                 

        The investment results of Separate Accounts on which the Insurance Group
    does not bear the investment risk are reflected directly in Separate
Accounts liabilities and are not reported in revenues in the    
        consolidated statements of earnings. For 2007, 2006 and 2005, investment
  results of such Separate Accounts were gains of $10,028.6 million,
$5,689.1 million and $3,409.5 million, respectively.            

   Deposits to Separate Accounts are reported as increases in Separate
        Accounts liabilities and are not reported in revenues. Mortality, policy
    administration and surrender charges on all policies including those
funded by Separate Accounts are included in revenues.           

        The Company reports the General Account's interests in Separate Accounts
as Trading securities in the consolidated balance sheets.       

  Recognition of Investment Management Revenues and Related Expenses
  ------------------------------------------------------------------

 Commissions, fees and other income principally include Investment
        Management advisory and service fees. Investment Management advisory and
       service base fees, generally calculated as a percentage, referred to as
 basis points ("BPs"), of assets under management, are recorded as
     revenue as the related services are performed; they include brokerage
     transactions charges received by SCB LLC, for certain retail, private
client and institutional investment client transactions. Certain
        investment advisory contracts, including those with hedge funds, provide
    for a performance-based fee, in addition to or in lieu of a base fee
        that is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results
       or a percentage of the related investment results in excess of a stated
     benchmark over a specified period of time. Performance-based fees are
        recorded as revenue at the end of each measurement period. Institutional
   research services revenue consists of brokerage transaction charges
      received by SCB LLC and SCBL, for in-depth research and other services
  provided to institutional investors. Brokerage transaction charges
earned and related expenses are recorded on a trade date basis. 
   Distribution revenues and shareholder servicing fees are accrued as
earned.                                                         

        Commissions paid to financial intermediaries in connection with the sale
   of shares of open-end AllianceBernstein mutual funds sold without a
        front-end sales charge are capitalized as deferred sales commissions and
 amortized over periods not exceeding five and one-half years, the
periods of time during which the deferred sales commissions are 
       generally recovered from distribution services fees received from those
      funds and from contingent deferred sales commissions ("CDSC") received
     from shareholders of those funds upon the redemption of their shares.
       CDSC cash recoveries are recorded as reductions of unamortized deferred
sales commissions when received.                                

F-20

P-->485BPOS88th "Page" of 141TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 88th
        AllianceBernstein's management tests the deferred sales commission asset
       for recoverability quarterly. AllianceBernstein's management determines
 recoverability by estimating undiscounted future cash flows to be
        realized from this asset, as compared to its recorded amount, as well as
        the estimated remaining life of the deferred sales commission asset over
 which undiscounted future cash flows are expected to be received.
       Undiscounted future cash flows consist of ongoing distribution services
        fees and CDSC. Distribution services fees are calculated as a percentage
        of average assets under management related to back-end load shares. CDSC
is based on the lower of cost or current value, at the time of  
   redemption, of back-end load shares redeemed and the point at which
      redeemed during the applicable minimum holding period under the mutual
fund distribution system.                                       

        Significant assumptions utilized to estimate future average assets under
       management and undiscounted future cash flows from back-end load shares
  include expected future market levels and redemption rates. Market
   assumptions are selected using a long-term view of expected average
   market returns based on historical returns of broad market indices.
        Future redemption rate assumptions are determined by reference to actual
 redemption experience over the one-year, three-year and five-year
periods ended December 31, 2007. These assumptions are updated  
 periodically. Estimates of undiscounted future cash flows and the
   remaining life of the deferred sales commission asset are made from
        these assumptions and the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are compared
to the recorded value of the deferred sales commission asset. If
AllianceBernstein's management determines in the future that the
 deferred sales commission asset is not recoverable, an impairment
   condition would exist and a loss would be measured as the amount by
        which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value.
Estimated fair value is determined using AllianceBernstein's    
       management's best estimate of future cash flows discounted to a present
value amount.                                                   

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets                            
------------------------------------                            

        Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value
        of identifiable assets of acquired companies, and relates principally to
   the Bernstein Acquisition and purchases of AllianceBernstein units.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.                     

       Intangible assets related to the Bernstein Acquisition and purchases of
AllianceBernstein units include values assigned to contracts of 
        businesses acquired. These intangible assets continue to be amortized on
  a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of twenty years.

Other Accounting Policies

       Capitalized internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis
      over the estimated useful life of the software that ranges between one
and nine years.                                                 

     AXA Financial and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries, including
   the Company, file a consolidated Federal income tax return. Current
     Federal income taxes are charged or credited to operations based upon
     amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable
operations for the current year. Deferred income tax assets and 
    liabilities are recognized based on the difference between financial
statement carrying amounts and income tax bases of assets and   
liabilities using enacted income tax rates and laws.            

Discontinued operations include real estate held-for-sale.      

     Real estate investments meeting the following criteria are classified
as real estate held-for-sale:                                   
      o    Management having the authority to approve the action commits the
organization to a plan to sell the property.          
o    The property is available for immediate sale in its present
          condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for
the sale of such assets.                              
      o    An active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to
         complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated and are
continuing.                                           
   o    The sale of the asset is probable and transfer of the asset is
        expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within
one year.                                             
     o    The asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is
reasonable in relation to its current fair value.     
o    Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is  
       unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or
that the plan will be withdrawn.

      Real estate held-for-sale is stated at depreciated cost less valuation
 allowances. Valuation allowances on real estate held-for-sale are
      computed using the lower of depreciated cost or current estimated fair
     value, net of disposition costs. Depreciation is discontinued on real
estate held-for-sale.                                           

     Real estate held-for-sale is included in the Other assets line in the

    The Company determines the fair value of fixed maturities and equity
      securities based upon quoted prices in active markets, when available,
       or through the use of alternative approaches when market quotes are not
     readily accessible or available. These alternative approaches include
     matrix or model pricing and use of independent pricing services, each
     supported by reference to principal market trades or other observable
        market assumptions for similar securities. More specifically, the matrix
    pricing approach to fair value is a discounted cash flow methodology
    that incorporates market interest rates commensurate with the credit
quality and duration of the investment.

       Bonds not due at a single maturity date have been included in the above
      table in the year of final maturity. Actual maturities may differ from
      contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or
prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The Company's management, with the assistance of its investment 
    advisors, monitors the investment performance of its portfolio. This
   review process includes a quarterly review of certain assets by the
Insurance Group's Investments Under Surveillance Committee that 
      evaluates whether any investments are other than temporarily impaired.
       Based on the analysis, a determination is made as to the ability of the
   issuer to service its debt obligations on an ongoing basis. If this
 ability is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, then the
appropriate provisions are taken.                               

       The following table discloses the 1,369 issues of fixed maturities that
  have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than a
twelve month period and greater than a twelve month period as of

  The Insurance Group's fixed maturity investment portfolio includes
   corporate high yield securities consisting primarily of public high
    yield bonds. These corporate high yield securities are classified as
   other than investment grade by the various rating agencies, i.e., a
rating below Baa3/BBB- or the National Association of Insurance 
     Commissioners ("NAIC") designation of 3 (medium grade), 4 or 5 (below
  investment grade) or 6 (in or near default). At December 31, 2007,
       approximately $580.8 million or 2.2% of the $27,013.7 million aggregate
        amortized cost of fixed maturities held by the Company was considered to
be other than investment grade.                                 

The Insurance Group does not originate, purchase or warehouse   
        residential mortgages and is not in the mortgage servicing business. The
Insurance Group's fixed maturity investment portfolio includes  
      Residential Mortgage Backed Securities ("RMBS") backed by subprime and
     Alt-A residential mortgages. RMBS are securities whose cash flows are
       backed by the principal and interest payments from a set of residential
       mortgage loans. RMBS backed by subprime and Alt-A residential mortgages
 consist of loans made by banks or mortgage lenders to residential
    borrowers with lower credit ratings. The criteria used to categorize
       such subprime borrowers include Fair Isaac Credit Organization ("FICO")
       scores, interest rates charged, debt-to-income ratios and loan-to-value
     ratios. Alt-A residential mortgages are mortgage loans where the risk
        profile falls between prime and subprime; borrowers typically have clean
        credit histories but the mortgage loan has an increased risk profile due
    to higher loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios and /or inadequate
 documentation of the borrowers' income. At December 31, 2007, the
Insurance Group owned $73.6 million in RMBS backed by subprime  
  residential mortgage loans, approximately 95% rated AAA, and $50.0
million in RMBS backed by Alt-A residential mortgage loans,     
approximately 96% rated AAA. RMBS backed by subprime and Alt-A  
     residential mortgages are fixed income investments supporting General
Account liabilities.                                            

      At December 31, 2007, the carrying value of fixed maturities which are
     non-income producing for the twelve months preceding the consolidated
balance sheet date was $0.1 million.                            

Mortgage Loans

        The payment terms of mortgage loans on real estate may from time to time
    be restructured or modified. The investment in restructured mortgage
        loans on real estate, based on amortized cost, amounted to $65.0 million
      at December 31, 2006; there were no restructured mortgages at December
31, 2007. Gross interest income on such loans included in net investment
      income aggregated $3.9 million, $4.1 million and $5.0 million in 2007,
  2006 and 2005, respectively. Gross interest income on restructured
mortgage loans on real estate that would have been recorded in  
 accordance with the original terms of such loans amounted to $3.3
million, $4.8 million and $6.0 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,  
respectively.                                                   

   Impaired mortgage loans along with the related investment valuation
allowances for losses follow:

        During 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, the Company's average recorded
      investment in impaired mortgage loans was $49.1 million, $78.8 million
        and $91.2 million. Interest income recognized on these impaired mortgage
        loans totaled $4.5 million, $4.5 million and $8.9 million for 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively.                                         

  Mortgage loans on real estate are placed on nonaccrual status once
        management believes the collection of accrued interest is doubtful. Once
 mortgage loans on real estate are classified as nonaccrual loans,
        interest income is recognized under the cash basis of accounting and the
     resumption of the interest accrual would commence only after all past
       due interest has been collected or the mortgage loan on real estate has
   been restructured to where the collection of interest is considered
       likely. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, the carrying value
       of mortgage loans on real estate that had been classified as nonaccrual
loans was $10.0 million and $65.5 million.

 At December 31, 2007 and 2006 and during the years then ended, no
      significant financial instruments contained implicit or explicit terms
        that met the definitions of an embedded derivative component that needed

------------------------------------------                

     The Company has certain variable annuity contracts with GMDB and GMIB
features in-force that guarantee one of the following:          

     o    Return of Premium: the benefit is the greater of current account
value or premiums paid (adjusted for withdrawals);    

   o    Ratchet: the benefit is the greatest of current account value,
          premiums paid (adjusted for withdrawals), or the highest account
     value on any anniversary up to contractually specified ages
(adjusted for withdrawals);                           

    o    Roll-Up: the benefit is the greater of current account value or
 premiums paid (adjusted for withdrawals) accumulated at
         contractually specified interest rates up to specified ages; or

    o    Combo: the benefit is the greater of the ratchet benefit or the
        roll-up benefit which may include a five year or annual reset.

    The total account values of variable annuity contracts with GMDB and
  GMIB features include amounts allocated to the guaranteed interest
   option which is part of the General Account and variable investment
    options which invest through Separate Accounts in variable insurance
        trusts. The following table presents the aggregate fair value of assets,
    by major investment category, held by Separate Accounts that support
      variable annuity contracts with GMDB and GMIB benefits and guarantees.
    The investment performance of the assets impacts the related account
    values and, consequently, the net amount of risk associated with the
       GMDB and GMIB benefits and guarantees. Since variable annuity contracts
  with GMDB benefits and guarantees may also offer GMIB benefits and
     guarantees in each contract, the GMDB and GMIB amounts listed are not
mutually exclusive:

C) Hedging Programs for GMDB and GMIB Features                  
-------------------------------------------               

        In 2003, the Company initiated a program intended to provide an economic
   hedge against certain risks associated with the GMDB feature of the
       Accumulator(R) series of variable annuity products sold beginning April
    2002. In 2004, the program was expanded to provide an economic hedge
against certain risks associated with the GMIB feature of the   
       Accumulator(R) series of variable annuity products sold beginning 2004.
        This program currently utilizes a combination of exchange-traded futures
contracts and interest rate swap and floor contracts that are   
 dynamically managed in an effort to reduce the economic impact of
        unfavorable changes in GMDB and GMIB exposures attributable to movements
 in the equity and fixed income markets. At the present time, this
        program hedges such economic risks on products sold from 2001 forward to
        the extent such risks are not reinsured. At December 31, 2007, the total
        account value and net amount at risk of the hedged Accumulator(R) series
    of variable annuity contracts were $55,746 million and $744 million,
respectively, with the GMDB feature and $35,220 million and zero
million, respectively, with the GMIB feature.                   

       These programs do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS
        No. 133. Therefore, SFAS No. 133 requires gains or losses on the futures
     contracts used in these programs, including current period changes in
        fair value, to be recognized in investment income in the period in which
they occur, and may contribute to earnings volatility.          

      D)  Variable and Interest-Sensitive Life Insurance Policies - No Lapse
          ------------------------------------------------------------------
Guarantee                                               
---------                                               

The no lapse guarantee feature contained in variable and        
 interest-sensitive life insurance policies keeps them in force in
    situations where the policy value is not sufficient to cover monthly
     charges then due. The no lapse guarantee remains in effect so long as
   the policy meets a contractually specified premium funding test and
certain other requirements.                                     

 The following table summarizes the no lapse guarantee liabilities
    reflected in the General Account in Future policy benefits and other
policyholders liabilities, and the related reinsurance ceded:

9)     REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS                                                   

      The Insurance Group assumes and cedes reinsurance with other insurance
       companies. The Insurance Group evaluates the financial condition of its
        reinsurers to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer
        insolvencies. Ceded reinsurance does not relieve the originating insurer
of liability.                                                   

      The Insurance Group reinsures most of its new variable life, universal
life and term life policies on an excess of retention basis. The
        Insurance Group maintains a maximum retention on each single life policy
       of $25 million and on each second-to-die policy of $30 million with the
excess 100% reinsured. For certain segments of its business, the
       Insurance Group ceded 40% of the business underwritten by AXA Equitable
on a guaranteed or simplified issue basis was ceded on a yearly 
        renewable term basis. The Insurance Group also reinsures the entire risk
     on certain substandard underwriting risks and in certain other cases.
Likewise, certain risks that would otherwise be reinsured on a  
proportional basis have been retained.                          

At December 31, 2007, the Company had reinsured in the aggregate
     approximately 24.8% of its current exposure to the GMDB obligation on
     annuity contracts in-force and, subject to certain maximum amounts or
    caps in any one period, approximately 74.1% of its current liability
exposure resulting from the GMIB feature. See Note 8 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.                              

 Based on management's estimates of future contract cash flows and
        experience, the estimated fair values of the GMIB reinsurance contracts,
        considered derivatives under SFAS No. 133, at December 31, 2007 and 2006
  were $124.7 million and $117.8 million, respectively. The increase
        (decrease) in estimated fair value was $6.9 million, $(14.8) million and
$42.6 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.            

     At December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, reinsurance recoverables
  related to insurance contracts amounted to $2.89 billion and $2.69
     billion. Reinsurance payables related to insurance contracts totaling
        $58.7 million and $54.2 million are included in other liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets.                                    

        The Insurance Group cedes substantially all of its group life and health
      business to a third party insurer. Insurance liabilities ceded totaled
$239.6 million and $262.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.                                                   

       The Insurance Group also cedes a portion of its extended term insurance
  and paid up life insurance and substantially all of its individual
  disability income business through various coinsurance agreements.

   The Insurance Group has also assumed accident, health, aviation and
       space risks by participating in or reinsuring various reinsurance pools
    and arrangements. In addition to the sale of insurance products, the
    Insurance Group currently acts as a professional retrocessionaire by
   assuming life reinsurance from professional reinsurers. Reinsurance
      assumed reserves at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $642.8 million and
$639.3 million, respectively.

   On July 9, 2004, AXA and certain of its subsidiaries, including AXA
   Financial, entered into a (euro)3.5 billion global revolving credit
        facility which matures July 9, 2009, with a group of 30 commercial banks
       and other lenders. Under the terms of the revolving credit facility, up
     to $500.0 million is available to AXA Financial for general corporate
purposes.                                                       

      AXA Equitable has a $350.0 million, one-year promissory note, of which
   $101.7 million is included within Wind-up Annuities. The promissory
  note, which matures in March 2008, is related to wholly owned real
       estate. Certain terms of the promissory note, such as interest rate and
      maturity date, are negotiated annually. At December 31, 2007 and 2006,
  AXA Equitable had pledged real estate of $322.0 million and $326.0
million, respectively, as collateral for the promissory note.   

  In February 2006, AllianceBernstein entered into an $800.0 million
        five-year revolving credit facility with a group of commercial banks and
other lenders. In November 2007, AllianceBernstein increased the
 revolving credit facility by $200.0 million. The revolving credit
facility is intended to provide back-up liquidity for           
  AllianceBernstein's commercial paper program, which increased from
        $425.0 million to $800.0 million in May 2006. Under the revolving credit
     facility, the interest rate, at the option of AllianceBernstein, is a
       floating rate generally based upon a defined prime rate, a rate related
   to the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or the Federal Funds
        rate. The revolving credit facility contains covenants that, among other
   things, require AllianceBernstein to meet certain financial ratios.
     AllianceBernstein was in compliance with the covenants as of December
31, 2007.                                                       

      As of December 31, 2007, AllianceBernstein maintained a $100.0 million
extendible commercial notes ("ECN") program as a supplement to  
 AllianceBernstein's commercial paper program. ECNs are short-term
  uncommitted debt instruments that do not require back-up liquidity
support.                                                        

      In 2006, SCB LLC entered into four separate uncommitted line of credit
       facility agreements with various banks, each for $100.0 million. During
      2007, SCB LLC increased three of the agreements to $200.0 million each
      and entered into an additional agreement for $100.0 million with a new
      bank. As of December 31, 2007, no amounts were outstanding under these
credit facilities.                                              

Long-term Debt                                                  
--------------                                                  

At December 31, 2007, the Company was not in breach of any debt 
covenants.                                                      

11)     RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS                                              

        The Company reimburses AXA Financial for expenses relating to the Excess
   Retirement Plan, Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and certain
    other employee benefit plans that provide participants with medical,
      life insurance, and deferred compensation benefits. Such reimbursement
     was based on the cost to AXA Financial of the benefits provided which
     totaled $63.1 million, $53.5 million and $57.2 million, respectively,
for 2007, 2006 and 2005.                                        

   The Company paid $806.9 million, $767.2 million and $695.0 million,
 respectively, of commissions and fees to AXA Distribution and its
     subsidiaries for sales of insurance products for 2007, 2006 and 2005.
   The Company charged AXA Distribution's subsidiaries $340.2 million,
     $352.9 million and $324.4 million, respectively, for their applicable
    share of operating expenses for 2007, 2006 and 2005, pursuant to the
Agreements for Services.                                        

       In September 2001, AXA Equitable loaned $400.0 million to AXA Insurance
    Holding Co. Ltd., a Japanese subsidiary of AXA. This investment both
       matured and was repaid on June 15, 2007 and had interest rate of 5.89%.

      In 2005, AXA Equitable issued a note to AXA Financial in the amount of
    $325.0 million with an interest rate of 6.00% and a maturity date of
 December 1, 2035. Interest on this note is payable semi-annually.

      In September 2007, AXA issued $650.0 million in 5.40% senior unsecured
  notes to AXA Equitable. These notes pay interest semi-annually and
mature on September 30, 2012.

    In 2003, AXA Equitable entered into a reinsurance agreement with AXA
Financial Reinsurance Company (Bermuda), LTD ("AXA Bermuda"), an
        indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of AXA Financial, to cede certain term
   insurance policies written after December 2002. AXA Equitable ceded
     $113.1 million, $91.9 million and $57.9 million of premiums and $91.3
       million, $49.1 million and $26.3 million of reinsurance reserves to AXA
Bermuda in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.                   

        Various AXA affiliates cede a portion of their life and health insurance
business through reinsurance agreements to AXA Cessions, an AXA 
     affiliated reinsurer. AXA Cessions, in turn, retrocedes a quota share
 portion of these risks to AXA Equitable on a one-year term basis.
Premiums earned in 2007 and 2006 under this arrangement totaled 
approximately $1.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively.      

Both AXA Equitable and AllianceBernstein, along with other AXA  
        affiliates, participate in certain intercompany cost sharing and service
agreements including technology and professional development    
   arrangements. AXA Equitable and AllianceBernstein incurred expenses
     under such agreements of approximately $143.6 million, $127.5 million
and $119.7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Expense
    reimbursements by AXA and AXA affiliates to AXA Equitable under such
       agreements totaled approximately $58.4 million, $53.8 million and $55.9
        million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The net receivable related
       to these contracts was approximately $25.3 million and $25.8 million at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.                       

Commissions, fees and other income included certain revenues for
     services provided to mutual funds managed by AllianceBernstein. These
revenues are described below:

12)     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS                                                  

 The Company (other than AllianceBernstein) sponsors qualified and
        non-qualified defined benefit plans covering substantially all employees
       (including certain qualified part-time employees), managers and certain
       agents. On December 31, 2007, the Company transferred the liability for
       a non-qualified defined benefit plan to AXA Financial in exchange for a
   non-cash capital contribution totaling $13.5 million. These pension
 plans are non-contributory and their benefits are based on a cash
      balance formula and/or, for certain participants, years of service and
final average earnings over a specified period in the plans.    
  AllianceBernstein maintains a qualified, non-contributory, defined
      benefit retirement plan covering current and former employees who were
      employed by AllianceBernstein in the United States prior to October 2,
2000. AllianceBernstein's benefits are based on years of credited
     service and average final base salary. The Company uses a December 31
measurement date for its pension and postretirement plans.      

Generally, the Company's funding policy is to make the minimum  
       contribution required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
      1974 ("ERISA"). The Company made cash contributions of $4.8 million in
        2007. No significant cash contributions to the Company's qualified plans
are expected to be required to satisfy their minimum funding    
requirements for 2008.

 At December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158, requiring
       recognition, in the consolidated balance sheet, of the funded status of
     its defined benefit pension plans, measured as the difference between
    plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligations. The

  The primary investment objective of the plans of the Company is to
    maximize return on assets, giving consideration to prudent risk. The
       asset allocation is designed with a long-term investment horizon, based
   on target investment of 65% equities, 25% fixed income and 10% real
   estate. Emphasis is given to equity investments, given their higher
 expected rate of return. Fixed income investments are included to
        provide less volatile return. Real estate investments offer diversity to
the total portfolio and long-term inflation protection.         

  A secondary investment objective of the plans of the Company is to
    minimize variation in annual net periodic pension cost over the long
     term and to fund as much of the future liability growth as practical.
    Specifically, a reasonable total rate of return is defined as income
   plus realized and unrealized capital gains and losses such that the
 growth in projected benefit obligation is less than the return on
investments plus contributions.                                 

        The assumed discount rates for measurement of the benefit obligations at
  December 31, 2007 and 2006 each reflect the rates at which pension
        benefits then could be effectively settled. Specifically at December 31,
2007, projected nominal cash outflows to fund expected annual benefits
    payments under the Company's qualified and non-qualified pension and
postretirement benefit plans were discounted using a published  
   high-quality bond yield curve. The discount rate of 6.25% disclosed
        below as having been used to measure the benefits obligation at December
31, 2007 represents the level equivalent discount rate that produces the
same present value measure of the benefits obligation as the    
 aforementioned discounted cash flow analysis. The following table
        discloses the weighted-average assumptions used to measure the Company's
        pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost at and for the
years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

 As noted above, the pension plans' target asset allocation is 65%
        equities, 25% fixed maturities, and 10% real estate. Management reviewed
    the historical investment returns and future expectations of returns
      from these asset classes to conclude that a long-term expected rate of
return of 8.5% is reasonable.                                   

     Prior to 1987, the pension plan funded participants' benefits through
       the purchase of non-participating annuity contracts from AXA Equitable.
        Benefit payments under these contracts were approximately $18.9 million,
      $20.3 million and $21.7 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

      The following table sets forth an estimate of future benefits expected
     to be paid in each of the next five years, beginning January 1, 2008,
       and in the aggregate for the five years thereafter. These estimates are
    based on the same assumptions used to measure the respective benefit
     obligations at December 31, 2007 and include benefits attributable to
estimated future employee service.

      AllianceBernstein maintains several unfunded deferred compensation plans
for the benefit of certain eligible employees and executives. The 
    AllianceBernstein Capital Accumulation Plan was frozen on December 31,
 1987 and no additional awards have been made. For the active plans,
     benefits vest over a period ranging from 3 to 8 years and are amortized
       as compensation and benefit expense. ACMC, Inc. ("ACMC"), a subsidiary of
the Company, is obligated to make capital contributions to        
AllianceBernstein in amounts equal to benefits paid under the     
      AllianceBernstein Capital Accumulation Plan and the contractual unfunded
       deferred compensation arrangements. In connection with the acquisition of
       Bernstein, AllianceBernstein adopted SCB Deferred Compensation Award Plan
       ("SCB Plan") and agreed to invest $96.0 million per annum for three years
     to fund purchases of AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. ("AllianceBernstein
    Holding") units or an AllianceBernstein sponsored money market fund in
       each case for the benefit of certain individuals who were stockholders or
principals of Bernstein or hired to replace them. The Company has 
 recorded compensation and benefit expenses in connection with these
     deferred compensation plans totaling $289.1 million, $243.8 million and
$186.2 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.             

13)      SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION                                               

        AXA and AXA Financial sponsor various share-based compensation plans for
        eligible employees and associates of AXA Financial and its subsidiaries,
   including the Company. AllianceBernstein also sponsors its own unit
        option plans for certain of its employees. Activity in these share-based
 plans in the discussions that follow relates to awards granted to
       eligible employees and associates of AXA Financial and its subsidiaries
  under each of these plans in the aggregate, except where otherwise
noted.                                                          

    For 2007 and 2006, respectively, the Company recognized compensation
     costs for share-based payment arrangements of $81.2 and $64.3 million
     before income taxes and minority interest. Effective January 1, 2006,
the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment", that
      required compensation costs for these programs to be recognized in the
consolidated financial statements on a fair value basis.        

    The Company recognized compensation costs of $38.8 million and $24.8
   million for employee stock options for 2007 and 2006, respectively.
       Prior to adopting SFAS No. 123 (R), the Company had elected to continue
 accounting for employee stock option awards under APB No. 25 and,
        therefore, no compensation costs for these awards had been recognized in
     the consolidated statement of earnings in 2005. On a pro-forma basis,
 net earnings as reported in 2005 would have been reduced by $23.2
million, net of income tax benefit, had compensation expense for
        employee stock option awards been measured and recognized by the Company
        under the fair-value method of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation".                                                  

  On May 10, 2007, approximately 3.1 million options to purchase AXA
        ordinary shares were granted under the terms of the Stock Option Plan at
    an exercise price of 34.61 euros, of which approximately 2.3 million

        have a four-year graded vesting schedule, with one-third vesting on each
     of the second, third, and fourth anniversaries of the grant date, and
       approximately 0.8 million have a four-year cliff vesting term. The last
       tranche of awards exceeding 5,000 options, or approximately 0.5 million
       options in total, are subject to conditional vesting terms that require
   the AXA ordinary share price to outperform the Euro Stoxx Insurance
        index measured between May 10, 2007 and May 10, 2011. All of the options
      granted on May 10, 2007 have a ten-year contractual term. Beginning at
   the grant date, the total fair value of this award, net of expected
       forfeitures, of approximately $25.5 million, is charged to expense over
       the shorter of the vesting term or to the date at which the participant
becomes retirement eligible.                                    

        The number of AXA ADRs authorized to be issued pursuant to option grants
      and, as further described below, restricted stock grants under The AXA
      Financial, Inc. 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Stock Incentive Plan")
        is approximately 124.5 million less the number of shares issued pursuant
        to option grants under The AXA Financial, Inc. 1991 Stock Incentive Plan
    (the predecessor plan to the Stock Incentive Plan). A summary of the
     activity in the AXA, AXA Financial and AllianceBernstein option plans
during 2007 follows:

(1)      Intrinsic  value,  presented in millions,  is calculated as the excess 
     of the closing  market price on December 31, 2007 of the respective
underlying shares over the strike prices of the option awards.
(2)      Approximately 19,500 options on AllianceBernstein Holding units were   
forfeited in 2007.                                            

     Cash proceeds received from employee exercises of options to purchase
    AXA ADRs in 2007 were $178.4 million. The intrinsic value related to
        employee exercises of options to purchase AXA ADRs during 2007, 2006 and
2005 were $141.4 million, $132.1 million and $68.3 million,     
        respectively, resulting in amounts currently deductible for tax purposes
        of $48.0 million, $44.9 million and $22.9 million, respectively, for the
periods then ended. Under SFAS No. 123(R), windfall tax benefits
        resulting from employee stock option exercises during 2007 and 2006 were
$34.3 million and $34.8 million, respectively.                  

At December 31, 2007, AXA Financial held 4.8 million AXA ADRs in
       treasury at a weighted average cost of approximately $24.33 per ADR, of
        which approximately 4.6 million were designated to fund future exercises
        of outstanding employee stock options and the remainder of approximately
0.2 million units was available for general corporate purposes, 
    including funding other stock-based compensation programs. These AXA

F-40

      ADRs were obtained primarily by exercise of call options that had been
       purchased by AXA Financial beginning in fourth quarter 2004 to mitigate
        the U.S. dollar price and foreign exchange risks associated with funding
exercises of employee stock options. Remaining outstanding and  
 unexercised at December 31, 2007 are call options to purchase 8.6
     million AXA ADRs at strike prices ranging from $31.39 to $32.37, each
      having a cap equal to approximately 150% of its strike price, at which
    time the option automatically would be exercised. These call options
expire on November 23, 2009. During 2007, AXA Financial utilized
     approximately 4.4 million AXA ADRs from treasury to fund exercises of
    employee stock options. Outstanding employee options to purchase AXA
ordinary shares began to become exercisable on March 29, 2007,  
       coincident with the second anniversary of the first award made in 2005,
     and exercises of these awards are funded by newly issued AXA ordinary
shares.                                                         

     For the purpose of estimating the fair value of employee stock option
    awards granted on or after January 1, 2007, the Company continues to
     apply the Black-Scholes-Merton formula and the same methodologies for
       developing the input assumptions as previously had been used to prepare
 the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS No. 123. A Monte-Carlo
       simulation approach was used to model the fair value of the conditional
    vesting feature of the May 10, 2007 award of options to purchase AXA
       ordinary shares. Shown below are the relevant input assumptions used to
 derive the fair values of options awarded in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
      respectively. For employee stock options with graded vesting terms and
   service conditions granted on or after January 1, 2006, the Company
        elected under SFAS No. 123(R) to retain its practice of valuing these as
singular awards and to change to the graded-vesting method of   
attribution, whereby the cost is recognized separately over the 
     requisite service period for each individual one-third of the options
        vesting on the second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date.

    As of December 31, 2007, approximately $66.3 million of unrecognized
       compensation cost related to unvested employee stock option awards, net
     of estimated pre-vesting forfeitures, is expected to be recognized by
the Company over a weighted average period of 6.2 years.        

        Under the Stock Incentive Plan, AXA Financial grants restricted AXA ADRs
to employees of its subsidiaries. Awards of restricted AXA ADRs 
        outstanding at December 31, 2007 include grants that vest ratably over a
       three-five year period as well as grants with a seven year term vesting
    schedule and potential for accelerated vesting based on performance.
      Under The Equity Plan for Directors (the "Equity Plan"), AXA Financial
     grants non-officer directors restricted AXA ADRs and unrestricted AXA
ADRs annually. Similarly, AllianceBernstein awards restricted   
       AllianceBernstein Holding units to independent directors of its General
       Partner. In addition, under its Century Club Plan, awards of restricted
      AllianceBernstein Holding units that vest ratably over three years are
made to eligible AllianceBernstein employees whose primary      
       responsibilities are to assist in the distribution of company-sponsored
mutual funds. For 2007, 2006 and 2005 the Company recognized    
  compensation costs of $8.6 million and $5.6 million under SFAS No.
    123(R), and $10.1 million under APB No. 25, respectively, for awards
       outstanding under these plans. Consistent with existing practice of the
   Company prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), grant-date fair value
       continues to be measured by the closing price of the shares awarded and
      the result generally is attributed over the shorter of the performance
        period, the requisite service period, or to the date at which retirement
        eligibility is achieved and subsequent service no longer is required for
continued vesting of the award.

    At December 31, 2007, approximately 482,501 restricted awards remain
     unvested, including 73,990 restricted AllianceBernstein Holding units
     under the Century Club Plan. At December 31, 2007, approximately $4.2
   million of unrecognized compensation cost related to these unvested
   awards, net of estimated pre-vesting forfeitures, is expected to be
      recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years. Restricted AXA
  ADRs vested in 2007, 2006 and 2005 had aggregate vesting date fair
      values of approximately $7.0 million, $13.5 million and $19.2 million,
        respectively. In 2006, 78,865 restricted AXA ADRs were granted having an
    aggregate grant-date fair value of $2.8 million. The following table
summarizes unvested restricted AXA ADR activity for 2007.

       On July 1, 2007, under the terms of the AXA Miles Program 2007, the AXA
  Management Board granted 50 AXA Miles to every employee of AXA for
        purpose of enhancing long-term employee-shareholder engagement. Each AXA
        Mile represents the right to receive one unrestricted AXA ordinary share
       on July 1, 2011, conditional only upon continued employment with AXA at
   the close of the four-year cliff vesting period with exceptions for
  retirement, death, and disability. For AXA Financial participants,
       settlement of the right to receive each unrestricted AXA ordinary share
       will be made in the form of an AXA ADR. The fair value of approximately
      449,400 AXA Miles awarded to employees of AXA Financial's subsidiaries
      was approximately $9.8 million, measured as the market equivalent of a
    vested AXA ordinary share. Beginning on July 1, 2007, the total fair
      value of this award, net of expected forfeitures, is expensed over the
   shorter of the vesting term or to the date at which the participant
becomes retirement eligible. For 2007, the Company recognized   
     compensation expense of approximately $2.7 million in respect of this
 grant of AXA Miles. Provided AXA achieves certain performance and
       customer satisfaction goals, an additional 50 AXA Miles per employee is
targeted for award in 2009 under terms then-to-be-determined and
approved by the AXA Management Board.                           

       On May 10, 2007, under the terms of the AXA Performance Unit Plan 2007,
the AXA Management Board awarded approximately 546,246 unearned 
    performance units to employees of AXA Financial subsidiaries. During
      each year that the performance unit awards are outstanding, a pro-rata
  portion of the units may be earned based on criteria measuring the
performance of AXA and AXA Financial Group. The extent to which 
      performance targets are met determines the number of performance units
       earned, which may vary between 0% and 130% of the number of performance
       units at stake. Performance units earned under the 2007 plan cliff-vest
        on the second anniversary of their date of award. When fully-vested, the
     performance units earned will be settled in cash, or in some cases, a
    combination of cash (70%) and stock (30%), the latter equity portion
        having transfer restrictions for a two-year period. For 2007 awards, the
   price used to value the performance units at settlement will be the
       average opening price of the AXA ordinary share for the last 20 trading
      days of the vesting period converted to U.S. dollars using the Euro to
U.S. dollar exchange rate on May 8, 2009. For 2007, the Company 
        recognized compensation expense of approximately $3.3 million in respect
of the May 10, 2007 grant of performance units.                 

     For 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized compensation costs of
       $11.6 million and $25.9 million under SFAS No. 123(R), and $7.2 million
     under APB No. 25, respectively, for performance units earned to date.
  Substantially similar to existing practice of the Company prior to
     adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the change in fair value of these awards
   now is measured by the closing price of the underlying AXA ordinary
        shares or AXA ADRs with adjustment to reflect the impact of expected and
        actual pre-vesting forfeitures. In addition, similar to adoption of SFAS
    No. 123(R) for employee stock option awards, the cost of performance
  units awarded on or after January 1, 2006 were attributed over the
      shorter of the cliff-vesting period or to the date at which retirement
  eligibility is achieved. The value of performance units earned and
   reported in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at
December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $31.1 million and $45.8 million, 
     respectively, including incremental awards earned under the 2006 plan
     from having exceeded the targeted performance criteria established in
that year by 11.5% as well as an estimated 10.0% increment for  

F-42

     2007 performance. Approximately 595,317 outstanding performance units
  are at risk to achievement of 2007 performance criteria, including
approximately 50% of the award granted on May 10, 2007.         

 On March 25, 2007 and March 28, 2007, respectively, approximately
    364,620 performance units earned under the AXA Performance Unit Plan
     2004 and approximately 545,076 performance units earned under the AXA
Performance Unit Plan 2005 were fully vested for total value of 
     approximately $37.9 million, including incremental units earned under
      each of these plans from having exceeded the targeted 2006 performance
       criteria by 11.5%. Distributions to participants were made on April 12,
2007, resulting in cash settlements of approximately 84% of these
        performance units for aggregate value of approximately $31.7 million and
equity settlements of the remainder with approximately 147,848  
      restricted AXA ADRs for aggregate value of approximately $6.3 million.
These AXA ADRs were sourced from shares held by AXA Financial in
treasury.                                                       

      In January 2001, certain employees exchanged fully vested in-the-money
AXA ADR options for tandem Stock Appreciation Rights/AXA ADR    
       non-statutory options ("tandem SARs/NSOs") of then-equivalent intrinsic
       value. The Company recorded compensation expense for these fully-vested
awards of $6.1 million and $28.9 million for 2006 and 2005,     
     respectively, reflecting the impact in those periods of the change in
        the market price of the AXA ADR on the cash-settlement value of the SARs
      component of the outstanding tandem SARs/NSOs: no expense was recorded
for these awards in 2007. The value of these tandem SARs/NSOs at
December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $17.7 million and $24.9 million, 
     respectively. At December 31, 2007, 1.1 million tandem SARs/NSOs were
       outstanding, having weighted average remaining expected and contractual
  terms of 1.11 and 2.22 years, respectively, and for which the SARs
   component had maximum value of $17.7 million. During 2007, 2006 and
  2005, respectively, approximately 0.4 million, 2.8 million and 0.7
       million, of these awards were exercised at an aggregate cash-settlement
value of $7.2 million, $41.2 million and $7.5 million.          

        On May 10, 2007, 66,550 Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs") with a 4-year
cliff-vesting schedule were granted to certain associates of AXA
       Financial subsidiaries. These SARs entitle the holder to a cash payment
     equal to any appreciation in the value of the AXA ordinary share over
        34.61 Euros as of the date of exercise. Similar to the SARs component of
     the tandem SARs/NSOs, awards remaining unexercised at expiry of their
10-year contractual term will be automatically exercised on the 
expiration date. At December 31, 2007, 0.3 million SARs were    
       outstanding, having weighted average remaining contractual term of 6.27
       years. The accrued value of SARs at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $3.5
      million and $2.9 million, respectively, and recorded as liabilities in
        the consolidated balance sheets. For 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded
compensation expense for SARs of $1.1 million and $1.9 million, 
  respectively, under SFAS No. 123(R) reflecting the impact in those
     periods of the changes in their fair values as determined by applying
       the Black Scholes-Merton formula and assumptions used to price employee
        stock option awards. For 2005, the Company recorded compensation expense
       of $0.6 million under APB No. 25 reflecting the impact in the period of
      the change in the market price of the underlying AXA ordinary share or
AXA ADR on the value of the outstanding SARs.                   

For 2007, eligible employees of AXA Financial's subsidiaries    
  participated in AXA's global offering to purchase newly issued AXA
     stock, subject to plan limits, under the terms of AXA Shareplan 2007.
        Similar to the AXA Shareplan programs previously offered in 2001 through
     2006, the plan offered two investment alternatives that, with limited
       exceptions, restrict the sale or transfer of the purchased shares for a
     period of five years. "Investment Option A" permitted participants to
       purchase AXA ADRs at a 20% formula discounted price. "Investment Option
     B" permitted participants to purchase AXA ordinary shares at a 14.25%
      formula discounted price on a leveraged basis with a guaranteed return
      of initial investment plus 75% of any appreciation in the value of the
     total shares purchased. Under SFAS No. 123(R), the Company recognized
      compensation expense of $27.7 million in 2007, primarily in connection
     with AXA Shareplan 2007, and $22.1 million in 2006 in connection with
   AXA Shareplan 2006, representing the aggregate discount provided to
       participants for their purchase of AXA stock under each of those plans,
as adjusted for the post-vesting, five-year holding period. No  
   compensation expense was recorded in 2005 in connection with shares
        subscribed under that year's AXA Shareplan offering. Participants in AXA
  Shareplans 2007, 2006 and 2005 primarily invested under Investment
       Option B for the purchase of approximately 5.3 million, 5.0 million and
5.7 million AXA ordinary shares, respectively.                  

    In 1997, AllianceBernstein Holding established a long-term incentive
compensation plan under which unit-based awards are made to key 
        employees for terms established by AllianceBernstein Holding at the time
    of grant. These awards include options, restricted AllianceBernstein
     Holding units and phantom restricted AllianceBernstein Holding units,
  performance awards, and other AllianceBernstein Holding unit based

       awards. The aggregate number of AllianceBernstein Holding units subject
      to options granted or otherwise awarded under this plan, as amended in
     December 2006 to include awards made to select participants under the
    Special Option Program, may not exceed 41.0 million. At December 31,
2007, approximately 14.5 million options to purchase AllianceBernstein
    Holding units and 1.1 million other unit awards, net of forfeitures,
were subject to the aggregate allowable maximum under this plan.

  (1) In 2007, AllianceBernstein issued units to its employees under
       long-term incentive plans. As a result of this transaction, the
            company recorded a non-cash realized gain of $17.7 million and $29.7
million for 2007 and 2006 respectively.                 

       Writedowns of fixed maturities amounted to $79.0 million, $27.4 million
      and $31.2 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Writedowns of
    mortgage loans on real estate were $0.4 million and $1.7 million for
   2006 and 2005, respectively; there were no such writedowns in 2007.
       There were no writedowns on equity real estate for 2007, 2006 and 2005.

    For 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, proceeds received on sales of
      fixed maturities classified as available for sale amounted to $1,554.6
    million, $1,281.9 million and $2,220.0 million. Gross gains of $12.6
million,

$33.9 million and $53.2 million and gross losses of $20.3       
        million, $24.5 million and $31.1 million, respectively, were realized on
       these sales. The change in unrealized investment gains (losses) related
       to fixed maturities classified as available for sale for 2007, 2006 and
  2005 amounted to $(376.4) million, $(416.7) million and $(1,004.8)
million, respectively.                                          

     For 2007, 2006 and 2005, investment results passed through to certain
participating group annuity contracts as interest credited to   
        policyholders' account balances amounted to $52.7 million, $57.8 million
and $68.6 million, respectively.                                

     Changes in unrealized gains (losses) reflect changes in fair value of
only those fixed maturities and equity securities classified as 
  available for sale and do not reflect any changes in fair value of
policyholders' account balances and future policy benefits.

        The Company recognized a net tax benefit in 2006 of $117.7 million. This
      benefit was related to the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service's
        ("IRS") audit of the 1997-2001 tax years, partially offset by additional
   tax reserves established for subsequent tax periods. Of the net tax
   benefit of $117.7 million, $111.9 million related to the continuing
  operations and $5.8 million to the discontinued Wind-up Annuities.

        On August 16, 2007, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2007-54 that purported
   to change accepted industry and IRS interpretations of the statutes
    governing the computation of the Separate Account dividends received
     deduction ("DRD"). This ruling was suspended on September 25, 2007 in
Revenue Ruling 2007-61 and the U.S. Department of the Treasury  
        ("Treasury") indicated that it would address the computational issues in
       a regulation project. Any regulations that Treasury ultimately proposes
       for issuance in this area will be subject to public notice and comment,
      at which time insurance companies and other members of the public will
     have the opportunity to raise legal and practical questions about the
       content, scope and application of such regulations. The ultimate timing
        and substance of any such regulations are unknown, but they could result
 in the elimination of some or all of the Separate Account DRD tax
benefit that the Company receives.                              

The components of the net deferred income taxes are as follows:

  The IRS is currently examining the Company's 2002 and 2003 Federal
corporate income tax returns.                                   

      As a result of the implementation of FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, the
Company recognized a $44.8 million decrease in the amount of    
        unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to the
 January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The total amount of
        unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007 was $371.3 million. Of that
   total, $276.9 million would affect the effective tax rate and $94.4
        million are tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly
   certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such
      deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other
        than interest and penalties, the change in timing of the deduction would
 not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
        payment of cash to the taxing authority. At December 31, 2007, the total
      amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $412.2 million of which $301.9
        million would affect the effective rate and $110.3 million was temporary
in nature.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. Interest and penalties
    included in the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
2007 and January 1, 2007 were $68.6 million and $46.1 million,  
      respectively. Tax expense for 2007 reflected $22.5 million in interest
related to unrecognized tax benefits                            

     A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and
penalties) follows:

    It is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax
       benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve
    months due to the conclusion of the current IRS audits. The possible
        change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be estimated at
this time.

 In accordance with their October 2006 agreement, during 2007, AXA
 Financial and its subsidiaries, AXA Equitable, Enterprise Capital
       Management, Inc. ("Enterprise") and Enterprise Fund Distributors, Inc.,
   ("EFD") transferred to Goldman Sachs Asset Management L.P. ("GSAM")
      assets of the business of serving as sponsor of and investment manager
     to 27 of the 31 funds of AXA Enterprise Multimanager Funds Trust, AXA
Enterprise Funds Trust and The Enterprise Group of Funds, Inc.  
(collectively, the "AXA Enterprise Funds") and completed the    
     reorganization of such funds to corresponding mutual funds managed by
       GSAM. Of the remaining four funds not included in the GSAM transaction,
 one fund was liquidated during 2007 and the three remaining funds
       together had approximately $661.9 million in assets under management as
        of December 31, 2007. AXA Financial has since entered into agreements to
     transfer the remaining funds. As a result of management's disposition
plan, AXA Enterprise Funds advisory contracts are reported as   
     Discontinued Operations. In 2007 and 2006, respectively, $0.7 million
pre-tax ($0.4 million post-tax) and

      $3.0 million pre-tax ($1.9 million post-tax) of transaction costs were
       recorded as a result of the disposition of the funds. Proceeds received
 in 2007 on the transfer of the AXA Enterprise Funds totaled $26.3
million.                                                        

   In 2007 and 2006, respectively, impairments of $0.7 million pre-tax
        ($0.4 million post-tax) and $4.1 million pre-tax ($2.7 million post-tax)
        were recorded on intangible assets associated with investment management
   contracts based upon estimated fair value. At December 31, 2007 and
  2006, total assets related to these operations were zero and $26.5
     million, respectively, and were included in Other assets. At December
31, 2007 and 2006 there were no liabilities related to these operations.

     Both the gross and net of accumulated amortization carrying amount of
  AXA Enterprise Funds related intangible assets were zero and $26.5
 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. There was no
       amortization expense related to the AXA Enterprise Funds for 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively.

       In 1991, management discontinued the business of Wind-up Annuities, the
terms of which were fixed at issue, which were sold to corporate
       sponsors of terminated qualified defined benefit plans, and for which a
        premium deficiency reserve and an allowance for future losses based upon
projected future cash flows had been established.

        The Company's quarterly process for evaluating the need for an allowance
        for future losses involves comparison of the current period's results of
     Wind-up Annuities to previous projections and re-estimation of future
      expected losses, if appropriate, to determine whether an adjustment is
  required. Investment and benefit cash flow projections are updated
        annually as part of the Company's annual planning process. These updated
       assumptions and estimates resulted in releases of the allowance in 2006
      and 2005. If the Company's analysis in any given period indicates that
   an allowance for future losses is not necessary, any current period
        Wind-up Annuities' operating losses are deferred to the extent that such
 losses are expected to be offset by reasonably assured future net
 investing and operating cash flows. Management believes the $18.0
       million of deferred operating losses at December 31, 2007 are offset by
    projections of reasonably assured future net investing and operating
cash flows.                                                     

  The determination of projected future cash flows involves numerous
        estimates and subjective judgments regarding the expected performance of
     invested assets held by Wind-up Annuities and the expected run-off of
      Wind-up Annuities liabilities. There can be no assurance the projected
future cash flows will not differ from the cash flows ultimately
       realized. To the extent actual results or future projections of Wind-up
       Annuities are lower than management's current estimates and assumptions
      and result in deferred operating losses not being offset by reasonably
     assured future net investing and operating cash flows, the difference
        would be reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings in Wind-up
  Annuities. In particular, to the extent income, sales proceeds and
        holding periods for equity real estate differ from management's previous
    assumptions, periodic adjustments to the loss allowance liability or
deferred operating loss asset, as applicable, may result.       

        Income tax expense for Wind-up Annuities in 2006 included a $5.8 million
    tax benefit in connection with the settlement of an IRS audit of the
1997-2001 tax years.                                            

Real Estate Held-For-Sale

    In 2007 two real estate properties with a total book value of $172.7
       million and in 2006 one real estate property with a total book value of
     $34.3 million that had been previously reported in equity real estate
      was reclassified as real estate held-for-sale. Prior periods have been
   restated to reflect these properties as discontinued operations. In
third quarter 2007, one of the held-for-sale properties was sold
        resulting in a gain of $4.9 million ($3.2 million post-tax). At December
31, 2007 and 2006, equity real estate held-for-sale was $121.7 million
   and $235.4 million, respectively, and was included in Other assets.

 At December 31, 2007, aggregate maturities of the long-term debt,
  including any current portion of long-term debt, based on required
     principal payments at maturity were $248.3 million for 2008, none for
2009-2012 and $200.0 million thereafter.

  The Company has entered into operating leases for office space and
      certain other assets, principally information technology equipment and
office furniture and equipment. Future minimum payments under   
      non-cancelable operating leases for 2008 and the four successive years
   are $196.6 million, $196.4 million, $190.8 million, $185.3 million,
       $152.0 million and $1,957.8 million thereafter. Minimum future sublease
       rental income on these non-cancelable operating leases for 2008 and the
       four successive years is $5.5 million, $5.2 million, $5.2 million, $4.8
million, $3.3 million and $13.2 million thereafter.             

        At December 31, 2007, the minimum future rental income on non-cancelable
     operating leases for wholly owned investments in real estate for 2008
       and the four successive years is $114.9 million, $115.6 million, $115.5
      million, $115.7 million, $116.0 million and $798.1 million thereafter.

   The Company has entered into capital leases for certain information
  technology equipment. Future minimum payments under non-cancelable
   capital leases for 2008 and 2009, the two remaining years, are $0.3
million and $ 0.2.

     The Company provides certain guarantees or commitments to affiliates,
       investors and others. At December 31, 2007, these arrangements included
        commitments by the Company to provide equity financing of $803.1 million
    to certain limited partnerships under certain conditions. Management
        believes the Company will not incur material losses as a result of these
commitments.                                                    

AXA Equitable is the obligor under certain structured settlement
        agreements it had entered into with unaffiliated insurance companies and
     beneficiaries. To satisfy its obligations under these agreements, AXA
   Equitable owns single premium annuities issued by previously wholly
     owned life insurance subsidiaries. AXA Equitable has directed payment
        under these annuities to be made directly to the beneficiaries under the
    structured settlement agreements. A contingent liability exists with
respect to these agreements should the previously wholly owned  
     subsidiaries be unable to meet their obligations. Management believes
  the need for AXA Equitable to satisfy those obligations is remote.

     The Company had $63.8 million of undrawn letters of credit related to
    reinsurance at December 31, 2007. AXA Equitable had $98.5 million in
   commitments under existing mortgage loan agreements at December 31,

 2007. In February 2002, AllianceBernstein signed a $125.0 million
  agreement with a commercial bank under which it guaranteed certain
      obligations of SCBL incurred in the ordinary course of its business in
the event SCBL is unable to meet these obligations. During 2007,
       AllianceBerstein was not required to perform under the agreement and at
     December 31, 2007 had no liability outstanding in connection with the

19)     LITIGATION                                                              

       A putative class action entitled STEFANIE HIRT, ET AL. V. THE EQUITABLE
       RETIREMENT PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES, MANAGERS AND AGENTS, ET AL. was filed in
       the District Court for the Southern District of New York in August 2001
        against The Equitable Retirement Plan for Employees, Managers and Agents
      (the "Retirement Plan") and The Officers Committee on Benefit Plans of
     Equitable Life, as Plan Administrator. The action was brought by five
        participants in the Retirement Plan and purports to be on behalf of "all
     Plan participants, whether active or retired, their beneficiaries and
    Estates, whose accrued benefits or pension benefits are based on the
  Plan's Cash Balance Formula". The complaint challenged the change,
      effective January 1, 1989, in the pension benefit formula from a final
      average pay formula to a cash balance formula. Plaintiffs alleged that
     the change to the cash balance formula violated ERISA by reducing the
   rate of accruals based on age, failed to comply with ERISA's notice
       requirements and improperly applied the formula to retroactively reduce
        accrued benefits. The relief sought includes a declaration that the cash
      balance plan violated ERISA, an order enjoining the enforcement of the
        cash balance formula, reformation and damages. In April 2002, plaintiffs
    filed a motion seeking to certify a class of "all Plan participants,
 whether active or retired, their beneficiaries and Estates, whose
 accrued benefits or pension benefits are based on the Plan's Cash
       Balance Formula". Also in April 2002, plaintiffs agreed to dismiss with
 prejudice their claim that the change to the cash balance formula
  violated ERISA by improperly applying the formula to retroactively
 reduce accrued benefits. That claim was dismissed. In March 2003,
  plaintiffs filed an amended complaint elaborating on the remaining
claims in the original complaint and adding additional class and
    individual claims alleging that the adoption and announcement of the
      cash balance formula and the subsequent announcement of changes in the
       application of the cash balance formula failed to comply with ERISA. By
      order dated May 2003, the District Court, as requested by the parties,
  certified the case as a class action, including a sub-class of all
 current and former Plan participants, whether active, inactive or
   retired, their beneficiaries or estates, who were subject to a 1991
     change in application of the cash balance formula. In September 2006,
       the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.
     The court ruled that (a) the cash balance provisions of the Equitable
   Plan do not violate the age discrimination provisions of ERISA, (b)
     while the notice of plan changes provided to participants in 1990 was
    not adequate, the notice of plan changes provided to participants in
   1992 satisfied the ERISA notice requirements regarding delivery and
 content, and (c) the claims of the named plaintiffs are barred by
   statute of limitations. The Court found that other individual class
       members were not precluded from asserting claims for additional benefit
       accruals from January 1991 through January 1993 to the extent that such
        individuals could show that the statute of limitations did not bar their
        claims. In October 2006, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. Defendants
have cross-appealed. The appeal has been fully briefed.         

       In April 2004, a purported nationwide class action lawsuit was filed in
the Circuit Court for Madison County, Illinois entitled MATTHEW 
        WIGGENHORN V. EQUITABLE LIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES. The
    lawsuit alleges that AXA Equitable uses stale prices for the foreign
    securities within the investment divisions of its variable insurance
   products. The complaint further alleges that AXA Equitable's use of
       stale pricing diluted the returns of the purported class. The complaint
        also alleges that AXA Equitable breached its fiduciary duty to the class
    by allowing market timing in general within AXA Equitable's variable
      insurance products, thereby diluting the returns of the class. In June
      2005, this case was transferred by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation to the U.S. District Court in Maryland, where other  
    market-timing related litigation is pending. In June 2005, plaintiff
      filed an amended complaint. In July 2005, AXA Equitable filed a motion
      to dismiss the amended complaint. In June 2006, AXA Equitable's motion
to dismiss the amended complaint was granted and, in June 2006, 
  plaintiff appealed. As of April 2007, the appeal is fully briefed.

  In June 2006, AXA Equitable received a demand for arbitration from
    Centre Life Insurance Company ("Centre Life") seeking to rescind the
      100% quota share reinsurance agreement, effective July 1, 2000 between
Centre Life and AXA Equitable, under which Centre Life reinsures
  portions of AXA Equitable's individual disability income insurance
    business. The arbitration demand alleges that AXA Equitable provided
      Centre Life with inaccurate and incomplete data upon which Centre Life
relied in order to establish the reinsurance premium paid by AXA
       Equitable as consideration in the transaction. The demand alternatively
     seeks damages for the increase in reserves Centre Life alleges it was
caused to record as a result

       of the difference in the data it originally relied upon and its present
       assessment of the data. The demand further alleges that Centre Life has
       paid expenses relating to the business in excess of its liability under
     the reinsurance agreement. In July 2007, Centre Life filed an amended
    arbitration claim, in which Centre Life alleges claims substantially
     similar to those included in the original arbitration claim and seeks
      damages of $191.4 million plus statutory interest and attorneys' fees.
The arbitration is scheduled for March 2008.                    

   A putative class action entitled EAGAN ET AL. V. AXA EQUITABLE LIFE
 INSURANCE COMPANY was filed in the District Court for the Central
     District of California in December 2006 against AXA Equitable as plan
      sponsor and fiduciary for an ERISA retiree health plan. The action was
  brought by two plan participants on behalf of all past and present
   employees and agents who received retiree medical benefits from AXA
     Equitable at any time after January 1, 2004, or who will receive such
       benefits in 2006 or later, excluding certain retired agents. Plaintiffs
        allege that AXA Equitable's adoption of a revised version of its retiree
      health plan in 1993 (the "1993 Plan") was not authorized or effective.
        Plaintiffs contend that AXA Equitable has therefore breached the retiree
    health plan by imposing the terms of the 1993 Plan on plaintiffs and
other retirees. Plaintiffs allege that, even if the 1993 Plan is
       controlling, AXA Equitable has violated the terms of the retiree health
        plan by imposing health care costs and coverages on plaintiffs and other
     retirees that are not authorized under the 1993 Plan. Plaintiffs also
      allege that AXA Equitable breached fiduciary duties owed to plaintiffs
 and retirees by allegedly misrepresenting and failing to disclose
information to them. The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages,  
restitution and injunctive relief prohibiting AXA Equitable from
      violating the terms of the applicable plan, together with interest and
        attorneys' fees. In March 2007, AXA Equitable filed a motion to dismiss.
In July 2007, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that (i)
        redefined the scope of the class to now include all retired employee and
    independent contractor agents formerly employed by AXA Equitable who
    received medical benefits after December 1, 2000 or who will receive
       such benefits in the future, excluding certain retired agents, and (ii)
    eliminated the claim based on a breach of fiduciary duty and certain
     claims related to health care costs. In September 2007, AXA Equitable
       filed its answer to the amended complaint. In October 2007, a discovery
and motion schedule was set, with a trial date of May 2009.     

      AXA Equitable and/or AXA Advisors LLC is currently the subject of four
     putative class actions pending in Federal court alleging certain wage
     and hour violations with regard to certain sales personnel. The cases
       were filed between July 2006 and September 2007. Each of the cases seek
    substantially the same relief under essentially the same theories of
      recovery: violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act for failure to pay
   minimum wage and overtime and violation of similar provisions under
 state labor laws in the respective states. In September 2007, the
    parties agreed to consolidate all four pending cases in the Northern
     District of California. The cases include the following: MEOLA V. AXA
        ADVISORS AND AXA EQUITABLE; LENNON V. AXA ADVISORS, ET AL.; BOLEA V. AXA
    ADVISORS, LLC AND AXA EQUITABLE, ET. AL.; AND DHRUV V. AXA ADVISORS,
    LLC, ET AL. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, restitution of all
       wages improperly withheld or deducted, punitive damages, penalties, and
attorneys' fees.                                                

ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN LITIGATION                                    

Market Timing-Related Matters                                   

      In October 2003, a purported class action complaint entitled HINDO, ET
AL. V. ALLIANCEBERNSTEIN GROWTH & INCOME FUND, ET AL. ("Hindo   
  Complaint") was filed against AllianceBernstein, AllianceBernstein
Holding, AllianceBernstein Corporation, AXA Financial, certain  
investment company funds (the "U.S. Funds") distributed by      
 AllianceBernstein Investments, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
      AllianceBernstein, the registrants and issuers of those funds, certain
       officers of AllianceBernstein (the "AllianceBernstein defendants"), and
certain other unaffiliated defendants, as well as unnamed Doe   
      defendants. The Hindo Complaint alleges that certain defendants failed
      to disclose that they improperly allowed certain hedge funds and other
       unidentified parties to engage in "late trading" and "market timing" of
U.S. Fund securities, violating various securities laws.        

   Additional lawsuits making factual allegations generally similar to
    those in the Hindo Complaint were filed in various Federal and state
 courts against AllianceBernstein and certain other defendants. In
     September 2004, plaintiffs filed consolidated amended complaints with
        respect to four claim types: mutual fund shareholder claims; mutual fund
derivative claims; derivative claims brought on behalf of       
AllianceBernstein Holding; and claims brought under ERISA by    
participants in the Profit Sharing Plan for Employees of        
AllianceBernstein.

P-->485BPOS120th "Page" of 141TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 120th
        In April 2006, AllianceBernstein and attorneys for the plaintiffs in the
        mutual fund shareholder claims, mutual fund derivative claims, and ERISA
claims entered into a confidential memorandum of understanding  
        containing their agreement to settle these claims. The agreement will be
   documented by a stipulation of settlement and will be submitted for
    court approval at a later date. The settlement amount ($30 million),
  which AllianceBernstein previously accrued and disclosed, has been
       disbursed. The derivative claims brought on behalf of AllianceBernstein
   Holding, in which plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages,
remain pending.                                                 

 -----------------------------------

     Although the outcome of litigation generally cannot be predicted with
certainty, management intends to vigorously defend against the  
     allegations made by the plaintiffs in the actions described above and
        believes that the ultimate resolution of the litigations described above
 involving AXA Equitable and/or its subsidiaries should not have a
     material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the
       Company. Management cannot make an estimate of loss, if any, or predict
 whether or not any of the litigations described above will have a
material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of
operations in any particular period.                            

        In addition to the type of matters described above, a number of lawsuits
        have been filed against life and health insurers in the jurisdictions in
which AXA Equitable and its respective insurance subsidiaries do
       business involving insurers' sales practices, alleged agent misconduct,
     alleged failure to properly supervise agents, contract administration
     and other matters. Some of the lawsuits have resulted in the award of
        substantial judgments against other insurers, including material amounts
   of punitive damages, or in substantial settlements. In some states,
    juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages. AXA
      Equitable and AXA Life, like other life and health insurers, from time
   to time are involved in such litigations. Some of these actions and
      proceedings filed against AXA Equitable and its subsidiaries have been
        brought on behalf of various alleged classes of claimants and certain of
       these claimants seek damages of unspecified amounts. While the ultimate
  outcome of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty, in the
 opinion of management no such matter is likely to have a material
  adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or
        results of operations. However, it should be noted that the frequency of
     large damage awards, including large punitive damage awards that bear
       little or no relation to actual economic damages incurred by plaintiffs
in some jurisdictions, continues to create the potential for an 
unpredictable judgment in any given matter.                     

20)     INSURANCE GROUP STATUTORY FINANCIAL INFORMATION                         

        AXA Equitable is restricted as to the amounts it may pay as dividends to
        AXA Financial. Under the New York Insurance Law, a domestic life insurer
        may, without prior approval of the Superintendent, pay a dividend to its
    shareholders not exceeding an amount calculated based on a statutory
   formula. This formula would permit AXA Equitable to pay shareholder
 dividends not greater than $656.7 million during 2008. Payment of
      dividends exceeding this amount requires the insurer to file notice of
     its intent to declare such dividends with the Superintendent who then
        has 30 days to disapprove the distribution. For 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
   Insurance Group statutory net income totaled $605.8 million, $532.3
    million and $780.4 million, respectively. Statutory surplus, capital
      stock and Asset Valuation Reserve ("AVR") totaled $7,812.0 million and
      $7,907.5 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007,
        2006 and 2005, respectively, AXA Equitable paid shareholder dividends of
$600.0 million, $600.0 million and $500.0 million.              

     At December 31, 2007, the Insurance Group, in accordance with various
 government and state regulations, had $41.1 million of securities
deposited with such government or state agencies.               

At December 31, 2007 and for the year then ended, there were no 
differences in net income and capital and surplus resulting from
     practices prescribed and permitted by the State of New York Insurance
     Department ("NYID") and those prescribed by NAIC Accounting Practices
and Procedures effective at December 31, 2007.                  

       Accounting practices used to prepare statutory financial statements for
      regulatory filings of stock life insurance companies differ in certain
  instances from GAAP. The differences between statutory surplus and
capital stock determined in accordance with Statutory Accounting
Principles ("SAP") and total shareholder's equity under GAAP are
   primarily: (a) the inclusion in SAP of an AVR intended to stabilize
       surplus from fluctuations in the value of the investment portfolio; (b)
future policy benefits and policyholders' account               

F-53

P-->485BPOS121st "Page" of 141TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 121st
        balances under SAP differ from GAAP due to differences between actuarial
       assumptions and reserving methodologies; (c) certain policy acquisition
       costs are expensed under SAP but deferred under GAAP and amortized over
        future periods to achieve a matching of revenues and expenses; (d) under
        SAP, income taxes are provided on the basis of amounts currently payable
      with provisions made for deferred amounts that reverse within one year
       while under GAAP, deferred taxes are recorded for temporary differences
        between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities
   where the probability of realization is reasonably assured; (e) the
valuation of assets under SAP and GAAP differ due to different  
   investment valuation and depreciation methodologies, as well as the
       deferral of interest-related realized capital gains and losses on fixed
income investments; (f) the valuation of the investment in      
    AllianceBernstein and AllianceBernstein Holding under SAP reflects a
      portion of the market value appreciation rather than the equity in the
   underlying net assets as required under GAAP; (g) the provision for
    future losses of the discontinued Wind-Up Annuities business is only
      required under GAAP; (h) reporting the surplus notes as a component of
surplus in SAP but as a liability in GAAP; (i) computer software
        development costs are capitalized under GAAP but expensed under SAP; and
       (j) certain assets, primarily pre-paid assets, are not admissible under
SAP but are admissible under GAAP.                              

  The following reconciles the Insurance Group's statutory change in
 surplus and capital stock and statutory surplus and capital stock
    determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the
NYID with net earnings and shareholder's equity on a GAAP basis.

Item 27. Number of Contractowners                                               

  As of February 29, 2008 there were 3,866 participants in annuity
contracts offered by the registrant all of which are non-qualified.             

Item 28. Indemnification                                                        

(a)   Indemnification of Directors and Officers               

        The by-laws of AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company  ("AXA
Equitable")provide, in Article VII, as follows:   

       7.4   Indemnification of Directors, Officer and Employees. (a) To the
             extent permitted by law of the State of New York and subject to
all applicable requirements thereof:              

         (i)   Any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action or
               proceeding, whether civil or criminal, by reason of the fact that
        he or she, or his or her testator or intestate is or was a
               director, officer or employee of the Company shall be indemnified
by the Company;                                   

      (ii)  any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action
             or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, by reason of the fact
           that he or she, or his or her testator or intestate serves or
             served any other organization in any capacity at the request of
the Company may be indemnified by the Company; and

(iii) the related expenses of any such person in any of said  
categories may be advanced by the Company.        

              (b) To the extent permitted by the law of the State or New York,
    the Company may provide for further indemnification or
          advancement of expenses by resolution of shareholders of the
              Company or Board of Directors, by amendment of these By-Laws, or
              by agreement. (Business Corporation Law ss.ss.721-726; Insurance
Law ss.1216)                                      

        The directors and officers of AXA Equitable are insured under policies
issued by X.L. Insurance Company, Arch Insurance Company, Endurance Insurance   
Company, U.S. Specialty Insurance, St. Paul Travelers and ACE Insurance Company.
The annual limit of such policies is $150 million, and the policies insure the  
officers and directors against certain liabilities arising out of their conduct 
in such capacities.                                                             

(b)   Indemnification of Principal Underwriter Not Applicable.

           Presently there is no Principal Underwriter of the Contracts.
     AXA Equitable provides marketing and sales services for
              distribution of the Contracts. No Commissions are paid; however,
           incentive compensation is paid to AXA Equitable employees who
             provide these services based upon first year plan contributions
and the number of plans sold.                     

(c)   Undertaking                                             

        Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the
            Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers
       and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the
         foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been
        advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
         Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
           expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the
             event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities
               (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or
      paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the
         registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or
              proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling
            person in connection with the securities being registered, the
              registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
             has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of
appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
            indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in
            the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such
issue.                                            

Item 29. Principal Underwriters                                                 

      (a)   Not applicable. Presently there is no Principal Underwriter of
the Contracts. See Item 28(b).                    

(b)   See Item 25 of this Part C.                             

(c)   Not applicable.

Item 31. Management Services                                                    

Not applicable.                                               

Item 32. Undertakings                                                           

The Registrant hereby undertakes:                             

        (a)  to file a post-effective amendment to this registration statement
    as frequently as is necessary to ensure that the audited
             financial statements in the registration statement are never more
         than 16 months old for so long as payments under the variable
annuity contracts may be accepted;                  

     (b)  to include either (1) as part of any application to purchase a
             contract offered by the prospectus, a space that an applicant can
            check to request a Statement of Additional Information, or (2) a
            postcard or similar written communication affixed to or included
         in the prospectus that the applicant can remove to send for a
Statement of Additional Information;                

 (c)  to deliver any Statement of Additional Information and any
         financial statements required to be made available under this
Form promptly upon written or oral request; and     

        (d)  AXA Equitable represents that the fees and charges deducted under
         the Contract described in this Registration Statement, in the
           aggregate, are reasonable in relation to the services rendered,
     the expenses to be incurred, and the risks assumed by AXA
Equitable under the Contract.                       

     The Registrant hereby represents that it is relying on the November
28, 1988 no-action letter (Ref. No. IP-6-88) relating to variable annuity       
contracts offered as funding vehicles for retirement plans meeting the          
requirements of Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Registrant further 
represents that it complies with the provisions of paragraphs (1) - (4) of that 
letter.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
