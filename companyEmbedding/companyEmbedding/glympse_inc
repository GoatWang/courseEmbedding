The Board



Why Glympse

            Think about it: How often do you share information about your location with friends,
            family or colleagues each day? Where are you? When will you be home? I'm running
            15 minutes late for the meeting. Let's meet at the restaurant at 6 p.m. With Glympse,
            you no longer need to make a phone call or send a text to communicate common location-based
            information. Designed to keep up with an increasingly mobile lifestyle, Glympse
            visually answers the question of "Where are you?" with a dynamic map that updates
            your whereabouts in real-time.
        

            You can now "glympse" anyone in your contact list and share your location as easily
            as sending a text message, but a lot more fun. Recipients know exactly where you
            are, when and for as long as you want them to. In short, Glympse is simple, safe
            location sharing — in an instant.
        


How Glympse Works

            Glympse is a mobile service that allows GPS-enabled mobile phone users to share
            their location via a Web-based map for a pre-set period of time with anyone they
            choose. With Glympse, you are in complete control – you choose WHO you want to see
            your location, WHEN and for HOW LONG.
        

            Unlike other location-based services that require users to log in and build a friend
            network before use, Glympse can be used within seconds of downloading to a GPS-enabled
            smartphone device. There's no need to create an account to use the service, eliminating
            login and password hassles. Once downloaded, you can "glympse" anyone you choose
            by simply selecting a contact or contacts, choose the duration you want your location
            to be available to the recipient, and then hit send. Only Glympse uses patent-pending,
            time-based GlympseWatch℠ technology that allows users to set a timer for how long
            their location may be shared, from minutes or up to four hours. A sender has the
            ability to "pause" or "cancel" a Glympse at any time or choose to extend an existing
            Glympse. The "auto shut off" security feature addresses the concern that users can
            easily forget to turn off location-sharing mode and unintentionally broadcast their
            whereabouts at inappropriate times.
        

            On the receiving end, anyone with an Internet-enable mobile device or email access
            can receive a Glympse and view your whereabouts turn-by-turn, in full interactive
            fidelity. The recipient receives an SMS or email message with a unique URL that
            can be clicked to open browser with a map, pinpointing the sender's precise location.
        

            While Glympse users are given the option of adding a photo and nickname or an optional
            message to appear on the map with their location, it is not a requirement to use
            the service. At Glympse, consumer privacy and safety are paramount. With Glympse,
            you do not need to join a new social network or go through a cumbersome set-up process
            that requires you to find people with the same phone and service then seek permission
            to share location with each other. The sender is the only one who decides when they
            will share their location and with whom and for how long. Once the GlympseWatch
            expires, or "times out," that's it. The only way a recipient can see your location
            again is if you send another Glympse. You can also "pause" or "cancel" a Glympse
            at any time or choose to extend it for up to another four hours.

Who We Are

            Glympse was founded in 2008 by some guys who spent 15 years working together in
            various capacities at Microsoft. We set aside the security of the paychecks and
            benefits (like free sodas) that come with employment at a big multi-national corporation
            to create something we all believe passionately in – Glympse. We saw the emerging
            technical and social trends and saw a unique opportunity in time to create a new
            class of location sharing that visually answers the question "where are you?" for
            people who matter, when it matters.
        

The Founders

Bryan Trussel, Co-founder and CEO

                    Bryan is the face of the operation, working to make Glympse part of our daily lives
                    and make sure the product's ease and simplicity coincides with its commitment to
                    safety and security. Bryan spent 16 years leading teams at Microsoft, working on
                    a range of products from Windows to Interactive TV and embedded systems to casual
                    games, including creating and launching several V1.O products, like MessengerGames,
                    Windows CE and Xbox Live Arcade. He has a bachelor's in Computer Science from the
                    University of Utah and an MBA from Kellogg at Northwestern. He currently resides
                    in Redmond, Wash. with his wife, four daughters and four-year-old son.
                

Fave Glympse. Bryan is always a bit behind schedule and will regularly
                    send a Glympse to colleagues and clients prior to meetings so they know exactly
                    when he will arrive. He also has a keen interest in the family uses of Glympse with
                    two newly driving daughters who he likes to know are safe after he hands them the
                    keys. But his all-time favorite is receiving a Glympse, so if you're out and about,
                    send him a Glympse once in a while to bryan [at] glympse [dot] com.
                


Steve Miller, Chief Architect

                    Steve is the technology guru, turning whiteboard ideas into tangible reality. Prior
                    to co-founding the company, Steve was a principal developer at Microsoft, working
                    on Windows, Interactive TV, Embedded Systems, and architecting the anti-spam efforts
                    for Microsoft Exchange. Steve received his bachelor's in Computer Science from Cal
                    Poly, San Luis Obispo, and he currently lives in Woodinville, Wash. with his wife
                    and three children.
                

Fave Glympse. In rare circumstances when Steve stops programming
                    and ventures outdoors, he regularly sends Glympses to friends to coordinate an evening
                    out or meet up at the pub, and he likes to use the ones from Bryan to perfectly
                    time his arrival at meetings.

Glympse Launches Integration Enhances Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service Experiences with Live Map Technician View and Appointment Eta
Jun 20 17
Glympse Launches Integration that enhances Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service Experiences with Live Map Technician View and Appointment ETA. Field service appointments can be high-friction events, or strategic opportunities to engage customers and build trust. The outcome depends on whether customers, field agents, and back office support teams are informed and empowered throughout the process. Glympse is teaming with Microsoft so businesses using Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Field Service can provide customers with constant, accurate awareness regarding the status of field service appointments. The collaboration seamlessly embeds Glympse En Route, a location-powered customer experience management solution, within the Dynamics 365 for Field Service application through a new, off-the-shelf integration. As a result, end customers receive continuously updated appointment and technician visibility that culminates in a live map view of the technician's location as he travels to the appointment destination.

share location information or ETA.

About Glympse



Why Glympse


How Glympse Works

Who We Are
The Founders
The Board



Why Glympse

            Think about it: How often do you share information about your location with friends,
            family or colleagues each day? Where are you? When will you be home? I'm running
            15 minutes late for the meeting. Let's meet at the restaurant at 6 p.m. With Glympse,
            you no longer need to make a phone call or send a text to communicate common location-based
            information. Designed to keep up with an increasingly mobile lifestyle, Glympse
            visually answers the question of "Where are you?" with a dynamic map that updates
            your whereabouts in real-time.
        

            You can now "glympse" anyone in your contact list and share your location as easily
            as sending a text message, but a lot more fun. Recipients know exactly where you
            are, when and for as long as you want them to. In short, Glympse is simple, safe
            location sharing — in an instant.
        


How Glympse Works

            Glympse is a mobile service that allows GPS-enabled mobile phone users to share
            their location via a Web-based map for a pre-set period of time with anyone they
            choose. With Glympse, you are in complete control – you choose WHO you want to see
            your location, WHEN and for HOW LONG.
        

            Unlike other location-based services that require users to log in and build a friend
            network before use, Glympse can be used within seconds of downloading to a GPS-enabled
            smartphone device. There's no need to create an account to use the service, eliminating
            login and password hassles. Once downloaded, you can "glympse" anyone you choose
            by simply selecting a contact or contacts, choose the duration you want your location
            to be available to the recipient, and then hit send. Only Glympse uses patent-pending,
            time-based GlympseWatch℠ technology that allows users to set a timer for how long
            their location may be shared, from minutes or up to four hours. A sender has the
            ability to "pause" or "cancel" a Glympse at any time or choose to extend an existing
            Glympse. The "auto shut off" security feature addresses the concern that users can
            easily forget to turn off location-sharing mode and unintentionally broadcast their
            whereabouts at inappropriate times.
        

            On the receiving end, anyone with an Internet-enable mobile device or email access
            can receive a Glympse and view your whereabouts turn-by-turn, in full interactive
            fidelity. The recipient receives an SMS or email message with a unique URL that
            can be clicked to open browser with a map, pinpointing the sender's precise location.
        

            While Glympse users are given the option of adding a photo and nickname or an optional
            message to appear on the map with their location, it is not a requirement to use
            the service. At Glympse, consumer privacy and safety are paramount. With Glympse,
            you do not need to join a new social network or go through a cumbersome set-up process
            that requires you to find people with the same phone and service then seek permission
            to share location with each other. The sender is the only one who decides when they
            will share their location and with whom and for how long. Once the GlympseWatch
            expires, or "times out," that's it. The only way a recipient can see your location
            again is if you send another Glympse. You can also "pause" or "cancel" a Glympse
            at any time or choose to extend it for up to another four hours.

Who We Are

            Glympse was founded in 2008 by some guys who spent 15 years working together in
            various capacities at Microsoft. We set aside the security of the paychecks and
            benefits (like free sodas) that come with employment at a big multi-national corporation
            to create something we all believe passionately in – Glympse. We saw the emerging
            technical and social trends and saw a unique opportunity in time to create a new
            class of location sharing that visually answers the question "where are you?" for
            people who matter, when it matters.
        

The Founders

Bryan Trussel, Co-founder and CEO

                    Bryan is the face of the operation, working to make Glympse part of our daily lives
                    and make sure the product's ease and simplicity coincides with its commitment to
                    safety and security. Bryan spent 16 years leading teams at Microsoft, working on
                    a range of products from Windows to Interactive TV and embedded systems to casual
                    games, including creating and launching several V1.O products, like MessengerGames,
                    Windows CE and Xbox Live Arcade. He has a bachelor's in Computer Science from the
                    University of Utah and an MBA from Kellogg at Northwestern. He currently resides
                    in Redmond, Wash. with his wife, four daughters and four-year-old son.
                

Fave Glympse. Bryan is always a bit behind schedule and will regularly
                    send a Glympse to colleagues and clients prior to meetings so they know exactly
                    when he will arrive. He also has a keen interest in the family uses of Glympse with
                    two newly driving daughters who he likes to know are safe after he hands them the
                    keys. But his all-time favorite is receiving a Glympse, so if you're out and about,
                    send him a Glympse once in a while to bryan [at] glympse [dot] com.
                


Steve Miller, Chief Architect

                    Steve is the technology guru, turning whiteboard ideas into tangible reality. Prior
                    to co-founding the company, Steve was a principal developer at Microsoft, working
                    on Windows, Interactive TV, Embedded Systems, and architecting the anti-spam efforts
                    for Microsoft Exchange. Steve received his bachelor's in Computer Science from Cal
                    Poly, San Luis Obispo, and he currently lives in Woodinville, Wash. with his wife
                    and three children.
                

Fave Glympse. In rare circumstances when Steve stops programming
                    and ventures outdoors, he regularly sends Glympses to friends to coordinate an evening
                    out or meet up at the pub, and he likes to use the ones from Bryan to perfectly
                    time his arrival at meetings.
