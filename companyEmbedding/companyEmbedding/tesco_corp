Casing Running Tools



Casing Drive System



Compact Casing Drive System


Casing running tools provide a mechanized, safe and cost-effective way to run and make-up casing. Tesco invites you to save on costs and avoid unnecessary risks by utilizing one of our Casing Drive Systems™ (CDS™). There are many benefits to adding a CDS to a drilling operation.

First, the purpose of every CDS model is to provide a mechanized way of running casing and ensuring that casing reaches bottom without fail. It has been proven that pipe rotation and reciprocation while cementing helps to achieve a more reliable and secure cement job. Tesco’s casing running tools provide the ability to rotate, circulate and reciprocate pipe simultaneously during cementing operations.

Oftentimes, casing running tools are only utilized in cases when pipe is stuck downhole. Tesco’s CDS tools can certainly handle challenging situations such as stuck pipe. However, the CDS is built for more. Tesco’s CDS works with the top drive to easily attain smooth make up with no bending load and with precise control on final torque. Rig up your CDS from the beginning of the job and collect the cost-saving and productivity benefits throughout the casing or cementing processes.

Tesco’s CDS also decreases the amount of equipment required onsite and provides safety benefits in several ways. A mechanized casing running tool replaces typical conventional equipment such as the power casing tong, casing elevators and spiders and a dedicated hydraulic power unit. This decreases manpower required, saves on equipment costs and provides a less cluttered, and thereby a safer, working environment. The CDS also eliminates the need to have a stabbing board operator working, which has been identified as a top factor that can cause lost-time incidents during operations.

Explore the range of casing running tools Tesco has to offer and find the CDS model that best fits your needs.

Tesco’s product offering includes a variety of solutions for the drilling environment. Intelligently designed and built to last, Tesco products can be tailored to fit most rigs and are engineered to meet the demands of today’s challenging drilling environment. Ensuring quality and customer satisfaction are Tesco’s first priorities.

Casing Running Tools
As the inventors of the industry’s first casing running tool, Tesco understand the benefits of rotating and reciprocating during cementing operations. By running a Tesco Casing Drive System™ (CDS™), operators are able to reduce manpower on the rig and the chances of unscheduled downtime. These powerful products can not only save your casing string from problem areas, but can make routine running practices faster and more efficient.

Top Drives
Tesco’s history of innovation was established with the development of the world’s first portable top drive system. Tesco pioneered a technology that made modern drilling procedures available to most rigs. Our strategy has been, and always will be, to bring time and cost efficiency to any drilling application. Tesco has a large range of top drives available on the market, including electric, hydraulic and even custom-integrated models.

Catwalks
Tesco Automated Catwalk (TAC) systems transfer pipe to the rig floor in the safest, most reliable manner available. Made for adaptability and durability, TAC systems are able to deliver pipe closer to hole center than ever before. By using Tesco catwalks, operators and drilling contractors are able to save valuable time and increase productivity.

Wireless Torque, Turn and Tension Sensor
The TesTORK is Tesco’s solution for precision connection details when running casing or for high speed drilling data when drilling complex wells. The secure wireless connection and precision sensors eliminates the need for cables and encoders. Intuitive software and an easy to use interface ensures each casing connection meets the specifications of the tubular supplier. The TesTORK provides precision information required in today’s modern casing and drilling applications.

TAC 23


Automated catwalks benefit the drilling process in many ways, including more efficient operations, creating a safer working environment and reducing costs. The latest generation of catwalks on the market, the Tesco Automated Catwalk (TAC) system transfer tubulars between the pipe rack and the rig floor in an efficient, controlled manner. The TAC has an extendable trough which gives operators the ability to customize its position to the approximate inch required at well center. This drastically reduces the swing weight of the tubular being picked up from the trough, and it reduces the amount of space necessary for the rig crew to push back from the tubular when laying down. An on-board Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) allows the operator to move critical functions of the catwalk simultaneously, positioning it precisely where the trough needs to be on the rig floor. TACs can be operated wirelessly with an explosion-proof remote from the rig floor or manually from the valve back on the TAC.

TACs are designed to achieve zero contact with personnel. When picking up a casing string, the TAC is equipped with casing runs that are pinned onto its side. This creates a bridge between the pipe racks and the catwalk and keeps workers at safe distance. Additionally, the TAC system’s open belly design and its ability to manipulate the arms horizontally provide for ease of maintenance and allows the operator or technician to troubleshoot in a more open, and thereby safer, working environment. In fact, most troubleshooting can be diagnosed by standing on the outside of the catwalk’s frame looking in.

Each TAC is equipped with gull wings that swing outward and can be hydraulically lowered to create a ramp so that drill pipe can roll off into pipe tubs or a waiting loader. After the initial set up, the rig crew has no need to come in contact with the TAC again except to perform maintenance or move to a new location.

Please note that certain models may require longer lead times for particular locations. Explore the current TAC systems to discover which model is right for your rig.
