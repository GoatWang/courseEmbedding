                        We found Rapid’s approach to our Video Conferencing needs head and shoulders above the competition, their attention to our requirements for an easy to use technology, the need for support and training means we use the solution every day. 6 Years later, Rapid are still looking after us and have deployed solutions to our other meeting rooms around the north of England.
                        
 Mike Knibb Exchange Chambers 



                        Rapid recommended Smartboards for our visual training needs. They provided us with a mobile resource that can be moved from room to room. This easy to use, intuitive technology has become a firm favourite with our trainers and has increased audience participation in our sessions. Rapid provided us with a great installation and training and we have gone on to use them in other Audio Visual projects.
                        
 Wendy Barker East Cheshire NHS Trust 





                        We have worked with Rapid in all aspects of our IT including taking on the support and expansion of our existing Ruckus Wi-Fi Network, providing our broadband services, a managed cost per copy printing solution powered by Brother Printers, our AV / digital signage needs and a campus wide coverage CCTV over IP Solution.  Rapid’s understanding of all things IP, there dedication to great service and best value for money have made them an ideal ICT partner to our school.
                        
 Steve Ford strategic IT manager - Helsby High School 



                        Rapids approach to our business needs was consultative, they wanted to understand our objectives and help reduce operational costs.  
						This approach helped us realise the technologies potential quickly and achieve a quicker ROI. 
                        
 Ken Jones IPS Manager - Jaguar Land Rover 





                        We needed meeting room solutions to update our old Flip Charts and Whiteboards for Continuous Improvement applications. 
						We needed the system to be intuitive and easy to use. We didn’t want technology for the sake of it, it had to add value 
						to the business.  Smart and Rapid delivered beyond our expectations, a first class solution with excellent training 
						and support.
                        
 Halldor Fossa IB Lean Project Manager - RBS 



						The Smart displays have become an integral part of our meetings and have grown from a hand full of boards to the majority 
						of our meeting rooms Small and large.  Colleagues enjoy using them and realise the value in using them every day.  
						Rapid based their training around our specific business requirements which meant our staff were able to hit the 
						ground running with the technology.

FAQ

What are UITs?Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are a fixed portfolio of stocks, bonds or other securities. These types of portfolios allow investors to know what securities are held within a UIT as of the date of deposit, as well as the mandatory termination date of the trust. While it is not common, a trust may terminate early as described in the prospectus. UITs offer an attractive opportunity for investors to own a portfolio of securities via a low minimum, typically liquid investment. As a point of contrast, while many actively managed funds continually buy and sell securities, thereby changing their investment mix, the securities held in a UIT generally remain fixed.
How are UIT securities chosen?Some UIT securities are chosen according to a quantitative selection process determined by a sponsor while some are based on an index. Other UITs are chosen by experienced analysts or portfolio managers, who research the securities and screen them for various characteristics, according to specific objectives. Once securities are selected, the UIT portfolios are then supervised accordingly throughout the life of the trust.
Can a security held in a UIT be removed at any time?While it is rare, a security held in a UIT may be removed from a portfolio under certain circumstances, such as a significant decline in credit rating. By and large, securities held in a UIT remain fixed for the life of the trust, regardless of market value.
What are the minimum investments in SmartTrust® UITs?Typical minimums are 100 units, however, the minimums may vary based on the UIT. Higher minimums may also be required by each respective brokerage firm.
Are UITs suitable for my retirement accounts?Unit trusts may be an appropriate investment vehicle for IRAs or self-employed retirement plans. They offer a variety of investment opportunities — ranging from relatively conservative to more aggressive investments — in both domestic and international markets.
What are my options when a UIT matures?Option #1: Rollover at a reduced sales charge
At a reduced sales charge, investors may roll over into a new series of the same trust, if available, or any other SmartTrust® UIT available in the primary market*
*Maturity rollover is considered a taxable event. Please refer to each trust’s prospectus for complete rollover option information. Investors should be aware that there is a time limit to notify the trustee of the rollover.
Option #2: Maturity
Investors may do nothing and allow the portfolio units to mature. The trust will liquidate and they will receive a cash distribution of the trust’s proceeds, if any.
Option #3: In-kind distribution
Investors may generally request an in-kind distribution of the securities underlying the units if they own 2,500 or more units at either the time of purchase or maturity. Please see additional provisions set forth in the prospectus. SmartTrust® Unit Investment Trusts are generally long-term investment strategies and investors should consider their ability to invest in successive portfolios, if available. Investors should consult their tax advisor to determine tax consequences associated with an investment from one portfolio to the next, if available. Neither Hennion & Walsh, Inc. or Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, Inc. provide tax advice. Please refer to the trust prospectus for more complete in-kind distribution information. In-kind distribution is generally available for stocks traded and held in the United States. In-kind distribution may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice.
Can I sell my units?You may sell all, or a portion of, your units any day the stock market is open. You will receive the then-current net asset value of the units, based on the current market value of the underlying securities in the portfolio, less any remaining deferred sales charge, as of the evaluation time. As the market fluctuates, of course, so will the value of your units. Therefore, your units may be worth more or less than what you originally paid.
How are UITs priced?UITs are priced at the end of each business day similar to mutual funds. The price is based on the market value of the underlying securities and includes cash and other assets and liabilities held by the trust.
Are UITs eligible in commission and fee/wrap accounts?UITs are available in a sales charge structure for commission accounts as well as for fee/wrap accounts. It is best to check with your individual brokerage firm to see if UITs are eligible for your fee/wrap platform.
Are UITs regulated?Unit investment trusts are one of three basic types of investment company. Investment companies are subject to stringent federal laws and oversight by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is important to note that the SEC does not approve or disapprove of UITs or the securities within a given UIT or pass upon the adequacy of any prospectus for a given UIT. Investment companies are regulated primarily under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This federal statute is highly detailed and governs the structure and day-to-day operations of investment companies. Investment companies are also subject to regulations of the Securities Act of 1933, FINRA, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

*Estimated Net Annual First Year Distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding. The estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the  first year to pay for organization costs, the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge. The actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities.

*Estimated Net Annual First Year Distribution per unit is computed by dividing the estimated annual income of the underlying securities less the expense per unit by the number of units outstanding. The estimated net annual distributions for subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio will be sold during the  first year to pay for organization costs, the creation and development fee and the deferred sales charge. The actual net annual distributions will vary with changes in the trust’s fees and expenses and income of the underlying securities.

Alternatively,  go to the download drivers section.




I get an error during installation.

         Solving problems



I get the wrong letters and/or symbols when typing on my computer.


















Set the correct language as explained in the keyboard settings page




The multimedia keys are not working.


















Not all programs are supporting multimedia keys.

For best compatibility, use Windows Mediaplayer and Internet Explorer. 
Ensure that the Multimedia program you wish to control is selected as Default in the system properties.
If still not working, uninstall any other programs/drivers related to keyboards.





The mouse arrow shakes, moves strangely or does not move at all.




















Try using the mouse on a different surface or use a mousepad. (like the Trust Bigfoot Gel mousepad)

Clean the sensor on the bottom of the mouse with a dry cloth.





Sometimes letters are missing when typing.




















Clean your keyboard from dust and crumbles.  





Where is your service center? Or where can I send my product to be repaired?


















Unfortunately, we do not have service centers to repair products.
A defective product should be replaced by your point of purchase during the warranty period.




My Trust product is not working.


















Follow the steps in the trouble shooting guide.




The file on the website won't download (completely)


















Possibe causes blocking the download:


Firewall is blocking the download.
 Adjust your firewall software to allow downloads.

An antivirus/internet security software suite is blocking the download.
If you have internet security software make sure it is configured to allow downloads.

Your browser is blocking the download.
It can help to clear the cache to be able to download again.
It can also help to reset browser settings when clearing the cache doesn't work.
Alternatively use a different browser to download the file.

Network/ISP issues.
It can be related to a problem with the connection to your Internet service.







When I download the file on the website, I receive a message about a corrupt or invalid signature.



















This is a false alarm by Microsoft browsers.

The digital signatures of the file are neither corrupt nor invalid. Windows requires drivers to be digitally signed by the author; otherwise, Windows will not load the driver out of precaution.

It is possible that several drivers of Trust do not have this Windows signature, as there are extra costs for this signature. However, we can confirm that even without this signature the driver is safe to install.

If you can't ignore the warning, please use any non-Microsoft browser such as Google Chrome for downloading and installing the driver.




My product is faulty. What do I do?


















We offer a 'return to retailer' warranty on our products.

Frequently Asked Questions






             Installation and configuration



Where can I get software/drivers for my Trust product?


















Software/drivers are available on the CD included with your product. 
Alternatively,  go to the download drivers section.




I get an error during installation.


















To solve errors like:


"Unrecognized USB device"

"Device driver software was not successfully installed"

"Can not find driver"

Please follow the installation trouble shooting guide.







         Usage



Can I change the functions of the multimedia keys?


















No, these are fixed functions.




How can I change the function of the media keys?


















These keys use the default program that your operating system has set for these functions.
E.g. the Internet Browser key will open the default browser on your computer and the music player will open the default music player on your computer.

To change the default programs, you'll need to go to Start > Programs > Default Programs on Windows 7/8, or System > Default apps in Windows 10.




How to switch on the light?


















When you start-up the computer, the lights are not on yet.

You switch them on, after the computer has started up, with the button on the right in the middle panel, marked with a bulb and next to it a lighted bulb.

After you have switched on the light, you can rotate between the 3 available colors, by pressing the button on the left in the middle panel, marked with a bulb and a rounded arrow around the bulb.







         Solving problems



I get the wrong letters and/or symbols when typing on my computer.


















Set the correct language as explained in the keyboard settings page




The multimedia keys are not working.


















Not all programs are supporting multimedia keys.

For best compatibility, use Windows Mediaplayer and Internet Explorer. 
Ensure that the Multimedia program you wish to control is selected as Default in the system properties.
If still not working, uninstall any other programs/drivers related to keyboards.





Sometimes letters are missing when typing.




















Clean your keyboard from dust and crumbles.  





Where is your service center? Or where can I send my product to be repaired?


















Unfortunately, we do not have service centers to repair products.
A defective product should be replaced by your point of purchase during the warranty period.




My Trust product is not working.


















Follow the steps in the trouble shooting guide.




The file on the website won't download (completely)


















Possibe causes blocking the download:


Firewall is blocking the download.
 Adjust your firewall software to allow downloads.

An antivirus/internet security software suite is blocking the download.
If you have internet security software make sure it is configured to allow downloads.

Your browser is blocking the download.
It can help to clear the cache to be able to download again.
It can also help to reset browser settings when clearing the cache doesn't work.
Alternatively use a different browser to download the file.

Network/ISP issues.
It can be related to a problem with the connection to your Internet service.







When I download the file on the website, I receive a message about a corrupt or invalid signature.



















This is a false alarm by Microsoft browsers.

The digital signatures of the file are neither corrupt nor invalid. Windows requires drivers to be digitally signed by the author; otherwise, Windows will not load the driver out of precaution.

It is possible that several drivers of Trust do not have this Windows signature, as there are extra costs for this signature. However, we can confirm that even without this signature the driver is safe to install.

If you can't ignore the warning, please use any non-Microsoft browser such as Google Chrome for downloading and installing the driver.




My product is faulty. What do I do?


















We offer a 'return to retailer' warranty on our products.
In case of a defect, you can return the product to your retailer with failure description, proof of purchase and all accessories.
During the warranty period you will receive a replacement product from the retailer if available.
