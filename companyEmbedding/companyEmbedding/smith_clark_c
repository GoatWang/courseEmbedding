About Lifestyle and Sport Sunglasses:




You have different clothes for different activities and types of weather, so why wouldn't you do the same with sunglasses? A pair of casual sunglasses does not fare well on the rugged trail just as a pair of wrap-around sport specs might not be ideal for everyday use. Thankfully, Moosejaw is here to help you out by providing a wide variety of sunglasses that meet every part of your lifestyle.


The men's and women's sunglasses found above are not just your regular ole sunnies. Packed with features and bonuses such as polarized, UV protection, scratch-resistant, blue light filtering, impact resistant, and much, much more. Some styles even have interchangeable lenses so you can easily adapt to your environment.


With high-quality brand names like Oakley, Smith, Native and Maui Jim offering their best in fashion and sport sunglasses, you might just end up with more than one of these bad boys. After all, these aren't just protecting your eyes, but rather giving you a whole new way of seeing the world around you. From water to sand to snow and even asphalt, these lifestyle sunglasses cut glare and shield you from debris and sun rays. Even if you're just out for a walk with your pup, the sunglasses above will give you all the protection you need.

Product Description
Smith Clark Matte Black Grey Green
Crisp edges, distinctive thick surfacing and a classic keyway nose detail characterize the Smith Clark Matte Black Grey Green glasses. Constructed using megol nose pads, feather-light, Evolve eco-material and lightweight, impact resistant Carbonic lenses, the Clark expresses strong style without the weight to match.
Our Brown lens tint excels at absorbing stray “blue light” and sharpening visual acuity. Perfect for activities where depth perception is important. Provides 100% protection from harmful UVA/B/C rays.
PRODUCT FEATURES:
Medium Fit / Coverage
Auto-Lock Hinges
Evolve Frame Material
Hydrophilic Megol Nose Pads
6 Base Lens Curvature
Carbonic TLT lenses
How do we do it? It all starts with design. We use the military’s Human Systems Integration (HSI) process—meaning we take human variables such as fit, optical performance, ballistic performance, integrated equipment, and weapons interface into account in the design process. This allows us to refine a product’s functionality across a wide spectrum of factors. In other words, Smith Elite is pure integration—on steroids.

Frame Size Information
If you look on the inside of the arm of your glasses you find will something that looks like: 52 [] 16 135.
This is information on the size of your glasses: the lens diameter, the bridge width and the arm length, all measured in millimetres.
 The Eye Width, or Lens Diameter, is the width of the lens (in mm), measured from the bridge. (In this example, the Eye Width is 52.)
The Bridge Width is the gap above your nose between the lenses. It should be comfortable. Too tight, and the glasses could pinch your nose; too loose and the glasses will not be stable on your face. (In this example, the Bridge Width is 16.)
The Temple Length, or Arm Length, is usually one of three standards – 135, 140 or 145mm. The arm should be long enough to sit comfortably over your ears. Glasses with straight arms do not always have this measurement indicated. (In this example, the Temple Length is 135.)

Description


Specifications



Product Description
Smith Clark Matte Blue Blackout
Crisp edges, distinctive thick surfacing and a classic keyway nose detail characterize the Smith Clark Matte Blue Blackout. Constructed using megol nose pads, feather-light, Evolve eco-material and lightweight, impact resistant Carbonic lenses, the Clark expresses strong style without the weight to match.
A Dark Gray lens tint that cuts glare and reduces eye fatigue in very bright, exposed sunny conditions. Also effective at altitudes where bright conditions can become exponentially more powerful from the glare created when powerful mid-day sun reflects off of the snow. Provides 100% protection from harmful UVA/B/C rays.
PRODUCT FEATURES:
Medium Fit / Coverage
Auto-Lock Hinges
Evolve Frame Material
Hydrophilic Megol Nose Pads
6 Base Lens Curvature
Carbonic TLT lenses
