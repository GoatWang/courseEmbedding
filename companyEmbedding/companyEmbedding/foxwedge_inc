Attention To Details
They distinguish a masterpiece from a pretty picture. 
A stunning home from a nice house. 
And a Fox Weldoor from an ordinary storm door.

Order Products

























Fox Weldoor Brand
It's our attention to detail that makes the Fox Weldoor one of the Midwest's 
best-selling doors. Details such as heliarc-welded corners and exclusive 
interlocking hinge system which result in unmatched strength and performance. 
Or the state of the art powder-coat finish that defies even the harshest elements.

Become A Dealer

























All Doors Are Not Created Equal
You didn't settle for just any house - Don't settle for just any door.  
Use this handy checklist while shopping for your new storm door, then 
go to the bottom of this page and fill in the "Find A Dealer" form.  
If you want an immediate response please call our toll free 
Hotline 1-800-552-0027.  One of our Customer Service Representatives 
will be happy to take your call.

                    I specialize in custom furniture, cabinetry and woodworking using traditional 
cabinetmaker skills, tools and techniques. Those tried and true joinery 
techniques found on quality furniture from times past are always used in my 
work. Such examples are dovetails in all drawers, dovetailed blanket chests, 
sliding dovetails for the legs on pedestal and three legged tables, mortise and 
tenon joints in cabinet work, rail and stile door construction, raised panels, 
even foxwedge tenon joints on some pieces.

Tim McCready (center), owner of Bankston & Bailey, started McCready's Foxwedge School of Craft this year.









































































































Brad Armstrong likes building furniture.

"But I'm not very good at it," said Armstrong, a partner at The Martin Agency, the Richmond-based advertising firm.

Armstrong's daughters recognized that and gave him a gift certificate for woodworking classes at McCready's Foxwedge School of Craft.

He used the classes to build a unique corner desk.

"We went from the roughest wood [bought from a saw mill] to furniture," Armstrong said.

He said he learned a great deal from the school's owner, Tim McCready.

"Tim was fabulous not only in figuring out the design but also in making sense of it all," Armstrong said.

"He has thousands of little tips. He can talk about the grain of wood and the kinds of tools that work best," he said. "It's clear that this is his love. It's fun to be around someone who loves something so much."

What started as a way to subsidize a rock band during his college days at Virginia Commonwealth University in 1992 turned into both a passion and a career for McCready.

He now owns the Foxwedge school and Bankston & Bailey, where he designs and makes fine furniture.

He started his career as a woodworking apprentice at Richmond-based design and fine-furniture maker Harrison Higgins Inc.

"As it turned out, I liked woodworking more than the band," McCready said.

After graduating from VCU in 1998, he worked at a couple of research-related jobs before starting a doctoral program in counseling psychology at the University of Maryland.

"I stopped after one year because I wanted to get back to woodworking," he said.

When he returned to Richmond in 2006, he took a job at Ruffin & Payne's woodworking mill.

"I was working on large-scale architectural projects, such as columns and staircases," he said. "I worked on anything that is made from wood and attached to a house."

McCready decided to start his own company, Bankston & Bailey (the moniker comes from two family names), in 2007. His clients include interior designers, museums and individuals.

"I made the concierge desk for the Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina, for example, and I made some veneered cases for the new addition to the Virginia state Capitol," he said.

He works on a project-to-project basis with clients that range geographically from the Hamptons in New York to South Carolina. Word-of-mouth advertising has helped the business grow.

This year, revenue at Bankston & Bailey's is up 20 percent from 2008.


McCready started Foxwedge (named after a woodworking joint that can't be undone) in January as a way to share his craft with others.

"This type of knowledge in terms of traditional handwork is disappearing," he said. "It's dying. There are very limited opportunities to learn woodworking from top to bottom, not only in Richmond but everywhere."

Students at the school learn the entire process of fine-furniture making, from initial design to finished product. Instruction is based on the student's project choice.

"They can make whatever they like," McCready said. "They make beautiful objects, and they get to keep what they make."

After they complete 12 hours of instruction, students can buy open shop time in McCready's studio at 3105 W. Leigh St.

McCready limits each class to two students. His goal for 2010 is to have 10 students enrolled in five classes a week.

Brian Manetz of Fredericksburg recently signed up for a second round of classes to make a dresser for his family's river cottage. During his first 12 sessions, he designed and made a coffee table that now sits in the cottage.

"I found this beautiful piece of sugar maple wood, and I thought it would make the perfect coffee table, but I didn't know how to make [one]," he said. "I was successful with Tim's help. The table came out beyond my expectations."

Manetz enjoys working with McCready because of his willingness to work on any project.

"He will teach you how to do anything," Manetz said. "He teaches you how to use hand tools properly and how to maintain them before you start using them. He forces you to do it the right way the first time."
