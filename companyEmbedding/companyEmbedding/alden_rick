How I Did It: Rick Alden, Skullcandy









By Rick Alden













WRITE A COMMENT



















CREDIT: 










As told to Nitasha Tiku
Industry: Consumer Products & Services
Three-Year Growth: 24,077.4%
Rick Alden started out promoting snowboarding events. Then he sold bindings -- he dismantled his own boots and played with car-door latches to come up with the prototype. Next came Skullcandy, which sells stereo headphones and other audio products. The Park City, Utah, business hit $35.7 million in sales last year -- thanks in no small part to the community of boarders, surfers, and skaters that Alden has cultivated through sponsorships and other forms of grass-roots marketing. As Skullcandy goes mainstream, he says, his goal is to keep that customer base excited about the brand.
One of our first products was a set of headphones called Skullcrushers. Each set comes with a pair of Mylar cone speakers and a pair of subwoofers. They were designed to appeal to skateboarders and snowboarders who love a ton of bass. The sound rattles your head and bleeds through your eyes. It's a damage-your-hearing kind of bass.
I'd walk into snowboarding and skateboarding shops that I'd sold bindings to or that I'd known for 15 years, and say, "Hey, man, I think you ought to sell headphones." They'd look at me a little bit funny, like, "Gee, Rick, maybe you didn't realize we're a skateboard shop. We don't sell consumer electronics." So I'd say, "How many of your customers have iPods? Music is a lifestyle experience, and you are a lifestyle shop -- and we're selling a product that is relevant to your customer base." Still, convincing them to carry Skullcandy took a lot of work.
We made a lot of guarantees: If it doesn't sell, we'll buy it all back; we'll rotate to get the best product mix. Fortunately, we've never had to buy any product back.
We always wanted to build our technology into other gear -- to put audio into snowboard helmets, for example. So we met with Giro, one of the top producers of snowboard and ski helmets. They loved the idea of putting speakers into their ear pads and wiring not just music but also cell phones. They even agreed to print the tag line "Powered by Skullcandy" on the packaging. After that, the company really took off.
Then we would go into shops, saying, "Hey, we want you to sell our products." And they would tell me, "We don't sell headphones." And then I'd say, "You've actually been selling Skullcandy for a year or two now" and point to the Giro helmet on the wall.
I pitched Skullcandy to Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Target (NYSE:TGT), and Circuit City (NYSE:CC) to be picked up for the fourth quarter of 2007. I didn't anticipate that all three would say yes and place orders for all their U.S. stores. Could we even build that much product? We went to China and figured out a way to increase our tooling cavities so that we could get more units out of a single production run. And we delivered on time to all three chains.
Our success in the mainstream market creates a real danger for us. Our core has expanded from skateboard and snowboard shops to include stores that sell sneakers, bikes, vinyl records, and electric guitars. Those account for only 10 percent of our revenue, but it's the most important 10 percent, and we have to protect it. So we sponsor boarders, surfers, and BMX bikers. One hundred percent of our marketing efforts focus on that segment.
I have a saying: Conservative guys buy core products, but core guys will never buy conservative. In other words, we've got to be edgy and keep our original consumer happy, because without him, we'll lose people like me -- old guys who want to buy cool young products, too. We're the guys who sit behind a desk more than we sit on a mountain bike, but we want to believe we still belong in that world. We all still want to be cool.

Our Story

WE WERE BORN ON A CHAIRLIFT
Skullcandy came screaming into this world as the brainchild of notorious non-conformer and action sports product mastermind Rick Alden. One day as he was hauling to the top of a Park City peak for another powder run, he had to yank out his ear buds from his music player and use them to answer his phone. That’s when a simple but powerful idea hit him. What if there were headphones that could seamlessly switch from music to calls? And what if those headphones actually looked as good as they worked? That idea, on that chairlift, on that day, was the bedrock Skullcandy was built on.

Rick threw himself full force into making his idea a reality just like he did with everything else in his life, from skating to snowboarding to art to tinkering in his garage. His get it done at all costs attitude attracted a core of like-minded mavericks who didn’t give a damn about playing by the rules or the insurmountable odds stacked against them. They were hell bent on turning the headphone game on its head and shaking some sense into a tired industry stuck in its monochromatic ways.

Long story short, it worked. In a sea of black and white we became a groundswell of color and style that the world had been waiting for. Skullcandy’s commitment to counterculture and self-expression scratched the audio itch of core up-and-comers and underdogs that nobody else could reach. We teamed up with kindred risk takers and pioneers living at full volume like artists, athletes, DJs and helped grow events that were far away from the main stage and mainstream. Skullcandy’s street cred grew and grew until we boldly secured our rightful place on store shelves and the heads of trendsetters and trailblazers everywhere.

Today Skullcandy is a global brand bringing the noise and pushing boundaries far and wide. We’ve successfully modernized audio and leveled the playing field by making high fidelity affordable and high style attainable . More importantly we’ve designed our headphones to be used and abused, not put on a shelf or in some fancy case. They’re made to be your trusty sidekick riding with you through thick and thin as you charge hard at everything you do.

We’ve firmly planted the Skullcandy flag at the intersection of sport, music, youth culture, art, film and fashion and are dropping in to become the experts at pushing human potential through the power of music. Our goal is simple: innovate to solve real problems and democratize amazing audio experiences with quality and style. For people like you—like all of us. We inspire life at full volume.

CEO Interview: Rick Alden of SkullCandy Alister & PaineDecember 7, 2009

 +12 Tweet Share8 Share1 PinShares 11Rick Alden of SkullCandy out-rides the economic avalanche and lets our readers know what he did to survive.  Live and learn.
Listen up.  Ernst & Young named this man Entrepreneur of the Year in 2008.  This year SkullCandy was listed as Number One for Consumer Electronics by Inc. Magazine (Ranked #14 in the Inc. 500 overall).  Did I mention they’ve grown over 6,251% in the past three years?
Snowboarder, entrepreneur, Deadhead.
We caught up with Rick Alden between impromptu business meetings and guest speaking at Weber State University to talk about how he figured out how to make serious money doing exactly what he loves.
 
Alister & Paine: I see SkullCandy brought in 86 million dollars in revenue last year—expected to hit $120 this year. How did a headphone company based out of Park City do that?
Rick Alden: Haha. We asked ourselves the same thing. We had intended to sell some cool lifestyle headphones to skateboard snowboard type lifestyle shops and we genuinely lucked into a great time in the market. 
Fantastic companies like Seinnheiser and Sony that had been selling headphones before us had just been under attending to a very useful, very young new user of headphones focused on the iPod demographic. 
Alister & Paine: How do you feel about a third of your profits being taken as taxes after all the blood, sweat and tears that goes into making it? 
Rick Alden: Taxes just gut you. On one hand you say, the taxes are going to support both the state and federal government that allows us to be able to do business and to be successful and to create an economy where we can be successful, so you have to grin and bear it a little bit, but still…
Alister & Paine: If you had 24 hours in the Oval Office to do anything, what would it be?
Rick Alden: Whew. I don’t often get asked questions that I’ve never thought about before. One, secure borders. Two, go to a fixed tax program. 
Alister & Paine: What’s the best perk of the job?
Rick Alden: When you actually start to scale the business and you’ve got enough money to hire a fantastic team. We have managed to assemble this world class dream team of management across the company. Not only does it make you a bunch of money but it just makes them the coolest people in the world to work with. 
Anytime I want to go anywhere in the world I just schedule a meeting in that country and go. 
Alister & Paine: We all know how the idea for the SkullCandy headphones came about, trying to answer your cell phone on a ski lift while listening to your iPod—what song were you listening to?
Rick Alden: Oh my goodness! Come on. I have no idea. I was probably listening to either The Grateful Dead or Phish. That’ll probably make a lot of people wonder what kind of guy I am.
Alister & Paine: Is SkullCandy a C-Corp or an S-Corp and what made you decide to go that route?
Rick Alden: Started out S-Corp but when you bring in investors you pretty much need to be C-Corp because as soon as you’re making money the tax effect for investors in the business passes a tax obligation onto the owners of the business. 
Alister & Paine: Once you had the idea, what were the preliminary steps to get it going?
Rick Alden: First it was having the time to do it. Then it was finding a factory that could develop the technology—I’m just a dumb snowboarder, not an electrical engineer. 
Then it was coming up with the first customers, developing some demand creation, and actually building the product. 
Where it got really hard for us was figuring out how to buy large volumes of inventory. We almost had to close the doors because we didn’t have the ability to finance the production of that first major purchase order. 
Alister & Paine: How did you raise capital?
Rick Alden: You can’t grow the business on debt, cause you need money. Literally my wife and I started this business off our family savings and then a home equity loan. Having sufficient capital to be able to buy inventory in the early days and to be able to build the company in the early days was a real challenge. 
Debt is expensive, equity is really expensive if the company is successful, but revenue doesn’t cost you anything. We’ve worked hard and have been reinvesting that money into the business every year.
Alister & Paine: What was your startup strategy? 
Rick Alden: We went to Burton Snowboards and we started doing audio beanies with Burton and really unique headphone jackets with Bonfire Snowboard clothing all powered by SkullCandy. We did dozens of these collaborations building audio into other people’s products. 
Suddenly we had a dozen fantastic world class companies inside the skateboard snowboard community that were advertising and promoting ‘Powered by SkullCandy’ in their campaigns. 
We also gifted headphones to every pro skater, pro snowboarder, pro surfer, pro mountain biker, any super cool athlete, and made sure everyone one of them got free headphones. 
Alister & Paine: Where do you find your motivation?
Rick Alden: A big part of the desperation and inspiration for me has always been I just want to work for myself, I don’t want to work for anyone else. 
The real motivation for growth right now is the investors. If you’re going to take investors into your business and take their money, you have a real responsibility that you get them a return on their money. 
Alister & Paine: There are thousands of hungry entrepreneurs out there. What advice do you have for them?
Rick Alden: Get to market. So many people try and spend so much time trying to perfect a product before they go out and sell it and what they don’t realize is that every year they’re expected to have better product. 
There’s always a new version of software because software always gets better because it was never perfect the last time they released it. Cars are never perfect when they release it. That’s why they have the next changing model with all those things improved on it. 
Alister & Paine: If you could be any person, dead or alive, who would you want to be—besides yourself?
Rick Alden: I’m going to have to go with Craig Kelly. Do you have any idea who Craig Kelly is?
Alister & Paine: I have a feeling I should. 
Rick Alden: No you shouldn’t, because if you did you would live in the small knit world that I live in. Craig Kelly was one of the first and greatest snowboarders that ever lived. He snowboarded in places and with more style than any snowboarder that ever lived in his time. I would love to be able to know the places and the freedom and the amount of creativity and style that he snowboarded with. 
How shallow an answer is that? I’m not coming up with Gandhi, I’m not coming up with Jesus Christ, I’m coming up with Craig Kelly. How about that.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
