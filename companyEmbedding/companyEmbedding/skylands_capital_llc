Our Firm
Skylands Capital, LLC is a long/short equity investment firm specializing in U.S. equities. Skylands manages four long-biased long/short portfolios as well as long-only assets.
Skylands’ origins date to 1983, the year our oldest portfolio was launched within our predecessor firm, Strong Capital Management (“SCM”). Skylands’ owner and head portfolio manager, Charles ("Chip") Paquelet, began his career at SCM in 1989. While Chip was tasked with many roles at SCM, managing and growing the hedge fund business unit was his primary responsibility. In 2004, with the full endorsement of SCM, Chip led a management buyout of the hedge fund business unit into a newly created firm named Skylands Capital, LLC. Reflecting Skylands' emphasis on continuity, the majority of our team members today were formerly associates at SCM.
A number of Skylands’ associates have personal capital invested alongside our clients, ensuring our interests are aligned.
The firm is registered as an investment advisor with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.


“We have many client relationships that span over 20 years. This speaks to our long-term investment performance and commitment to the client.”
Chip Paquelet

FirmLeadershipInvestment TeamStrategyPhilosophy
























investment strategy
Our investment approach emphasizes on-site meetings with the companies in which we invest. On an annual basis, we typically have over 500 meetings with management teams. Through these meetings we:

Evaluate management;
Learn about management’s strategy and goals;
Assess the company’s structural competitive advantages;
Probe the growth prospects, including new or differentiated products that will impact a company’s ability to grow;
Perform financial analyses, such as profit margin and return on capital measures, to evaluate the quality of the business;
Inquire about competitors and suppliers as a cross check for other investments we may be considering.

Once we have collected data and formed a view about a company’s growth prospects, we build financial models and establish valuation targets. Importantly, businesses are not static so it is imperative to regularly update our inputs so that our financial models and valuation targets reflect current information.
The portfolio construction takes into account valuation work, growth prospects and an assessment of how macroeconomic trends are affecting individual companies and industries. Our goal is to assemble a diverse portfolio of attractively valued stocks in businesses that we believe are poised to deliver above average growth. In addition to monitoring and updating the portfolio holdings, we are always on the hunt to discover new opportunities to upgrade the portfolio.



“We believe that visiting companies offers unique insights into an enterprise's growth prospects and competitive advantages.”

Philosophy :: Skylands Capital

FirmLeadershipInvestment TeamStrategyPhilosophy
























Investment philosophy
We believe:


Economies, markets and individual companies are exposed to a myriad of cycles. Those cycles can include interest rates, commodity prices, regulatory changes, taxes, competitive behavior and many others. The human mind and most investors are predisposed to extrapolate recent trends. This linear thinking in a world that is inherently cyclical creates wonderful investment opportunities for investors who understand cycles and can anticipate change before it is obvious.


Stock prices fluctuate much more than the underlying value of a business. This volatility can be exploited by trading around core positions.


Long-term value creation is heavily dependent on capital deployment. Most investors are laser focused on what a company will earn in the next quarter or year. We believe that how those profits are deployed is just as important as having earned them in the first place. History is replete with “strategic” acquisitions that often fail to produce acceptable economic returns. Managements should be questioned on how they evaluate the relative attractiveness of their various capital deployment options.


It is a false choice to invest in either growth or value. The optimal investment is a structurally advantaged growing business that can be purchased at a value price. There are two sides to investing - what you get and what you pay. Both are important.


Management matters: strategy, motivation, track record, goal setting, and capital deployment.


Maintain flexibility. The only constant is change. Accordingly, a flexible approach with a liquid portfolio enables the portfolio manager to adapt to changing circumstances.


These statements are included for illustrative purposes only, do not comprise an investment program and are not intended as a complete description of Skylands' investment philosophy.
