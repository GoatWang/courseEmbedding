Kailua development near Kawainui Marsh raises questions
2014-11-14T03:04:28Z2014-11-14T04:50:30Z












KAILUA, OAHU (HawaiiNewsNow) -
            A plan for a new industrial park in Kailua is stirring some controversy. That's because the developer wants to build it right next to the largest wetland area in the state.This 23 acres would eventually turn into nine warehouses and a base yard for light industrial companies to work. The development would be located at the current Hawaiian Earth Products site on Kapaa Quarry Road. It is part of the Kawainui Marsh which is a special management area.Opponents point out the landowners questionable past. Its tenants have been cited and fined for illegal grading and stockpiling. There is also a state investigation accusing a tenant of illegally dumping oils and chemicals."I see evidence of oil spills. I don't know how any of the other government departments that go out there to look can't see it it's so obvious," said Vern Hinsvark, Kailua Neighborhood Board Member who opposes the development.The landowner, Kapaa I LLC., says it's all been a wakeup call. They hired a sustainable design firm to help build a Leed Development incorporating environmentally friendly features. The area used to be a landfill so they will seal it up and filter the water that runs off."I would argue that's a much better situation than what's there now with this untreated unfiltered water that runs straight from the landfill into the marsh," said Ikaika Anderson, Honolulu City Councilmember who represents the area.The City Council has unanimously approved the rezoning and a special use permit to clean up prior violations. Furthermore they've said the Windward side needs more industrial property."You can balance the needs of businesses and the needs of the environment. One does not have to suffer. Businesses don't have to suffer for the environment. The environment doesn't have to suffer for businesses to be successful," said Susan King, Kapaa I LLC.Kapaa I also says it will educate tenants about the Kawainui Marsh and have rules to follow.However the Kailua neighborhood board opposes the development saying the landowners can't even control the current tenants."If they can't take care of the land they have now I question they'll be able to maintain it on a long term basis," said Hinsvark."I feel like they can trust us. I hope they know they can trust us and we're going to show them that they can," said King.Councilman Anderson vouched for the King family saying they have organized numerous community clean-ups of Kawainui Marsh and positive environmental stewards."I have faith this family is going to do what they said they were going to do," said Anderson."It's like a mask. They do all these good things, but that doesn't allow them to do the bad things they do," said Hinsvark.Kapaa I says it's still about three to four years before any buildings go up.Copyright 2014 Hawaii News Now.

									S. Susan King
									(SBN: 261777)

Email: sking@cohendurrett.com


Education:
University of California at Davis, King Hall Law School – 2007
University of California at Berkeley – 2000


Biography:
S. Susan King is an associate with the law firm of CohenDurrett. Her practice focuses on business formations and compliance, succession planning, business sales and acquisitions, and other transactional matters. Ms. King has formed and counseled numerous business entities of varying sizes and purposes, from both small and large family-owned enterprises to 501c3 nonprofit public benefit organizations to project-specific vehicles for asset protection purposes. She navigates her clients through the complex analysis of tax and non-tax considerations to choose the entity form that best suits their needs, whether that be a C- or S-corporation, general or limited partnership, or limited liability company. 


Ms. King believes that formation is only the first step for every business entity. Continued compliance and recordkeeping throughout the life of the business entity is a key component for preserving the “corporate veil” and the shield of limited liability, and yet, corporate governance often falls by the wayside as clients concentrate on growing the business. Through experienced and timely counsel, Ms. King strives to maintain her clients in good standing and guides them through the twists and turns of operating a business.


In recent years, Ms. King has expanded her practice into estate planning and trust administration as natural outgrowths of her business succession planning practice. While estate tax liability is not a concern for many people, Ms. King believes that a carefully crafted estate plan is still essential to avoid probate, to communicate one’s wishes to loved ones, and to plan for both the expected and unexpected. 


Ms. King was admitted to the California bar in 2008 after attending law school at U.C. Davis. After graduation, she entered private practice and has served the Sacramento area for eight years.  Ms. King is a member of the State Bar of California, the Sacramento County Bar Association, and the Sacramento Estate Planning Council.

Susan King’s Royal Treatment
 






Susan King’s Royal Treatment
While King’s legislative record is well known, her criminal record is not. And she is fighting to keep it hidden from her constituents and voters.






April 15, 2016by Cary CheshireCategory: Under The DomeIn the United States, citizens and elected officials are supposed to be equal under the law. The U.S. Constitution bans titles of nobility, and demands no special treatment for any citizen over another. However, one Texas lawmaker believes she deserves an exception.
State Rep. Susan King (R-Abilene) has represented a slice of Texas for nearly ten years. In office, King has served as a committee chair in the coalition government of liberal Republicans and Democrats that governs the Texas House. Unsurprisingly she has voted as a typical establishment, grow-government Republican, earning a failing grade on the Fiscal Responsibility Index for voting to increase her own office budget, authorize billions in new state debt, and other poor choices.
While King’s legislative record is well known, her criminal record is not. And she is fighting to keep it hidden from her constituents and voters.
After an incident at her home in November that resulted in a police response, King was checked into a treatment facility for depression and suspended her campaign to replace outgoing State Sen. Troy Fraser (R-Horseshoe Bay). King relaunched her campaign in December and quickly sought to have her record with the Abilene Police Department sealed.
In response to several Public Information Act requests, the Attorney General ruled that the police reports were public records and King’s constituents were entitled to see them. However, King was successful in suing for a restraining order on the release of her criminal record in the courtroom of a liberal Travis County Judge. King claims that she is merely protecting her “health records” from public scrutiny, but many argue that a police response is far different than a doctor’s medical records.
Matt Langston, a spokesman for King’s runoff election opponent, asserts the King campaign is conflating health records and criminal records in order to cover up potentially embarrassing events that occurred at her home in November.
“When you have a medical issue you don’t call the cops, you call an ambulance,” said Langston. “The fact is that [King’s] temporary restraining order is with the Abilene Police Department — as she attempts to keep them from doing their job and complying with a legal, open records request.”
In Texas, 911 calls aren’t considered health records, and are widely obtainable across the state. They are routinely released to the media upon request. Requests for 911 calls are so frequent that the Houston Police Department even includes them on their website among the “most common types of requests.” Despite that fact, many in the media seem to be openly carrying water for the King campaign and inappropriately deeming a call to the police as part of King’s “health records.”
The coverage has drawn criticism from Robert Pratt, host of the popular “Pratt on Texas” radio show.
“All of it is journalistic malpractice creating an atmosphere of victimhood for Rep. King who, as a matter of record, was the one who told the public of her treatment for depression,” said Pratt. “Why is this so egregious? Because no health records were ever at issue in the case – such are private and protected by law. The Temporary Restraining Order, and the entire case, is about nothing more than government records routinely released: 911 calls. That’s it.”
King’s success in the Travis County courtroom means the case won’t be reopened until November. As a result, her criminal record “conveniently” won’t be released until after her primary campaign has already been decided. Until then, citizens will be left in the dark with regard to what the police records contain. But one thing is clear for Texans to see —the special treatment given to Susan King is yet another example of a politically motivated privilege granted to those in Texas’ political class.

Traditionally, appropriators in the Texas Legislature utilize what’s commonly referred to as “incremental” budgeting. Under that process, agencies begin at their previous appropriation amount and are provided increases to account for rising costs, population, etc.
Such a practice is inherently flawed because it rests on the assumption that the particular agency is running efficiently and revenue is spent appropriately. In addition to enabling waste, fraud, and abuse, the process is also rigid and slow to adapt.
The answer to this should be a zero-based budgeting system. Under that process, the state budget is wiped clean every time and is re-calculated as if starting from scratch. That way, departments, agencies, and other government entities find it much tougher to spend your tax dollars inefficiently because they cannot count on current levels of spending to be maintained.
By implementing zero-based budgeting, lawmakers could make government smaller and more efficient for taxpayers.

Union Dues 

Public sector unions in Texas are given the benefit of using taxpayer resources to collect and pay out their members’ dues. Once a government employee joins a public union, the state allows dues to be automatically deducted from employee paychecks and transferred directly to their respective union. In the hands of unions, the funds are primarily utilized to advocate against business-friendly, free market, and pro-taxpayer legislation.
By continuing this practice Texas further emboldens unions. In states where union members manually contribute their dues on a regular basis, unions have seen a sharp decline in membership.
Government collection of union dues also presents a conflict of interest. State and local officials are charged with negotiating contracts with unions who lobby, donate, and campaign within the same political realm.
By abolishing the practice of government-collected union dues, union members would still be able to contribute to associations of their choosing – the cost burden would simply fall on the unions themselves. Taxpayers should not be forced to pay for the collection of funds that are essentially used to lobby against polarized, anti-free market ideals.

Tax-funded Lobbying 

In a free-market system, customers are often loathe to spend money at businesses that reinvest their profits towards political aspirations they find abhorrent. Unfortunately, no such freedom exists when local governments decide to use your tax dollars to lobby the state legislature. Citizens have little recourse when it comes to paying the taxes decided on by their local officials — and none whatsoever when it comes to how that money is spent.
What is most egregious about the practice of tax-funded lobbying is the policy goals these lobbyists seek. As a creation of the state, the legislature is often tasked with reigning in the taxing and regulatory authority abused by runaway local government entities — which is where these hired guns come into play. They lobby your state legislators to oppose things such as protections from tax increases, ballot transparency initiatives, and annexation authority just to name a few.
Anything that might prevent these entities from taking more of your hard earned tax dollars — they will spend your money to defeat.
Texas taxpayers currently shoulder one of the highest property tax burdens in the nation — coming it at 6th highest in the U.S. There can be little doubt that tax-funded lobbyists have had a hand in that role — and considering more than half of registered lobbyists are funded by local governments, it’s time to end this fundamentally anti-taxpayer practice.

Spending Limits 

Since 2004, state spending is up 12 percent beyond population and inflation growth – a testament to the weak spending limit applied to Texas’ budget.
Though the state legislature must pass a balanced budget (meaning spending can be no greater than the revenue anticipated), the state constitution and enacting statutes only limit the spending growth in certain areas. The net effect is that less than half of all appropriated funds are actually subject to a cap.
In addition to its application, the existing spending cap is also flawed in its definition. Rather than being defined by a metric factoring population and inflation growth, it’s defined as the “rate of growth in the state’s economy” – however legislators are allowed to define exactly what that means. Should legislators seek to spend above and beyond the limit they set for themselves, they only need a majority vote in both chambers to “bust the cap.”
Taxpayers concerned about the exploding growth of government should tell their lawmakers to pass a constitutional amendment strengthening the existing state expenditure limit.
Rather than capping only a portion of the budget, all state spending (including those related to drawing down federal funds) should be subject to the cap, and a super-majority vote of both legislative chambers should be required to exceed it. Additionally, rather than basing the limit on the ill-defined and legislatively malleable phrase in place now, it should instead be based off the rate of population and consumer price inflation growth.
This measure goes to what citizens can actually afford, not what lawmakers want to spend.
Had such a limit been implemented in 2004, Texas taxpayers would have saved an estimated $22 billion.

Rollback Rates 

Texas lawmakers have limited the amount local officials can increase property taxes each year on existing taxpayers, otherwise known as the “rollback rate.” Under current law, if the proposed tax increase exceeds this “rollback” threshold, local citizens can conduct a signature petition drive to force a public vote on the tax rate.
Unfortunately, this public vote is not automatic, meaning local officials (with the exception of school boards) can raise taxes as much as they please without obtaining any voter approval. Lawmakers should lower the rollback rate, but local voters should be empowered by requiring that they approve tax increases over and above this rollback threshold.
The legislature limits annual property tax increases for local operating budgets because local governments experiencing growth should rely upon new taxpayers to pay for their own services. Existing residents should not be tax-gouged each year for the same services, without an option to vote on the tax increase.

Property Taxes 

Texans don’t own their home, they rent it from the government. That’s certainly what it feels like to most taxpayers when they receive the annual property tax bill. The burden of property taxes is growing more rapidly, while incomes remain stagnant. Texas is consistently ranked near the top of the list of states throughout the country with the highest property taxes.
Texans aren’t subject to one property tax. Rather, they are subject to thousands upon thousands of local property taxes. Many taxpayers have more than a dozen local taxing entities overlapping them! Holding each and every entity accountable is difficult even for the most active citizen. Making matters worse, increases in property tax bills from year to year are nearly impossible to forecast, making it difficult for homeowners to budget for, and even more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the market.
A more fair and equitable system of taxation is based upon consumption, rather than property or income. The Legislature should continue working towards ways to buy down the maintenance and operations (M&O) portion of school district property taxes with state funds and eventually fund it entirely through sales taxes. The legislature should also continue to pass pro-taxpayer reforms, including greater protections from local tax increases, appraisal reform, and more transparency.

Pension Reform 

Thirteen municipal pension systems in Texas are enshrined in state statute. This means that, locally, Texans across the state are paying taxes into pension systems that they have no control over. Even worse, even the most menial changes to these systems must be approved by the legislature before going into effect. This gives municipalities 140 days every two years to coordinate all stakeholders to push for change.
This creates a major problem during times when local governments can’t afford to pay the full actuarial required amount into their pensions systems. Instead of working with their local pension board for temporary resolutions, they either have to go to the legislature for changes or redirect tax dollars from other local projects.
Local government entities should have direct governance, and responsibility, for the pensions of their municipal employees. Mayors and city councils shouldn’t have to go to the legislature for minor changes that should be handled locally; adding an extra layer of bureaucratic red tape only limits the potential for constructive change. The state should return control to local entities, as long as the local process proves to be accountable and transparent to taxpayers and municipal employees.

Local Debt 

Each Texan currently owes local governments a total of roughly $12,500 in debt payments, the second-highest amount of any state in America. Only New York has more local debt, per person, than Texas. This has contributed to Texans paying the 6th highest property taxes in the nation, according to the Tax Foundation.
While voters have approved much of this debt through local propositions in May and November elections, greater ballot transparency is needed. Also, cities are abusing Certificates of Obligation – which do not require voter approval – and should only be used in emergencies such as natural disasters.
The legislature has allowed too many entities to issue local debt. The largest borrowers are school districts, followed by cities, counties, and thousands of “special purpose” districts. Water, hospital, and community college districts also owe billions in debt.
Uniform election dates, greater ballot transparency, local debt limits, and fewer overlapping local entities will help Texans seeking to address our local debt crisis.

Franchise Tax 

The Texas Franchise Tax is an overly complex tax levied on Texas businesses’ gross revenue. Contrary to an income tax or sales tax, businesses are subject to a gross margin tax even when they take a loss and the taxes continue to stack up through every step of production of a product.
The franchise tax is also structured in such a complex way that compliance costs are often almost as much as the tax itself, with businesses having to pay higher accounting fees and often being forced to keep two separate sets of books.
The Texas Legislature recently made a move to lower the burden on Texas businesses; however, to truly lift the burden off of businesses and taxpayers, further action must be taken to phase out or repeal the franchise tax immediately.

Ethics Reform 

In the world of public policy, “ethics” is often a misnomer. Webster’s dictionary defines “ethics” as “rules of behavior based on ideas about what is morally good and bad.” Yet everything from open records and open meetings laws to laws regulating lobbying, elections, and campaign finance are often lumped together under the label of “ethics.”
Alarmingly, advocates against free speech and public participation in elections often attempt to place the “ethics” label on legislation limiting the free speech rights of citizens. These efforts to stifle speech must be fought at every turn.
The true need for so-called “ethics” laws stems from a growing public understanding that many elected officials use their offices to enrich themselves rather than serve the citizens. Good “ethics reform” should be aimed directly at eliminating and exposing this self-dealing. The only way to do that is to impose additional disclosure requirements on elected officials and government employees, not on citizens who choose to be engaged in their communities.
Good reforms in this area include ending the revolving door in which elected officials leave office and immediately go to work as hired gun lobbyists. Even more shocking, we must end the currently common practice of elected officials serving as pay-for-play lobbyists while they are in office. Similarly, Texans need to know when and how their elected officials are making money off of government contracts and government bonds.

Corporate Welfare 

The state, as well as local governments across Texas, disperse millions of taxpayer dollars annually to businesses handpicked by government officials. The funds are given via incentive programs such as the Major Event Trust Fund (METF) and Texas Enterprise Fund (TEF) at the state level and tax increment reinvestment zones (TIRZ) at the local level.
By offering subsidies, governments hope to encourage businesses to relocate and/or expand in Texas. Economic development is the overlying idea behind the programs, however, they have received heavy criticism due to the state’s inability to effectively measure their economic impact, a lack of accountability, and the picking of “winners and losers” by the government officials.
The idea of state and local governments using tax revenue in an effort to “create wealth” contradicts free market values and the principles of open competition. Texas’ relatively friendly business environment and low tax rates serve as a pre-existing draw for businesses and a natural catalyst for economic growth. In addition, little research has been provided to show that the benefits of the programs actually outweigh the financial costs.
By abolishing corporate welfare programs, government officials will be encouraged to keep taxes and red tape at a minimum in order to stay competitive and use those funds to create a more balanced budget that addresses the more pressing needs of Texas residents.

Ballot Transparency 

Local governments primarily issue debt in May or November, with ballot propositions that require a simple majority of local voters. But state law does not require voters to have detailed information on the ballot to make an informed decision.
In addition to the amount of debt voters are asked to approve, the ballot language should also disclose the proposal’s total cost – including interest expense – the current debt liability of that entity, and the impact on property taxes if the proposition passes or fails.
Unrelated projects, such as administration buildings, fire stations, vehicles, schools, and football stadiums, should be listed as separate propositions for voters to approve or deny. Current law allows local officials to hold the “needs” of a community hostage to unnecessary “wants,” by lumping hundreds of unrelated projects into a single, one-sentence, all-or-nothing proposition.
Voters should be given more than a one-sentence description on the ballot when considering hundreds of projects that cost hundreds of millions of dollars or more in new debt.

Appraisal Reform 

There are two variables that determine the total amount of property taxes homeowners pay each year: the tax rate and the appraised value of the home. Local government officials often brag about how they keep tax rates the same (even lower them!) from year to year, yet tax bills continue to grow. Why? Because the appraised value of homes in the district increase to the point that they offset any reduction in the tax rate.
Appraisal districts are comprised of appointees from those very same taxing entities, rather than taxpayers, giving the appraisal districts a perverse incentive to artificially increase revenue via appraisal increases any time those taxing entities don’t want to be held accountable for raising taxes.
Additionally, the appraised value of a home may increase by up to 10% each year, even when population and inflation growth rates are much lower.
Taxpayers should tell their legislators to pass meaningful appraisal reform to hold appraisal districts accountable to the public, not local taxing entities, and lower the cap on appraisal increases to protect taxpayers from dramatic increases in their property tax bills.
