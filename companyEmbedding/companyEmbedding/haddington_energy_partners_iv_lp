Haddington Energy Partners Closes On $350 Million Private Equity Fund For Midstream Energy Investments

HOUSTON, Nov. 15, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Haddington Ventures, L.L.C. announced today that it has closed its latest private equity fund, Haddington Energy Partners IV, LP (HEP IV), with total committed capital of nearly $350 million targeted for investments in midstream energy infrastructure.  
According to senior managing partner Chris Jones, HEP IV is targeting conventional midstream opportunities and is seeking to invest in experienced midstream management teams with proven track records of success in entrepreneurial environments.  
"HEP IV clearly demonstrates Haddington's commitment to building infrastructure in the midstream energy business by investing in entrepreneurs with the skills to create and grow world-class midstream projects and companies," Mr. Jones said.  "These management teams require strong leaders able to drive strategic company visions, create and manage highly capable organizations, and integrate strong operating capabilities.  HEP IV targets management teams to both develop or acquire and optimize a wide variety of midstream infrastructure."    
"HEP IV closed at nearly double the size of HEP III, which served to diversify Haddington's investor base significantly," said Terry Crikelair, Managing Partner of Champlain Advisors, LLC, who served as exclusive placement agent.  "We were pleased with the strong interest from several new investors along with the continued support from the existing investor base."
Haddington has raised nearly $700 million of equity capital since its formation in 1998.  Currently, one third of Haddington's management teams are repeat portfolio company management teams from prior Haddington funds. 
Haddington's senior partners are all former successful midstream entrepreneurs and operators; their prior entrepreneurial backgrounds have since been supplemented with a lengthy history of working together as fund managers at Haddington.  This unusual combination of backgrounds allows Haddington to bring a wealth of midstream contacts and experiences to its portfolio company teams, along with a proven track record of successfully sponsoring midstream asset acquisition and development teams.
The participating investors in HEP IV include insurance companies, public and private pensions, endowments, bank holding companies and high net worth individuals.  
Greenwich, CT-based Champlain Advisors, LLC, a global fund placement and investor relations advisory firm, served as Haddington's exclusive placement agent in raising HEP IV.

Haddington Ventures closes on new $350 million private equity fund for midstream








November 15, 2012



































Houston-based Haddington Ventures LLC said November 15 that it has closed its latest private equity fund, Haddington Energy Partners IV, LP (HEP IV), with total committed capital of nearly $350 million targeted for investments in midstream energy infrastructure.
According to senior managing partner Chris Jones, HEP IV is targeting conventional midstream opportunities and is seeking to invest in experienced midstream management teams with proven track records of success in entrepreneurial environments.
“HEP IV clearly demonstrates Haddington’s commitment to building infrastructure in the midstream energy business by investing in entrepreneurs with the skills to create and grow world-class midstream projects and companies,” Jones said. “These management teams require strong leaders able to drive strategic company visions, create and manage highly capable organizations, and integrate strong operating capabilities. HEP IV targets management teams to both develop or acquire and optimize a wide variety of midstream infrastructure.”

Greenwich, CT-based Champlain Advisors, LLC, a global fund placement and investor relations advisory firm, served as Haddington’s exclusive placement agent in raising HEP IV.
Haddington Ventures LLC, through its private equity funds, generally makes control-oriented investments in companies focused on gathering, separation, processing, treating, compression, storage, and transmission of energy. Haddington is the only midstream energy fund in which all principals have substantial direct operating company experience, both in energy-related acquisitions and in energy infrastructure development.
Champlain Advisors is an independently owned provider of global fund placement and investor relations advisory services to alternative investment managers. Champlain’s team has raised over $21 billion of institutional capital globally for leading alternative investment managers. Champlain is an SEC registered broker/dealer and FINRA/SIPC member firm.

Private equity investor Haddington Ventures, through its fund Haddington Energy Partners IV LP, will buy the subsidiary Continental Gas Storage Deutschland GmbH from parent company Continental Gas Storage BV. Financial terms of the deal were not released. Haddington Ventures is based in Houston.

PRESS RELEASE:
Haddington Ventures, L.L.C. announced today that it has entered into an exclusive agreement with Continental Gas Storage BV (CGS) to purchase that Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Continental Gas Storage Deutschland GmbH (CGSD), through Haddington Energy Partners IV LP, a private equity fund managed by Haddington.
The proposed transaction is subject to further due diligence by Haddington and is expected to close by mid-year 2011. Once closed, the transaction will enable the continued development and construction of CGS’s Epe Underground Natural Gas Storage project, located in Germany.
Haddington is a leading private equity firm, active in the midstream energy business sector. The Fund generally makes control-oriented investments in companies focused on gathering, separation, processing, treating, compression, storage, and transmission of oil and natural gas. Haddington is a truly unique organization as a midstream energy fund manager with principals and investment professionals possessing substantial direct operating experience. As such, the Fund is capable of investing in both operating enterprises with growth potential and green-field development opportunities. This capability allows Haddington to capitalize on current market conditions in the midstream energy sector globally. 





Continental Gas Storage (www.continentalgasstorage.com) was established to provide non-integrated flexible gas storage and services to customers such as gas producers, power producers, natural gas distribution companies and large end users of natural gas. CGS aims to convert nine salt caverns into an underground natural gas storage facility in four phases to provide its customers with effective third-party access to flexible storage services. The salt caverns are ideally located in Northwest Europe in Germany. The Company plans to develop the project in multiple phases and all nine caverns are expected to be on-line by 2019.
CGS expects to reach maximum capacity of approximately 644 million cubic meters (mcm), or 25 billion cubic feet (Bcf), of working storage capacity by 2020 with all nine caverns in commercial operation. The initial investment is estimated to be approximately euro 310,000,000 (US$410,000,000), including acquisitions, financing and construction costs, for a total working gas volume of approximately 261 mcm (10.1 Bcf). The final plant expansions are expected to be completed by 2018 with additional investment of approximately euro 200,000,000 (US$270,000,000) for 383 mcm (14.9 Bcf) of additional working gas capacity.
Haddington Managing Director, J. Chris Jones stated: “We are very pleased with our engagement with Continental Gas Storage. It is our strong desire to participate in the European midstream energy markets, and we are very happy to be a potential partner with users of and suppliers to the natural gas storage market participants in Europe. In addition, we feel privileged to be associated with high-quality companies as counterparts. Haddington and its principals have developed, or are developing, in excess of 131 Bcf of high-deliverability gas storage projects at five different locations throughout the United States since 1989. We look forward to combining our historical expertise with the outstanding talent at CGS and to building the first independently owned and operated gas storage project in the European Union.” 





“With our continued collaboration with Haddington, our Epe Project has gained further momentum towards realization,” said Bertan Atalay, Managing Director & CEO. “It is our strong intent to work very closely with our advisors, contractors and counterparts to move the Epe Project forward to construction in the near term.”

Sago Energy

Investment Status: realized
Sector: Gathering & Processing
Investment Fund: Fund I, Fund II
Geography: Louisiana & Texas
Initial Investment: March 1, 2000
Date of Disposition:March 1, 2004

In March 2000, Fund I acquired a 93.6% ownership interest in Sago with the purchase of the Ledco gathering and processing facilities in Louisiana from Tejas Gas LLC, an affiliate of Shell Oil Company. The assets were small non-core assets that Shell deemed non-strategic after its acquisition of Tejas Gas. Haddington had a historical working relationship with one of the founders of Sago and believed that Sago could establish operations with the purchase of the Louisiana assets, and then grow through opportunistic acquisitions of additional smaller, under-performing midstream assets.  Revenues from the Louisiana assets served to fund overhead while Sago pursued additional acquisitions. After evaluating more than 30 follow-on acquisition opportunities over the next three years, Sago purchased the Jameson Processing Plant and 2,200 miles of natural gas gathering systems in West Texas in March 2003 at an attractive earnings multiple. This follow on investment was made by Fund II and significantly augmented the size of Sago’s business and permitted it to expand operations into the Permian Basin of West Texas. In March 2004, Sago was acquired by West Texas Gas Inc.

Lodi Gas Storage 

Investment Status: realized
Sector: Natural Gas Storage
Investment Fund: Fund I, Fund II
Geography: California
Initial Investment: Nov. 1, 1998
Date of Disposition:Dec. 1, 2005

In the late 1990s, Haddington perceived a need for development of high deliverability natural gas storage projects in the western United States. California was beginning to deregulate several segments of the energy industry. At the time of WHP’s inception, Haddington believed California had insufficient natural gas storage capacity to stabilize the energy market. California demand was growing dramatically in excess of national rates, while little investment was being made in natural gas infrastructure. California was encouraging new entrants into the natural gas market and the supply profile was expected to change through the development of new market options for the Midwest by Canadian producers via the then proposed Alliance Pipeline and the previously announced expansions on TransCanada and Northern Border. In Haddington’s view, deregulation encourages the development of new services and assets and ultimately leads to commodity price volatility due to fluctuating supply and demand. High deliverability storage can stabilize fluctuating supply and demand.In 1998, Haddington formed Western Hub Properties (WHP) as a provider of cost efficient energy storage services to traditional gas users and independent power producers. Haddington presented WHP with an opportunity to develop a project located near Lodi, California. Haddington used its proprietary methodology of calculating storage value to predict that the Lodi project would generate acceptable rates of return. Haddington formed Lodi Gas Storage, a wholly owned subsidiary of WHP, to operate the Lodi project, recruited the Lodi Gas Storage management team, and assisted in arranging the original project financing.In October of 2002, ArcLight acquired a 50% equity interest in Lodi Gas Storage. In December 2005, ArcLight acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in Lodi Gas Storage, effectively completing the sale of WHP’s only natural gas storage asset.

Apex CAES 

Investment Status: active
Sector: Electric storage and power generation
Investment Fund: Fund IV
Geography: Texas
Initial Investment: Jan. 1, 2011

Storing compressed air
CAES is a proven power storage and generation technology that involves storing compressed air in underground caverns for use later as a source of energy. 
CAES has unique capabilities to satisfy emerging grid and power market needs.  Currently, Apex is pursuing CAES projects within Texas; however, it plans to target opportunities in other markets where the addition of intermittent wind and solar resources increase the value of grid regulation and time shifting of energy.  Apex is currently permitting its first CAES site on the Bethel salt dome in East Texas and expects to break ground by mid 2014. 
The Apex management team possesses exceptionally strong power industry experience encompassing power development, marketing, commodity risk management, corporate development and finance. Haddington’s experience in CAES includes developing the Norton CAES project in northern Ohio, which was sold in 2010 to FirstEnergy Corp.  Additionally, Haddington has extensive experience developing underground natural gas storage projects.  The combination of a highly accomplished management team and an investor with broad experience in energy storage enhances Apex’s ability to successfully execute on its objectives.
