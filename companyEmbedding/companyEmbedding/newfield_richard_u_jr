"Rick is a highly experienced, proven banker with an established track record of success in risk management and financial institution operations, integration of businesses during mergers and corporate governance," said Tim Laney, president and chief executive officer of NBH. 
With NBH's recent acquisition of Bank Midwest and the eventual merging of Hillcrest Bank into the new Bank Midwest this spring, the holding company is well poised for additional growth. NBH is one of the best-capitalized bank holding companies in the U.S. and was specifically created to establish a high-performing, community-focused banking enterprise. NBH's goal remains to deliver a superior level of service and to be recognized for their commitment to their customers, colleagues, communities and investors. NBH has the leadership in place to execute their strategy of building a strong banking presence in the Midwest and to prepare to become a publicly traded bank holding company.
In his new role at NBH, Newfield will be responsible for risk management operations, including compliance, operational, credit and market risk as well as business services credit, credit operations, problem asset management, risk analytics and regulatory affairs. As the Business Services Credit Executive at Regions Bank, Newfield was responsible for oversight of business lending approvals and loan portfolio quality across all business client segments.   During his 23 year tenure at Bank of America, he held various senior roles in risk management, credit, commercial banking, global bank debt and corporate marketing. Newfield brings significant experience to NBH in the areas of development and implementation of business models and integration of businesses during mergers. In addition, he has led credit process reengineering initiatives, including risk and credit policy design, and corporate governance.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
