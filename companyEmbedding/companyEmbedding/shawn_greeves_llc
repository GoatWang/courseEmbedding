Many Probate Attorneys call upon us to purchase properties in settling estates. In addition to purchasing the property in Probate, we can offer estate advances to the Heirs in need of funds prior to the Probate Process completing. Give Us a call to discuss your particular situation. Ray Bartle Realty & Investments also assists buyers in realizing the Dream of Owning their own home.

8/9/11 Tuesday, Berkeley -- Leslie Banks, 26, left, reacts when
her landlord, Shawn Greeves, right tells her that he has another
house that she can move into with her family after Banks rental
home in the 6000 block of Hancock in Berkeley burned Tuesday
afternoon. Three adults and four kids got out of the house safely
along with a cat, but everything inside the house was destroyed.
"You've been a really good tenant," said Greeves. "I'm going to
take care of you." J.B. Forbes jforbes@post-dispatch.com
