History[edit]




Zions retail footprint


Zions' history dates back to the founding of Zion's Savings Bank and Trust Company, which was opened in the fall of 1873 by Brigham Young during the Mormon settlement of Utah. It was Utah's first chartered savings bank and trust company.
During the Panic of 1893, the bank managed not only to remain solvent, but continue to grow.[2]
During the early 20th century, Zions financed such firms as:[2]

Bingham Copper Company (later Kennecott Utah Copper)
Salt Lake and Los Angeles Railroad Company (now Union Pacific Railroad)
Big Cottonwood Power Company (later Utah Power and today Rocky Mountain Power)
Salt Lake Gas Company (later Mountain Fuel Supply Company and today Questar Gas)

The Panic of 1907 was the lone interruption in the steady growth of Zions. But even with this interruption, deposits grew.[citation needed]
Great Depression[edit]
At the time of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Zions was in a very sound financial position.[citation needed] On the morning of February 15, 1932, customers began a run on the bank, waiting in lines that ran out of the building and onto the street. Tellers were instructed to honor all withdrawal requests. In 2.5 days, a total of $1.5 million was withdrawn. Near the end of the second day, bank president Heber J. Grant placed a sign in the bank's window that read, in part:

[The bank] is in a very strong, clean, liquid condition. It can pay off every depositor in full. Fear of its failure is not only without foundation, but positively foolish. There is not a safer bank in the State or the Nation.[2]

Lines of customers that had been as long as a city block began to dwindle, and within five or six days many customers returned to deposit their money. By month's end, total deposits were more than withdrawals, and Zions had survived the Great Depression.[3]
At the end of 1957, Zion's merged with Utah Savings and Trust Company and First National Bank of Salt Lake City.[3] The surviving institution was named Zions First National Bank.
1960-2007[edit]
In 1960, Keystone Insurance and Investment Company, which had been founded in 1955, bought a majority stake in Zions from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and changed its name to Zions Utah Bancorporation. It kept that name until 1987, when it became shortened to Zions Bancorporation, its present name, to reflect the growing presence of the company outside of Utah.[4]
Zions went public in January 1966.[3]
Throughout the long bear market of the 1970s, its stock performed well, rising from its low, early in that decade, to ten times in value by 1985, with a three-for-two split in 1981. By 1986 the company had a book value of over US$170 million, with steady annual earnings of over US$26 million.
It expanded into Nevada in 1985 with the purchase of Nevada State Bank.[2][5]
The company entered Arizona in 1986 with the acquisition of Mesa Bank.[2][6]
It expanded into Colorado and New Mexico in 1996 by acquiring Pitkin County Bank and Trust, Valley National Bank of Cortez, and Centennial Savings Bank.
Zions made many acquisitions in 1997 and 1998.[7]
In 1997, Zions acquired Vectra Banking Corporation and Tri-State Finance Corporation of Colorado.[8] Zions also acquired Tri-State Bank of Idaho.[9] It also bought 27 branches in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah from Wells Fargo.[10]
Zions expanded into California in 1997, Washington in 1998, Oregon and Texas in 2005.
In 1999, the company bid for First Security Corporation but it was acquired by Wells Fargo[11] after Zions was forced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to restate its results in prior years due to the way it accounted for acquisitions.[12] However, after the acquisition closed, Zions became the largest bank headquartered in Utah.
In 2001, the company was added to the S&P 500 stock market index.[13]
2008-present[edit]
In September 2008, one of Zions' subsidiaries, Nevada State Bank, acquired the insured deposits of failed Silver State Bank, which was closed by Nevada state officials. Silver State was the 11th bank to fail in 2008.
On August 31, 2010, Zions announced the sale of its NetDeposit subsidiary to BankServ.[14]
Zions received a $1.4 billion investment from the U.S. government as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The final $700 million was repaid on September 26, 2012 and the government realized a profit of $253 million from its investment in the company.[15][16]
On June 1, 2015, Zions Bancorporation announced a corporate restructuring in order to cut an estimated $120 Million in operational expenses. Under the restructure, all of the affiliates will cease to exist as separate entities; local banks will maintain the same branding, but will legally all be the same company.[17]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

SALT LAKE CITY, July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:    ZION) ("Zions" or "the Company") today reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2017 of $154 million, or $0.73 per diluted common share, compared with net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $129 million, or $0.61 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2017 and net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $91 million, or $0.44 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2016.








Harris H. Simmons, Chairman and CEO, commented, "We are encouraged with the solid results of the second quarter. Loan growth exceeded expectations and was diversified across commercial and consumer categories and also by geography. We experienced continued strong revenue growth, and expenses – both interest expense from deposits and operating expense – were well-controlled, resulting in a solid increase in pre-provision net revenue. Credit costs improved substantially over prior periods, and we expect such costs to remain low for the foreseeable future." Mr. Simmons concluded, "We are particularly enthusiastic about our ability to return substantial capital to shareholders over the next several quarters, which should contribute to further improvement in return on equity."
For the full version of the Company's 2017 second quarter earnings release, including financial tables, please visit zionsbancorporation.com.

Because product management teams include members from different backgrounds such as engineering, design, and data design, product managers must have strong communication skills and excel in cross-functional work environments. Expect to answer questions about your management abilities, prioritization skills, and experience working in product. Though not required, technical backgrounds are advantageous particularly when applying for roles at tech companies."4,168Product manager interview questions shared by candidatesTop Interview Questions Sort: RelevancePopular Date Product Manager at Google was asked... Feb 10, 2012 You notice that adwords revenue for a certain word has dropped in Italy for the last 30 days. How do you go about determining why that has happened?4 AnswersThis is a test to see how you think on your feet.Adword Revenue : No. of impressions * Click Thru Rate * Cost Per Click Anyone of the three parameters could decline to have an overall reduction in revenue. No. of Impressions could go down if a. The internet usage has fallen for some socio-culturaal reasons in Italy b. The usage of Google search has reduced because of may be some competitor applicaton launch or some major marketing promotion activities c. Some major technical issues has come up may be in the Google servers which is resulting in higher latency in Google Search applications resulting in reduced usage Click Thru Rate might have gone down 1 Major shift is usage clusters Keywords used have changed resulting in changed search behavior where in people are less prone to click thru. 2 Some technical issues like adds not displayed properly Same major flaw in random add picking might have got introduced 3. Some recent layout change has been there and peope are yet to get accustomed with the changed layout Reduced CPC: 1. People are spending less on Adwords and hence bidding less 2 Due to the keyword change, the new cluster CPC is much lesser.1. Determine the amount of decrease in month over month percentages, and make sure this isn't a trend. 2. Assuming we've seen similar decreases in conversions and clicks, 30 days is a month's time. Let's say this is in August, when the entire country uses the majority of their average of 42 vacation days per year. That's a factor. 3. Given you've said decreases in revenue and assuming all click and conversion data remained the same month over month, we may look for broken dynamic revenue variable conversion codes on the page source.

(For more information: onboarding@interviewjoy.com)Product Manager at Hewlett-Packard was asked... Oct 8, 2009 What me through the project lifecycle.1 AnswerI walked through business creating case, requirement formulation, design, development, testing, lauch.Senior Product Manager at Amazon was asked... Aug 2, 2010 The manager of component 'A' says his functionality is more important than that of component 'B.' The manager of component 'B' says his is more important than that of component 'A.' You can only implement one A or B, but not both - which do you choose to implement.11 AnswersI reference the Product Plan and select the component w/ the higher priority. The interview says "There is no Product Plan." I say "I select the one w/ the higher ROI." They say "there is no ROI." I say "then I choose the component whose manager has the best rationale."I would say to do my own researchI would say whichever is more valuable to customer & gives competitive advantage to Amazon.Show More ResponsesThe key question to ask is definition of "IMPORTANT". Is it important to the managers (ego equation), important to the end consumer or important for Amazon. The first one needs to be thrown out immediately and the others must be quantified based on achievability, impact on end user and ROI.Agreed. Need to drill into what "important" means. Great catch My guess is that Amazon was looking to quantify/define "important" from the customer perspective.I would recommend doing a data collection plan on the "functionality" - can you quantify the functionality and its execution be turned into hours saved, steps minimized, bottlenecks reduced, inefficiencies gained?I would recommend doing a data collection plan on the "functionality" - can you quantify the functionality and its execution be turned into hours saved, steps minimized, bottlenecks reduced, inefficiencies gained?In addition to the above suggestions, I would look at cost and time to market and then score both options. Then define value metrics. The cheapest and most valuable either as a technology sustainer or for customer wins. Given that it's Amazon, customer value will hold up the highest as one of their corporate culture virtues.How was "important" defined and what data backs up the claim? What is the impact of selecting component A v. B on budget, time to market, feature creep, deadlines, etc. Another key data point is what is the risk of selecting one over the other? Are both important enough to change the release plan, or can one be added later as a product improvement?I would collect data and take the decision. Type of data that you need collect depends on functionalities.This must be escalated to the program management team or a higher authority to make a decision. This decision should not be made at the level of a product management.Senior Product Manager, Social Media Advertising at Amazon was asked... Jun 26, 2012 Tell me how you would scale a social media software platform?3 AnswersI didn't have a good answer for this one.Its such a tricky question. I guess its by the analytic we use to know the page views and all..Try to define "scale", ask for clarifications. Are we trying to scale to more users or to more ad providers? Are there any current bottlenecks? What is the goal here? How about we improve the experience by providing more relevant ads? etc...Product Marketing Manager at KLA-Tencor was asked... May 18, 2009 How will you position the current legacy product considering that the next generation product is beginning to be offered.1 AnswerThe answer they were looking for was that the legacy product should be offerred tothe price sensitive customers, while migrating other customers to the more expensive, advanced newer product.Product Marketing Manager at Juniper Networks was asked... Nov 8, 2011 Can you tell me how you would manage a new product launch? 1 AnswerI would put together a launch plan with input from the necessary teams: Product Management, Engineering, Testing, Support. A part of the plan would include schedule, key stakeholders and responsible team members, and key deliverables and milestones with dates. I would arrange weekly meetings leading up to the launch date and manage the progress on each of the milestones and deliverables by coordinating with each of the team members.Product Marketing Manager at Aruba Networks was asked... Sep 12, 2013 Tell me the thought process and planning as well as the execution in the launching a product x or creating a positioning for a product/feature Y. 1 AnswerStart with the target customer, the use case, and the differentiation of this product.Product Marketing Manager at Hewlett-Packard was asked... Apr 27, 2011 "if Germans were the tallest people in the world how would you prove it"50 AnswersI first asked how would we define germans. People who were born in germany. People who lived in Germany. From East or West. The food they ate (had to do likely w/ $) and stuff like that.Man...poorly constructed question! We only have to prove 'it' if Germans ARE the tallest people in the world. Therefore, if we are forced to prove it, it must be the case that Germans are actually the tallest people! We could also randomly sample heights from people considered German and compare it to a random sampling of heights from people in non-German groups we are interested in. Assuming we have resources to get large enough samples and can account for a variety of biases, some ANOVA and other stats stuff can get us the answer.Ask yourself, who you are supposed to prove it to? The question was for a Product Marketing Manager interview; could it perhaps be that what they want is to see how you take something you *know* to be true (you have to believe that the products you are trying to sell are great products to be a really great salesperson), and convince everyone else of that fact?Show More ResponsesThere's a lot of poorly defined stuff in here: Define Germans. (Include Polish or French post WWII rapes?) Define 'prove'. (Leave no doubt, or is a statistical rejection of the null hypothesis acceptable, and if so, by what percentage?) Define 'tallest'. (Include children under the age of 2?)I would check out the Guinness Book of World Records and find out the nationality of the tallest person in the world.I'd probably say to the interviewer 'As long as no one can disprove that Germans are the tallest people, then you really don't have to prove anything.'"Germans were the tallest people in the world" is a statement that is considered to be a statement that is made on basis of some Statical analysis data point then that's the proof. In given statement, Conclusion is made prior to the proof.It would be an appropriate question if there was no 'if' in a question,Take height measurements of a statistically significant sample of Germans as well as all other groups to be considered. If the average height of the German sample is the highest, you've proven what was to be proven.I can think of two different ways to get a quick insight into this: 1. Survey McDonalds. Get them to count the heights of the first 50 people in the door on a given day, then compare that information. I haven't done the confidence math on this. 2. Call the Levi Strauss company and ask them what distribution of pants they sell around the world. Bluejeans are sold just about everywhere, so except for the possibility that leg length isn't an exact indicator of overall height (I, for example, have short legs for my height) they should be able to tell you how tall people are in any given country based on the pants they sell there.You can prove that there is a statistically significant difference between 2 classes using a 2-tailed students T test. It just requires the average and standard deviation of each class. Instead of just giving up and saying we can't define who is German. Pick a definition of what a "German" is , take their average height and standard deviation, and compare it to the average and standard deviation of the rest of the world using the 2-tailed students T test (or other similar statistical tests). Collecting height data may not be realistic for 1 person but if the interviewer asked you the question with no other stipulations, then you can fill in the rest. Pretend you have unlimited resources. Just assume the data you need is known or can be looked up. I think the interviewer wants to hear you think through a problem that displays you're creativity and resourcefulness. Just saying it's not possible won't get you the job."I'm sorry - I feel uncomfortable with Holocaust jokes..."Other than measuring the height directly, another possible solution is to use the "side effects" of taller people, e.g. higher ceilings, larger shoes or clothing, or maybe it's all in the DNA? Anyway, just call up an international retailer and ask if they make things bigger for Germans.Show More ResponsesI would answer with the following procedure: 1- Get the height of the shortest "German" 2- Get the height of the tallest "non-German" if the shortest german is taller than the tallest non-german, then this argument is true. otherwise, it's false.DMV records (or likewise entities) are available all over the world.@Research Engineer wrote "Pick a definition of what a "German"" Well, if we are going to pick our own definition, mine would be: 1) Everyone who is over 6'6" is German; 2) Everyone under 6'6" is not German. QED.I would look to the medical community, CDC or AMA, possibly the UN.The proposed answers seem rather convoluted. You would have to prove it by statistics. The statistics indicate that the Dutch are the tallest people with an average height of 6 feet for men. Most of western (and eastern) Europe have surpassed the United States in height due to the US fast food compulsion and inequitable health care.If we already know that Germans are the tallest people in the world, then we don't have to prove it.This is a problem solving question - straight up, pure and simple. You take the question as a hypothesis and explain how you would go about proving the veracity of the statement. If stats exist on the internet that's probably the fastest way to answer the question. If there was time an money you could pay for secondary research (if it exists) or primary research. The interviewer only wants to see how logical you are - not to actually solve the problem or question the thesis statement.I have to agree: Driver Licenses are a good source for height information. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15464003Gather as large of a sample of German and non-German heights. Employ a t-test/z-test to accept or reject the hypothesis at a given confidence interval.Pull out my phone and access www.guinnessworldrecords.com This one was easy. HP needs to come up with more challenging questions if they are to prosper in 2012. HP's HR interviewer is now answering similar questions since being fired for lack of defining what he meant by a German. tsk tskShow More ResponsesTheir cars would be the biggest if they were indeed the tallest.Sorry, assumptions cannot be proved, BUT let me try to convince you. This will strike some conversation, just enough time for you to think on how to convince. I am sure, all this Questions do not have a perfect answer. They want to check your thought process, patience.The average length of mattress in Germany is higher than the other countries, then Germans are the tallest.Before I do that, how will the answer best help us solve our business challenges?Germany has the largest number of stores that sell shoes in larger sizes(11 inch and above). And foot size is directly proportional to the height of person......hence germans are proved to be the tallest.If Germans "were" the tallest people in the world, I would have to prove it by determining what group "is" the tallest people in the world.No need - the Dutch are the tallest, apparently.If you work with the definition that the country with the tallest median person are the tallest nation, you can get to a solution algorithmically (assumptions: no multiple citizenships allowed, median on an even number of persons is the one at positon n/2+0.5 for simplicity. We have lots of time to do this, so we don't care about getting to a result quick) (1) get everybody in a room. (2) ask people to stand together by nations and form a line each (3) repeat for each line until nobody swaps (3-1) ask each person to swap with their right neighbour if that neighbour is shorter (4) for each line (should be sorted by height now) (4-1) ask the smallest and the largest person of each nation to leave (4-2) repeat until only one or two people are left. (5) for each of the pairs left send the shorter one home (6) repeat until only one person is left (6-1) ask the remaining persons to form random pairs. Don't worry if one person is left standing alone. (6-2) send all the shorter persons in each pair home. (6-3) If the remainin person is German - you have proved it.I would respond by saying that this is a profiling question and would prefer not to answer.DMV records don't include heights in many countries of the world (including Germany). Which kind of puts the kibosh on this approach.... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_driving_licenceShow More ResponsesI think average height for adults is available from census or other survays per country. Now if you consider a person living in Germany German (citizenship/residence vs nationality), the highest number of your list should be Germany, there's the proofIn the hypothetical world of the question, it is a fact that the Germans are the tallest. A fact is a statement that can be proven. So the fact was already proven at some point (in the make believe world). Answer is a question: How did the person who proved it before do it?In Science, there is no absolute "truth." A hypothesis is not "proven" per se. You can support your hypothesis with positive data but you can never really prove it scientifically. Conclusion: your theory that "Germans are the tallest people" can either be supported or negated but not proven.Use arrest, warrant or inmate records. They do have height information because that is an identifying characteristic, just like Scars, Marks or Tattoos.Just check the most selled pant size.By taking the average height into consideration of every country ..it would be proved that germans were tallest in the world....Analogy: If A=B, how would you prove it? Answer: I don't need to. Because you already said that A=B.Measure the height of the shortest doorway in a railway station or a common everyday place and compare to other nations.Germany is known for the automobile manufacturing giants like BMW etc. Just measure the the distance from the seat beneath to the rooftop above. If it is greater than any other car manufactured, then certainly an average German's height would account as the tallest.since in the qn. they have used "if", i wud answer that, "how can i prove you right or wrong, if you itself not sure about the fact"Show More ResponsesTape measureDMV reportI would show the average height of Germans compared to the average height of the rest of the worldLook upI would Google it.First you have to define your population, then you have to establish a plan for your research. What method are you going to use to gather data, and also define your sampling plan- the bigger the sample group the more reliable. In market research there are several methods to analyze your data establishing your sampling procedure. We can use deductive or inductive research.Classic puzzle question with aim to understand a persons thinking process and structure. The interviewer's original question drill-down approach or any of the statistical approaches are the only correct ways to answer such a problem solving question. The others -- like pant sizes, shoe sizes -- are interesting leading questions to lead to the solution. You never simply answer such a case question without drilling down on the use cases first. Apparently the other responders either failed math / proofs, are not anywhere near the product spectrum, or are random trolls jumping on a "hot" question. Sadly they downvoted the best answer and the only one that probably would have passed the interview.Associate Product Manager at Google was asked... Mar 18, 2009 What is the marginal cost of a gigabyte in gmail?12 AnswersI had no idea what marginal cost is but after a lot of hints, I finally came up with 1$ / a gigabyte though that's probably on the low end. The right answer is probably a bit higher, say 2-3 $ / a gigabyte (from the costs of servers, disk space, maintenance, set up of servers, maintaining webpage, designing user interface and then offset by the advertisements and click-throughs)probably even less than that now. http://thenextweb.com/2009/11/11/data-quarter-price-googles-plan-chrome-os-storage/Isn't marginal cost the cost to produce an additional unit? So costs like designing the user interface, maintaining the webpage (which would have to be done no matter the gigabyte capacity) shouldn't be accounted for.Show More ResponsesAh, you clearly would have made a better candidate than I have. Like I said, I didn't know what marginal cost was so I just came up with a ballpark figure.Here's my guess at what they're looking for. Marginal cost - this is the additional cost for adding a user. It doesn't need to take in to account the software development effort, but it should take out the atomized cost for everything else. You need to price out the the cost of the enterprise HD/GB. We can call it $1 by GB. Then you need to realize that there needs to be redundancy, so at the lest we need to double that number, if they put a super high value on data retention triple it. Then you need to think about server cost and divide that out, server rack space cost and physical rack area...etc. So if it's $1 for the actual HD space it's probably more like $2.50-$3.50 for the total marginal cost. I don't work for google, but my guess is that they're looking at the though process. What will change with a marginal user increase and what will not. If you only think of the cost of the HD then you're not getting a job with google.The simplest answer is to look up the Amazon S3 costs (currently platoing at 5.5c/GB) and assume that the economics are fairly similar.To correct my own post - these are per/month prices. So the eternal retention prices would be ~50 times higher, which gives us the same figure as Jon's.Considering the money they make per account signed up with gmail, I'd say they definitely make money per gigabyte spent for gmail, but I'm not sure how much.I never worry about the capacity of my gmail account, it seems to me the cost of an extra gig of gmail storage is zero. As it is the mission of Google to make sure every users always have enough storage capacity and Google is doing a great job in this area, so the maginal cost of a gigabyte in gmail should be zero.If it was a cost, Google would not exist. When analyzing costs, and especially marginal cost, one must consider all aspects. Once one considers the return too, the cost goes into a negativeThe marginal cost of adding a gigabyte is either zero or thousands of dollars.. Either the gigabyte is already physically in existence or you would have to build a new server. The marginal cost is not averaged across all gigabytes. There might be a minor increase in energy consumption due to this extra gigabyte, but who will notice that? If your goal is to stand out in an interview, I would suggest going the Thousands of Dollars answer. For those non computer guys out there, let's relate this question to something physical.. What is the marginal cost of adding one more person to an airline flight.. Their are two situations, the plane in not already full so we can essentially neglect the cost of the additional passenger since it is so low.. (The extra energy to move the 200 pounds, when the plane is already moving hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the 25 cents for a soda..) But if the plane is already full, then the marginal cost of one extra passenger is the cost to fly a second plane.. Thousands of dollars...Marginal cost is the cost of adding one additional unit, so fixed costs of Gmail are already taken care of. So the cost is the cost of the hard drive + any labor to install and configure that hard drive for gmail. Take a sum of the costs and then divide it by the size of the hard drive (GB) and you should have your rate. I think it will be well below a dollar. In my quick math I had it at 20 cents but that assumes consumer pricing.Product Manager at Google was asked... Jan 26, 2011 you are on a biz trip and travelling from one city to another. you have a stack of unsorted flight boarding passes. only departure city and destination city are on the boarding pass. how do you find the first departure city and your final destination city13 Answersusing two arrays and searchcant u identify it with the departure city which in this case will match with one of the cities u are currently in?Your current location is your departure city. Your final destination is the city whose name occurs only once among all the city names minus your departure city.Show More ResponsesWhy wouldn't you just look at all of the cities listed on the documents and the two which don't ever repeat are your departure and destination city. (For the two that don't repeat, one will only be listed as a departure and the other one will be the one that is only listed as a destination.)I doubt you can assume your current location is your departure. The point of this type of problem is to show multiple solutions and also analyze the time complexity. One natural solution is to take one boarding pass, find the boarding pass with the next one after it, and so on. You would end up with a sorted stack of boarding passes. The method I described (take one, search the rest for the following city, repeat) would take order n squared time - n for the first pass, n-1 for the second pass, and so on. You could exit early, but the worst case time complexity is the sum from 1 to n, which is order n squared. The better solution, as GK wrote, is to take a boarding pass and write down the names of the two cities, and a notation indicating departure or arrival. On the next boarding pass, do the same; if a city is repeated, cross it off the list. At the end you will have two cities. This is order n, with order n storage space.Assume this is a acyclic graph (a city is not visited again once you leave it). Now, arrange the boarding passes and note the number of times a city appears in departure as well as arrival. For all intermediate cities this number will be the same. For the initial city the arrival-departure = -1 and for the destination arrival-departure = +1. Now, you start traversing from there. Form a table where you take each node and note the next node. For cyclic graphs it is more complex. You will still find the initial and destination city the same way but the traversal will be hard.1. Iterate over set of boarding passes, and maintain a map of city --> occurrence count for source/destination city At end of iterating over passes, you have a map of city --> occurrence count 2. For the keyset of cities, get count for each city. If source count or destination count == 1, city is in the source/destination tuple.1) Number each boarding pass from 1 to n ... takes O(n) 2) Create one hash table where you index by departure and iterate over boarding passes and enter indices corresponding to departure city ... takes O(n) 3) Now, start at 1 and follow the hash table adding following passes. When you reach the end, see if there are any boarding passes left. If not, you are done. If there are, then start at the first one and keep going until you pre-pend it to the previous sequence ... O(n) Hence, total time is O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n)The question asks for the first departure city and final destination city. Sort the passes in ascending order of departure time using a fixed timezone - let's say EST (I have observed that boarding passes rarely, if at all, specify the local timezone, but this can be deduced from the departure city.) Doesn't matter how many times you repeat the same (departure/destination) city, the earliest departure time in the stack is your departure, the last arrival time in the stack is your destination.No matter how busy you are, I guess you would always *know* the departure city and the destination cities. So what you are really looking for is to sort the boarding passes so that you can keep away the used ones and have a neat stack of upcoming ones. You could do an insertion sort by sorting the boarding passes according to date/time of departure. You would need to take care of the time zones since the boarding passes usually only mention the local times.Are you guys kidding? You look at the date and time. LoL.If you assume some efficiency in the routes -- as in, there isn't backtracking -- you can analyze distances and positions of/ between the cities to map the full route. That will give you the endpoints.for(Map.Entry entry : map.entrySet()){ if(!map.containsValue(entry.getKey())) { System.out.println("Source:"+entry.getKey()); } if(!map.containsKey(entry.getValue())) { System.out.println("Dest:"+entry.getValue()); } }Inter­views > Product Manager1–10 of 4,168 Interview QuestionsPrevious12345NextSee Interview Questions for Similar JobsSenior Product ManagerProject ManagerSoftware EngineerDirectorProgram ManagerAssociate Product ManagerManagerBusiness AnalystSenior Software EngineerAnalystAccount ManagerSenior ManagerConsultantAssociateVice PresidentProduct Marketing ManagerMarketing ManagerAccount ExecutiveInternSenior ConsultantMoreLessInterested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.
