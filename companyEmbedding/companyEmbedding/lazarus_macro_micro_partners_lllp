Explanatory Note


Lazarus Investment Partners LLLP, Lazarus Management Company LLC, and Justin B. Borus (collectively "Reporting Persons") are filing this Amendment to reflect a material change in the information contained in its previously filed 13D.


Item 1.  Security and Issuer.


(a)  This statement on Schedule 13D relates to the Common Stock of Barfresh Food Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer").


(b)  The principal executive offices of the Issuer are located at 90 Madison Street, Suite 701, Denver, CO  80206.


Item 2.  Identity and Background.


(a)-(c) and (f)  This statement is being filed by Lazarus Investment Partners LLLP, a Delaware limited liability limited partnership ("Lazarus Partners").


Lazarus Management Company LLC, a Colorado limited liability company ("Lazarus Management"), is the investment adviser and general partner of Lazarus Partners and Lazarus Macro Micro Partners LLLP ("Macro Micro Partners"), and consequently may be deemed to have voting control and investment discretion over securities owned by Lazarus Partners and Macro Micro Partners. Justin B. Borus ("Mr. Borus") is the managing member of Lazarus Management. As a result, Mr. Borus may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of any shares deemed to be beneficially owned by Lazarus Management.  Macro Micro Partners' holdings in the Issuer consists of 3,000 shares of Common Stock, and it is not a Reporting Person.  Its shares are included in Lazarus Management's and Mr. Borus' holdings for the reasons set forth above.  The foregoing should not be construed in and of itself as an admission by Lazarus Management or Mr. Borus as to beneficial ownership of the shares owned by Lazarus Partners and Macro Micro Partners.  Each of Lazarus Management and Mr. Borus disclaims beneficial ownership of the securities set forth in this Schedule 13D, except to the extent of its or his pecuniary interests therein.


The business address for the Reporting Persons is c/o Lazarus Management Company LLC, 3200 Cherry Creek South Drive, Suite 670, Denver, Colorado 80209. Mr. Borus is a United States citizen. 


The principal business of Lazarus Partners is investing in securities.  The principal business of Lazarus Management is providing investment advice.  The principal business of Mr. Borus is investment management.


(d)  During the last five years, none of the Reporting Persons have been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors).


(e)  During the last five years, none of the Reporting Persons have been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding were or are subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, Federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws, except that Lazarus Management is subject to an order in an SEC administrative proceeding, File No. 3-16068 based on its inadvertent late filing of reports required under Sections 13(d) and 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Without admitting or denying any violation, Lazarus Management submitted an offer to the SEC to settle the matter by agreeing to cease and desist from committing more filing violations and by paying a $60,000 penalty, with the offer of settlement being accepted in the SEC's order.





Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.


The Reporting Persons hold shares of the Issuer's common stock and warrants to purchase common stock that were acquired for cash with Lazarus Partners' own funds (or Macro Micro Partners' funds for the 3,000 shares it acquired).


Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction.


(a)-(i)            The securities of the Issuer were purchased for investment in the ordinary course of Reporting Persons' business and not with the purpose nor with the effect of changing or influencing control of the Issuer nor in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect.


Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer.


(a)  Reference is made to items 7, 9, 11 and 13 of pages 2-4 of this Schedule, which items are incorporated by reference.  The securities reported on this Schedule consist of 8,055,962 shares of Common Stock and Warrants to purchase an additional 10,033,333 shares of Common Stock held by Lazarus Partners and an additional 3,000 shares of Common Stock held by Macro Micro Partners (and reported only by Lazarus Management and Mr. Borus).  The calculation of percentage of beneficial ownership in Item 13 of page 2 – 4 was calculated using information obtained from the Issuer's 10Q filed with the SEC on August 13, 2014 in which it stated  that the number of shares of its common stock outstanding as of August 11, 2014 was 66,112,728.


(b)  The Reporting Persons have the sole power to vote or to direct the voting of all such shares described in Item 5(a) above.  The Reporting Persons have the sole power to dispose or direct the disposition of all such shares described in Item 5(a) above.  The Reporting Persons do not have shared power to vote or to direct the vote of any such shares described in Item 5(a) above, and do not have shared power to dispose or direct the disposition of any such shares described in Item 5(a) above.


(c)  On March 19, 2014, Lazarus Partners purchased from the Issuer 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock and a 3 year warrant to purchase 500,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $.60 a share for a total purchase price of $500,000.  On December 20, 2013, Lazarus Partners purchased a promissory note in the principal amount of $500,000 and a 5 year warrant to purchase 833,333 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.45 a share (which may be exercised on a cashless basis) for a purchase price of $500,000. On July 26, 2013, Lazarus Partners purchased 5,600,000 Units from the Issuer for a purchase price of $.25 a unit for a total purchase price of $1,400,000.  Each Unit consisted of 1 share of Common Stock, a 3 year warrant to purchase 1 share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $.25 per share (which may be exercised on a cashless basis) and a 5 year warrant to purchase one-half (½) share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $.50 per share.  3,000 shares of Common Stock (that were a part of the 5,600,000 Units) were purchased by Macro Micro Partners.  On August 5, 2013, Lazarus Partners purchased 200,000 Units for a purchase price of $.25 per Unit or a total purchase price of $50,000.  Each of the foregoing transactions was a purchase directly from the Issuer in a private negotiated transaction.  In addition, Lazarus Partners made the following open market purchases within the past 60 days:

Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer.


Item 5 of the Schedule 13D is hereby supplemented by adding the following:
