We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

                            Micron21                        






We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

Customers trust C4L to protect them from the crippling effects of a vast array of escalating multi-vector DDoS attacks on a daily basis. Thunder TPS 3.2 greatly expands our effectiveness through the surgical nature of the countermeasures, the comprehensive baselining, anomaly detection capabilities, and detailed monitoring.

We selected A10 Networks as it delivers the most capable solution. We look forward to a successful partnership with A10 to deliver powerful, carrier class IPv4/IPv6 solutions to help our global customers preserve investments while providing a clear path to IPv6, efficiently and affordably.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

Customers trust C4L to protect them from the crippling effects of a vast array of escalating multi-vector DDoS attacks on a daily basis.

We selected A10 Networks as it delivers the most capable solution. We look forward to a successful partnership with A10 to deliver powerful, carrier class IPv4/IPv6 solutions to help our global customers preserve investments while providing a clear path to IPv6, efficiently and affordably.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

                            Micron21                        






We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

                            University of Kansas Hospital                        






We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

                    CHOOSE A10                










































We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

                            Micron21                        






We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

Customers trust C4L to protect them from the crippling effects of a vast array of escalating multi-vector DDoS attacks on a daily basis.

We selected A10 Networks as it delivers the most capable solution. We look forward to a successful partnership with A10 to deliver powerful, carrier class IPv4/IPv6 solutions to help our global customers preserve investments while providing a clear path to IPv6, efficiently and affordably.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

                            Micron21                        






We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

                            University of Kansas Hospital                        






We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

                            Micron21                        






We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

Customers trust C4L to protect them from the crippling effects of a vast array of escalating multi-vector DDoS attacks on a daily basis. Thunder TPS 3.2 greatly expands our effectiveness through the surgical nature of the countermeasures, the comprehensive baselining, anomaly detection capabilities, and detailed monitoring.

We selected A10 Networks as it delivers the most capable solution. We look forward to a successful partnership with A10 to deliver powerful, carrier class IPv4/IPv6 solutions to help our global customers preserve investments while providing a clear path to IPv6, efficiently and affordably.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

                            Micron21                        






We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering                        

                            University of Kansas Hospital                        






We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We selected A10 Networks as it delivers the most capable solution. We look forward to a successful partnership with A10 to deliver powerful, carrier class IPv4/IPv6 solutions to help our global customers preserve investments while providing a clear path to IPv6, efficiently and affordably.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

                            Hawkins                        






We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.







James Braunegg


                            Managing Director

We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.







Presley Acuna


                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering                        

                            Tremor Video                        






The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering                        

                            University of Kansas Hospital                        






We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

                            Micron21                        






We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

Customers trust C4L to protect them from the crippling effects of a vast array of escalating multi-vector DDoS attacks on a daily basis. Thunder TPS 3.2 greatly expands our effectiveness through the surgical nature of the countermeasures, the comprehensive baselining, anomaly detection capabilities, and detailed monitoring.

We selected A10 Networks as it delivers the most capable solution. We look forward to a successful partnership with A10 to deliver powerful, carrier class IPv4/IPv6 solutions to help our global customers preserve investments while providing a clear path to IPv6, efficiently and affordably.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

                            University of Kansas Hospital                        






We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We selected A10 Networks as it delivers the most capable solution. We look forward to a successful partnership with A10 to deliver powerful, carrier class IPv4/IPv6 solutions to help our global customers preserve investments while providing a clear path to IPv6, efficiently and affordably.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

                            Hawkins                        






We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.







James Braunegg


                            Managing Director

We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.







Presley Acuna


                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering                        

                            Tremor Video                        






The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering                        

                            University of Kansas Hospital                        






We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

                            Micron21                        






We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

Customers trust C4L to protect them from the crippling effects of a vast array of escalating multi-vector DDoS attacks on a daily basis. Thunder TPS 3.2 greatly expands our effectiveness through the surgical nature of the countermeasures, the comprehensive baselining, anomaly detection capabilities, and detailed monitoring.

We selected A10 Networks as it delivers the most capable solution. We look forward to a successful partnership with A10 to deliver powerful, carrier class IPv4/IPv6 solutions to help our global customers preserve investments while providing a clear path to IPv6, efficiently and affordably.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

                            University of Kansas Hospital                        






We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We selected A10 Networks as it delivers the most capable solution. We look forward to a successful partnership with A10 to deliver powerful, carrier class IPv4/IPv6 solutions to help our global customers preserve investments while providing a clear path to IPv6, efficiently and affordably.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

                            Hawkins                        






We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.







James Braunegg


                            Managing Director

We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.







Presley Acuna


                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering                        

                            Tremor Video                        






The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering                        

                            University of Kansas Hospital                        






We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

                            Micron21                        






We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

Customers trust C4L to protect them from the crippling effects of a vast array of escalating multi-vector DDoS attacks on a daily basis. Thunder TPS 3.2 greatly expands our effectiveness through the surgical nature of the countermeasures, the comprehensive baselining, anomaly detection capabilities, and detailed monitoring.

We selected A10 Networks as it delivers the most capable solution. We look forward to a successful partnership with A10 to deliver powerful, carrier class IPv4/IPv6 solutions to help our global customers preserve investments while providing a clear path to IPv6, efficiently and affordably.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

                            GoDaddy                        






We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

                            Hawkins                        






We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

                            Micron21                        






We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.







Presley Acuna


                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

                            Senior Director of Systems Engineering                        

                            University of Kansas Hospital                        






We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

We have peace of mind with A10's proven IPv6 and virtualization solutions.

Implementation Packages
Our implementation packages are based on the deliverables and activities essential to getting A10 products into production. There are several levels of engagement, depending on your needs and budget. Notes: Travel and expenses are charged as incurred. All hours must be used within quarter of package kick-off. Package must be completed within one year of purchase. All hours must be used continuously, with no breaks in activity after starting.
Single Install
If your team is prepared to deploy your A10 solutions but wants access to A10 support, this option is perfect. Working remotely, our consultant is available from the kickoff of the project through to the production installation. (Note: A single install can be over several units but it can only be one configuration. If a company has two configurations to be deployed over six units, they should purchase two single installs.)
Quick Start
This is a cost-effective option for supporting your team as it deploys your A10 network. An A10 consultant sets up the network configuration and guides the deployment through to installation. This package includes limited UAT support and knowledge transfer.

Framework
With an option for onsite or remote assistance, this package provides you with a dedicated A10 consultant who will work with your team throughout your deployment. An A10 consultant will develop a high-level design, which will act as a guide for the configuration, the development and execution of a test plan, installation, UAT and deployment of your A10 products. This package also includes a knowledge transfer and training.
Design
This package is delivered onsite by a qualified A10 consultant and includes all the tasks required to configure, test and deploy your solution. Our consultants use industry best practices and provide everything from design planning to the diagramming of your new network. This package also provides onsite training of your team, with a knowledge transfer for topics specific to your deployment.

Health Check And Enablement Package And Resident Engineer Services
Our Heath Check service offers review of deployed configuration and analysis to improve monitoring. The Enablement Package provides a number of hours that can be used when a project or need arises. Both packages are available both Offsite and Onsite.
Customer Success Services
Once you’ve fully installed your A10 products, you may want additional professional services to ensure optimal network performance via the following services.
Health Check
This package ensures the correct deployment and optimizations of your A10 network. An A10 consultant works with you and your team either onsite or remotely to determine the right approach for maximizing your investment.
Enablement
To allow for the greatest flexibility, this package provides access to the expertise of an A10 consultant as required, such as when you need troubleshooting, optimization, migrations, and strategic planning either onsite or remotely. (Note: This is the only package that does not need to be consumed continuously, i.e. you can use it as you go. It is a “bucket” of hours.)

A10 Networks Introduces Third-Generation SSL/TLS Hardware Solutions
Jun 5 17
A10 Networks introduced third-generation SSL/TLS hardware solutions to help organizations overcome the challenges of providing advanced SSL decryption and encryption for both application acceleration and security visibility. The rapid adoption of highly secure and compute-intensive standards, such as Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) and App Transport Security (ATS), require organizations to meet this demand or risk losing increasingly security-conscious customers. The third-generation SSL processors are available in select A10 Thunder hardware appliances. Existing customers can upgrade select Thunder appliances.

This Zacks Ranked #5 (Strong Sell) company provides software based application networking solutions. Its solutions enable enterprises, service providers, Web giants, and government organizations to enhance, secure, and optimize the performance of their data center applications and networks. The company delivers its solutions on optimized hardware appliances and as virtual appliances across its Thunder Series and AX Series product families. A10 Networks, Inc. (ATEN  -  Free Report)	 is headquartered in San Jose, California.Recent NewsOn July 13th management preannounced their Q217 results; both earnings and revenues are now expected to come in significantly below the Zacks consensus estimates.  Revenues are now expected to be in a range of $52.5-53.5 million, about $10 below the Zacks expectation.  Earnings EPS will now be in a range between -$0.06 and -$0.05, well below the expected $0.02 level.  Management blamed delayed deals in North American, and in Japan.  Most believe that many large service provider deals were the main cause of the negative revision of both earnings and revenues.  It is estimated that about 40% of the company’s revenues are derived from the service provider segment.  Further, these segment deals typically suffer from unpredictable timing, and tend to be lumpy throughout the year.  Management’s CommentsAccording to Lee Chen, President and CEO, “We are disappointed with our preliminary results. Revenue came in below our guidance as a number of opportunities in our pipeline did not close primarily in North America and to a lesser degree in Japan. Key deals remain in our pipeline and we are diligently working to improve our execution. We remain confident that our investments in security and cloud will serve as a strong foundation to penetrate these faster-growing segments of our market.”Price and Earnings Consensus GraphAs you can see in the graph below, the negative preannouncement caused the stock price and future earnings estimates to decline.A10 Networks, Inc. Price and Consensus A10 Networks, Inc. Price and Consensus | A10 Networks, Inc. QuoteDeclining Earnings EstimatesAfter the preannouncement analysts decreased their earnings expectations over the past 7 days for Q2 17, Q3 17, FY 17, and FY 18; Q2 17 dropped from -$0.02 to -$0.08, Q3 17 fell from -$0.01 to -$0.05, FY 17 plummeted from -$0.07 to -$0.20, and FY 18 declined from $0.04 to -$0.07.Bottom LineOn June 10th the company announced that Tom Consantino would be their new Chief Financial Officer.  Mr. Consantino previously held the position of VP/head of accounting and finance at Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report)	.  This addition plus their focus on the cloud and security will help the company navigate these current rough waters.  The company officially reports earnings after the market closes on July 27, where more details about the current situation will be released.  Therefore it would be wise to wait on the sidelines till these service provider issues are resolved.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech TrendZacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

A10 Networks is a U.S. public company specializing in the manufacturing of application delivery controllers (software and hardware). Founded in 2004 by Lee Chen,[1] co-founder of Foundry Networks, A10 originally serviced just the identity management market with its line of ID Series products.[2] In early 2007 they added bandwidth management appliances (EX Series). The company had its initial public offering on March 21, 2014, raising $187.5 million.[3]
History[edit]
In mid-2007, A10 Networks launched AX Series, a family of application delivery controllers/load balancing appliances, which won Best of Show at Interop 2007 in the Network Infrastructure (middle range) category.[4] In 2008 the AX Series won Grand Prix/Best of Interop Tokyo for best Carrier/Internet Service Provider (ISP) solution.[5] In 2009, the AX Series won two Grand Prix/Best of Interop Tokyo awards in the Network Infrastructure and ShowNet Product categories.[6] And in 2010, the 64-bit AX Series family of application delivery controllers won Best of Microsoft TechEd for Networking.[7] In 2011, A10 Networks received an Inc. 500 award as a fast growth private company in North America for the second consecutive year, including #1 Computer Hardware vendor,[8] Top 10 Internet company[9] and an entrepreneur award for CEO Lee Chen.[10]
In August 2012, a jury in California found A10 Networks responsible for intellectual property infringement and unfair competition, awarding Brocade Communications Systems a $112 million verdict.[11] On May 21, 2013, A10 and Brocade reached a settlement of their legal disputes.[12]
In May 2013 A10 launched its A10 Thunder Series platforms, which are hardware and software Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs).[13] A10 Thunder Series won awards at the TechEd 2013 show in New Orleans, Louisiana for the Hardware category as well as the Attendees' Pick award.[14]

We considered adding application acceleration features to our F5 BIG-IP server load balancers, but the licensing fees were very high. After evaluating the A10 ADC, we learned that we could provide faster acceleration, at half the price. With A10 all features are included, so we no longer have to dip into our budget in the future for more features or performance. In addition, we now have the latest state-of-the art architecture – and our entire school is benefiting from faster, more responsive applications.

We always look to partner with best-of-breed infrastructure and service providers. It gives us the confidence needed to run our service at the levels our customers expect from Box. A10 Networks falls into this top category and we're pleased to standardize on A10 for our application load-balancing needs.

A large number of virtual ADCs can be provided through a single A10 Thunder ADC chassis, and there are cases where cost performance per virtual ADC instance is more than ten times better than other products in the same price range.

Small business customer success online is largely influenced by the technology and support employed. Using A10, we are able to provide the same, top-level service our nearly 11 million customers have come to expect while improving reliability and keeping costs down.

We chose A10 ADC as our server load balancer platform because of their impressive interface and competitive price, plus the first class customer service and response from the A10 team. A10 ADC balances the user connections over our JD Edwards Enterprise Resource Planning software and Windows 2003 Terminal Servers. There is a far more even distribution of load after implementing A10.

We have total confidence in moving forward and implementing the A10 Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) as best-of-breed. These guys are serious, and their support is just as serious as their hardware. A10 Networks’ equipment is the only choice in an extremely high-density environment, which fits our business model perfectly.

We chose A10 Networks for our application delivery needs because its application feature set is of exceptional value. The pricing model of an all-inclusive feature set alleviates management headaches and also provides massive cost savings for required advanced features.

The cost for 80 Gb of throughput was less than that of 24 Gb from another vendor, and we got 4 boxes instead of two, allowing us to provide a multi-site clustered solution that we frankly could not afford from the competing vendors. A10's port density alone allows us to remove DMZ switches, as we can provide load-balanced DMZ connectivity with some of the 1 Gb Ports on the A10 ADCs at each production site. This saves us an additional four switches.

A10 Networks is a U.S. public company specializing in the manufacturing of application delivery controllers (software and hardware). Founded in 2004 by Lee Chen,[1] co-founder of Foundry Networks, A10 originally serviced just the identity management market with its line of ID Series products.[2] In early 2007 they added bandwidth management appliances (EX Series). The company had its initial public offering on March 21, 2014, raising $187.5 million.[3]
History[edit]
In mid-2007, A10 Networks launched AX Series, a family of application delivery controllers/load balancing appliances, which won Best of Show at Interop 2007 in the Network Infrastructure (middle range) category.[4] In 2008 the AX Series won Grand Prix/Best of Interop Tokyo for best Carrier/Internet Service Provider (ISP) solution.[5] In 2009, the AX Series won two Grand Prix/Best of Interop Tokyo awards in the Network Infrastructure and ShowNet Product categories.[6] And in 2010, the 64-bit AX Series family of application delivery controllers won Best of Microsoft TechEd for Networking.[7] In 2011, A10 Networks received an Inc. 500 award as a fast growth private company in North America for the second consecutive year, including #1 Computer Hardware vendor,[8] Top 10 Internet company[9] and an entrepreneur award for CEO Lee Chen.[10]
In August 2012, a jury in California found A10 Networks responsible for intellectual property infringement and unfair competition, awarding Brocade Communications Systems a $112 million verdict.[11] On May 21, 2013, A10 and Brocade reached a settlement of their legal disputes.[12]
In May 2013 A10 launched its A10 Thunder Series platforms, which are hardware and software Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs).[13] A10 Thunder Series won awards at the TechEd 2013 show in New Orleans, Louisiana for the Hardware category as well as the Attendees' Pick award.[14]

A10 Networks is a U.S. public company specializing in the manufacturing of application delivery controllers (software and hardware). Founded in 2004 by Lee Chen,[1] co-founder of Foundry Networks, A10 originally serviced just the identity management market with its line of ID Series products.[2] In early 2007 they added bandwidth management appliances (EX Series). The company had its initial public offering on March 21, 2014, raising $187.5 million.[3]
History[edit]
In mid-2007, A10 Networks launched AX Series, a family of application delivery controllers/load balancing appliances, which won Best of Show at Interop 2007 in the Network Infrastructure (middle range) category.[4] In 2008 the AX Series won Grand Prix/Best of Interop Tokyo for best Carrier/Internet Service Provider (ISP) solution.[5] In 2009, the AX Series won two Grand Prix/Best of Interop Tokyo awards in the Network Infrastructure and ShowNet Product categories.[6] And in 2010, the 64-bit AX Series family of application delivery controllers won Best of Microsoft TechEd for Networking.[7] In 2011, A10 Networks received an Inc. 500 award as a fast growth private company in North America for the second consecutive year, including #1 Computer Hardware vendor,[8] Top 10 Internet company[9] and an entrepreneur award for CEO Lee Chen.[10]
In August 2012, a jury in California found A10 Networks responsible for intellectual property infringement and unfair competition, awarding Brocade Communications Systems a $112 million verdict.[11] On May 21, 2013, A10 and Brocade reached a settlement of their legal disputes.[12]
In May 2013 A10 launched its A10 Thunder Series platforms, which are hardware and software Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs).[13] A10 Thunder Series won awards at the TechEd 2013 show in New Orleans, Louisiana for the Hardware category as well as the Attendees' Pick award.[14]
