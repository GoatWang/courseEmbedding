With that out of the way, let me now turn the call over to Ermanno Santilli, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, Ermanno.
Ermanno Santilli
Thanks Natalya, and thanks to everybody for joining the call today. Good morning. We are pleased to report a number of important developments MagneGas regarding our commercialization and cost reduction programs. First, I think we’ve shown that we are continuing to execute on our business strategy of increasing our industrial gas sales. We achieved a 31% increase in revenue for the three months ending March 31, 2017 versus the same period last year. The increase in sales came primarily from new customer accounts that we secured through our superior customer service at MagneGas2 fuel.
We have also been aggressively streamlining our operations, reducing our operating expenses by 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. This is the first crucial step in our strategy to shift from an R&D focused company to a profitable company. We are working aggressively to cut our burn rate and this is just the beginning of many steps we have taken to give us a profitable run rate within the next couple of quarters.
Our SG&A was down sequentially from the fourth quarter 2016 and we expect the true impact of our recent cost reductions to be reflected in the coming quarters. Our goal in 2017 is to achieve a self-sustained organic growth. Over the past 90 days, we have put in place an aggressive strategy that contains costs, the reduction of non-essential employees, consultants and along with a realignment of certain personnel and sales related positions.
We also identified a more cost-effective feedstock for MagneGas2, which will enhance our gross margins going forward. We see a clear path to profitability through organic growth in careful management of our expenses, including the cost reductions of MagnegGas2. In addition to organic growth, we are focused on acquiring accretive companies in the industrial gas market to rapidly scale the business and maximize profitability.

In addition to potential acquisitions in Florida and Indiana, where the Company already has a strong presence and existing sales force, we are also seeking to penetrate new markets in the United States with a strong industrial base particularly those were renewable technology solutions such as MagneGas2 would be well received. We have identified a number of potential high-quality targets. The key criteria for these targets include strong existing management team, a stable customer base, and consistent profitability.
Now in order to execute on the strategy, we formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary MagneGas Welding Supply LLC to hold ESSI and future industrial gas and welding acquisitions. We believe the parent organization is now ready to fully focus on concrete growth plans using clearly defined acquisition strategy.
We believe we have the opportunity to begin systematically consolidating a meaningful position in the industrial gas space over the coming quarters and for the next several years. The creation of MagneGas Welding Supply LLC is one of the many steps being undertaken by the executive team to prepare for the execution of the strategy in the near-term.
Turning to our equipment sales, in March we announced that we successfully completed the installation of the Plasma-Arc Gasification system at Green Arc in the Louisiana which makes it the first unit operating outside of MagneGas headquarters in the United States.
Pursuant to the terms of the Gasifier Purchase Agreement, MagneGas received a total of $775,000 in addition to recurring royalty payments. We are excited to have our first historic operating system at a customer location in United States and look forward to additional sales equipment nationwide.
Our strategy is to replicate this business model of upfront payments plus long-term, high margin royalties at additional locations. We also believe we have a large market opportunity in Europe for our sterilization, gasification and potentially co-combustion applications.
In January 2017, we signed a definitive agreement for a $2.65 million sale of our proprietary gasification and sterilization systems, MagnesGas2 fuel and cylinders to a company-based in Germany. This transaction represents the largest sale in our Company’s history in MagneGas Corporation’s first equipment sale in Europe. We have an open dialog with the German company and are discussing additional equipment sales from the future. We also have significant interest from other parts of Europe such as Scandinavia to purchase our units.
In conclusion, we believe this is a pivotal turning point for the Company. We are clearly focused towards near-term commercial growth opportunities and away from long lead time R&D projects. The objective of the shift is to develop a strong cash flow positive business model. We have been developing an acquisition pipeline both in the utility services and industrial gas and welding supply verticals.
We believe this acquisition strategy will provide a diverse and growing revenue mix, added intellectual property, dedicated to the utility space and significant additional human capital. These resources are intended to improve probability and magnitude of our commercial opportunities for co-combustion and sterilization, as well as the rapid geographic expansion of our most successful product to date, MagneGas2.
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Mahoney, who will review our financial performance.
Scott Mahoney
Thanks Ermanno. Revenues for the first three months ended March 31, 2017 were $872,000 as compared to $666,000 for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to additional customers and distributors acquired through ESSI. Gross profit increased to $368,400 from $299,900 for the first quarter ending March 31, 2017 versus the same period in the prior year.

Operating expenses for the first quarter ending March 31, 2017 were $2.9 million, unchanged from $2.9 million for the same period last year. However, operating expenses decreased $1.9 million, approximately 40% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The primary cause for the decrease was a focus on vendor rationalization, reduction in consulting and third-party services, and overall cost control efforts.
We’ve also taken on additional cost cutting measures related to personnel. We conducted a full review of the previous staffing model and we begun to eliminate redundant and non-essential positions. This has reduced compensation expense from approximately $3.8 million on an annualized basis in the beginning of first quarter 2017 to approximately $2.7 million on a current run rate.
We expect the majority of our staffing changes to take place in the second quarter of 2017, further reducing our payroll and related compensation expenses going forward. Our focus thereafter will be to primarily drive revenue growth, enabling our gross income to cover ongoing cash operating expenses for the organic business. Our goal remains to produce a stable, cash flow positive business model as quickly as possible, ideally no later than the end of this current year.
As of March 31, 2017 we had a cash balance of $53,578 versus $1.6 million at the end of 2016. As of March 31, 2017, we had no long-term debt with the small convertible note and a mortgage on our headquarters, which was relatively unchanged from the end of 2016.
Last week, we announced that we completed $1 million bridge financing and warrant exchange. The bridge financing provides us additional working capital for general corporate purposes at favorable terms and the warrant exchange will help us dramatically enhance our capital structure. By simplifying our existing capital structure, we now have greater financial flexibility, which we believe will be ultimately enhance our value for shareholders as we execute our corporate restructuring and new growth initiatives.
We believe we have taken the necessary steps and are successfully executing on our growth strategy and believe we now have the infrastructure in place to support our growth.
At this point, we'd like to open the call up to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sameer Joshi from Rodman & Renshaw. Please go ahead.
Sameer Joshi
Good morning, Scott. Good morning, Ermanno. How are you guys?
Ermanno Santilli
Good morning. Very well. Thank you.
Sameer Joshi
So the first question about the cost cutting efforts you are undergoing. You had $3.8 million annual savings target. Is that correct?
Scott Mahoney
No, our payroll was previously at an annual run rate of $3.8 million.
Sameer Joshi
Got it. Okay. And so this quarter your total OpEx was around $2.9 million, should we expect that these levels [or further] costs reductions that are should be expected?
Scott Mahoney
I think just two things to think about there. One I think in an absolute terms, we're focused on driving OpEx substantially lower. However, one of things that we’ll begin to talk more and more about is some of the people that were clearly expensive on our staff technical people. They were in a position because of their previous employment to where they could do things, where they could take some of their cash out and converted to stock options, restricted stock grants and things like that, some of our consulting partners were interested in doing the same.
So one of the things that we've explored very carefully over the last three months as where we could not only reduce absolute costs, but more importantly to our short-term endeavors, reduce our cash burn rate. So one of the things that we’ll begin to highlight beginning with our second quarter Q will be not only absolute EBITDA, but adjusted EBITDA to highlight the cash burn, and I think that's important for investors as we could see and focus on getting ourselves to our cash neutrality as quickly as possible.

I think that's imperative to show people the existing business, stable and healthy, organically funded. And then as we grow the items we would look to raise capital going forward would ideally be to make acquisitions and drive accelerated growth. Hopefully that answers your question.
Sameer Joshi
Yes. Now I understand. So you will be highlighting your EBITDA after stock-based combination?
Ermanno Santilli
Yes. We'll start to make that abundantly clear to investors going forward. We think it’s going to be a key metric.
Sameer Joshi
Understood. And above the line, you also mentioned that you're using a new feedstock, which is expected to reduce your growth – reduce your cost of goods. Your current gross margins are in the 40% to 45% range, are we going to see further improvements on that or will it be around 45%, 46%?
Ermanno Santilli
Yes. That’s a good question. We’re only touching on the topic because we don't know exactly what the results are going to be. But our prior feedstock, which was soybean oil is very thick and in essence what we're doing is we're pumping the liquid multiple times around our units and exposing it to the arc.
Over time that was getting thicker and thicker, which meant that occasionally you have to dump that and filter and clean and do all sorts of things that obviously added cost. On the feedstock that we are on right now is resulting in the same if not better gas produced, but is thinner, it’s still renewable and it’s functioning much, much better in our unit. So we fully expected to be able to demonstrate some pretty significant cost reductions in our production of MagneGas2 in the future.
Scott Mahoney
I think there's a couple of things to think about with this transition is it makes our use of labor much more efficient. So it just simply put, it means that we can get a lot more gas out of each man-hour. So it lets you get a lot more efficient about personnel staffing models. How many actually are required to support the machine for the production, how many actually are required to support the maintenance and the cleanup, the waste its produce, the various things that go into both prior production and then after production, the logistics are dealing with residual waste and the production output.
So that not only makes the machine operation as our business much more efficient, but this is a key stepping stone in making our machine increasingly marketable for potential end users. It doesn't require so much functional output, people working to create that output, so it becomes a lot more attractive for people to consider operating as an independent operator.
Ermanno Santilli
Yes. Ultimately over the next few months, we expect that this change in feedstock will be – will have a significant effect to our operations and strategically as a company as Scott said, the ability to easily sell these units to just about anybody.
Sameer Joshi
Thanks for that great explanation actually. That brings me to the Green Arc actually installation, how is that going and are they producing MagneGas2 and are you receiving royalties already or what is the schedule for that?
Ermanno Santilli
It's complete. The official completion of this was sent and accepted. They are producing gas. I think as they're seating their local market they are not producing gas every day, but they're certainly producing it and they actually are on the new feedstock already. So far they're really happy with the operation of the unit and our team has been there several times to a system training, so from our perspective it's complete.
Sameer Joshi
Great. So should we expect royalty revenues from this or the next two, three, four quarters?
Ermanno Santilli
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
Sameer Joshi
And just one more from me, the TALON order from Germany. There was going to be an upfront payment in the first 90 days, has that been received or what is the scheduled for that?

Ermanno Santilli
Yes. They have actually asked for an extension, which we have provided to them. The extension has a cost, and so we know it's not just an extension just to extend. We are speaking to them daily and we’re actually working with them on other multiple opportunities in addition to speaking to them and agreeing that this new feedstock at least from the industrial gas side of it is really a game changer for their business model as well.
Sameer Joshi
Okay. I have actually one more if you may, can you just talk a little bit about the coal initiative or the coal combustion technology acquisition you have spoken about a few quarters ago?
Ermanno Santilli
Yes. Scott, you want to take that?
Scott Mahoney
Sure. So we conducted excess diligence on an opportunity. At that point we are still very favorably disposed towards the action. However, some of the other thing that we have since dealt with, we're gaining items to getting any transaction done, any sort of transaction involving financing, acquisitions. And if you take a look at the announcement we made in the last week related to warrant exchange and interim financing, there is certain things that we did in those agreements that make our capital structure significantly more flexible.
It gives a lot more options to how we can get certain things done. So that was truly a big task. It’s a big achievement for us to basically give ourselves substantially more flexibility given that really this was our primary investor for the last four plus years and there are many terms and conditions in the structure that made it somewhat limiting to what kind of auction structures or options we could pursue. We've now limited virtually all of those limitations and it really opens up the entire realm of options for us to evaluate going forward.
Sameer Joshi
Great. Thanks for all the color provided on this call. This is really helpful. Thanks.
Ermanno Santilli
Thank you for the questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from [Jim Miller from Hillcrest Capital]. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning, gentlemen. It looks like the – your strategy, your game plan is starting to come together. I could see a little bit of visibility there, so congratulations.
Ermanno Santilli
Thanks.
Unidentified Analyst
The warrant exchange rate, I read up on it and [Ermanno] just touched on it, I just want to just get a better feel of what we – say a little bit more detail on that and if there's anything along those same lines going forward?
Scott Mahoney
Ermanno, you want to fill that or let me take care of it.
Ermanno Santilli
No, you can take it.
Scott Mahoney
Yes, so as I'm sure you're aware, I've been in the job since December 1, and my background is M&A and to capital raising. One of the things that we observed fairly early on as we were evaluating the ways that we could start to really advance the process for the Company's growth was that almost no matter, which form of transactional structure we wish to pursue, ultimately it was prohibited or limited and some actually performed by certain terms and conditions that all tied back to previous financings.
And essentially as long as the warrants that were in place – are in place, my option is to provide solutions to the executive team, the Company and the Board were very limited. And they became pretty apparent as we evaluate our options is that the only real clear path for the Company go forward would be to restructure its capital structure and give itself more options to do productive things that make people supportive of our strategy even more so than they are now.
And this warrants exchange was a linchpin in moving forward. A lot of people won't understand the importance of it until they see subsequent opportunities come to bear, but this was the first critical step and really giving us some of the ability to contemplate doing anything transformational.

Unidentified Analyst
Gotcha. Again somewhat along the same lines, it seems as if you are cleaning up the capital structure and setting the Company up for organic growth going forward. I actually have somewhat of a two part question. What do you see in terms of near-term, intermediate term catalysts along the growth from a growth perspective and also just getting a feel for just the size of the industry, the addressable market just so I can get a better feel for what the picture could look like in the coming months and years?
Ermanno Santilli
Well, the catalysts really are near-term, our continued sales increases, which we are confident we will be able to achieve and continued pretty significant cost reductions. That coupled with some of the acquisitions that we're looking at, obviously are going to be significant catalysts. I think that when the market realizes that we've created MagneGas2 is the best product in the industry. The only renewable fuel in the world for metal cutting – metal working and that we succeeding and leveraging it and continuing to grow at 30% when the industry is growing at 2%. I think that's going to be a pretty significant catalyst.
The cost reduction for me is obviously significant for the entire Company as well. That has been something we've been pursuing very aggressively as you can see. Once the shareholders in the market realizes that we're trending on a track towards profitability, obviously that is an enormous event for the Company and for our ability to raise capital, to finance, and how we run our operations. That would be a watershed moment for the Company and we're expecting to have that in 2017 as long as we continue on this path.
Finally technology wise, as I said I think that MagneGas2 the new feedstock will prove to be very important, not just in our organic growth profitability, but also in our ability to sell these units much easier than we were in the past. And finally, the sterilization technology, which we've invested in the past in which we're not really doing any more R&D projects on right now apart from waiting on USDA, those are part of the sales to Europe, where we're expecting that that sort of technology where would be – would find a lot of traction and successful commercially in Europe as MagneGas2 is in the U.S.
Scott Mahoney
I think if I could add a couple things. I think from my perspective, I think something that's [getting to connect in a] series of smaller catalysts, but are pretty meaningful. We've done a couple things organically that are just starting to bear fruit to immediate growth initiatives in our organic business that maybe easy to overlook. The first as we have launched the CO2 business. And CO2 is fundamentally different from some of the other organic activities that we’ve had in industrial gas and welding supply.
Probably one of the most key differences is essentially it creates a steadily growing recurring revenue model, which when a small company is trying to cash flow growth, that recurring nature of the revenue slowly becomes a more impactful baseline and we've had tremendous success. CO2 is a business that is heavily driven off of the leisure and travel and holiday industry and obviously where our Company is based in Florida.
We have enormous leverage against that industry and the gentleman that we brought in is extremely experienced, he has deep customer relationships. And he's done an excellent job getting us a toehold and ramping up that business. And we expected to steadily become a meaningful component of our business to the point were you may look at a year from now and that business alone may carry our payroll for all of Florida.
It's a very understated little business, but if we do a good job executing, if we grow it as fast as we can within region it can become a very nice little complimentary business that's easy to overlook. Another major initiative that's just beginning to take hold, in March we announced that we opened a Fort Wayne, Indiana location.

We did that because we had an existing Ocean account with big three auto manufacturer that we had been selling gas to through a distributor. The distributor was an acquired and we were then given the opportunity to continue to support that auto manufacturer directly through the sale of our gas. And when I came aboard I looked at that opportunity and said in many other instances in Florida, we've taken the MagneGas2 products used as a wedge and then began cross-selling many other items into installed customer base.
And I asked the question and said why wouldn't we look to bring in an experienced sales person to support their relationship, cross sell elevating else, and then go out into the local market and drive other organic growth and that's just beginning to take place. But please bear in mind that that opportunity with that big three auto manufacturer could spider web into other plants, other related opportunities, so we're just beginning to unfold that relationship now and that could become a pretty meaningful relationship for the Company quickly.
And we truly hope it will, but these are kind of understated organic growth opportunities that can have a pretty significant impact on making the existing business stable and strong in a matter of a few quarters. You couple that with what we've just done and we've set the table to give ourselves capital structure opportunities within ourselves, the ability to go out and look at other things.
One of the things that we all agree on is the best thing we could do is not only leverage our growth opportunities in Florida and in Indiana, but try to highlight other meaningful markets where we can either organically or through acquisitions quickly springboard into cost effective stable profitability. And that's what we're really trying to drive forward as fast as possible.
Unidentified Analyst
All right. Now I appreciate that. That’s tremendous. Just one last question, I just need just maybe a little bit more visibility, better understanding the 40% reduction in operating expenses, I would say it's significant and again it's impressive. I just want to get a feel for the comments as far as the impact being [sub leader] is it in the year, in the quarter and what type of impact are we looking at here?
Ermanno Santilli
We are definitely expecting the impact to be in the coming one, two and three quarters. It's going to be this year for sure.
Scott Mahoney
We've rationalized a lot and a lot of the costs are really being felt a lot more this quarter actually. Even though some of the actions were taken last quarter and as we continue to accumulate those decisions and cost cutting then it's going to result in a much lower cost base than prior years.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Thank you so much.
Scott Mahoney
Thank you.
End of Q&A
Operator
Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.
Ermanno Santilli
Thank you. Well as you can see we're continuing our strategic success with our pivot to profitability. So the latest results are 31% increase in sales quarter-over-quarter and 40% reduction in operating expenses. Our latest financing has cleaned up our cap structure and prepared MagneGas to execute on a complete corporate restructuring and acquisition growth strategy.
And finally, as we've been discussing in the coming months, we're looking forward to sharing with you the cumulative benefits of our cost cutting as well as more information as we receive it about MagneGas2 and how that’s really going to be a game changer for us in respect to cost and in respect to continued penetration of the market using it as a differentiator. Thank you very much and have a great day.

Ermanno Santilli
Thank you, Natalya, and thanks to everybody on the call joining us today.
We continued to grow our industrial gas sales and I’m pleased to report a 46% increase in revenue for the full year of 2016 versus the same period last year. We’re also proud that we’ve achieved a 50% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year, proving once again that our MagneGas2 product is an effective differentiator in a mature, commoditized industry.
We attribute much of this growth of our success from our MagneGas2 product line, which enables us to drive better value for our clients in a price competitive landscape. For the past two years, we’ve been proving out our business model of using MagneGas2 as a wedge product. This has been a critical driver of revenue growth and has allowed the Company to quickly gain market share. As a result, MagneGas has experienced a 39% growth rate versus an overall welding and gas supply industry market growth rate of just 2% to 3%. We expect sales will continue to increase as we expand into additional locations and add new partnerships.
We expect sales will continue to increase as we expand into additional locations and roll these new partnerships. Given the growing demand for MagneGas2, which has created a substantial backlog, we’ve signed the letter of intent to purchase 2,000 additional fuel cylinders. The high demand we’re experiencing is the direct result of our aggressive sales and marketing programs as well as our expanding distribution network. As a result, MagneGas2 fuel continues to gain the market acceptance rapidly.
We’ve added a number of new customers, and other large potential customers are in the testing or product procurement phase. In addition, our welding and gas supply distributor ESSI has expanded geographically to a total of five retail locations, generating increased demand for MagneGas2. As an example of our recent success, the marketing program we implemented with our distributor partners in 2016, AWISCO Corporation, attracted new customers including the New York City Department of Transportation, which selected MagneGas2 for metal cutting and repairs as well as the New York Iron Workers Joint Apprentice Training Facility, which added MagneGas2 to its training program for new iron workers. Additionally, in January of this year, MagneGas2 was selected as a metal cutting fuel for the Long Island railroad Brooklyn accident repairs in New York.

At the same time, we’re accelerating our organic and acquisition expansion plans in the state of Florida, with the reasonable goal of expanding to a majority of metropolitan markets in the state of Florida by the end of 2018. We believe adding new locations will enable us to drive high margin revenue growth in the key market in the coming months. We also expanded our product offering in Florida to include the commercial sale of beverage Carbon Dioxide as a complimentary product to our industrial gas line of products in Sarasota and Fort Myers, and are now planning to roll this out into other retail locations in the state of Florida in the coming months. We believe the sale of CO2 will lead to organic revenue growth opportunities in Florida and sales to new customers. We plan to initially sell CO2 in a large restaurants, travel, and leisure markets where there is expansive use of CO2 in carbonated beverages in Florida.
We are gaining a foothold in the U.S. automotive market as well. Earlier this year, we announced that we expanded into the Indiana market with direct sales of industrial gases, welding supplies, and MagneGas2 to a Fortune 100 U.S. automaker. This follows on an earlier announcement in July of 2016 with the U.S. automaker base in the Midwestern United States that also adopted MagneGas2 for its initial manufacturing facility. That relationship has since expanded to include a second facility in October 2016. Facilities we are currently servicing produce light trucks and automobiles, and are using MagneGas2 as the exclusive fuel for metal cutting due to its faster cut time and hotter flame temperature compared to existing fuels. Given our recent success in the Midwest and automotive markets, we hired an experienced industrial gas sales executive to support this key client, while further expanding our market presence in these markets.
As more factories are running at higher production rates, we expect MagneGas2 to accelerate penetration as a cost reduction enabler. We are confident that MagneGas2 would become the metal cutting standard rapidly.
Earlier this month, we announced that we successfully installed a 100 kilowatt Plasma-Arc Gasification unit at Green Arc Supply in Louisiana. Green Arc Supply of Louisiana purchased a Gasifier to manufacture and distribute MagneGas2 exclusively in certain regions of Louisiana and Texas. MagneGas received a total of $775,000 for the purchase of this system in addition to recurring royalty payments. We are excited to have our first operating system at a customer location, and plan to replicate this model with other distributors in other geographic markets which include upfront payments plus long-term, high margin royalties.
We continue to look for opportunities to increase equipment sales. In January 2017, we signed a definitive agreement for $2.65 million of equipment of our proprietary gasification and sterilization system for a company based in Germany. This transaction represents the largest sale in our history and our first sale of gasification systems in Europe. Moreover, the German company has indicated their interest to purchase additional systems for multiple markets. These two systems are expected to be used for demonstration and service contracts with the goal of entering the agricultural, municipal wastewater treatment, and industrial gas markets in Germany. We believe that this transaction finally sets the stage for our expansion across Europe and globally.
Regarding co-combustion, the Company completed its move from Michigan to Florida to reduce cost and to increase testing turnaround time. While testing has recommenced and is ongoing as we speak, the Company now believes the certification of this product is more complex and involved than previously anticipated.

In 2016, we conducted a series of tests of our developmental wastewater sterilization systems, which were encouraging. In Florida alone, one third of all residents use septic systems for disposal of their wastewater. There are significant challenges faced by companies retained to treat this waste and we believe MagneGas has a better alternative. We will continue to pursue this through additional testing, collaboration, and marketing.
We also continue to work closely with representatives from USDA to explore potential opportunities in the agricultural industry and for sterilization systems. MagneGas has also recently implemented comprehensive cost reduction and realignment program in 2017. The Company completed a production cost reduction program of MagneGas2 following an engineering program to identify a much more cost effective feedstock. The Company has also initiated a comprehensive reduction of non-essential operating overheads.
This program includes vendor consolidation, headcount reductions, and redeployment of personnel from support staff to sales staff. This reduction in feedstock, cost, and our expense reductions should enhance profitability going forward.
This month, we presented at the CleanEquity Monaco Conference on March 9th and 10th to senior financial and strategic clean-tech investors, policy makers, legislatures, end users, and media. One of the sponsors of the event was Prince Albert II and the event was hosted by Innovator Capital. We are also happy to announce we held our very first annual MagneGas2 distributor development program meeting in Clearwater, Florida. The meeting went very well and we discussed a number of important initiatives on how to grow our sales further with distributors.
In conclusion, we have spent the last two years proving our model that by using MagneGas2 is a door opener in a perfectly commoditized industry, we’re able to achieve growth rate with faster path our competition. As a result, we are currently growing our sales at an estimated rate of 20 times the industry average. While we’re accelerating commercialization of MagneGas2, future investments would be increasingly focused towards revenue generating activities.
At this point, I’d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Mahoney, who will review our financial performance in detail.
Scott Mahoney
Thank you, Ermanno.
Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $3.5 million as compared to $2.4 million for the same period last year. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 from our industrial gas segment were $2.7 million versus $2.4 million in the same period of the prior year. MagneGas has also experienced close to 20% revenue growth for MagneGas2 fuel sales versus the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to additional customers and distributors acquired through ESSI and the results of our marketing programs.
Gross margins increased 43% from 39% for the full year ending December 31, 2016 versus December 31, 2015. This improvement was in part due to increased sales of our higher-margin offerings, particularly MagenGas2, and our proprietary equipment sales as well as controlling and improving the cost of materials. In addition, the gross profit from the Green Arc sales was higher than anticipated due to lower component costs and installation expenses incurred.
Operating expenses increased approximately $3.6 million for the full year ending December 31, 2016 to $13.7 million from $10.1 million for the same period the prior year. The increase in our operating expense in 2016 was primarily attributable to the completion of our new headquarters and increased consulting expenses related to research and development, investor relations, public relations and new business development. As of December 31, 2016, we had a cash balance of $1.6 million versus $5.3 million as of December 31, 2015. From a financially perspective, we see meaningful growth opportunities for the business as a whole. We now have two years of solid data that clearly demonstrates the commercialization potential of the MagneGas two products as a key competitive advantage for continued accelerated growth in the industrial gas and welding supply industry. We will look to capitalize in this track record through accelerated organic growth and targeted select acquisitions. As this business model matures and scales, we will increasingly rely on this business to self fund more focused R&D around sterilization, filtration and co-combustion verticals. We are also very encouraged by the accelerating interest with respect to customers seeking to purchase our equipment both in the United States and in Europe.

At this point,, we would like to open the call up to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sameer Joshi of Rodman & Renshaw. Please proceed with your question.
Sameer Joshi
So, the question relates to the $2.65 million order. As I understand, there was a $1.35 million upfront payment that was expected 90 days after signing, is that right?
Ermanno Santilli
Yes. And we are actually expecting that at some point soon.
Scott Mahoney
Yes the indication is that that will be paid.
Sameer Joshi
And so just to follow up on that, what is the timeline for deploying all these -- the two systems and then the delivery of cylinders and regulators?
Ermanno Santilli
This is the Germany?
Sameer Joshi
The German, yes the German.
Ermanno Santilli
Production will take between six to nine months, possibly longer, possibly shorter depending on component supply, but the filled up bottles and the regulators that they are also purchasing can be sent over quite quickly. We have also discussed with them possibilities of leasing one of our small 50 kilowatt demonstration units which we are discussing right now as well, just to get a head start on some of the testing.
Sameer Joshi
Okay. The six to nine months is -- had that period begun or is that going to begin once you get the first payment?
Scott Mahoney
It will begin when we get the first payment. We would expect the revenue to be recognized in the current year.
Sameer Joshi
So, the next question relates to OpEx, and I think you spoke to it during your prepared remarks. But when I look at the SG&A expense, I see around $2.9 million for the fourth quarter, which was higher than the $2.3 million to $2.6 million that we had seen in the previous three quarters. Going forward, should we expect that $2.9 million level or how should we look at it, SG&A?
Scott Mahoney
We haven’t provided specific guidance, but our goal is to aggressively contain and eliminate any sort of redundant or unnecessary, non-revenue generating SG&A. We’ve initiated and completed a very extensive realignment of resources internally. So, whereas in the past, we had a more balanced investment on a quarterly basis between sales, business development, and research, we shifted heavily towards immediate near-term commercialization sales opportunities. So, there has been a procurement [ph] in unnecessary non-core expenses, elimination of lot of expenses that which the vendors that may provide a consultant service for other things that at this point are not necessary to growing the top-line and we’re optimistic that will have a significant impact on the bottom line.
Sameer Joshi
Understood. Just to get a little bit nuance there. Is there -- do these numbers have -- the SG&A in particular have any of the moving expenses or closing of the facilities expenses?
Scott Mahoney
Yes. That’s a fair component of the overall annual expense. There is also some expense incurred in the fourth quarter that may be will be a little bit higher than normal for things that you would not expect to incur on an ongoing basis, and we did have an executive change that would come with some fictional cost recognized in the quarter. We brought on and made some changes to some of our vendors and used stock-based compensation to preserve and extend cash. So, there is a number of factors sort of fourth quarter being a little higher, but I suspect it will be meaningfully lower going forward.
Sameer Joshi
Understood, that’s helpful. The next couple of questions relate to the co-combustion, the coal co-combustion technology development in particular. I understand the Australian program is sort of on a pause right now. Is that correct?
Ermanno Santilli
No, we’re actually -- we’re testing as we speak. It’s just that we just struggled to as easily or as readily replicate some of the results that we’ve seen up in Michigan. Moving the unit down, you do change your setup; we have some limitation in the space that we’re in regarding safety, which places more bends and the piping and everything else. Of course our partner passed away. So, we lost some of that knowledge. He kept cards very close to his chest. So, it’s not pausing actually; I was texting the project manager on that today and we’re burning as we speak.

Sameer Joshi
Okay. So, it will be on track soon? Also, in October last year, there was a talk about acquisition of a coal combustion technology company. Can you give us an update on that?
Ermanno Santilli
Yes, that is ongoing. We’re actually actively in discussions to continue to advance the opportunity. Obviously, it’s something that we’ve not probably provided an update on, so we want to be careful of exactly what we discuss. But, the transaction is still making meaningful progress. And we think it is a very strong fit with our business model, if we were to complete the transaction.
Sameer Joshi
Okay. One last one from me, and thanks for taking all these questions. Will you help us understand the $1.049 million item on the income statement, which is related to sale of property and equipment? 
Scott Mahoney
I’m sorry. Could you ask the question one more time? 
Sameer Joshi
There is $1.049 million cost and it is related to sale of property in the fourth quarter.
Scott Mahoney
We had some disposition of some old equipment carried as inventory but we haven’t -- we didn’t dispose of any other hard assets. So with the new auditors, they took a close look at some of our carried values for some of the legacy machines that we used, and we will use some of the assets installed in those machines to switch out replacement parts and maintenance for our ongoing production. And some of the expenses incurred were to write down some of the carried values to be as conservative as possible. So, [multiple speakers]
Sameer Joshi
Got it. No, it is part of the $13 million total operating expenses. So, I’ll hand…
Scott Mahoney
That’s right. It’s really just an impairment -- the non-cash impairment.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of [Jim Miller of Southwest] [ph] Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Scott, maybe that you can shed a little bit more light on the cost reduction program that you’ve going on? And not too much detail but just a little bit more light as far as how much more we can expect and what the picture would look like for 2017?
Scott Mahoney
Well, obviously, it’s a small company -- that’s a great question by the way, Jim. Thank you for taking the time to listen and ask something like this. It gives us chance to really talk what we’re trying to do this year. As someone who as you’ll know I am new to the Company. And one of the things that the Board really wanted to see and as I mentioned try to do, to focus on is try to accelerate sales of what we now commercially is viable and works and gives us the ability to grow our business as rapidly and as profitably as possible. But at the same time, they want us to be very careful to minimize any potential frictional costs that were not core as central to getting the Company to profitability as quickly as possible. So, as someone who came in, in the fourth quarter of last year, the first thing that I looked at was forced ranking the three verticals that we have opportunity sets in today, industrial gas; we have the co-combustion utility service space; and then, we have the wastewater sterilization and filtration space. And just as someone sort of handicapping risks, probabilities and timelines, to me it looks very clear that gas was really that could make money in the near-term. Sterilization, the technology is proven, we just need to develop the right revenue generating model to be able to take the service to market. And co-combustion is a big opportunity set but it’s also a project that could take several to many years to fully commercialize.
So, really where we shifted our cost control immediately was to try to minimize any third parties involved in things like writing the grant [ph] for helping us to conduct independent studies on things that weren’t immediately central to generating revenue. And we shifted more of the discretionary spending into the sales force. You’ve seen some announcements about expanding into CO2, expanding into the Tampa market, wanting to really have a game plan to grow our existing organic sales force in Florida; we expanded into Fort Wayne, Indiana. So, a lot of our expenses have basically been eliminated if there wasn’t clear path to that investment having a short period [ph] of that period but the highest possible IRR. Hopefully that makes sense. But as you see in the next couple of Qs, I think a lot more detail and clarity will be available, so that we can have more meaningful follow-up calls like this in the next couple of quarters.

Ermanno Santilli
And to follow on to that, Scott and I and the whole management team, we’ve been working really hard on this pivot, and it really has been cascaded throughout the entire Company. We’re focused more-and-more on what’s going to generate revenue and that really is now the objective of the entire Company.
Unidentified Analyst
Now, along the lines of generating revenue from reading the press release and kind of listening to your comments earlier, I get the sense that Germany should be significant at some point. Again, it’s early in the process. What -- as far as big picture, how does that change your mindset or how does that play into your pivot as far as revenue growth going forward?
Ermanno Santilli
Well, you’ve probably heard me on these conference calls in the past, and I’ve certainly shared this internally at MagneGas Corporation that I’m very confident that MagneGas will one day be larger in Europe than we are in United States, and that’s simply because the costly environment in Europe has been better monetized than here in United States. I think this starts with Germany is very strong, it’s a solid partner; their job is to bring new technologies, new green technologies to Europe and into Germany and they found us. We’ve -- I’ve known one of their partners for years now and I met them when I was over in Europe. So, they’re fully qualified, very well funded and this is what they do.
Our vision is that this is the start of industrial gas business in Germany. So, we are taking our prudent products in United States and taking it over to Europe. And then, Italy is continuing to make progress on the agricultural sterilization side. And we are pretty confident that that is going to continue and that could take up the sterilization product. So, this time next year, we could have a very healthy gasification and sterilization business in Europe.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And scaling up in Europe kind of looking forward, any issues there?
Ermanno Santilli
No, the model that we’ve taken -- I’m sorry go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
No, when that time comes, will there -- how does that play into the model that you work with?
Ermanno Santilli
Currently, we have no intention of having a physical presence in Europe apart from distributors. Distributors are fantastic because they bring local talent, expertise. And as you know, every market in Europe is different with different -- somewhat different laws at different regulations. So, for our industries, we will need local talent. And instead of investing it with bricks and mortar, we look for distributors. So, really from that perspective, I think we’ll find. I think from the production perspective, we have already discussed with the German partners that in the future, if there is a need to produce in Germany in order to speed delivery that we would produce -- they would produce non-proprietary pieces of the unit, and we will provide the proprietary pieces and they would be assembled in Germany with our specs. Of course, we would be on hand to assist with the first few units. But then after that it would relatively easy to reduce cost of shipment and production, and produce these units in Europe.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jim McIlree of Chardan Capital. Please proceed with your question.
JimMcIlree
I think in the script, you talked about purchasing 2,000 more cylinders. What’s the capital requirement for that and how does that pace out over the course of the year?
Scott Mahoney
Typically speaking, the cylinders cost $150 and $250, depending upon the type and configuration. So, the 2,000 is I would take an average of the $175 a unit. And at this point, we will probably fund that over the next 180-days or less. Right now, if there is a lot of pent-up demand, both with their own customers, the customers that are serviced through our distributor relationships and our new business development efforts. So, that’s a very high quest problem for us to have it at this point; we are very fortunate to be there, and it’s just a matter of pace and as we source capital, may grow.

Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Rockowitz of Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Rockowitz
My question -- I got a couple, first is about the royalty agreements that you have with Green Arc Supply. Can you elaborate a little bit on what those may look like going forward? And then the same question, do you have royalty agreement in place with the German company?
Scott Mahoney
Yes. So, essentially that question can be answered the same way for both transactions. And I would probably suggest that the model we are trying to build is as these prospective equipment buyers come in, yes, we are looking to monetize the sale with the highest possible margins but we’re also trying to maximize the net present value of both the sale of the unit and that discounted present value of the royalty stream. The way I would think about it is the royalty stream is actually a component of a couple of different things. When we sell the units, there are some ongoing service and maintenance and training obligations that the customer will pay for, there is the royalty on the actual production of the gas. And then typically speaking, depending upon where the machine is going to be located, the customer may also be buying some of their consumables through us to try to benefit from economies of scale from joint purchasing.
So, the way I would typically model to the people as I said, take whatever an upfront purchase price of the unit is, and you’re probably going to see roughly a 10% recurring revenue trail thereafter. I don’t want to say in perpetuity but as long as the machine’s in place, you’re going to see that kind of a trail. And generally speaking, your royalties are going to be at a 100% margins; everything else is going to be probably not much better than 50% margins. I think if we just keep it very simple and think about a 10% revenue trail at about a 50% gross margin, there’s almost no operating expense incrementally because essentially they’re going to be paying for our people’s time who are already on our books and being incurred within our SG&A. So you’re going to basically a gross income from that revenue trail theoretically drops straight through to EBITDA. 
Brian Rockowitz
And would you mind providing a little bit of an update on the Holston Gases of Tennessee distributor agreement? You haven’t mentioned anything about that in this call.
Ermanno Santilli
Yes. Well, the Holston Gases, they’re a fantastic distributor in multiple states. They have really turned on to MagneGas2 and the entire sales team has been visiting there, has really done a great effort to sell through all the branches. I think we’re probably touching a fraction of the branches that we could ultimately touch. And we believe that one day they will be a customer to purchase units just on Green Arc, so they can control their own destiny with the cutting fuel and produce MagneGas2 on their facilities.
Brian Rockowitz
And my last question, and it’s a little bit of tough one to ask but the stock’s been trading under $1 now for some time. Have you guys been notified or is there any concern about being delisted off of the NASDAQ?
Scott Mahoney
We are not concerned about being delisted. We are proactively addressing the situation. I think we have made it publicly known in the past, we’re required to notice whenever we get a notice like that from NASDAQ, and the Company has received that notice in the past. So, we are in the process of addressing that with NASDAQ as we speak.
Brian Rockowitz
Are you guys considering some sort of a reverse split or anything of that nature?
Scott Mahoney
I can’t really comment on anything specifically other than we are proactively working with NASDAQ. And if there were anything like that, should be forthcoming, you have to see it in filings to know that.

Operator
There are no further questions over the audio portion of the conference. I would now like to hand the conference back over to management for closing remarks.
Ermanno Santilli
Thanks very much for joining this call. I think over the past few quarters, those of you who attended and listened, can see that we have grown much more confident with MagneGas2; we have been consistently proving our business model; we are consistently outselling the industry; we are taking customers away from competition. Six months ago, we were deeply focused on co-combustion and sterilization. I think that we continue to be focused on those markets but we are pivoting our investments to what we know is going to raise our revenue, gross profit and ultimately bring the Company to profitability. Since the end of 2016, we have spent a lot of time as a management team to reduce costs, both on SG&A and on production cost of MagneGas2. And those have really given great results. We are looking forward to the next quarterly conference call to be able to see them. And that’s going to make us -- reduce our cost on SG&A and ultimately reduce our -- improve our margins on MagneGas2, so that we can grow the business even more aggressively. Thank you very much.

A slow burn
By: Michael Hinman | Tampa Bay Reporter
April 03, 2015


	Ermanno Santilli looks to turn his father’s ideas into a world-changing technology through an ultra-hot, clean-burning fuel produced by MagneGas Corp. Photo by Mark Wemple 

Executive summary
Company. MagneGas Corp.   Industry. Technology   Key. Firm seeks to make good on its promising technology.

Technology that will change the world.
It’s hard to find an up-and-coming company that doesn’t make the claim, and Ermanno Santilli is no different.
Santilli’s father, an Italian-born mathematician and physicist named Ruggero Santilli, founded MagneGas Corp. in 2007. His hope: Replace propane and acetylene with what he described as a more efficient, cleaner-burning, metal-cutting gas. 
In the years since, the younger Santilli and his team have found other uses for the firm’s MagneGas2-fueled plasma arc flow technology. The list runs a wide gamut, from sewage and sludge treatment to even creating energy from the dirty emissions of a coal plant.
Products using MagneGas2 became available in January, but a widespread rollout of products using all of MagneGas’ full potential remains months, if not years away. 
New ideas
Acetylene has been the fuel of choice for metal-cutting torches for more than a century. In the same way car owners are taking baby steps toward alternative fuel sources like electricity, metal-cutters are doing the same when it comes to parting ways with their tried and true, Santilli says. But it’s a slow pace. 
“We have a resistance to change,” says Santilli, who succeeded his father as CEO of MagneGas in 2012. “It’s a slow growth. These companies we want as customers are not on the Internet, they are not on Amazon. For us, it’s about word-of-mouth, it’s about relationships.”
MagneGas isn’t waiting, however. The company already has expanded applications for the gas, including a trial project in Indiana designed to cut the sterilization time of pig manure from months to almost instantly. 
Santilli is most excited about is a new project where MagneGas2 could almost double the energy yield from coal burning.
“The gas we get is super-powerful,” Santilli says. “When it’s oxidized, we’re talking about reaching temperatures up to 10,500 degrees, comparable to 6,400 degrees in acetylene. The higher the flame temperature, the better the combustion.”
At twice the temperature of the sun’s surface, MagneGas2 practically rips apart carbon dioxide, the primary pollutant known to affect climate change. That creates an emission the company says is cleaner than burning natural gas. The ignited gas can then be injected into the smoke emission from a coal-burning power plant, creating a second combustion, which could produce even more energy.
“Power plants like the one Duke Energy operates in Crystal River have to spend more than a billion dollars on scrubbers to keep a lot of that coal smoke out of the atmosphere,” Santilli says. “We could replace those scrubbers with our gas, and increase the energy efficiency of that coal from 35% to 45% or even 50%.”
Rough patches
With opportunities like that, Santilli’s confidence is understandable. 
“This is going to be one of the biggest shake-ups to the power industry since nuclear power,” Santilli says. “If you can take coal from 35% to 50% efficiency, it’s a trillion-dollar business in America alone.”
However, MagneGas is far from a trillion-dollar corporation. 
Eight years after it was founded, it’s not even a profitable one. The firm has generated revenue of more than $5.1 million since 2010, but has posted a net loss totaling $23.5 million during that same period. 
Nasdaq has twice threatened to delist MagneGas stocks after prices dropped below $1. In fact, the company has until June to turn around its share price, which closed last week at 82 cents.
Finding ways to effectively commercialize new technology can be a long process, says Daniel James Scott, a longtime local leader in technology startups who was named executive director of the Tampa Bay Technology Forum in January.
“Being an innovator is tough,” he says. “The folks at universities are really smart, inventing these cures and potions and lotions, but they just don’t have the industry to fall back on. There is no executive picking up the mantle on their behalf, helping them gain access to new and fresh markets.”
That also can happen at the corporate level, especially with a newer company that hasn’t fully realized the potential of the technology it possesses, Scott says. Many startups stay largely unknown, depending on angel investors and other venture capital to keep research and development funded. Yet firms that choose the route of public money, like MagneGas, are constantly exposed during that critical time, warts and all.
“I tell startups all the time that even with all the fancy metrics, analytics and frameworks that we have today, they are still no less risky than they were 10 years ago,” Scott says. “It’s still a leap of faith.”
Don’t miss out
Patient money remains the best money, Scott says. Jabil Circuit Inc. in St. Petersburg is a perfect example. Throughout the early 1990s, just as the electronic products services company was starting out, shares hovered around $1.
The dot-com bubble in 2000 shot share prices well above the $60 mark for a short time, but Jabil has since lived around the $20 mark for the past four years. It’s one of the region’s top five largest public companies with a market cap of more than $4.4 billion.
MagneGas, which trades on the Nasdaq using the symbol MNGA, is nowhere near that level, with a market cap a little more than $30 million. Staying patient and keeping an open mind, however, could help turn MagneGas into the next Jabil, one startup entrepreneur says.
“Most companies come in with a focus on a technology and a problem, but they don’t know where the market is going,” says Taylor Wallace, co-founder and CEO of WeVue in Tampa. “It’s often a hard sell for young entrepreneurs because they get so fixated on the idea they started with, they miss out on new opportunities.”
WeVue faced a situation just like that. Wallace and partner Saxon Baum developed a smartphone app to aggregate pictures and videos from concerts or sporting events. The app would then create single places through this new social media platform to see and hear everything from an event.
The problem, however, was having enough users at specific events to make the product worthwhile. It was a problem Wallace and Baum quickly realized they would not be able to solve.
“We instead found that partnering with a lot of business events, like holiday parties or conferences, created a lot of success for us,” Wallace says. “It became a way to focus on company culture through crowd sourcing, sharing content in a way that would’ve been cost-prohibitive before.”
Partnering for profits
In that regard, diversification remains a key component of Santilli’s approach at MagneGas. 
He’s not willing to just sit and wait for markets like acetylene usage to shift. Instead, Santilli says it’s worth the risk to throw possible applications out and see which ones stick.
“Just like any business, we’re going to have 10 ideas, and maybe just three of them will work,” Santilli says. “And that is great. We have so many applications that we’re thinking about and patents that we’re working on, that we’re really not worried.”
With annual losses well into seven digits, the current focus at MagneGas is to reduce costs by bringing in partners. MagneGas recently announced a partnership with two companies it didn’t name, a deal that will help fund research and testing of its coal energy production project. The company has already spent more than $500,000 on that project. 
MagneGas also is working on plans to better distribute its gas to more customers. That’s why it acquired Equipment Sales & Service Inc. of Pinellas Park in October for $3 million. 
“There are a lot of companies out there who are one-hit wonders, or even Hail Marys, where all their chips are in one place,” Santilli says. “We already have three different business lines, and even if we find success with just one of them, we know we can change the world.”

MagneGas is a hydrogen-based fuel created through the company’s plasma arc flow technology. 
Liquid waste, such as sewage, animal manure or even used antifreeze, flows through a submerged electric arc between two electrodes. As the arc decomposes the liquid molecules into atoms, it forms a plasma around the electrodes that reach temperatures above 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit. 
When the plasma is moved away from the electrodes, MagneGas rises to the surface, which can then be collected and used. MagneGas can be used for everything from transportation fuel to metal cutting to even cooking and heating.

This company, and their technology for co-combustion, will bring coal power back into play, and if you get in now and hold for a while, you can profit enormously.  Significant announcements regarding co-combustion likely are coming soon with positive test results.  Stock is now trading in the $.80 range with a huge upside once this news hits.

Michael,
Do you believe MNGA’s CEO is alone in thinking the technology to produce an entirely new species of fuel from waste which burns 4000+ degree F hotter than thought physically possible (by the “really smart folks” at Universities) and is able to reduce C02 and toxic pollutants from coal power plants by 20-40% at an actual cost SAVINGS should be classified as “world changing” technology?
Magnegas burns cleaner (less C02 - per the Edison Welding Report) than natural gas yet outperforms the nastiest hydrocarbon based fuel on the market (acetylene).  I really don’t think it is fair to compare the prospects of something like Magnegas ,which can physically, LITERALLY (when adopted) ALTER the chemical composition of Earth’s atmosphere (in a GOOD way) to some guy who thinks his new IPhone app is going to “change the world”. 
YES, progress has been “slow” for MNGA but for OBVIOUS reasons – just google “Magnegas”. (as I am sure you did prior to writing this article).
For the last 7 years, nobody (including Wikipedia editors, metal cutters, or university professors) thought for one SINGLE second that any fuel could release a 9-12% surplus of oxygen when it burned – let alone cut metal 38% faster than acetylene. (which is why they FLAT out ignored Magnegas by dismissing it as nothing but “pseudoscience” - which they were clearly now all WRONG about - unless you think GM, FDNY, EWI and US Navy are all just on MNGA’s ‘pay roll’?)
To put things in perspective – since the company’s tech advanced (a year ago?) to be able to process used cooking oils (resulting in the less expensive to produce AND higher performing MG2 series of fuel), the company has since (last 3 months) converted the New York City Fire Department and a MAJOR utility company (Duke Energy - allegedly!) to switch to Magnegas.
The previous “slow” pace certainly appears to now be accelerating with the fuel now vetted by BIG name clients as actually being REAL doesn’t it?
MNGA is the ONLY Company in last 100+ years which has developed a fuel which can OUTPERFORM acetylene.  If you think I am might be exaggerating here then take 5 minutes of your time and call those “smart folks” at the University and ask them to provide you with the chemical equation of the alleged ‘generic’ mixture of “conventional gases” which is also expected to cut 2 inch plates as fast as MG2 does.
They will not be able to answer you as Magnegas is literally a new species of fuel based on different type of bonding mechanism available in nature but one that has eluded scientists since O3 (ozone – which is technically a magnecule) was first discovered in 1839.
Science can literally “save the world” – provided technology ( like MNGA’s) is developed to harness this knowledge into much needed new industrial applications.
Finally, to clarify – Dr. Santilli’s goal for the last 30 years was to create a non-unitary covering of quantum mechanics to provide the framework to develop fundamentally NEW types of energy and clean burning fuels.  Which he has done.   The whole ‘acetylene replacement’ things was just the easiest market niche (lowest barriers for entry) to enter and monetize the invention while in the process demonstrating to the world that Magnegas is unlike any other fuel on the market and really should be used in cars and fossil fuel plants – as originally intended by Dr. Santilli.
It’s nice to see more people writing about MNGA, but I just wish people had a better understanding of basic science so they could recognize the significance of totally new chemical species unlike anything anyone has ever seen before.  
Feel free to interview me (I don’t work of MNGA) or ask me any questions about the technology and science if you ever decide to do a follow up article on Magnegas.
Thanks
-Don Borghi

CEO of the Month Ermanno Santilli









MagneGas Corporation is a highly innovative technology company that counts among its inventions, a patented process that converts liquid waste into hydrogen based fuels. We spoke to ErmannoSantilli, CEO of MagneGas, to find out more about his company and learn more about the truly game-changing technology they have created.

First of all, could you give us an overview of your company?The technology behind our company and the product MagneGas2® was actually founded by my father Dr. Santilli, and throughout the years we have evolved into a fully independent publicly traded company with over 8000 shareholders. Last year, the increase in our stock performance was close to 140% and our shareholder base and institutional shareholder base grew by approximately 30%. We are unique in the fact that we are the only green technology (or greentech) company that is based on a process called Submerged Plasma Arc Flow technology.Please tell us more about this technology. How would you describe it to someone outside of your industry?This submerged plasma arc flow technology is just a fancy way of saying that we take a liquid and we shoot an electric arc through it. Basically, we zap it with electricity and when you do that a gas is created that bubbles to the surface. Once this is done, we filter it, compress it and then fill our cylinders with it. We have independently verified our gases, and have found that our gases are hotter, safer and cut much faster than any other cutting fuel product out there. Because of this, our gas is currently being used by NASA subcontractors on the Space Center project, the Fire Department of New York City, both the US Army and Navy, and several of the top utilities in the US as well as thousands of customers throughout Florida and the rest of the country. Across our company, we have three lines of business: industrial gas, agricultural and energy. Believe it or not, for industrial gas we actually use soybean oil. With our process, the liquid you put in dictates the type of gas that comes out. What we found to be the best application for the replacement of acetylene is soybean oil, but that may change over time. Many customers rave about the faster cutting speed of our product MagneGas2, and just about everyone who tries it switches over. The customer response is so great that we are ramping up our production to accommodate this ever-increasing demand.But that’s just one of our operating modes, another involves taking waste manures such as hog manure, raw sewage or anything that has biological activity and processing this waste. For this process, we flow it through instead of zapping it and the heat and the electric arc kills any bacteria. This process renders it completely inert, yet it is still full of the nutrients that nature puts into manures. What this means is that farmers can take what are, in essence, one of the most abundant wastes in the world and reuse these liquids in the form of sterilized water and soil supplements.We continue to test this sterilization application at several large farms and have many discussions underway with the US Department of Agriculture and others in terms of collaborations. As you can imagine, the agricultural business is a very stable business and doesn’t adopt new technologies very quickly.Our third opportunity, energy, uses a very specific type of gas and the reason why our gas is so much more effective is that it has a very high flame temperature. The City College of New York in the US tested our gas and found that it has a 10,500 degree Fahrenheit flame temperature, significantly higher than any other industrial gas. Typically speaking, when you burn something, the higher the flame temperature, the better the efficiency and lower emissions. When you burn something using the product MagneGas2 at such a high temperature you get more complete combustion. Along with our partners in Australia, we found that if you take certain fuels and mix it with our gas you can burn it in a way that is both cleaner and more efficient.This brings us to another one of our innovations, co-combustion, which is we believe is a real game-changer. Coal fired electric generating plants continue to provide approximately 45% of the world’s power, so it’s not going away anytime soon. In certain countries, however, coal has a bad name and many coal plants are being forced to close due to their polluting emissions, and/or expensive CO2 taxes. When you burn a lump of coal, it’s burning at best at a 35% efficiency, which wastes energy and creates a lot of particulate matter in the smoke emitted. That smoke contains pollutants that many believe are heavy contributors to climate change.Our work has shown that if you inject the product MagneGas2 into a specially designed chamber and have an ignition point, you have a secondary combustion event that allows you to burn the smoke again at a much higher efficiency. Using MagneGas2 in this coal-burning process, we can add another 30% efficiency at a minimum, while at the same time achieving a substantial reduction in emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. We firmly believe that this is going to have a significant impact on the coal-burning industry as a whole and on our global environment as well.The advantages of this technology goes beyond increased energy efficiency. “Scrubbers”, which are the current technology used to reduce coal emissions, are highly expensive, costing up to $700 million dollars each. The average coal-fired power plant needs about four of them. So there is certainly a CAPEX and OPEX opportunity alongside being more efficient. In our industry, people fight tooth and nail to try and improve the efficiency of coal and spend billions of dollars on being more efficient. We can turn the game on its head because we don’t treat the smoke as a waste stream but as a new energy source as a result of using our fuel.We’ve been working on this project for about two years with one of the largest power companies in the United States, who has apready spent over $5 billion on carbon capture. Depending on the setup and configuration, we’re getting up to a 20 to 40% reduction in the level of CO2 emissions. There is no other technology that reduces CO2 and saves money. Most companies tend to put it underground or convert it into something. What this company has said to us is that we are the only company they’ve come across that potentially reduces CO2 and saves money.Could you give us an insight into what it’s like to work in your industry? What are the major challenges facing your company at present?Generally speaking, launching any new technology can be difficult, especially in our target industries. If you took your mobile phone out of your pocket, chances are that it’s no more than two or three years old. That’s because the mobile phone industry moves to adopt new technologies and ideas very quickly. By contrast, the industrial gas business has far less innovation, and the people in that market are just not as used to changes like you and I are about our phones. There’s a tendency to stick to what we’re doing and less willingness to adopt to new innovations.In terms of challenges, when you experience the type of rise our company has experienced in just one year, you attract a lot of attention and some of this can be quite negative. This negative attention typically comes from people who are speculators and manipulators, shorting your stock and writing wild and speculative things, which has led to a lot of potential distractions. We’ve worked hard to keep our eye on the prize.As a growing company, it’s inevitable that you’ll continue to build your team. What are some of the qualities you look for when hiring staff?We find that because our industry is not as dynamic as others, instead, we look for parallel or related industries and try and use the experience garnered there to add value to our company. We look for innovators and early adopters, those with an open mind as well as classical experience in the world of engineering.In fact, we’ve actually had luck recruiting ex-military members, who now make up 40% of our staff, and it is very humbling to have them work for our company. Some of them have been incredibly decorated for their service and we find that that level of structure and experience and their ability to adapt has been very important to us.As for the award, how does it feel to have been selected as CEO of the Month?It feels great to be selected as CEO of the Month and it is certainly an honor. I would like to thank Wealth & Finance very much! Last year’s stock performance is something we’re obviously proud of, but what really drives us is that we are taking this fantastic technology and using it to try and create a strategic shift in the energy markets. I have often said that our work in the co-combustion of coal will be the biggest news in the energy sector since the advent of nuclear power. Our social media following has also demonstrated that a lot of people love what we do, and this is what motivates me to press forward.During my time as CEO, we have had a lot of success in terms of product development and market penetration. I am an open integrator and one of the first things I did was to have a worldwide meeting with all of our various partners and collaborators. Actually, this was where the co-combustion model was born. We have brought in many fresh new faces from four years ago and are now moving into a new and bigger facility. And during this time we went from an over the counter company to being listed on NASDAQ.Lastly, what would be your major plans for 2016 and beyond? Do you have any interesting opportunities on the horizon?Our objectives are quite simple and straightforward. First, we’re going to continue to penetrate the $5 billion industrial gas market. Later this year we are going to place our first unit in the US to produce gas. In addition to this, we have several other customers waiting in the wings for the placement of a unit. We’re going to grow at the right speed for our size and resources. Second, in the agricultural sector, we’re going to continue to partner with the USDA. We also have some very interesting testing going on, both in Europe and the US. Third, on the co-combustion side, we expect to complete our testing in Q2 and we anticipate several significant opportunities to come out of it. We will continue to do more and grow, develop and transform while keeping our operating costs under control. MagneGas Corporation has never been in such a fantastic position to grow and prosper.
