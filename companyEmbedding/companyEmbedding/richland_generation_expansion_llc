Richland-Stryker Investment LLC Sells RSG Subsidiary, Including Two Peaking Plants in Ohio

Jan 27, 2014, 08:30 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Richland-Stryker Investment LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


HOUSTON, Jan. 27, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Richland-Stryker Investment LLC (RSI) announced today that it has consummated the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Richland-Stryker Generation LLC (RSG), to a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Capital Partners (ECP). Included in the sale of RSG were two gas/oil fired peaking power generation facilities totaling 464 MW: The 444 MW Richland Generation Station located in Defiance, Ohio and the 20 MW Stryker Generation Station located in Stryker, Ohio. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
RSI has owned the two generating stations since 2011, when it acquired the operating facilities from FirstEnergy Corporation. RSI's acquisition of the two peaking stations was led by Quintana Infrastructure & Development LLC (QID). QID also maintained principal responsibility for the ongoing management of the business of RSG and the daily operations of the facilities.
RSI is owned by affiliates of QID, Starwood Energy Group Global LLC, BlackRock, Inc., Frist Capital LLC, Gordy Gas Corporation and Post Oak Energy Capital, L.P.
The Richland and Stryker generating stations are highly reliable resources located in a congested electric transmission corridor of northwest Ohio. These facilities provide reliable capacity and key grid support services to the ATSI region of PJM.
Jones Day was engaged as legal counsel representing RSI on both the acquisition and subsequent divestiture of the two generating stations. JP Morgan acted as RSI's exclusive financial advisor on the transaction.
ECP is a private equity firm with offices in Short Hills, NJ and San Diego, CA.  ECP has over $11 billion of capital commitments under management, and is focused on investing in the power generation, electric transmission, midstream oil and gas, renewable energy, oil field services and environmental services sectors of North America's energy infrastructure. The fund's management has substantial experience leading successful energy companies and energy infrastructure investments.

       Green Power is energy generated from renewable sources: methane, solar, and wind. 
       



       Landfill
       


We're currently using landfill methane gas to produce electricity at five facilities in South Carolina at Horry Solid Waste Authority, Lee County Landfill SC, LLC, Richland County C & D Landfill Anderson Regional Landfill SC, LLC and Georgetown County Landfill.
 
Preparing and inspiring our young people to be successful adults in a changing world is a challenge Currently the Horry Landfill and the Lee and Anderson landfills (operated by Allied Waste) produce 17.4 Megawatts of power, Richland landfill (operated by Waste Management) produces 5.5 Megawatts and Georgetown County Landfill produces 1 Megawatt from methane gas fueled generators, for a total generation output of 23.9 Megawatts.
 
Residents of South Carolina have been making the commitment to helping our environment by  purchasing "blocks" of Green Power. The impact that these residents have on the environment is astounding. When you sign up for just 2 blocks (200 kWh) of Green Power for 12 months at just two dimes a day, you are making the same environmental impact as:

Berkeley County Landfill
Moncks Corner, SC


Berkeley County Landfill is the sixth of Santee Cooper's biogas powered landfill generating stations. Dedicated on March 22, 2011, the Berkeley Green Power Generating Stationfeatures  two 1.6-MW Caterpillar engine generators fed by a system of pipes and wells that collects methane gas created as garbage in the landfill decays. The power generated at the station is distributed through Berkeley Electric Cooperative’s system. Berkeley County Water & Sanitation owns and operates approximately 60 landfill-gas extraction wells at the county landfill. The gas produced will generate up to 3 MWs of electricity—enough to power 1,500 average-sized homes in the Southeast.


Capacity: 3 Megawatts

Horry Solid Waste Authority
Horry County, SC

Horry Solid Waste Authority was the first of the "green power" landfills to come online in September 2001. Initially it had two 1.1 Megawatt generators producing a combined 2.2 Megawatts of renewable energy. Later, in January of 2003, another 1.1 Megawatt generator was installed to bring total horsepower for all three generators to 3,500 horsepower and increased total "green" production to 3.3 Megawatts. Producing this much power means that these generators can produce enough power to support more than 2,100 homes annually.
The landfill currently occupies 727 acres including a Recycling Convenience Center, Composting Facility, Construction and Demolition landfill, and the Municipal Solid Waste landfill. Horry County Solid Waste Authority strives "To be an independent, innovative, responsive organization that aggressively provides comprehensive, cost-effective solid waste management in an environmentally sound manner, incorporating state-of-the-art methods and technology, and educating the public on responsible waste management."
Capacity: 3.3 Megawatts

2017-07-05Mercury Systems Expands Mission Computing Capabilities  With Acquisition of Richland Technologies, LLCAcquisition uniquely positions Mercury as a leading commercial provider of secure and safety-critical  processing subsystems for aerospace and defense applications, facilitating continued growthANDOVER, Mass. - July 5, 2017 - Mercury Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRCY, www.mrcy.com), today announced that it has acquired Richland Technologies, LLC (RTL). Based in Duluth, Ga., RTL specializes in safety-critical and high integrity systems, software, and hardware development as well as safety-certification services for mission-critical applications. In addition, the Company is a leader in safety-certifiable embedded graphics software for commercial and military aerospace applications. The acquisition complements Mercury’s acquisition of Creative Electronic Systems (CES) last November by providing additional capabilities in safety-critical markets as well as the opportunity to leverage RTL’s U.S. presence and expertise. Together, the RTL and CES acquisitions position Mercury uniquely as a leading provider of secure and safety-critical processing subsystems for aerospace and defense customers. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on Mercury’s financial results for the first quarter or full fiscal year 2018. Mercury intends to maintain RTL’s presence in Duluth, Ga. 

     “We are very pleased to welcome RTL to the Mercury family,” said Mark Aslett, Mercury’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Mercury gained a very strong footprint in safety-critical avionics with the acquisition of CES, based in Geneva, Switzerland, which we have renamed and is now operating as Mercury Mission Systems International (MMSI) as part of our Sensor and Mission Processing product line. The combination of RTL with MMS gives us a strong U.S. presence in the safety-critical avionics market, adding significant systems engineering, safety-critical software and hardware development and certification expertise to our existing mission computing portfolio. These new capabilities will enhance Mercury’s market penetration in commercial aerospace, defense platform management, C4I and mission computing – markets that are very closely aligned with Mercury’s existing market focus,” Aslett concluded.

Richland Center Renewable Energy
 — Midwest Environmental Advocates is representing a group of citizens near Richland Center who oppose another discharge of polluted wastewater to the Lower Wisconsin River system.




Latest News

	Victory! In late February 2013, a group of individuals concerned about water quality in the lower Wisconsin River successfully reached an agreement with Richland Center Renewable Energy, LLC (RCRE) to reduce pollution in area waterways. The settlement agreement includes a plan for the renewable energy company to reduce the impact of phosphorus pollution from its facility as well as from area nonpoint sources through projects implemented Friends of the Lower Wisconsin River (FLOW) and Richland County Land Conservation Department. Read the full press release.

	Under the final agreement, RCRE will install phosphorus removal technology by the end of this year and make any additional improvements to meet phosphorus requirements by January 1, 2015. Richland Center Renewable Energy will also provide substantial funds for nonpoint source phosphorus pollution reduction measures.  A substantial portion of these funds will be used by FLOW to establish conservation easement buffers to limit the phosphorus pollution in the Lower Wisconsin State Riverway.

	The Friends of the Lower Wisconsin Riverway, Inc. (FLOW) provides a grassroots voice for the protection and enhancement of the Lower Wisconsin State Riverway.  FLOW supports a broad spectrum of Riverway activities including natural resource protection, environmental research, river education, cultural and historic preservation, and community support.






Case Summary

	Richland Center, Wisconsin is home to several cheese processing facilities that each have their own water pollution permits to discharge wastewater to the Lower Wisconsin River or its tributaries. In addition to these permits, the facilities send some of their wastewater to the Richland Center Water Treatment Works for treatment. Since 2009, the city’s treatment center has been in repeated violation of its water pollution permit limits. The city provided documentation to the Department of Natural Resources that the violations have been caused by increased pollution from these cheese facilities.

	The proposed solution to this problem is Richland Center Renewable Energy (RCRE), an anaerobic digester that takes whey permeate and other dairy bi-products from cheese facilities and treats it with microorganisms in order to reduce waste and create energy. While this is a good idea, this facility still has wastewater to discharge.

	The DNR issued a waste pollution permit to RCRE in early 2012. Neighbors of these cheese facilities and the proposed RCRE facility were concerned about what another water pollution discharge will mean for the Pine River and the Lower Wisconsin River, waterbodies that will receive the wastewater pollution. These neighbors enjoy fishing, swimming and boating in the Pine River and the Wisconsin River and enjoy the diverse fish and wildlife that live in and around the river corridors.

	Midwest Environmental Advocates helped these citizens challenge this permit. Under current law, the DNR permit is illegal because it authorizes RCRE to discharge wastewater upstream of the Lower Wisconsin River without a sufficient antidegradation review, authorizes a new discharge of phosphorus to a waterway that currently exceeds the phosphorus water quality criteria, and authorizes a compliance schedule for a new pollution discharge to achieve phosphorus water quality criteria.
