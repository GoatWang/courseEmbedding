EDISON, N.J., Jan. 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- ContraVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCBB: CTRV), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies, announced today the addition of Carol L. Brosgart, M.D., to the Company's Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) to support the development of its targeted antiviral therapies, including CMX157, a highly potent analog of the antiviral drug tenofovir, which ContraVir plans to develop for HBV.  Dr. Brosgart has a strong background and expertise in viral infectious diseases, particularly hepatology.
James Sapirstein, Chief Executive Officer of ContraVir, commented, "I am excited to work with Dr. Brosgart again after working together at Gilead on the clinical development of tenofovir as well as on the Board of Tobira Pharmaceuticals.  There is no one I trust more than her to provide advice and guidance, particularly for our HBV program, given her experience in this space.  She joins our SAB Chairman, Dr. Nate Katz, the foremost authority on post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) pain, and together their unparalleled expertise will be extremely valuable to ContraVir as we advance clinical development for FV-100 and CMX157."
Carol Brosgart, M.D., serves as Special Adviser on Health Care for FIPRA International and as a consultant to biotechnology companies. She is a Clinical Professor of Medicine in the Divisions of Global Health Sciences, Biostatistics and Epidemiology in the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). From 2011 through 2013, she served as the Senior Advisor on Science and Policy to the Division of Viral Hepatitis at the Centers for Disease Control and to the Viral Hepatitis Action Coalition at the CDC Foundation. She has held a number of senior management positions in the medical and biotechnology community including Chief Medical Officer and Senior Vice President at Alios BioPharma, and Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer Children's Hospital & Research Center in Oakland, California. From 1998 to 2009, Dr. Brosgart held a number of senior management positions at Gilead Sciences Inc. including Vice President, Public Health and Policy, Vice President, Medical Affairs, and Vice President, Clinical Research. During her tenure leading clinical research at Gilead, Viread® and Hepsera® were approved by the FDA and regulatory agencies worldwide. 
Dr. Brosgart was a practicing physician before joining Gilead, and was the founding Medical Director of the East Bay AIDS Center at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley, California from 1987 through 1998 and the Medical Director of Central Health Center, Alameda County Health Care Services Agency from 1978-1987. She is active professionally in the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the HIV Medical Association, the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the European Association for the Study of Liver Disease.

She received her B.S. in community medicine from the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) and her M.D. from UCSF. 
About ContraVir Pharmaceuticals ContraVir is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of targeted antiviral therapies with two candidates in mid-to-late stage clinical development. ContraVir's lead candidate, FV-100, is an orally available nucleoside analogue prodrug that is being developed for the treatment of herpes zoster, or shingles, which is an infection caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV).  In addition to direct antiviral activity, FV-100 has demonstrated the potential to reduce the incidence of debilitating shingles-associated pain known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in a Phase 2 clinical study.  ContraVir is also developing CMX157, a highly potent analog of the successful antiviral drug tenofovir DF (Viread®).  CMX157 is active against HBV and more than 200-fold more potent in vitro versus tenofovir against all major HIV subtypes resistant to current therapies.  CMX157's novel structure results in decreased circulating levels of tenofovir, lowering systemic exposure and thereby reducing the potential for renal side effects.  ContraVir intends to develop CMX157 for HBV and HIV in Phase 2 clinical studies.

These statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "anticipate," "believe," "forecast," "estimated" and "intend," among others. These forward-looking statements are based on ContraVir's current expectations and actual results could differ materially.

These factors include, but are not limited to, substantial competition; our ability to continue as a going concern; our need for additional financing; uncertainties of patent protection and litigation; uncertainties with respect to lengthy and expensive clinical trials, that results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results; uncertainties of government or third party payer reimbursement; limited sales and marketing efforts and dependence upon third parties; and risks related to failure to obtain FDA clearances or approvals and noncompliance with FDA regulations. As with any drug candidates under development, there are significant risks in the development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of new products. There are no guarantees that future clinical trials discussed in this press release will be completed or successful, or that any product will receive regulatory approval for any indication or prove to be commercially successful.

NASH, a chronic, progressive liver disease, in the spectrum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, has rapidly become a leading cause for end-stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation, both in the United States and globally. NASH is a complex disease that will likely require therapy that addresses the underlying metabolic abnormalities, in addition to inflammation and fibrosis."For the full results of the Meeting, please refer to the Company's Form 6-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 8, 2017.About Aramchol™ and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)Aramchol™ (arachidyl amido cholanoic acid) is a novel fatty acid bile acid conjugate, inducing beneficial modulation of intra-hepatic lipid metabolism. Aramchol™'s ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in animal models, demonstrating down regulation of the three key pathologies of NASH: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. The effect of Aramchol™ on fibrosis is mediated by down regulation of steatosis and directly on human collagen producing cells. Aramchol™ has been granted by the FDA Fast Track designation status for the treatment of NASH.NASH is an emerging world crisis impacting 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S. due to the rise in obesity. NASH is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality.About Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd.:Galmed is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of Aramchol™, a first in class, novel, once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of NASH for variable populations, as well as other liver associated disorders. Galmed is currently conducting the ARREST Study, a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIb clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aramchol™ in subjects with NASH, who are overweight or obese, and who are pre-diabetic or type-II-diabetic. Galmed also sponsors the ARRIVE Study, a proof-of-concept Phase IIa clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Aramchol in up to 50 patients with HIV-associated NAFLD and lipodystrophy. The ARRIVE Study is an investigator-initiated trial, conducted at the University of California San Diego by Professor Rohit Loomba.

Galmed Pharmaceuticals Announces the Election of Dr. Carol L. Brosgart as a New Member of the Board of Directors
























TEL AVIV, Israel, June 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd.                 

/quotes/zigman/29097739/composite GLMD
+5.80%


 ("Galmed" or the "Company"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, and other liver diseases, announced today that on June 7, 2017, the Company held an annual general meeting of shareholders (the "Meeting"), at which the Company's shareholders voted to elect Dr. Carol L. Brosgart as a new Class I director to serve as a member of the board of directors until the close of the annual general meeting to be held in 2018.


                                        








Dr. Brosgart brings a vast array of clinical, policy and corporate experience to Galmed having held senior management positions with several leading pharmaceutical and life sciences companies. Dr. Brosgart, as Vice President, Clinical Research at Gilead Sciences, oversaw the NDA, EU and global approvals and launches of Viread
		[™]
	 for HIV and Hepsera
		[™]
	 for Hepatitis B. Recently, she served for eight years as a member of the board of directors of Tobira Therapeutics until it was acquired by Allergan in November 2016. She is also active in the public policy arena for AASLD and IDSA/HIVMA. Dr. Brosgart is a member of the Executive Committee of the Forum for Collaborative Research (FCR) at the University of California, Berkeley and has served on both the Steering Committee of the FCR's Liver Forum, which is a leader in the field of collaborative research focused on NASH, and the FCR's HBV Forum, focused on cure research for Hepatitis B. She has published widely in the field of chronic viral infections and liver disease and serves as a Clinical Professor of Medicine, Biostatistics and Epidemiology at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF).


                                        








Allen Baharaff, Galmed's President and Chief Executive Officer stated, "Dr. Brosgart has extensive clinical and drug development experience with direct relevance to both our clinical studies in NASH (the ARREST study) and HIV associated NAFLD and lipodystrophy (the ARRIVE study). We believe her experience in launching successful new drugs and navigating commercial launches and corporate transactions will prove invaluable to Galmed as we continue our drug development in chronic liver disease."


                                        








Dr. Brosgart stated, "I am pleased to join the board of directors of Galmed, a leading company in clinical research in NASH and fibrosis. NASH, a chronic, progressive liver disease, in the spectrum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, has rapidly become a leading cause for end-stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation, both in the United States and globally. NASH is a complex disease that will likely require therapy that addresses the underlying metabolic abnormalities, in addition to inflammation and fibrosis."


                                        








For the full results of the Meeting, please refer to the Company's Form 6-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 8, 2017.


                                        

About Aramchol™ and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)









Aramchol
		[™]
	 (arachidyl amido cholanoic acid) is a novel fatty acid bile acid conjugate, inducing beneficial modulation of intra-hepatic lipid metabolism. Aramchol
		[™]
	's ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in animal models, demonstrating down regulation of the three key pathologies of NASH: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. The effect of Aramchol
		[™]
	 on fibrosis is mediated by down regulation of steatosis and directly on human collagen producing cells. Aramchol
		[™]
	 has been granted by the FDA Fast Track designation status for the treatment of NASH.


                                        








NASH is an emerging world crisis impacting 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S. due to the rise in obesity. NASH is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality.


                                        

About Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd.:









Galmed is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of Aramchol
		[™]
	, a first in class, novel, once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of NASH for variable populations, as well as other liver associated disorders. Galmed is currently conducting the ARREST Study, a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIb clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aramchol
		[™]
	 in subjects with NASH, who are overweight or obese, and who are pre-diabetic or type-II-diabetic. Galmed also sponsors the ARRIVE Study, a proof-of-concept Phase IIa clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Aramchol in up to 50 patients with HIV-associated NAFLD and lipodystrophy.
