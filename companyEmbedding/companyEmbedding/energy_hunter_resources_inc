DALLAS, July 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Hunter Resources, Inc., an oil-focused energy company headquartered in Dallas, Texas (www.energyhunter.energy), today announced that it has completed a private placement of 3,150,000 shares of its common stock for aggregate gross proceeds equal to approximately $3.15 million of new common equity capital.
Private Placement and Property Acquisition Highlights









Completed private placement of 3,150,000 shares issued at a subscription price of $1.00 per share 
Private placement oversubscribed by approximately 25 percent 
Total gross proceeds of approximately $3.15 million 
Acquired two acreage lease blocks totaling approximately 500 net acres located in the heart of the Eagle Ford shale in Karnes County, Texas along the Karnes Condensate Trend 
Combined recoverable reserves estimated at 16 MMBOE 
Total estimated ultimate recoveries range between 400 MBOE and 620 MBOE per well 
At current strip pricing, adjacent wells have reached payout in less than one year with ROI's greater than 80 percent
Private Placement Details
The private placement offering initially consisted of 2,500,000 shares, issued at a subscription price of $1.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $2.5 million.  Gary C. Evans, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Energy Hunter Resources, Inc., personally invested ten percent in the offering.  Increased demand for the offering resulted in an oversubscription of the private placement by approximately 25 percent for total proceeds of $3,150,000. 
Subsequent to the closing, a portion of the proceeds from the private placement were used to acquire two lease acreage blocks located in the heart of the Eagle Ford shale of Karnes County, Texas along the Karnes Condensate Trend.  Energy Hunter has further signaled that it has targeted undisclosed acreage blocks located in the Permian Basin and mineral rights in the Marcellus and Utica Shale it is negotiating to acquire.  Remaining proceeds from the offering will also be allocated for general corporate purposes.
In addition to this initial private placement, Energy Hunter Resources also announced that it plans to undertake an initial public offering pursuant to Regulation A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). 
Eagle Ford Property Acquisition
Energy Hunter Resources acquired two separate lease blocks totaling approximately 500 net acres located in the heart of the Eagle Ford shale along the Karnes Condensate Trend in Karnes County, Texas.  The total acreage position is prospective for both the lower and upper Eagle Ford Shale, as well as the Austin Chalk formation.  There are no drilling commitments on this acreage until 2017.  Energy Hunter owns 87.5 percent of the working interest in these properties and will be the operator of record on all new wells drilled.  Approximately 14 wells can be drilled in the lower Eagle Ford formation between the two prospects, as well as an additional 10 wells in the upper Eagle Ford formation for a total of 24 wells, excluding the Austin Chalk formation and potential drilling sites therein.  Combined, total recoverable reserves are estimated at 16 MMBOE.  At current strip pricing, adjacent wells have reached payout in less than one year with ROI's greater than 80 percent utilizing current commodity prices.
Management Comments
Gary C. Evans, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Energy Hunter Resources, Inc., said, "The recently completed private placement could not have come at a more opportune time due to this downcycle.  Asset prices in the industry, even with the recent uptick in commodity prices, remain at severely depressed levels.  Many operators that may be over-leveraged or that may be seeking to unload non-core assets, are creating opportunities for companies like Energy Hunter Resources.  Additionally, existing leases are expiring from their primary term due to the lack of capital being deployed. When we saw this opportunity, we decided to move quickly to execute on our business plan.  We structured the private placement, exceeded our private placement fund raising goals, and subsequently completed the acquisition, all within 60 days." 
Evans continued, "For more than 30 years, members of the new Energy Hunter team and I have worked in and around many of these fields.  We therefore used our knowledge and experience in these fields and allocated a portion of the proceeds from the private placement to acquire two lease acreage blocks in the heart of the Eagle Ford shale in Karnes County, Texas.  We believe that the economic returns of these plays provide some of the best economics of any properties in the country at current commodity prices. We will continue to explore and analyze similar opportunities and provide updates as we begin development of our new acreage position in the Eagle Ford Shale."
The shares of common stock of the Company have not been registered under the Securities Act. Such shares were offered and sold in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering.  This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the shares of common stock, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

Chairman
  and Chief Executive Officer of Magnum Hunter Resources
  Corporation Gary Evans poses for a portrait at the company's new
  headquarters in Irving

  By Terry Wade

  HOUSTON (Reuters) - Gary Evans, a wildcatter who left his job as
  chief executive of Magnum Hunter Resources just as it emerged
  from bankruptcy on Monday, is wasting no time getting back into
  the oil business despite the worst price rout in years.

  He has already formed a new venture called Energy Hunter
  Resources Inc and is close to buying two tracts of land in the
  oil-rich Permian Basin and Eagle Ford fields of Texas, Evans told
  Reuters on Tuesday.

  Evans, who started his most successful oil company for $1,000 in
  1985 near the bottom of a price crash and later sold it for $2.2
  billion, is an eternal optimist, much like many risk-taking
  wildcatters.

  "All the veterans in the business know that this is a phenomenal
  time to get something new going, when everybody else is running
  for the hills," he said.





  Evans declined to discuss the size of the parcels he is
  purchasing but said the privately held tracts had enough space to
  drill about 40 wells that would cost about $6 million each.

  "I'm a big believer that oil prices this time next year will be
  $10 to $20 higher per barrel. So I'd like to drill some now and
  capture some of that upside," he said.

  The land is not currently producing but is surrounded by active
  oil fields, he said.

  Evans said he was targeting the Eagle Ford and the Permian Basin,
  two of the country's top tight oil fields, because he has worked
  there before and their sweet spots, with the oiliest rock, still
  offer profits with oil near $44 a barrel.

  "These two plays in this current commodity cycle offer the best
  opportunity for finding unique deals," he said. "You have to be
  in a sweet spot ... that's what is very hard to find."

  Evans is restricted for one year from buying working interests in
  the Marcellus and Utica natural gas fields in the eastern United
  States where Magnum Hunter operates.

  Magnum Hunter, which exited bankruptcy this week with zero debt,
  has said it is looking for a new CEO as it tries to regain its
  footing after oil and natural gas prices fell by half since
  mid-2014.

  Evans, 59, said the first round of financing for Energy Hunter
  Resources will be a private placement with friends and family.

  Later he said he may tap public capital markets, where he has
  raised some $6 billion over his career.

  He said the current bankruptcy wave, which has ensnared about 60
  oil and gas companies, is hitting as derivatives expire that
  companies had used to protect against the price crash.

  Liquidity helped fuel the U.S. fracking revolution and more money
  was available in the latest boom, which came at a time of
  record-low Federal Reserve interest rates, than in previous
  cycles.

  "I don't think there's any doubt that access to capital - whether
  it is the Fed, hedge funds or private equity - is 100 times
  greater now than it was in the 1980s," Evans said

DALLAS, Sept. 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Hunter Resources, Inc., an oil-focused energy company headquartered in Dallas, Texas (www.energyhunter.energy), announced that it recently opened a divisional office in Houston, Texas.  Additionally, the Company recently appointed two new executives and a technical geological manager, all of whom will be based in the new Houston office.  The Company appointed H .C. "Kip" Ferguson, Executive Vice President of Exploration and Development, Brian G. Burgher, Senior Vice President of Land and Jason Wilson, Manager of Geology. The managerial appointments represent more than 75 years of combined energy industry experience.  








Gary C. Evans, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Energy Hunter Resources said, "It's an exciting time at Energy Hunter Resources.  Strong off the heels of our successful initial capital raise, our first acquisition, and the recently announced board of director appointments of Rajiv Modi and Joe McClaugherty, I'm pleased to announce the additional management appointments of Kip Ferguson, Brian Burgher and Jason Wilson."
Evans continued, "Kip, Brian and Jason bring a core set of skills to our Company that include acquisition and development (A&D) experience as well as previous due diligence experience related to more than a billion dollars of assets within our core operating regions.  Additionally, emphasis on capex analysis, land matters, legal issues, as well as extensive operational and geologic experience, will prove invaluable with respect to our future growth plans.  While these skill sets are critical at any stage of an oil and gas company's development, they are especially critical during the formation of a new company.  Our ability to successfully identify, acquire and develop undervalued assets with our team of professionals has enabled us to quickly build an initial land position that is very attractive, especially in light of today's low commodity price environment."
H. C. "Kip" Ferguson, III, is an oil and gas veteran of 28 years.  Throughout his career Ferguson's responsibilities have included business development, natural gas management, asset acquisition and divestiture, project planning, capex and budget analysis and hydrocarbon reserves management. Ferguson previously served as Executive Vice President of Magnum Hunter Resources from October 2009 to 2016 and was President of the company's Eagle Ford Shale Division from 2011 until April 2013 when the asset was eventually sold for $401 million.  Prior to Magnum Hunter Resources, Kip Ferguson was the President and Director of Sharon Resources, Inc. from September 1999 to October 2009 when the company was acquired by Magnum Hunter Resources and subsequently renamed Eagle Ford Hunter, Inc.  Ferguson served on the board of directors at Sharon Resources, Inc. and Sharon Energy Ltd. from September 1999 to October 2009.  Ferguson also served on the board of directors for Diaz Resources, Inc. from 2005 to 2009. Mr. Ferguson served on the board of directors of New Standard Energy, a public Australian company from 2013 to 2014.
Brian Burgher brings more than 30 years of continuous experience in the oil and gas business with emphasis on leases, land and legal areas. Burgher served as Senior Vice President of Land for Magnum Hunter Resources and was also the land manager for the Eagle Ford Asset, which was assembled, developed and sold under his leadership. Brian Burgher further oversaw the acquisition and divestiture of, and due diligence on, more than $1 billion worth of leases and wells during his tenure at Magnum Hunter.  Brian has also been an independent producer and mineral and royalty owner and has worked as a field landman, field broker, in-house landman and Land Manager. Brian Burgher is a fourth generation oil and gas landman with family roots dating back to the earliest discoveries in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. 
Jason Wilson has more than 20 years of experience in geology and operations across all sectors of our target region.  From 2009 to 2013 he was a member of the Magnum Hunter Resources Eagle Ford operations team that successfully executed the grassroots development of the Gonzales/Lavaca Counties acreage position located in South Texas that was eventually sold for $401 million.  After leaving Magnum Hunter Resources, Mr. Wilson worked for one year as a senior geologist for New Standard Energy, an Australian-based company.  Following his post at New Standard Energy until joining Energy Hunter, Mr. Wilson worked as an independent consultant for EnCap Investments, L.P.  Wilson also worked previously in similar capacities for Anadarko Petroleum and Sharon Resources.

He has 28 years of experience in oil and gas and most recently served as executive vice president of Magnum Hunter from October 2009 to this year. He was president of the company’s Eagle Ford Shale division from 2011 until the division was sold for $401 million in April 2013.




Brian Burgher was named senior vice president of land. His more than 30 years of oil and gas experience has focused on leases, land and legal areas. He served as president of land for Magnum Hunter and was the land manager for the Eagle Ford asset, which was assembled, developed and sold under his leadership.
Jason Wilson has been named manager of geology and has more than 20 years of experience in geology and operations across all sectors of Energy Hunter’s target region, the company said. He was part of Magnum Hunter’s Eagle Ford operations team from 2009 to 2013. More recently, he worked for Australia-based New Standard Energy and as an independent consultant for EnCap Investments LP.
“It's an exciting time at Energy Hunter Resources,” Evans said in the company’s Sept. 19 statement, noting the news comes “strong off the heels of our successful initial capital raise, our first acquisition and the recently announced board of director appointments.”




 


In mid-July, Energy Hunter completed a private placement of 3.15 million shares of its common stock, generating aggregate gross proceeds equal to about $3.15 million of new common equity capital. The private placement offering initially consisted of 2.5 million shares, but increased demand caused it to become oversubscribed by 25 percent. At the time, the company also stated it plans to launch an initial public offering, but no further details were provided.

Energy Hunter used a portion of the private placement proceeds to acquire two lease acreage blocks totaling 500 net acres in Karnes County in South Texas’ Eagle Ford shale. At the time, the company also was negotiating to acquire undisclosed acreage blocks in the Permian Basin in West Texas and mineral rights in the Marcellus and Utica Shale in the Mid-Atlantic region.
In late August, Energy Hunter announced its first two independent board of director members: Joe McClaugherty, a senior partner of Santa Fe-based law firm McClaugherty & Silver PC, and Rajiv Modi, chairman and managing director at Cadila Pharmaceuticals.
In Energy Hunter’s Sept. 19 announcement, Evans went on to say that the new Houston employees’ skills “are especially critical during the formation of a new company.”
“Our ability to successfully identify, acquire and develop undervalued assets with our team of professionals has enabled us to quickly build an initial land position that is very attractive, especially in light of today's low commodity price environment,” Evans concluded.
Magnum Hunter previously was based in Houston, but Evans announced in 2014 that the company would relocate to the Dallas area. The company then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late 2015, listing about $1.1 billion in debt and $1.5 billion in assets. When it emerged from bankruptcy in May, Magnum Hunter announced it was searching for a new CEO.
