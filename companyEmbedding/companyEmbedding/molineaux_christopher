Susan M. Molineaux

Co-Founder at Calithera Biosciences, Inc.

                  Calithera Biosciences, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, which focuses on discovering and developing novel small molecule drugs directed against tumor metabolism and tumor immunology targets for the treatment of cancer. The company was founded by James A. Wells and Susan M. Molineaux on March 9, 2010 and is headquartered in South San Francisco, CA.                





 Educational Background



B.S. in Zoology 


University of Maryland

                  The University of Maryland, College Park is a public research university, the flagship campus of the University System of Maryland, and the original 1862 land-grant institution in the State. The University of Maryland is committed to achieving excellence as the State’s primary center of research and graduate education and the institution of choice for undergraduate students of exceptional ability and promise. The University creates and applies knowledge for the benefit of the economy and culture of the State, the region, the nation, and beyond. As the flagship of the University System of Maryland, the University shares its research, educational, cultural, and technological strengths with businesses, government, and other educational institutions. The University counts among its greatest strengths -- and a major component of its excellence -- the diversity of its faculty, students, and staff. The University of Maryland, College Park is committed to equal educational opportunity and strives to hire a diverse faculty and staff of exceptional achievement through affirmative actions, to celebrate diversity in all of its programs and activities, and to recruit and retain qualified graduate and undergraduate minority students.                




Ph.D. in Immunology & Infections Diseases 


The Johns Hopkins University

                  The Johns Hopkins University opened in 1876, with the inauguration of its first president, Daniel Coit Gilman. "What are we aiming at?" Gilman asked in his installation address. "The encouragement of research ... and the advancement of individual scholars, who by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue, and the society where they dwell."

The mission laid out by Gilman remains the university's mission today, summed up in a simple but powerful restatement of Gilman's own words: "Knowledge for the world."

What Gilman created was a research university, dedicated to advancing both students' knowledge and the state of human knowledge through research and scholarship. Gilman believed that teaching and research are interdependent, that success in one depends on success in the other. A modern university, he believed, must do both well. The realization of Gilman's philosophy at Johns Hopkins, and at other institutions that later attracted Johns Hopkins-trained scholars, revolutionized higher education in America, leading to the research university system as it exists today.

After more than 130 years, Johns Hopkins remains a world leader in both teaching and research. Eminent professors mentor top students in the arts and music, the humanities, the social and natural sciences, engineering, international studies, education, business and the health professions. Those same faculty members, and their research colleagues at the university's Applied Physics Laboratory, have each year since 1979 won Johns Hopkins more federal research and development funding than any other university.

The university has nine academic divisions and campuses throughout the Baltimore-Washington area. The Krieger School of Arts and Sciences, the Whiting School of Engineering, the School of Education and the Carey Business School are based at the Homewood campus in northern Baltimore. The schools of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing share a campus in east Baltimore with The Johns Hopkins Hospital. The Peabody Institute, a leading professional school of music, is located on Mount Vernon Place in downtown Baltimore. The Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies is located in Washington's Dupont Circle area.

The Applied Physics Laboratory is a division of the university co-equal to the nine schools, but with a non-academic, research-based mission. APL, located between Baltimore and Washington, supports national security and also pursues space science, exploration of the Solar System and other civilian research and development.

Johns Hopkins also has a campus near Rockville in Montgomery County, Md., and has academic facilities in Nanjing, China, and in Bologna, Italy. It maintains a network of continuing education facilities throughout the Baltimore-Washington region, including centers in downtown Baltimore, in downtown Washington and in Columbia.

When considered in partnership with its sister institution, the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health System, the university is Maryland's largest employer and contributes more than $10 billion a year to the state's economy

Pennsylvania Bio, a trade group representing life sciences companies throughout the state, has boosted its membership in recent years by targeting clinical research organizations, also known as contract research organizations (CROs), and developing programs for that sector of the industry.
In 2009, Pennsylvania Bio’s membership roster included two clinical research organizations.

This year it has 37 CROs among its 546 members, many of which are based outside the state.
Pennsylvania Bio President Christopher P. Molineaux talked about the region’s growing CROs with Philadelphia Business Journal Senior Reporter John George.




Q: What’s behind the growth in the number of CROs in this region?
There are a couple of reasons. Big Pharma has been pursuing ways to reduce expenses and de-risk product development. Outsourcing nonstrategic functions allows the pharma companies to reduce overhead, while still having access to these highly technical, highly specialized services. In some cases, the pharma company turns to former employees, who have formed CROs, because they know and trust the former employee. It’s less costly for the pharma company, which is no longer carrying the overhead, and the pharma company is still able to access top-quality resources who were trained in the pharma company’s labs. This approach is also very beneficial for the enterprising scientist who can start his own business, performing the same scientific work he performed within a pharma company, while running his own organization and creating jobs.




 


Q: What does this mean for our region? 
The emergence of these smaller CROs or laboratory services organizations is an opportunity for southeastern Pennsylvania to, once again, differentiate itself as the global hub of biopharmaceutical expertise. As biopharma companies turn to an outsourced model for R&D and this CRO community continues to expand, Pennsylvania is uniquely suited to lead the way. Our region has the talent and the expertise due to decades of academic excellence in medical research and decades of global pharma presence.
Q: What is your association doing for CROs?
Pennsylvania Bio has developed new programs and member benefits to appeal to the increasing CRO community. The association formed a CRO Advisory Committee in 2012 — with leaders from 15 large, mid-sized and startup CROs — to determine and help shape the most beneficial business and public policy environment for this growing sector. Patrick Dentinger, president and CEO of (Exton-based) Absorption Systems, chairs the committee, which includes representatives from CROs across Pennsylvania.

John George covers health care, biotech/pharmaceuticals and sports business.
