FAQ's









 Where Are Accounts Held?
                                                





                                                Accounts are held at Scottrade Advisor Services though CIM can act as an Investment Advisor at other brokers, if a client needs to retain their current discount broker. Please contact us for more information.
                                            










 Does CIM Ever Have Access To Client Assets?
                                                





                                                No. CIM acts only as the limited discretionary investment advisor. All account assets are held at the selected custodian, typically Scottrade Advisor Services. In addition, all account statements and tax documents are issued by the custodian as well.
                                            










 What Is Your Management Fee?
                                                





                                                Management fees are applied based on account assets. Typically, for the first $250,000 of householded assets, a management fee of 1.0% is applied. For the next $250,000 in householded assets, a management fee of 0.8% is applied, and so on and so forth. Please contact us for more information.
                                            










 Are There Broker Commissions?
                                                





                                                Yes. Online brokers will apply a commission rate to all trades in the account. For Scottrade Advisor Services, Capital Income Management has negotiated a reduced commission rate for its clients for most types of trades. For all other online brokers, standard commission rates may apply.
                                            










 How Does Trading In My Account Work?
                                                





                                                We typically do bulk trades in a master account and then allocate securities to each account based on the security weighting by percentage. For example, if 10,000 shares of XYZ is purchased and will represent a 3% weighting in each account, then the total number of shares are allocated to each account according to that 3%. Each account allocation is then charged a standard commission fee no matter the total number of shares.
                                            










 How Many Positions Will I Have In My Account?
                                                





                                                Portfolios typically include 15-20 positions in Exchange Traded funds (ETFs) and Closed-End funds (CEFs). We typically hold core positions in our buy rated CEFs though these positions may be added to or reduced during ex-dividend periods or when extreme dislocations occurs.
                                            










 Will I Be Able To Have Online Access To My Account?
                                                





                                                Absolutely. Accounts are accessible online through Scottrade's standard login screen or through your existing broker. Client's can also have check writing capability as well as automatic monthly or periodic distributions.
                                            















SAMPLE PORTFOLIOS 
Capital Income Management offers a selection of model portfolios which utilize a blend of Closed-End funds (CEFs) and Exchange Traded funds (ETFs) to achieve high income as well as appreciation potential.Clients can then choose which portfolio fits best with their long term objectives whether it be for income, tax-advantaged income, balanced or appreciation targeted investments.  All of our model portfolios would focus on high income as a primary objective but dependent on the blend of CEFs and ETFs utilized, model portfolios can overweight yield oriented funds for income weighted portfolios or growth oriented funds for appreciation weighted portfolios.
                                Model portfolios will generally include between 15-20 funds for added diversity though the funds shown can change without notice.  Hedged positions are not shown due to ongoing market conditions that can result in more or less hedged positions.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY 
Our goal at Capital Income Management (CIM) is to give client's superior total return performance while protecting capital. What separates us from other investment advisors is a unique investment strategy that utilizes the inefficiencies that exist between diversified securities commonly known as Exchange Traded funds (ETFs) and Closed-End funds (CEFs). ETFs and CEFs are used by investors to achieve diversified equity exposure in the markets but not many investment managers analyze the relationship between these funds and develop portfolios based around their relative valuations. We have found that active portfolio management of these two mostly passive investment fund classes is all one needs to realize a high income and growth portfolio with manageable risk.






Diversified Securities

                                    History has shown that investing in non-diversified securities such as individual stocks can be a minefield during down or bear market cycles and can make portfolio recovery extremely difficult even when markets recover. We only invest in Exchange Traded funds (ETFs) and Closed-End funds (CEFs) which minimizes any sudden drop in security holdings due to their diversity. ETFs and CEFs give investors the relative safety they need while offering the tradability of individual securities.
                                







High Income Securities

                                    Our goal is to offer clients total annual portfolio income yields of at least 7% so that even if the market goes through a rough patch, our portfolios are still yielding income. CEFs and ETFs give us the means to achieve such high income yields through various income strategies.
                                







Growth Opportunities

                                    ETF's can really only match their benchmark indices but because CEFs can often trade with more volatility than ETFs but yet still retain the safety of diversification, CEFs tend to offer better growth opportunities.

                                







Discount Market Prices

                                    CEFs often trade at premium and discount market prices to their NAV's and will often present opportunities for more sophisticated investors. Our strategy monitors over 100 CEF's for dislocations when premium and discount market prices result in under or overvaluation levels.
                                







Hedging Strategies

                                    The success of our strategy during difficult market periods was due in large part to hedging benchmark ETFs or premium priced CEFs securities that provided downside protection when our portfolios were fully invested or when markets looked vulnerable to a correction.
                                





Understanding ETFs
Understanding CEFs






                                        Understanding Exchange Traded Funds
                                    







Exchange Traded funds (ETFs) have become the fastest growing segment of securities in the markets over the past decade both in their numbers and their assets. But what are ETFs and why have they become so popular? Much of the reason lies in the same reason why mutual funds became so popular diversification in one investment. The advantages of diversification have long been highlighted but they become even more pronounced during market downturns and enhanced market volatility. Like mutual funds, ETFs represent a portfolio of securities that adhere to a particular investment strategy, index or industry sector. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs generally do not have actively managed portfolios, have significantly lower expense ratios than most actively managed mutual funds and can be traded during open market hours like a stock without the unmitigated downside risk that non-diversified securities retain.

 
 






At Capital Income Management (CIM), we utilize ETFs in conjunction with CEFs because CEFs will often correlate with similar indexes that ETFs follow but at a discount or premium price. Analyzing these two securities together can give investors an advantage based on these relative valuation differences. CIM will use ETFs in long positions in our client portfolios as well as hedged positions with CEFs. Hedged positions are most important during difficult market periods to give portfolios downside protection.

 







ETFs have quickly become one of the primary investments of choice for many institutional asset managers because of their size and liquidity. Many ETFs include some of the most heavily traded securities on the NYSE and other global stock exchanges and include some of the biggest financial names as well.







                                        Understanding Closed-End Funds
                                    








                                                Closed-End funds (CEFs) are one of the most misunderstood and underutilized security classes in the markets today. There are hundreds of equity and bond CEFs trading on the open market exchanges representing over $240 billion in assets, but yet most investors know nothing about them. Like ETFs, CEFs can trade like a stock during open market hours and have diversified portfolios of US based and International stocks and/or bonds. Unlike ETFs however, CEFs can trade at market prices which are significantly higher or lower than their net worth, commonly referred to as the Net Asset Value (NAV).
                                            

 
 







                                                The NAV is the fund's total net worth and includes all the fund's assets minus all its liabilities. For ETFs and mutual funds, investors buy or sell shares at the market price which is designed to trade at the NAV price. This is because mutual funds and ETFs are known as 'open-end' funds and can continuously offer new shares to willing buyers and sellers. Thus, funds can match the market price with the NAV. For 'closed-end' funds however, the number of shares is set when the security goes public and is 'closed' to issuing new shares. As a result, the market price for those finite number of shares is determined by investor demand and that demand can result in market prices substantially different from the fund's NAV price. Funds which trade at market prices higher than the NAV are said to be at a 'premium' whereas funds which trade lower are said to be at a 'discount.'
                                            

 








                                                This premium and discount feature is unique to CEFs and adds a valuation metric that other security classes do not have. For example, investors who purchase a closed-end fund at say, a -10% discount in essence purchase all of the fund's holdings at a similar -10% discount. But just because a CEF may have holdings which perform one way does not mean that the fund's market price has to follow suit. Whereas a CEF's NAV is only based on the value and performance of its holdings, a CEF's market price can be based more on investor emotions and market sentiment. And as is often the case, investor emotions can be subjective and sentiment can drive CEF market prices to under and overvaluation levels. For more sophisticated investors who perform due dilligence and analysis on CEFs, the discount and premium valuation metric can often present opportunities. At Capital Income Management, we continuously analyze CEFs for dislocations in their premiums and discounts, looking for opportunities.
                                            










                                                Another significant feature of CEFs that separates them from most other investments is that CEFs generally offer exceptionally high dividend yields. This is because CEFs often use enhanced income techniques that most mutual funds or ETFs do not. Enhanced income can come from several strategies that the fund's use to generate income that the fund then passes on to investors in the form of high distributions and yields. Though yields are a function of current market prices, it is not unusual to see CEFs offering 6% to 9% or more annualized yields paid monthly or quarterly.
                                            










                                                Part of Capital Income Management's analysis of CEFs includes the effectiveness of a fund's income strategy in current market conditions. Certain strategies are more effective in up markets and some are more effective in flat or down markets and we manage our portfolios to take advantage of this income efficiency dependent on our market outlook. Because of their comparative high yields, CEFs tend to appeal to high net worth investors looking for higher income from their investments. But one should not think of CEFs as boutique investments only appropriate for wealthy investors. CEFs represent a broad mix of equity and bond market sectors and indices and CEF sponsors come from some of the largest and most progressive financial companies in the world.
                                            






NOTE:  ETFs and CEFs are not guaranteed and investors can lose any and all of their investment.

Glossary




Objective
The fund's investment objective is to provide an attractive level of distributions and capital appreciation. In pursuing its investment objective, the fund seeks to reduce and defer potential federal income tax liabilities incurred by the holders of its common shares in connection with their investment in the fund.


Highlights
An innovative, equity-based fund that seeks to provide:

Attractive, tax-advantaged quarterly distributions
Dividend growth potential
Capital appreciation opportunities
Potential for reduced risk vs. broad-based equity market indexes




Investment Strategy
The fund invests in dividend-paying stocks issued primarily by mid- to large-cap companies, seeking attractive dividend income and the potential for future dividend growth and capital appreciation. To a lesser extent, the fund invests in preferred stocks of mid- to large-cap companies. Under normal market circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its managed assets in securities that are eligible to pay tax-advantaged dividends. The fund also sells call options covering up to 35% of the value of the fund’s portfolio in seeking to enhance risk-adjusted performance relative to an all equity portfolio.  The fund uses leverage.

RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Common Stock Risk: Common stock returns often have experienced significant volatility.Dividend Income Risk: There is no guarantee that the issuers of common stocks in which the fund invests will declare dividends in the future or that, if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.Preferred Securities Risk: Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.Leverage Risk: The fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share NAV, market price, and distributions.  Leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative. Leverage is intended to increase common share net income, but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.  Different forms of leverage, including swaps, may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk. Leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk, as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limits.Call Option Risk: The value of call options sold (written) by the fund will fluctuate. The fund may not participate in any appreciation of its equity portfolio as fully as it would if the fund did not sell call options. In addition, the fund will continue to bear the risk of declines in the value of its equity portfolio.Tax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.Foreign Investment Risk: Investments in non-U.S securities involve special risks not typically associated with domestic investments including currency risk, if not hedged - the risk that changes in exchange rates will affect the value of the fund’s investments, as well as adverse political, social and economic developments. These risks often are magnified in emerging markets.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






†† Managed Distribution Policy

				Historical distribution sources have included net investment income, realized gains and return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time which may be viewed at nuveen.com/CEFdistributions. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholders’ 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year. You should not draw any conclusions about a fund’s past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate.
			

				Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 67 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks high current tax-free income for California residents.




Strategy



Under normal market conditions, it is the fund's fundamental policy to invest at least 80% of its total assets (which includes the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in California municipal bonds, but as a general rule, the percentage is much higher. The fund's duration typically ranges from four to twelve years. It is non-diversified.


Risk



The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Municipal funds carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) They also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Although state-specific municipal funds seek to provide interest dividends exempt from both federal and state income taxes and some of these funds may seek to generate income that is also exempt from federal alternative minimum tax, outcomes cannot be guaranteed, and the funds may generate some income subject to these taxes. Residency in the state is usually required for the state income tax exemption. Generally, municipal securities are not appropriate for tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
Duration is a measure of a security's price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Duration differs from maturity in that it considers a security's interest payments in addition to the amount of time until the security reaches maturity, and also takes into account certain maturity shortening features (e.g., demand features, interest rate resets, and call options) when applicable. Securities with longer durations generally tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than securities with shorter durations. A fund with a longer average duration generally can be expected to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than a fund with a shorter average duration.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average

This fund scores Below Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Municipal funds carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) They also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Although state-specific municipal funds seek to provide interest dividends exempt from both federal and state income taxes and some of these funds may seek to generate income that is also exempt from federal alternative minimum tax, outcomes cannot be guaranteed, and the funds may generate some income subject to these taxes. Residency in the state is usually required for the state income tax exemption. Generally, municipal securities are not appropriate for tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit  and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Distribution Yield: The distribution yield measures the percentage return in the form of dividends. It is calculated daily by annualizing the most recent dividend distribution and dividing by the daily share price (NAV or POP). If the Fund did not make a distribution as of the latest scheduled distribution date, "N/A" will be displayed.
12-month Yield: The 12-month yield measures the percentage return in the form of dividends. It is calculated monthly by taking the sum of the trailing 12-month dividend payments divided by the last month's ending share price (NAV or POP) plus any capital gains distributed over previous 12 months. If the Fund did not make any distributions over the previous 12 months, "N/A" will be displayed.
The SEC 30-day Yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the first 30 days of the month by the offering price per share at the end of that period. The yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the period, after the deduction of the Fund's expenses. Yield reflects a fee waiver and/or expense limitation agreement without which the 30-day SEC Yield would have been lower.
Dividend distributions are the distribution of a dividend to mutual fund shareholders as of a certain date. The following Funds declare daily dividends: MainStay California Tax Free Opportunities, MainStay Floating Rate, MainStay High Yield Municipal Bond, MainStay Money Market, MainStay New York Tax Free Opportunities, MainStay Tax Advantaged Short Term Bond, and MainStay Tax Free Bond.

Before You Invest
Before considering an investment in the Fund, you should understand that you could lose money.
The value of the Fund's investments may fluctuate because of changes in the markets in which the Fund invests, which could cause the Fund to underperform other funds with similar objectives. Changes in these markets may be rapid and unpredictable. The energy markets have experienced and may continue to experience volatility in recent periods, including a historic drop in the price of crude oil and national gas prices. Such conditions may negatively impact the Fund and its shareholders.
Energy companies are subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to the following: fluctuations in the prices of commodities; the highly cyclical nature of the natural resources sector may adversely affect the earnings or operating cash flows of the issuers in which the Fund will invest; a significant decrease in the production of energy commodities would reduce the revenue, operating income, operating cash flows of MLPs and other natural resources sector companies and, therefore, their ability to make distributions or pay dividends and a sustained decline in demand for energy commodities could adversely affect the revenues and cash flows of Energy Companies.
Holders of MLP units are subject to certain risks inherent in the structure of MLPs, including tax risks; the limited ability to elect or remove management or the general partner or managing member; limited voting rights and conflicts of interest between the general partner or managing member and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the limited partners or members, on the other hand.
An investment in the Fund will involve tax risks, including, but not limited to: The portion, if any, of a distribution received by the Fund as the holder of an MLP equity security that is offset by the MLP’s tax deductions or losses generally will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the Fund’s tax basis in the MLP equity security, which will cause income or gain to be higher, or losses to be lower, upon the sale of the MLP security by the Fund. The Fund expects to be treated as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code. Because of the Fund’s previous concentration in MLP investments, however, the Fund was not previously eligible to elect to be treated as a regulated investment company. Accordingly, the Fund was taxed as a regular corporation, or a “C” corporation, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and subject to state and local taxes as a regular corporation. Changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations of those laws or regulations in the future could adversely affect the Fund or the Energy Companies in which the Fund will invest.
Small- and mid-cap stocks are often more volatile and less liquid than large-cap stocks. Smaller companies generally face higher risks due to their limited product lines, markets, and financial resources. Funds that invest in bonds are subject to interest-rate risk and can lose principal value when interest rates rise. Bonds are also subject to credit risk, in which the bond issuer may fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner. High yield securities have speculative characteristics and present a greater risk of loss than higher quality debt securities. These securities can also be subject to greater price volatility.
The Fund is non-diversified. By concentrating in a smaller number of investments, the Fund's risk is increased because each investment has a greater effect on the Fund's performance.
The investment strategies, practices, and risk analysis used by the Subadvisor may not produce the desired results.
Disclosure1. POP (Public Offering Price) is the NAV (Net Asset Value) plus a sales charge. All POPs are subject to revision and include the maximum sales charge.2. Average annual total returns include the change in share price and reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions. Effective after the close of business 5/30/16, MainStay Cushing® Royalty Energy Income Fund was renamed MainStay Cushing Energy Income Fund. Performance for Class A, C, and I shares reflect the performance of the then-existing Class A, C, and I shares of Cushing Energy Income Fund (which was subject to a different fee structure) for periods prior to 7/11/14, restated to reflect current sales charges. Performance for Investor Class shares reflects the historical performance of Class A shares adjusted to reflect differences in fees and expenses. Unadjusted, the performance of the new class would likely have been different. Class I shares are generally available only to corporate and institutional investors.4. No sales charge applies to Class A and Investor Class share investments of $1,000,000 or more ($250,000 or more with respect to MainStay California Tax Free Opportunities Fund, MainStay High Yield Municipal Bond Fund, MainStay New York Tax Free Opportunities Fund, MainStay Tax Advantaged Short Term Bond Fund, and MainStay Tax Free Bond Fund; or $500,000 or more with respect to MainStay Floating Rate Fund and MainStay Short Duration High Yield Fund). Effective January 1, 2017, a CDSC of 1% may be imposed on certain redemptions of such shares within 24 months of the date of purchase.Investment Definitions
The S&P 500® Index is an unmanaged index and is widely regarded as the standard for measuring large-cap U.S. stock-market performance. Index results assume the reinvestment of all capital gain and dividend distributions. The securities holdings and volatility of the Fund differ significantly from the stocks that make up the S&P 500 Index. An investment cannot be made directly into an index.The P/E Ratio (price-to-earnings) denotes the weighted average of all the P/Es of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. The P/B Ratio (price-to-book) is the weighted average of all the P/Bs of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. Return on Equity (ROE) is the weighted average of all the ROEs of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. ROE is calculated by dividing net income by book value. Standard deviation measures how widely dispersed a fund's returns have been over a specified period of time. A high standard deviation indicates that the range is wide, implying greater potential for volatility. Beta is a measure of historical volatility relative to an appropriate index (benchmark) based on its investment objective. A beta greater than 1.00 indicates volatility greater than the benchmark's. Alpha measures a fund's risk-adjusted performance and is expressed as an annualized percentage. R-Squared measures the percentage of a fund's movements that result from movements in the index. The Sharpe Ratio shown is calculated for the past 36-month period by dividing annualized excess returns by annualized standard deviation. The Annual Turnover Rate is as of the most recent annual shareholder report. Upside/Downside Market Capture measures a manager's performance in up/down markets relative to the Fund's benchmark.
