Baqar has served as a member of our board of directors since October 2012 and has been a member of the board of directors of Maison Insurance and Maison Managers since October 2012. Since January 2011, Mr. Baqar has served as the Vice President of Kingsway America Inc., which is a subsidiary of KFSI and as Vice President of KFSI since January 2014. By virtue of a management services agreement between 1347 Advisors LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of KFSI, and United Insurance Management, L.C., he has also served as the Chief Financial Officer of United Insurance Holdings Corp, a publicly-held property and casualty insurance holding company. Before joining Kingsway America Inc., Mr. Baqar served as the Director of Finance of Itasca Financial LLC, an advisory and investment firm specializing in the insurance industry, from April 2008 to December 2009. His previous experience includes positions held at Kemper Insurance Companies, a diversified mutual property-casualty insurance provider, from June 2000 to April 2008, where he most recently served as a senior analyst. Mr. Baqar obtained a bachelor’s degree from Monmouth College and a Master of Business Administration from Northeastern Illinois University. He also holds a Certified Public Accountant designation. We believe Mr. Baqar’s qualifications to serve on our board of directors include his approximately five years of experience as a finance executive in the insurance industry.All Officers and Directors Copyright 2017, © S&P Global Market Intelligence  Terms of UseRecent PostsHello world!Recent CommentsArchivesJuly 2013CategoriesUncategorizedMetaLog inEntries RSSComments RSSWordPress.orgHome About Us Products Claims Latest News Contact Us

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.
