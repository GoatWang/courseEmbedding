About Us





In 1926, Meyer Products began building snowplows on a farm in Newburgh, New York. It was then and there Meyer became the innovator, pioneer and leader in manufacturing highly reliable snow and ice control equipment. Throughout our years in business, Meyer has been fully committed to fulfilling our customer’s needs and expectations.
In September 2015, Meyer Products, along with Meyer’s sister company Swenson Spreader, joined the ASH Group, a leading European-based manufacturer of premium snow plows, spreaders, control systems and related products. The ASH group is the parent company of European brands Schmidt and Aebi, globally offering a comprehensive and technologically advanced range of products for winter and summer maintenance focused primarily on the industrial, commercial, airport and railway sectors. Schmidt is a familiar name in the snow and ice management industry, manufacturing an array of advanced plows, spreaders and related products. Aebi manufactures heavy-duty equipment for agricultural applications.
