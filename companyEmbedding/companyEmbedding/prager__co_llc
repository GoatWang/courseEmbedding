What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Company History
Prager & Co., LLC ("Prager" or the "Firm") was established in 1987 and has grown into a 35-person national firm that provides investment banking, underwriting, financial advisory, and strategic consulting services to municipalities, government agencies, higher education institutions, not-for-profit organizations, foundations, and social service agencies.
Prager was founded in San Francisco as a higher education underwriting firm with the encouragement and assistance of two prominent California private higher education institutions. In early 1991, the Firm expanded its dedicated capital market operation to New York in order to ensure that the Firm could provide the best trade execution and market intelligence for its clients.
By 1998, the Firm had developed a distinct financial advisory practice, seizing upon the opportunity to fill a void in the world of higher education finance. Today, Prager combines the broad public finance experience of its professionals, an analytical client-focused approach and superior market intelligence to deliver full service investment banking, financial advisory, and bond-trading services to our clients.
We have enormous pride in our work and we are committed to achieving excellence in everything we undertake.  Our people maintain the highest level of integrity and ethics—values we believe to be at the heart of our business.  Since the Firm's inception, we have never wavered from our commitment to the municipal finance sector. While other firms have withdrawn from certain aspects of public finance or exited the business altogether, Prager has remained committed to our clients and the industry.
Organizational Structure
Prager is organized as a limited liability company with offices in both New York and San Francisco.  As a private company, the Firm is able to remain committed to its core business—public finance—independent of short-term market and shareholder pressures.
Comprised of two director members, three founding limited investment members, and a number of employee members, Prager is not a subsidiary or affiliate of a larger organization, although its limited investment members also have holdings in other financial service firms.
The Firm maintains three primary business areas including underwriting services, financial advisory and capital market operations.  Each of these business areas draws upon the expertise of seasoned professionals with an average of 14 years of experience in public finance.
What Makes Prager Different?

Commitment:  We provide high quality, client-focused service—we are not transaction-driven.
Focus:  The Firm's business areas, people and capital are exclusively focused on our clients in the public finance sector.
Approach:  We believe a comprehensive analytical approach is the best foundation for disciplined decision-making.
Market Expertise: We provide superior market intelligence, a dedicated underwriting desk and more than 24 years of experience and service to issuers and buyers. 
People:  A dedicated, client-focused team of professionals with broad experience in every aspect of public finance. 

Investment Banking Expertise
Today's municipal market is constantly evolving and has become far more complex as regulation and market pressures increase.  The Firm is an active underwriter, placement agent and financial advisor in public finance.  Our team has on-going exposure to market conditions, rating agency perspectives, capital structure alternatives and market pricing levels; and, we focus on identifying those financial and strategic best practices that will enable our clients to meet the challenges and opportunities they face. Prager's investment banking team draws upon a broad experience that spans nearly every sector of public finance including:

higher education
charter schools and k-12 education
not-for-profit and social service agencies
general obligations
pension obligations
public power
water and sewer
transportation
resource recovery and solid waste disposal
housing and redevelopment

Prager takes a relationship-driven approach coupled with an analytical discipline towards capital structure decisions. As such, we have worked with our clients to access the capital markets in order to address the critical options facing many borrowers including:

restructuring debt portfolios to meet strategic or budgetary objectives;
replacing or refinancing debt supported by third party credit;
implementing direct purchase structures; and
managing existing derivative portfolios.

Introduction to Financial Advisory Services
The financial management of tax-exempt and nonprofit institutions has become increasingly complex and interconnected.  Business models have evolved to a point where these institutions now represent a robust collection of individual business lines.  For example, while a university's primary function is operating an institution of higher education, it may also be responsible for a related set of businesses focusing on investment management, pension administration, real estate development and healthcare delivery. When combined with the persistent volatility in the economy, capital markets and regulatory environment, the importance of an objective and independent advisor cannot be understated.
Prager views financial management as a continual, iterative process as opposed to a transaction or event-driven set of decisions.  As a financial advisor, Prager focuses on providing comprehensive services to our clients in order to develop, revise and monitor long-term financial objectives. We recognize that capital market transactions are an important component of financial management—over the last five years the firm has advised on more than 66 transactions for higher education totaling more than $9.5 billion—however they are but one component. Consequently, our team provides ongoing services centered on capital planning, policy formation, risk management, capital market access as well as other reporting and analytic tools, as outlined below; and tailors each engagement to meet the unique structure and needs of each client.
CAPITAL PLANNING

Pro forma financial modeling
Central bank creation, modeling, and management
Debt capacity and affordability studies
Credit analysis and financial projections based on capital planning strategies
Peer institution comparisons and metrics

POLICY FORMATION

Board education and information
Debt, liquidity and derivatives policy development
Developing reporting framework for policy compliance

CAPITAL MARKET ACCESS

Capital market transaction advising including marketing, structuring, procurement and execution
Comprehensive derivatives advisory including structuring, procurement and execution
Rating agency relationship management
Investor relations management

REPORTING & ANALYTICS

Access to the Firm's proprietary web-based reporting platform (CapitalPlan.org)
Debt and swap portfolio management, reporting and modeling
Secondary market trading performance and real-time access to Prager underwriting desk
Liquidity sources and uses assessment
Enterprise risk assessments encompassing liability and operational risks



Strategic Financial Analysis For Higher Education


Our book, Strategic Financial Analysis for Higher Education, has been a valuable reference tool for financial managers, trustees, and other interested parties associated with not-for-profit institutions.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Business Continuity Plan Disclosure
Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4370, in the event of a significant business interruption, Prager & Co., LLC (the “Firm”) and its clearing firm (Pershing LLC, a subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation) have developed business continuity plans in order to protect the interests of our clients. This Disclosure summarizes our Firm’s plan to minimize the risks associated with a disruption to our facilities.
Our clearing firm has developed their own business continuity plan. Pershing’s disclosure (pp. 18-19) is available along with specific instructions here; alternatively, you may contact Pershing at (201) 413-3635 and you will be given recorded instructions.
Communications with our Clients and Employees in the event of a Disruption
In the event of a significant business disruption, clients may continue to contact us by telephone at (415) 403-1900 or (212) 661-6600; by email; or by fax at (415) 956-4789 or (212) 661-2805. General information concerning the outage will be available by telephone and on the internet at the Firm’s website, www.prager.com.
The Firm has established plans to ensure the safety and well being of our employees. Employees have received emergency plan instructions, and supervisors in each office retain copies of the Business Continuity Plan.
Mission Critical Information Systems and Office Relocation for Trading, Sales and Operations
The Firm has identified its mission critical systems and applications, some of which are supported by our clearing firm’s business continuity plan and other vendors. The Firm maintains its trading, sales, operations and information technology platforms in geographically distant locations. In addition, backup facilities are also kept at geographically distant locations. In the event that the primary facility has an outage exceeding an established time threshold, personnel and functions will be relocated to such alternative facilities.
The Firm has plans for routinely testing and updating our systems as deemed necessary.
Clients may request a copy of our Business Continuity Plan, which will be furnished upon request.
