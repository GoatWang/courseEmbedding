Gordon Smith, a native of Glasgow, Scotland, is the proverbial seventh son of a seventh son. His outstanding abilities as a medium or messenger from the spirit world have led him to be dubbed "The UK is most accurate medium" Gordon has brought comfort and healing to thousands of people through the messages he is delivered from the other side. He is traveled to many parts of the world to appear before audiences, has read for many celebrities, and has been featured in television documentaries, but his feet have remained firmly on the ground. Refusing to ever charge for a private reading, Gordon still works in his barbershop in the west end of Glasgow. Gordon has proven his abilities to scientists exploring the nature of mediumship, and has astounded them with the consistency and accuracy of his messages. In this often humorous book, Gordon tells his own story of life as a messenger for the spirit world and shares his commonsense advice for avoiding charlatans and finding a true connection to Spirit.

The New York Times bestselling author of Buddha and Jesus weaves together historical narrative, mystery, exciting adventure, and intrigue in this masterfully told novel that reveals surprising discoveries about the unknown last disciple of Christ, and a new understanding of who Jesus was in his final days.


When a solid gold reliquary missing from a church in Belgium suddenly resurfaces in America, a young newspaperman begins to investigate the story. At first, it seems like just another case of a treasure stolen during World War II that has resurfaced. But it soon becomes apparent that much more is at stake.

Hidden within the medieval reliquary is a gold box that holds a sacred relic—a single finger bone—from an anonymous saint. Why would the remains of someone unknown to the Church be considered holy? The search for answers leads to a shocking discovery—a dangerous secret known only to a small band of people. If one touches the reliquary, a sacred vision is received—a vision involving a young girl who had a chance encounter with Jesus just before he was crucified.

The few people who have been blessed with these miraculous messages have banded together into a mysterious school, a closed society that preserves this venerated wisdom. But their knowledge of the young girl and Jesus is at once so fascinating yet so highly controversial that it cannot be shared with the world.

This young girl, curious about the charismatic man named Jesus, embarks on a quest to find out who he really was. What she finds—the knowledge the society protects—is at times far different from the accepted gospels. Could this unknown girl be the 13th Disciple—the last and truest apostle of Christ?

The 7 chakras of the human personality are familiar to anyone working with healing or spiritual awareness. But that consciousness is essentially incomplete. It is the universal heart of the 8th chakra that can offer us the missing key to remember who we truly are. In this astounding book, scientist, healer, and mystic Jude Currivan, Ph.D., reveals a revolutionary new perception of the cosmos, reconciling leading-edge science with Spirit and the perennial wisdom of all ages into a universal model of consciousness. She also explains how the energies of the 8th chakra offer us a path to spiritual mastery.

Both accessible and profound, this groundbreaking work is a practical and empowering guide to our personal and collective spiritual wholeness and shows us how we can:
- Understand and integrate the principles of cosmic consciousness
- Reconcile science and Spirit to show not only how the physical world is as it is, but why
- Directly access and embody newly available cosmic energies and higher levels of transpersonal awareness 
- Manifest our soul purpose on Earth

Publisher's Description▼▲
What on earth is God doing? Who are you? What is your stage of life? What are your life circumstances? What is the cross you will have to bear? What are you afraid of? We ask these six critical questionsand then we ask them againat points of transition in our lives. They all lead us to the one core question: What is the good work to which I am called? Gordon T. Smith, author of Courage and Calling, writes: "It is a good question because our work matters to us, to others and, of course, it matters to God. Work itself is good. It is vital to our human identity; and we are most ourselves, most who God calls us to be, living in what it means to know the salvation of God, when we know the grace of work well done." However, Smith acknowledges that this is not a simple question to answer in the midst of our very complicated lives. That's why he has written this brief and accessible bookto offer the support and insight we need as we ponder these six core questions in community with God and others. As a steward of your life, in attentiveness to the calling of God, how is God inviting you to engage the world?

            Usually, at least for me, when I think of God 'calling' someone to some type of work it is always in the context of some type of 'official' evangelistic type of work, such as one being a missionary overseas, starting a 'prison' ministry, working at a rescue mission, teaching a class at Church on Sundaysetc.    Normally it is always outside of 'everyday life', outside of one's secular profession and outside of one's life at home, it is something recognizably 'spiritual'.  The author of this book has a different perspective(one that I basically agree with).  The premise of this book, Consider Your Calling by Gordon T. Smith,  is  that the work that God  calls Christians to do is not just missionary work, or heading church ministries, but it is also the seemingly 'secular' callings. 


 I LOVE the premise of the book, I just have some problems with how Mr. Smith tries to teach it.  First,  he talks about discovering ourselves, discovering what matters to us (after first asking what matters to God which is good), and I sort of get what he means but something seemed 'off' to me.  He says things like,"It can be so difficult to peel back the layers of pretense and get to the heart of our identity, to the deep sense of who we are.  But we must, because wisdom is found here.  The wise are always those who know God and know the ways of God.  But the wise are also those who come to the gracious and liberating truth of their own self-identity. "  and "Saying yes to our lives will mean saying no to that which is not us. we stop living with living with illusions about who we are or wish we were - and accept the life that has been given to us.  We embrace it, we choose it, and we walk with it." Yes, God will often work with our desires and interests, but what if He chooses to put us in a vocation which we have no interest?  Mr. Smith does say that, "God's calling on our lives will consistently be in light of our actual circumstances."  And I completely agree with that and appreciate his bringing that up, I just wish he would have dealt more with submission to God when we end up in a vocation that we would not have chosen for ourselves, that we should try to develop an interest in it and do our work to the best of our ability to God's glory.  One really may end up in a profession in which one has no interest but doesn't have a plausible way of getting out of it.  For instance, in Biblical times I am sure that many (if not all) servants would not have an innate interest in their vocation if they had an unjust master, and perhaps they would rather have  done something else, but Paul tells them, "Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering wrongfully."(1Pe 2:18-19 ASV)  Perhaps they were slaves or bondservants and didn't have a choice as to their profession, but if they were a Christian they already had their true identity given to them by Christ (they didn't have to analyze their own interests, their interests were given to them by God in His Word) and thus they knew how they were to act in their profession.  


The above brings me to another point that I think Mr. Smith should have dealt with, our identity in Christ - that type of 'self-discovery' is more important to discover first than the self-discovery Mr. Smith was talking about.  That is something that I do not remember him dealing with, the new people we are in Christ (defined by God's Word),though he does talk about us aspiring to deeper fellowship and  identification with Christ, I just don't remember him focusing on the fact that as Christians we are new creations/people in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17), that that is something that we need to come to grips with first of all by reading God's Word which tells us who we are and what attributes we are to be pursuing, humility (and counting others as more important than ourselves (Philippians 2)) ,self-control, patience, love, joy, submitting to authorities/bosses that God has placed over us (Romans 13, Titus 2:5..etc.), giving thanks in every circumstance, renewing our minds, dying to selfand on so on. The Bible is the best place to start for discovering our identity, if we realize who we are in Christ and how we are best pleasing to our true Master, then we are ready for any profession God assigns to us.  


Another thing that I didn't like was that Smith seems to think that the 'religious orders' of various monks (Benedictines, Franciscansand so on) were legitimate works for God, but from what I understand, most monks were imposing sacrificial works upon themselves to earn some type of favor with God (for salvation or grace) rather than working from salvation/grace that God had already given, they worked for it, and that type of work is heretical as the salvation/grace of God is not of human works, it is not earned by us at all.


And lastly, he is a bit too open to liturgy for my taste, he encourages signing oneself with the sign of the cross before going about our work, and there is also a prayer at the end of the book that one can use in corporate worship.  He defines worship as "the liturgy of the gathered people of God" - But isn't true worship obedience?  Serving God and submitting to His will in everything?  I think he missed another great starting point there, instead of talking about how we are to participate in God's work by being like Him in being creative and working along with God's plan to redeem people, he could have, instead, defined worship and obedience/our work for the Lord/submission to Him and thus have come from the standpoint of "we don't only worship on Sundays, or at official church gatherings, we can worship every single day, every hour by our submission to His will and by our obedience to His Word".  And thus we can work at secular occupations and be worshiping God.  Yes we want to participate in the work of God (though I might have some trouble with how Smith described I in the book), but our participation is not just a privilege, it is 'worship'.  I must say though that I heartily agree with this statement the author makes:  "We are participants in the grand narrative, the work of the Creator and Redeemer.  It is not, in the end, all about what we are up to, but rather what God is up to."


All in all, though I loved the point of the book, I think that Mr. Smith missed some key starting points for the basis Christian service.  I'll end with my favorite quote from the book where the author is encouraging people to recognize God's sovereignty in their lives/in their occupations:


Our vocations are always for 'such a time as this ' (Esther 4:14). Our vocations are always for this time and this place. Always. We always embrace the good work to which we are called in response to actual circumstances, challenges and opportunities. No one is ahead of their time, no one missed their time. Further, this means that vocation is not generic, by which I mean that we do not fill out a form about ourselves and our interests and strengths and then turn to the back of the book to see if we are to be an engineer, artist or preachers. Rather, our vocations are always received and responded to in light of the actual situations in which we find ourselves. And typically these are circumstances over which we may have very little control. We have been placed here, in this time and place, and now we need to navigate our way through what lies before us. What must be stressed is that wise women and men refuse to think of themselves as victims of their circumstances, but rather as those who have been providentially situated - before God and in the grace of God - and will respond with courage, creativity and patience to what is at hand."


Many thanks to the folks at InterVarsity Press for sending me a complimentary review copy of this book (My review did not have to be favorable).
