                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

The company's key area of focus is on its main web aggregating site and the Bankrate Online Network. For this reason, most of the department's IT staff is focused on software programming and development. A single software group exists to manage all internal and external applications development. This includes both client-side web development and internal applications administration and development.

With software development as their main task, only a small IT group exists for the purpose of dealing with hardware support and network infrastructure. This group operates in a supporting role, ensuring that the proper technology and infrastructure is in place to allow the software team to pursue its product-oriented goals.

History[edit]
Bankrate was founded in 1976 as a print publisher of the "Bank Rate Monitor."[2] In 1996, the company began moving its business online.[2] Today, Bankrate, Inc.'s online network includes Bankrate.com as well as CreditCards.com, Caring.com, Interest.com, Bankaholic.com, Mortgage-calc.com, CreditCardGuide.com, ThePointsGuy.com, Bankrate.com.cn, CreditCards.ca, NetQuote.com, CD.com, Walla.by and Quizzle. The online network received over 150 million visits in 2010.[2] In January 2011, Bankrate completed the acquisition of Trouve Media. In December 2011, Bankrate completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of InsWeb Corporation for $65 million in cash.[4] In March 2012, Bankrate acquired InsuranceAgents.com.[5]
After spending 10 years as a public company traded on the NASDAQ, Bankrate was acquired in 2009 by Apax Partners in a transaction valued at approximately $571 million.[6]
In June 2011, Bankrate raised a total of $300 million in gross proceeds with a successful Initial Public Offering on the New York Stock Exchange.[7] In December 2011, Bankrate priced a secondary offering of 12.5 million shares at $17.50 per share.[8] Kenneth S. Esterow was appointed Bankrate's President and Chief Executive Officer in January 2014, having previously served as Senior Vice President – Chief Operating Officer from September 2013 to December 2013.[9]
Services[edit]




The New York Stock Exchange on June 17, 2011, when Bankrate's shares were listed.


Since the beginning, Bankrate has provided information about interest rates. Beginning in 2004, Bankrate also began offering financial education content, insurance quotes, and credit card offers.[10]
One of Bankrate's reports in 2014 determined the costs of car ownership in each state, taking into account the costs of gas and insurance, among other factors. The data suggested that Wyoming is the most expensive state in the nation to own a car.[11]
Honors[edit]
The National Association of Real Estate Editors in 2014 named Bankrate's Mortgage blog the winner of its Best Blog and Best Column awards. In October 2012, Advertising Age ranked Bankrate as the fifth fastest-growing media company.[12] Bankrate's "Financial Regulation, One Year Later" package earned a 2012 "Best in Business" award from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW).[13] Bankrate won two SABEW Awards in 2011: Holden Lewis' mortgage blog and Bankrate's explanatory series on financial reform were honored.[14] Bankrate writers have won awards from the Society of Professional Journalists several times, most recently in 2007 for their coverage of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee's rate cut.[15] In 2008, Forbes named Bankrate #41 in its list of America's 200 Best Small Companies.[16] Forbes previously had honored the website in its "Best of the Web" series five times between 1999 and 2004.[17]

NEW YORK, May 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Bankrate, Inc. (NYSE:    RATE) announced today that it has reached an agreement to acquire the business of NextAdvisor, Inc., a leading online source of independent and in-depth research and reviews of credit cards, personal finance and internet services.  


"NextAdvisor's success in leveraging its proprietary marketing techniques in the fast growing content marketing space will accelerate Bankrate's efforts to move beyond search, most notably broadening our reach and giving us new ways to engage consumers looking for credit cards," said Kenneth S. Esterow, President and CEO of Bankrate, Inc.  "The NextAdvisor team has built a terrific set of capabilities by engaging consumers with unbiased, comprehensive content, especially around credit cards, an approach that nicely complements Bankrate's core business and value proposition."
Mr. Esterow added that the acquisition provides proprietary intellectual property, technological capability, analytics, and optimization, particularly relating to the fast-growing content marketing channel.
"We are incredibly excited to join Bankrate," said Erik Larson, Founder and CEO of NextAdvisor. "The NextAdvisor team has an immediate opportunity to extend its unique set of content marketing capabilities to a broader group of customers, products and services, including as a contributor to CreditCards.com."
The asset purchase includes upfront consideration of approximately $76.3 million in cash and approximately $3.0 million in time-based vesting restricted stock units. The consideration also includes a potential earnout payment of up to $137.9 million payable in cash or Bankrate stock and up to $7.8 million in cash or time-based vesting restricted stock units based on the NextAdvisor business unit achieving certain growth targets over the 18 month period following the closing of the transaction. 
The upfront payment represents a multiple of approximately 5 times NextAdvisor's adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2016 (pro forma for the removal of a one-time credit card marketing program benefit).  The maximum earnout payment will result in an overall purchase price multiple of no greater than 7.25 times an annualized adjusted EBITDA achieved over the earnout period (inclusive of the upfront payment).
The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions including antitrust review, and is expected to close before the end of Q2 2016.
Vista Point Advisors, a San Francisco based boutique investment bank, acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Next Advisor.

History[edit]
Bankrate was founded in 1976 as a print publisher of the "Bank Rate Monitor."[2] In 1996, the company began moving its business online.[2] Today, Bankrate, Inc.'s online network includes Bankrate.com as well as CreditCards.com, Caring.com, Interest.com, Bankaholic.com, Mortgage-calc.com, CreditCardGuide.com, ThePointsGuy.com, Bankrate.com.cn, CreditCards.ca, NetQuote.com, CD.com, Walla.by and Quizzle. The online network received over 150 million visits in 2010.[2] In January 2011, Bankrate completed the acquisition of Trouve Media. In December 2011, Bankrate completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of InsWeb Corporation for $65 million in cash.[4] In March 2012, Bankrate acquired InsuranceAgents.com.[5]
After spending 10 years as a public company traded on the NASDAQ, Bankrate was acquired in 2009 by Apax Partners in a transaction valued at approximately $571 million.[6]
In June 2011, Bankrate raised a total of $300 million in gross proceeds with a successful Initial Public Offering on the New York Stock Exchange.[7] In December 2011, Bankrate priced a secondary offering of 12.5 million shares at $17.50 per share.[8] Kenneth S. Esterow was appointed Bankrate's President and Chief Executive Officer in January 2014, having previously served as Senior Vice President – Chief Operating Officer from September 2013 to December 2013.[9]
Services[edit]




The New York Stock Exchange on June 17, 2011, when Bankrate's shares were listed.


Since the beginning, Bankrate has provided information about interest rates. Beginning in 2004, Bankrate also began offering financial education content, insurance quotes, and credit card offers.[10]
One of Bankrate's reports in 2014 determined the costs of car ownership in each state, taking into account the costs of gas and insurance, among other factors. The data suggested that Wyoming is the most expensive state in the nation to own a car.[11]
Honors[edit]
The National Association of Real Estate Editors in 2014 named Bankrate's Mortgage blog the winner of its Best Blog and Best Column awards. In October 2012, Advertising Age ranked Bankrate as the fifth fastest-growing media company.[12] Bankrate's "Financial Regulation, One Year Later" package earned a 2012 "Best in Business" award from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW).[13] Bankrate won two SABEW Awards in 2011: Holden Lewis' mortgage blog and Bankrate's explanatory series on financial reform were honored.[14] Bankrate writers have won awards from the Society of Professional Journalists several times, most recently in 2007 for their coverage of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee's rate cut.[15] In 2008, Forbes named Bankrate #41 in its list of America's 200 Best Small Companies.[16] Forbes previously had honored the website in its "Best of the Web" series five times between 1999 and 2004.[17]

History[edit]
Bankrate was founded in 1976 as a print publisher of the "Bank Rate Monitor."[2] In 1996, the company began moving its business online.[2] Today, Bankrate, Inc.'s online network includes Bankrate.com as well as CreditCards.com, Caring.com, Interest.com, Bankaholic.com, Mortgage-calc.com, CreditCardGuide.com, ThePointsGuy.com, Bankrate.com.cn, CreditCards.ca, NetQuote.com, CD.com, Walla.by and Quizzle. The online network received over 150 million visits in 2010.[2] In January 2011, Bankrate completed the acquisition of Trouve Media. In December 2011, Bankrate completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of InsWeb Corporation for $65 million in cash.[4] In March 2012, Bankrate acquired InsuranceAgents.com.[5]
After spending 10 years as a public company traded on the NASDAQ, Bankrate was acquired in 2009 by Apax Partners in a transaction valued at approximately $571 million.[6]
In June 2011, Bankrate raised a total of $300 million in gross proceeds with a successful Initial Public Offering on the New York Stock Exchange.[7] In December 2011, Bankrate priced a secondary offering of 12.5 million shares at $17.50 per share.[8] Kenneth S. Esterow was appointed Bankrate's President and Chief Executive Officer in January 2014, having previously served as Senior Vice President – Chief Operating Officer from September 2013 to December 2013.[9]
Services[edit]




The New York Stock Exchange on June 17, 2011, when Bankrate's shares were listed.


Since the beginning, Bankrate has provided information about interest rates. Beginning in 2004, Bankrate also began offering financial education content, insurance quotes, and credit card offers.[10]
One of Bankrate's reports in 2014 determined the costs of car ownership in each state, taking into account the costs of gas and insurance, among other factors. The data suggested that Wyoming is the most expensive state in the nation to own a car.[11]
Honors[edit]
The National Association of Real Estate Editors in 2014 named Bankrate's Mortgage blog the winner of its Best Blog and Best Column awards. In October 2012, Advertising Age ranked Bankrate as the fifth fastest-growing media company.[12] Bankrate's "Financial Regulation, One Year Later" package earned a 2012 "Best in Business" award from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW).[13] Bankrate won two SABEW Awards in 2011: Holden Lewis' mortgage blog and Bankrate's explanatory series on financial reform were honored.[14] Bankrate writers have won awards from the Society of Professional Journalists several times, most recently in 2007 for their coverage of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee's rate cut.[15] In 2008, Forbes named Bankrate #41 in its list of America's 200 Best Small Companies.[16] Forbes previously had honored the website in its "Best of the Web" series five times between 1999 and 2004.[17]

History[edit]
Bankrate was founded in 1976 as a print publisher of the "Bank Rate Monitor."[2] In 1996, the company began moving its business online.[2] Today, Bankrate, Inc.'s online network includes Bankrate.com as well as CreditCards.com, Caring.com, Interest.com, Bankaholic.com, Mortgage-calc.com, CreditCardGuide.com, ThePointsGuy.com, Bankrate.com.cn, CreditCards.ca, NetQuote.com, CD.com, Walla.by and Quizzle. The online network received over 150 million visits in 2010.[2] In January 2011, Bankrate completed the acquisition of Trouve Media. In December 2011, Bankrate completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of InsWeb Corporation for $65 million in cash.[4] In March 2012, Bankrate acquired InsuranceAgents.com.[5]
After spending 10 years as a public company traded on the NASDAQ, Bankrate was acquired in 2009 by Apax Partners in a transaction valued at approximately $571 million.[6]
In June 2011, Bankrate raised a total of $300 million in gross proceeds with a successful Initial Public Offering on the New York Stock Exchange.[7] In December 2011, Bankrate priced a secondary offering of 12.5 million shares at $17.50 per share.[8] Kenneth S. Esterow was appointed Bankrate's President and Chief Executive Officer in January 2014, having previously served as Senior Vice President – Chief Operating Officer from September 2013 to December 2013.[9]
Services[edit]




The New York Stock Exchange on June 17, 2011, when Bankrate's shares were listed.


Since the beginning, Bankrate has provided information about interest rates. Beginning in 2004, Bankrate also began offering financial education content, insurance quotes, and credit card offers.[10]
One of Bankrate's reports in 2014 determined the costs of car ownership in each state, taking into account the costs of gas and insurance, among other factors. The data suggested that Wyoming is the most expensive state in the nation to own a car.[11]
Honors[edit]
The National Association of Real Estate Editors in 2014 named Bankrate's Mortgage blog the winner of its Best Blog and Best Column awards. In October 2012, Advertising Age ranked Bankrate as the fifth fastest-growing media company.[12] Bankrate's "Financial Regulation, One Year Later" package earned a 2012 "Best in Business" award from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW).[13] Bankrate won two SABEW Awards in 2011: Holden Lewis' mortgage blog and Bankrate's explanatory series on financial reform were honored.[14] Bankrate writers have won awards from the Society of Professional Journalists several times, most recently in 2007 for their coverage of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee's rate cut.[15] In 2008, Forbes named Bankrate #41 in its list of America's 200 Best Small Companies.[16] Forbes previously had honored the website in its "Best of the Web" series five times between 1999 and 2004.[17]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
