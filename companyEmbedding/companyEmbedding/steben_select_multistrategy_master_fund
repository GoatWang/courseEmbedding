Fund Performance



Global equity markets remained stable in the first half of the month, despite a number of major political events, ranging from former FBI Director James Comey’s congressional testimony to general elections in the UK. However, market sentiment shifted at month-end after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi discussed the return of reflationary forces and the potential need to end quantitative easing measures later this year. Comments from the Bank of England and Bank of Canada were also more hawkish than anticipated. Markets interpreted these statements as the first step towards a less accommodative monetary policy environment and the result was a sharp sell-off in government bond markets accompanied by a drop in European stocks and a rally in the Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. 
The Fund made gains in fixed income relative value with net short exposure to bond duration and long exposure to credit spreads. Equity long/short was flat as equity market gains in the US and Asia were offset by declines in Europe. Global macro managers had a loss on the month due to bond and currency reversals. The bulk of the month’s decline came from multi-strategy and equity market neutral managers who were affected by the sharp sector rotation from tech into financials during the month. The Fund made a new allocation to a systematic equity long/short program managed by Quantitative Investment Management on July 1.

Gross Performance Contribution by Strategy for June 20173

 

Past performance is not indicative of future results. Returns for one year or less are cumulative.
1. Select Fund performance is net of all fees and expenses. Most recent month, YTD (Year-to-Date), 1-Year and Since Inception returns are estimated and are subject to change, pending final monthly accounting review. Select Fund is part of a master-feeder structure and invests all of its investable assets in the Steben Select Multi-Strategy Master Fund (Master Fund) except those restricted for regulatory reasons, liquidation purposes or forced redemptions. The Master Fund commenced operations on August 1, 2013 and Select Fund commenced operations on January 2, 2014. By investing all of its investable assets in the Master Fund, Select Fund participates in the substantially similar investment management that Steben & Company, Inc., the Adviser, renders to the Master Fund.  Performance results prior to January 2, 2014 are those of the Master Fund adjusted for fees and expenses of Select Fund I Shares. More detailed information regarding performance calculations and fees may be found in the “Performance Disclosures” section below and within the Fund’s prospectus. 
2. HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index is currently comprised of over 500 domestic and offshore funds of hedge funds that have a minimum of $50 million under management or a 12-month track record of active performance. All index fund performance is equally weighted and is net of all fund fees.
3. The Fund may change its allocation to the various strategies at any given time. Performance by Strategy presents the weighted contribution for each strategy traded in the Fund, over the period shown. Performance attribution is net of managers’ management and incentive fees and is gross of Fund fees. Percentages by strategy and allocation reflect the assets of the Master Fund. Performance data by strategy is intended to permit investors to better understand which strategies generated gains or losses for the period shown. Performance is net of Portfolio Fund fees but has not been adjusted to reflect Fund level fees and expenses. There is no assurance that the Master Fund will continue to allocate to these strategies or the managers. The Fund is actively managed, and the Investment Manager may allocate to other managers or hedge funds, and may withdraw from any of these funds or managers at any given time.
PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURES 
Performance data presented herein is the historical performance data of Select Fund I Shares and the Master Fund. There can be no assurance that Select Fund and the Master Fund will achieve their objectives or avoid significant losses. Investment results will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, if repurchased in a tender offer, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Fund’s shares are subject to legal restrictions on transfer and resale and investors should not assume they will be able to resell their shares. The Fund, however, intends to conduct quarterly share repurchases, subject to an early withdrawal fee of 2% within the first 9 months of an investor’s subscription. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Diversification does not assure a profit or protection against losses.

Select Fund I Shares are subject to the following operating expenses:
Investment Manager Fee. The Master Fund pays the Investment Manager a monthly investment management fee equal to 1.25% (on an annualized basis) of its month-end net asset value of outstanding Shares of the Master Fund determined as of the last calendar day of that month before giving effect to any purchases or repurchases of Shares or any distributions by the Fund.
Operating/Servicing/Distribution Fees. Select Fund I Shares pay annual operating, servicing, and distribution fees of 0.70% annually. 
Acquired Fund Fees. As of the period ended March 31, 2017, Acquired Fund Fees totaled 6.84%, which included all incentive fees paid to the Portfolio Funds based upon the profit of those Funds for the period.

Steben Select Multi-Strategy Fund
Fund Objective
The Fund’s investment objective is to seek capital appreciation with low long-term correlation to traditional public equity and fixed income markets, while also attempting to maintain a low correlation to managed futures and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). The Fund aims to select managers who focus on more liquid strategies, which may allow managers to reposition portfolios in difficult market periods in an attempt to reduce volatility and minimize drawdowns.



 
1. Beta: Measures a fund’s sensitivity to market movements by comparing a fund’s excess return (over a benchmark) to the market’s excess return. By definition, the beta of the market is 1.00. For example, a beta that is lower than 1.00 would normally indicate that a fund’s excess return is expected to be above the market’s excess return in a down year and below in an up year. However, beta cannot predict a fund’s future performance.
2. Although the Fund has limited liquidity, it searches for hedge funds that utilize strategies with a higher level of liquidity as compared to other funds of hedge funds.

What is Steben Select Multi-Strategy Fund?
Back To Top


Steben Select Multi-Strategy Fund (“Steben Select” or the “Fund”) is a multi-manager fund of hedge funds providing access to a select set of hedge fund managers. It is built on Steben’s 24-year reputation of manager selection, due diligence and monitoring.
A fund of hedge funds (FoHF) is an investment product that pools investor assets together and invests in multiple hedge funds.
It is a closed end investment management company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. It is structured as a Fund and is available to accredited investors only.
The Fund is part of a master-feeder structure and invests in a closed-end, non-diversified, registered investment company (the “Master Fund”). The Master Fund in turn invests in unregistered hedge funds and registered investment companies (“Portfolio Funds”). There can be considerable differences between the Fund and mutual funds. Although the Fund is registered as an investment company, both the Fund and Master Fund have limited liquidity and do not provide daily net asset values.




What are the Fund’s objectives?
Back To Top


The Fund’s investment objective is to seek capital appreciation with low long-term correlation to traditional public equity and fixed income markets. The Fund will pursue attractive risk-adjusted returns while attempting to maintain a low correlation to managed futures and Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) markets. Manager selection will be driven by Steben & Company’s highly experienced research and risk management team using both quantitative and qualitative criteria.

Diversification across multiple managers, reducing single hedge fund exposure
Access to top hedge fund managers by pooling investor assets to reach investment minimums
Quarterly liquidity (See #11 for more details)
Centralized monthly performance and annual tax reporting 





How is this fund different from a traditional hedge fund?
Back To Top


Investing in a single hedge fund, as opposed to a fund of multiple hedge funds, exposes the investor to “single manager risk” i.e., dependency on that individual manager’s ability to deliver returns. While a FoHF is not without significant risks, it does diversify investor assets across multiple managers, therefore reducing single manager risk.
Steben Select is not a hedge fund, but invests in hedge funds. It is a vehicle that offers investors access to hedge funds.
Other differences can include:

Lower investment minimum than going direct to an individual hedge fund. Pooling of investor assets allows access to managers with investment minimums out of reach of many investors.
Opportunity for due diligence, risk management, manager selection and rebalancing.





What investment strategies does the Fund pursue? 
Back To Top


                    Initially, the Fund will pursue returns in 4 style areas of the hedge fund universe:

Equity Long/Short
Quantitative Equity Market Neutral
Global Macro
Fixed Income Relative Value

For more detailed information on what these styles are, we invite you to read our educational guide: Hedge Funds: An Introduction




How is this fund different from other similar funds in the marketplace?
Back To Top


There are many different types of hedge fund investments available in the marketplace today. They range from single hedge fund investments, to funds of hedge funds, to hedge fund replication strategies. The particular types of vehicles include unregistered investment companies, closed-end registered investment companies, mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs).
Steben Select Fund is a fund of hedge funds. Funds of funds typically have more manager diversification than individual hedge funds. They invest in multiple hedge funds whose managers seek to potentially generate profit through their skill in active portfolio management. In contrast, hedge fund replication strategies are typically rules-based trading systems which attempt to mimic the risk profile of hedge fund indices and earn a return from the market risk premium associated with taking those risks. By definition, replication strategies have no “manager skill” and hence have no opportunity to earn excess profits above market risk premia through skill-based security selection or market timing which actual hedge fund managers attempt to do. However, replication strategies typically charge lower fees than hedge funds or fund of hedge funds.
Steben Select is a closed-end investment management company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Registered funds of hedge funds are generally available only to accredited investors. Mutual funds and ETFs are typically available to any investor. Mutual funds and ETF structures have daily liquidity, but this can limit the number of hedge fund strategies to only those which can be managed with daily liquidity. It also constrains the universe of potential managers to those who are able or willing to accept daily redemptions from clients. Many hedge fund managers are unwilling to offer daily liquidity because of the disruption it causes to their trading strategies. Thus, funds of hedge funds in an unregistered or closed-end investment company format, who may offer quarterly liquidity, can access a much larger universe of hedge fund managers than mutual funds or ETFs.




How many Portfolio Funds are in Steben Select?
Back To Top


As of May 2017, Steben Select currently invests with 8 managers. A 2013 Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund survey found that 54% of Funds of Hedge Funds had over 30 managers. So besides the low beta and correlation goals, Steben Select Fund invests in fewer hedge funds than the average FoHF. We believe that a smaller set of carefully selected managers can potentially better balance risk and return characteristics, and that excessive manager diversification can dilute the pool of talent in the portfolio.




How is this fund different from a stock or bond investment?
Back To Top


Stocks and bonds are types of assets, while hedge funds are a type of investing vehicle. While a mutual fund can invest in stocks or bonds, the same is true for a hedge fund. Hedge funds pool investor assets together and invest in a variety of assets, including stocks and bonds.
The significant and important difference is that stock and bond mutual funds generally fall into the “long-only” investment category, and most hedge funds fall into the alternative investment category. Most hedge funds are “unconstrained”, and do not need to adhere to any benchmark. Simply stated, they can attempt to pursue absolute returns, seeking gains in both rising and falling markets through long and short positions.
A traditional stock or bond investment is reliant on the market rising (including dividends and interest payments received) to achieve profits. Likewise, mutual funds pursuing returns in the equity and fixed income markets are typically “long only”, meaning they tend to make money when the market rises.
Although there are many types of hedge fund styles, most pursue their returns across a broader range of investments: including stocks, bonds, commodities, currency, and other global markets. They are free to pursue returns by not only buying “long” positions they expect to rise in value, but also selling “short” investments expected to fall in value. Being both long and short at the same time creates a type of “hedge” (hence the name hedge funds) and allows for the potential to profit when prices are both rising or falling.
Although most hedge funds have historically had lower volatility than the S&P 500, it is important to keep in mind that most hedge funds are considered riskier than individual investment grade bonds and indexed equity portfolios. Due to their diversification, funds of hedge funds typically have lower volatility than most individual hedge funds.




What type of investor is most appropriate for Steben Select?
Back To Top


We believe the Fund may be appropriate for high net worth investors seeking capital appreciation, who have a long-term time horizon and can bear the loss of some or all of their investment and/or the risks associated with a lack of liquidity.
Steben Select is for accredited investors only. Accredited investors must meet certain income and/or net worth thresholds. 




Where does this fund fit into a portfolio?
Back To Top


Hedge funds can be thought of as components of existing asset class allocations. For instance, a long/short equity hedge fund could be included within an equity allocation, or a relative value fixed income hedge fund could be included within a fixed income allocation. Hedge funds can also be thought of as an investment that potentially captures different sources of return from traditional investments and could be a separate allocation as part of an overall allocation to alternative investments. This is especially relevant for strategies that invest in multiple asset classes, such as global macro. But keep in mind that the Fund may be highly leveraged and may increase the potential for losses and gains.




How are the underlying Portfolio Funds selected?
Back To Top


Narrowing the potential universe of over 10,000 hedge funds to the select list of managers in the Fund is conducted by Steben & Company’s highly qualified research and risk management team.
The selection process is both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative screen reduces the number of potential candidates to around 30 to 50 funds. This screen includes searching for managers with a track record of at least 4 years, assets under management of over $100mm, a low beta to equity indices, and a low correlation to fixed income, real estate investment trust (REIT) and managed futures indices. Steben also screens for historically attractive risk adjusted return attributes. Steben then conducts qualitative due diligence — investment and operational — to further narrow the list to the select number of funds chosen.




What is the liquidity of an investment in the Fund?
Back To Top


The Fund intends to offer quarterly share repurchases through tender offers with 75 days written notice. An initial payment of 95% of the share price will be paid approximately 35 days after quarter end, with the remaining 5% paid once the annual audit is completed.
Share repurchases within the first 9 months of investing will incur an early withdrawal penalty of 2%. The penalty goes to the Fund and serves to offset the impact on other Fund investors of penalties imposed from withdrawals of investments in the sub funds through the Master Fund.




Is Steben Select Multi-Strategy Fund a mutual fund? 
Back To Top


Steben Select Fund is not a mutual fund. It is a closed-end investment management company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Fund invests in the Master Fund, which allocates its assets among a number of hedge funds.




What are the fees of the investment?
Back To Top


Steben Select charges the following fees:

Management Fee: 1.25%
Operating Expenses: 0.45%
Servicing Fee: 0.25%
Early Withdrawal Fee: 2% within first 9 months (see #11 for more information)

In addition to the management fee, the Fund will also bear the management and incentive fees charged by the underlying hedge funds, estimated at 6.84% per year. This figure is estimated by incorporating actual historical management fees and fund expenses and by applying actual incentive fee rates to the realized fund performance as included in the audited financial statements (March 2017) for each of the Portfolio Funds in which the Master Fund intends to invest. Actual such amounts incurred by the Master Fund may be substantially higher or lower because the performance of the Portfolio Funds, and hence their incentive fees may fluctuate, and the Master Fund may invest in different Portfolio Funds from time to time. These fees are not subject to any fee cap or the operating expense agreement with the investment manager, Steben & Company.




What is Steben’s role in managing the fund of hedge funds allocations?
Back To Top


Steben is the Investment Manager and is responsible for the selection, due diligence and oversight of the hedge fund managers. Steben can increase or reduce the allocation to any of the hedge fund managers or hedge funds at any time and may withdraw from any of these funds or managers at any given time. Steben also oversees the delivery of performance reporting, regular fund updates, and tax reporting information.




What paperwork is required to invest in the Fund?
Back To Top


The Fund may only be sold to accredited investors, which are investors who meet certain minimum annual income or net worth thresholds. The Fund is speculative and an investment in the Fund involves substantial risks. Investors should be able to bear the loss of their investment.
Prior to investing in the Fund, all investors should carefully read the prospectus, after which, the investor application is to be completed and sent to US Bancorp along with the initial investment amount. Applications may be submitted to, and are received by, the Fund throughout any given month, but are accepted at the same time once per month. Investor applications should be received by the Fund 8 business days prior to month end. Cleared funds must be in the Fund’s account five business days prior (checks received 8 business days prior) to the last business day of the month.
All applications and related documents will be returned if not accepted. Checks should be made payable to “Steben Select Multi-Strategy Fund.”
Please see the Investor Application for contact instructions. 




Can I buy shares directly from the Fund?
Back To Top


An investor can invest directly with the Fund but we encourage investors to consult their financial advisor in order to determine if the Fund is suitable inside their investment portfolio.




How do I find out what my investment is worth on an ongoing basis?
Back To Top


Investors, through the Fund’s administrator, US Bancorp, will receive a monthly statement. In addition, investors in the Fund through a financial advisor with a custodian will receive the Fund’s estimated NAV on their monthly brokerage statements.
Steben intends to provide monthly performance commentary approximately 4 weeks after month end. Estimated performance should be available within a week of month end.




Why does Steben & Company's experience qualify them to manage the Fund?
Back To Top

Our flagship fund has operated continuously since 1990. Our deeply experienced research and risk management team is responsible for running the quantitative and qualitative screening process to cull the universe of potential managers down to the select few who we invest with.
