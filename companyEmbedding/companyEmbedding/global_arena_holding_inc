Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares.

(  OTC PINK :  GAHC ), (the "Company") announced today that the Company is in the process of making some significant adjustments that should be impactful to corporate operations; including timely filings, capital raising, acquisitions, partnerships and product development -- all contributing to the expansion and growth of its core business.The Company CEO, John Matthews, said, "Over the past six months, we have worked diligently to continue setting the foundation needed to assist with the growth of our Global Election Services, Inc. ("GES") subsidiary. We have devoted much attention to advancing relationships with those technologies we intend to employ; either through acquisition or partnership. We have also looked to make some tough corporate decisions we believe will ultimately better the Company's position."On Tuesday, June 14, 2016, the Company filed a FORM 8-K stating that a material change -- concerning its auditors -- had been made. The Company dismissed Wei, Wei & Co. LLP, and engaged the auditing services of Anton & Chia, LLP. Management indicated that the Company will now likely be able to file its financials shortly. This will bring the Company back to both "Current Filer" status with OTC Markets and compliant with the reporting requirements of the Securities & Exchange Commission.Mr. Matthews concluded, "Making a change to a long-time auditor is never a decision taken lightly nor an easy process. While taking this route caused obvious disruption to a timely filing, we are happy to put this piece behind us, and move forward to bigger and better things."We are very pleased to soon be able to share the results of our work on several important endeavors, which I can say with a fair amount of confidence, our achievements will inspire stronger shareholder confidence. We are truly enthusiastic about our future and believe we will far surpass our 2015 achievements."About Global Arena HoldingThe Company trades on the OTC Pink Sheets under the ticker symbol GAHC.
