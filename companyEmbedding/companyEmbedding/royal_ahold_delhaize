Misleading Climate Advertising Causes EU Legal Liabilities, Ferrero Wins Nutella Lawsuit Over Ahold Delhaize

As published by Chain Reaction Research, in June, Ferrero won an EU lawsuit in the Belgian National Court against Delhaize. Delhaize had run an advertising campaign stating that Nutella and other Ferrero products contained palm oil, regardless of Ferrero’s sustainable palm oil and Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) commitments. Since 2014, Ferrero has purchased only ‘segregated’ RSPO-certified palm oil. The term ‘segregated’ means that Ferrero’s palm oil supply chain is kept separate throughout the supply chain from any other palm oil. The court ruled that Delhaize’s campaign ran afoul EU law against misleading advertising.

Background – Palm Oil is Big Business
Palm oil is a staple of many consumer goods, biofuels, and plastic substitutes. It is found in about half of all packaged products purchased by Western consumers. Demand for palm oil has tripled over the past fifteen years. In 2016, global palm oil production was 58.3 million metric tons. Malaysia and Indonesia produced 85 percent of global supply. In 2016, palm oil production was a USD 65 billion market.
Oil palm trees yield about 4 to 5 metric tons of crude palm oil (CPO) and 0.5 metric tons of crude palm kernel oil (PKO) per hectare (ha) per year. Because oil palm production achieves a higher yield than other oilseeds, it is attractive for cultivation. This has made it the most actively traded vegetable oil globally.
At the same time, palm oil production is a key driver of both deforestation and peatlands clearance in Indonesia and Malaysia. These activities have major negative impacts including greenhouse gas emissions, public health risks, human rights violations, land grabbing, and result in irreversible biodiversity loss. Chain Reaction Research estimates suggest that at least ten percent of Indonesia’s land is under concession to palm oil estates which has resulted in about 3 percent of Indonesia’s oil palm estate to be potentially a stranded asset due supply and demand constraints associated with deforestation regulations by governments and voluntary commitments by corporations.
Voluntary Corporate Commitments
Companies have responded by working towards sustainable palm oil supply chains. Currently, according to Forest Trends, 277 companies globally have some type of public zero-deforestation commitment. In fact, the member companies of the The Consumer Goods Forum has made a voluntary commitment to achieve zero net deforestation by 2020.
Another example is the 2014 New York Declaration on Forests. In this declaration,  53 companies committed to “at least halve the rate of loss of natural forests globally by 2020 and strive to end natural forest loss by 2030” and “eliminat[e] deforestation from the production of agricultural commodities such as palm oil, soy, paper and beef products by no later than 2020”.
Standardizing Sustainability Terms Within Supply Chain Contracts
The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was established in 2004 with the objective of promoting the growth and use of sustainable oil palm products through credible global standards and engagement of stakeholders. 21 percent of global production of palm oil is RSPO-certified.
In 2017, RSPO-certified palm oil accounted for about 2.4 million ha (11.8 million metric tons), or 21 percent, of global palm oil production. RSPO has four certification systems. These are Identity Preserved, Segregated, Mass Balance, and Book & Claim.
There are also other palm oil sustainability certification mechanisms such as the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) system.
The key is RSPO-certified palm oil trades over-the-counter (OTC) with the term sheet used for the contract between corporate buyer and seller referencing the specific sustainability criteria of the underlying transacted palm oil asset.
The commitments that are written into conditions for term sheets place corporations at risk for not achieving their sustainability goals. For example, in June, Unilever suspended purchasing crude palm oil from Sawit Sumbermas Sarana (SSMS) because this supplier violated Unilever’s supply chain commitments. In Q1 2017, trade receivables to Unilever Oleochemicals Indonesia amounted to IDR 57.6 billion (USD 4.3 million) – a 41x increase over Q4 2016 trade receivables. With the suspension of this contract, SSMS lost a buyer that was equivalent to 8.4 percent of their 2016 revenue.
In summary, SSMS actions could have put Unilever at legal risk of their products subject claims of violating misleading advertising laws in the EU. This is because SSMS sold palm oil to Unilever whose origin may have violated Unilever’s Sustainable Palm Oil Sourcing Policy – 2016.
EU Legal Risks: Misleading Advertising Directive and UCPD
The EU has laws in place to prevent misleading advertisement by businesses. Companies making claims about their products’ main characteristics while supplying these products to consumers or traders in the EU should be aware that there is a legal risk if they do not comply with these claims. This could include environmental and sustainability claims.
ClientEarth’s April 2017 legal policy brief explains that, depending on the specific circumstances of the case, such companies could be held accountable under EU laws on misleading commercial practices.
In the EU, the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (Directive 2005/29/EC) (UCPD) and the Misleading Advertising Directive (Directive 2006/114/EC) aim to protect consumers and traders against misleading advertising.
The UCPD prohibits misleading commercial practices that deceive or are likely to deceive the average consumer in relation to, among other things, the geographical origin of a product and are likely to influence consumers’ purchasing decisions. According to the UCPD, a company could violate the directive if its provides false information, presents information about a product that is deceptive, omits material information about a product, and/or fails to comply with a code of conduct by which the company has undertaken to be bound.
For example, in 2011, the Market Court of Helsinki upheld a claim by a Consumer Ombudsman that a trader took advantage of the retail public when it “advertised the sale of bags of sweets by stating that for each bag sold, it would plant one tree. However, the trader had already agreed to plant a certain number of trees, independently from the number of candy bags sold.”
According to a brief by ClientEarth:
“(UCPD) guidance provided by the European Commission specifies that clarity and accuracy of an environmental claim is key:

Traders must present their environmental claims in a “specific, accurate and unambiguous manner”; and
Traders must be able to substantiate their factual claims with scientific evidence and provide it in an understandable way if challenged.”

This means that if a trader that has described their product as being compliant with a self-regulatory code, it is important that the product actually is compliant with the self-regulatory code – such as the RSPO. Non-compliance with a code of conduct could constitute a breach of the UCPD where the related claims are not merely aspirational, but are firm and capable of being verified.
Finally, the UCPD states that certain practices are prohibited. These prohibited practices are relevant to voluntary commitments:

Falsely claiming to be a signatory of a code of conduct (e.g. displaying that the company has signed up to a code of conduct relating to the product’s environmental credentials).
Displaying a trust or quality mark without the necessary authorisation (e.g. the RSPO certification logo).
Falsely claiming that a code of conduct has the endorsement of a public or other body.
Claiming that the

History[edit]
Ahold Delhaize was formed in July 2016 from the merger of Ahold and Delhaize Group.[5][6] Delhaize Group dates back to 1867, when the Delhaize brothers opened a wholesale grocery business in Charleroi, Belgium. Ahold traces its roots back to 1887, when Albert Heijn opened a first store in the Dutch town of Oostzaan.

In addition to Massachusetts, Ahold and Delhaize overlap in Maryland and Virginia, especially the hypercompetitive Richmond, VA market where Ahold’s Martin’s banner (ex-Ukrop’s) competes with Delhaize’s Food Lion for tops in market share.

Based on the companies' stock prices from closing time Tuesday, the combined corporation would have a market capitalization of $29.1 billion.The two European retailers confirmed merger talks back in May, but now it is official. And this merger is an effort to be stronger in the States, where competition has been stiff. Hans D'Haese, an analyst with Degroof, told The Wall Street Journal the deal is a "defensive move."Ahold and Delhaize may not be household names to all American shoppers, but both of them make more than half their revenues in the U.S.  Ahold, based in the Netherlands, operates the Stop & Shop and Giant chains, and online grocery store Peapod, while Belgium’s Delhaize owns the Food Lion and Hannaford banners, the Journal said.The new company will be one of the top five biggest food chains in the U.S.Ahold is the larger company, with some $33 billion in annual revenue to Delhaize's $21 billion, and so Ahold is the de facto lead in the deal. It gets first billing in the new name, Ahold Delhaize, and it is Ahold's CEO, Dick Boer, who will stay on as CEO of the new corporation.The new entity, Ahold-Delhaize, is reminiscent of other food mega-mergers in the last decade, such as Anheuser-Busch InBev, Kraft Heinz, or MillerCoors.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

Ahold and Delhaize Seal Merger Deal
Delhaize Group CEO Muller to serve as chief integration officer

June 24, 2015, 02:15 am



 



It's official: Ahold and Delhaize have signed off on a deal to combine their businesses through what the parties describe as "a merger of equals."
The new entity, Ahold Delhaize, will create one of the largest supermarket conglomerates operating in the U.S.create a base of more than 6,500 stores with 375,000 associates, which will be poised to serve roughly 50 million customers per week in the United States and in Europe.The transaction between the international retailer conglomerates, which is valued at $10.4 billion, is expected to be completed mid-2016, following customary regulatory clearances and shareholder approval.
The all-stock deal will capitalize on the strong heritage and values of both companies, as well as complementary cultures, neighboring geographies, and the impact of combining successful sustainability programs.
The new leadership structure includes:

Mats Jansson, chairman of Delhaize Group = Ahold Delhaize chairman
Jan Hommen, chairman of Royal Ahold, and Jacques de Vaucleroy, Delhaize group director = vice chairmen
Dick Boer, CEO of Royal Ahold = CEO
Frans Muller, Delhaize Group CEO = simultaneous roles as deputy chief executive officer and chief integration officer
Current chief operating officers of Delhaize America and Ahold USA, Kevin Holt and James McCann, respectively, will remain in place

The transaction will deliver anticipated run-rate synergies of €500 million per year to be fully realized in the third year after completion; Ahold and Delhaize reported aggregated net sales of €54.1 billion (US $60.5 billion), adjusted EBITDA of €3.5 billion (US $3.9 billion), net income from continued operations of €1 billion (US $1.12 billion) and free cash flow of €1.8 billion (US $2 billion) in 2014.
Ahold will terminate its ongoing share buyback program; €1 billion (US $1.12 billion) will be returned to Ahold shareholders via a capital return and a reverse stock split prior to completion of the transaction.
At completion, Delhaize shareholders will receive 4.75 Ahold ordinary shares for each Delhaize ordinary share. Ahold shareholders will own 61 percent of the combined company's equity and Delhaize shareholders will own 39 percent of the combined company's equity.
Jan Hommen, Chairman of Ahold, and Mats Jansson, Chairman of Delhaize, said: "This is a true merger of equals, combining two highly complementary businesses to create a world-leading food retailer. The transaction delivers a compelling value proposition for our shareholders, a superior offering for our customers and attractive opportunities for our associates."
Frans Muller, CEO of Delhaize, said: "We believe that the proposed merger of Ahold and Delhaize will create significant value for all our stakeholders. Supported by our talented and committed associates, Ahold Delhaize aims to increase relevance in its local communities by improving the value proposition for its customers through assortment innovation and merchandising, a better shopping experience both in stores and online, investments in value, and new store growth. We look forward to working closely with the Ahold team to implement a smooth integration process and realize the targeted synergies."
Dick Boer, CEO of Ahold, said: "The proposed merger with Delhaize is an exciting opportunity to create an even stronger and more innovative retail leader for our customers, associates and shareholders worldwide. With extraordinary reach, diverse products and formats, and great people, we are bringing together two world-class organizations to deliver even more for the communities we serve. Our companies share common values, proud histories rooted in family entrepreneurship, and businesses that complement each other well. We look forward to working together to reach new levels of service and success."

Company Press Release
Ahold USA and Delhaize America, proud companies of Royal Ahold Delhaize, are each announcing plans to further strengthen their brands to ensure they will remain customer-focused, close to their communities and positioned to win in their markets. This follows the merger of Ahold and Delhaize Group on July 24, 2016, which created the largest grocery retailer group on the United States East Coast, and furthers its strategy centered on building great local brands while capturing the benefits of scale. 
As part of this strategy, Ahold USA and Delhaize America in December announced the creation of Retail Business Services LLC, led by Roger Wheeler, President. Retail Business Services will leverage its scale to drive synergies and best practices as well as provide industry-leading expertise, insights and analytics to the Ahold USA brands and Delhaize America brands to support their respective strategies. Services provided by Retail Business Services, in addition to commercial support, will include financial services, not-for-resale procurement, legal services, information technology, and people systems and services. 
With the creation of Retail Business Services, the Stop & Shop, Giant Foods, GIANT/MARTIN’S, Peapod, Food Lion and Hannaford brands will be able to dedicate full focus on building on their leading positions in their respective markets and delivering even more for their customers. Each of the brands will have distinctive commercial strategies that are tailored to local markets with dedicated resources, including category merchandising, assortment, pricing, promotions, marketing and format teams. This brand-centric structure, which we expect to be complete by early 2018, will better position the Ahold USA brands and Delhaize America brands to be even more closely connected to their customers and communities. 
“Positioning the Ahold USA brands to be even closer to their customers will not only help them deepen their connection in their local communities and win in their markets, it will ensure that associates have exciting and rewarding opportunities to make meaningful contributions to each brand’s success,” said Kevin Holt, chief operating officer of Ahold USA. 
“Today’s announcements will further strengthen Food Lion and Hannaford’s strong brands,” said Frans Muller, acting chief operating officer (ad interim) of Delhaize America. “The brand-centric structure will enable our Food Lion and Hannaford associates to build even stronger relationships with existing customers and communities in the markets they serve, and win new customers to grow their businesses.” 
Ahold USA also announced that its Stop & Shop New York Metro and Stop & Shop New England Divisions will be consolidated into one brand organization. Having a single brand organizational structure dedicated to Stop & Shop will strengthen the brand and will ensure it can better leverage its brand to serve the unique needs of customers in the different markets that Stop & Shop serves.
Delhaize America and Ahold USA brands will maintain their respective office locations in: 
• Stop & Shop, Quincy, Mass. 
• Food Lion, Salisbury, N.C. 
• GIANT/MARTIN’S, Carlisle, Penn. 
• Hannaford, Scarborough, Maine 
• Giant Food, Landover, Md. 
• Peapod, Skokie, Ill. 
Ahold USA brands and Delhaize America brands that have regional support offices now will continue to have brand support offices throughout their market areas. 
In addition, Holt announced the following Ahold USA brand executive leaders will continue in their roles: 
• Mark McGowan, President, Stop & Shop 
• Tom Lenkevich, President, GIANT/MARTIN’S 
• Gordon Reid, President, Giant Food 
• Jennifer Carr-Smith, President, Peapod 
“I’m very excited about the brand-centric model at Ahold USA and its brands, which puts the customer at the center of all we do,” said Holt. “Mark, Tom, Gordon and Jennifer all have proven track records and they are the right leaders for our great local brands.” 
Muller announced the following Delhaize America brand executive leaders will also continue in their roles: 
• Meg Ham, President, Food Lion 
• Mike Vail, President, Hannaford 
“I am extremely pleased that Meg and Mike will continue to lead and drive the successful strategies of Food Lion and Hannaford,” said Muller. “We have every confidence in the continued success of Food Lion and Hannaford under their leadership.” 
In addition, the following executive appointments in the U.S. will become effective when the brand-centric organization is complete, which is expected by early 2018: 
• Reporting to Royal Ahold Delhaize: 
o Greg Amoroso, Executive Vice President, U.S. Chief Financial Officer 
o Linn Evans, Executive Vice President, U.S. Chief Legal Officer 
• Reporting to Retail Business Services: 
o Kathy Russello, Executive Vice President, People Systems and Services 
o JJ Fleeman, Executive Vice President, Commercial Services & Strategy 
o Chris Lewis, Executive Vice President, Supply Chain 
o Paul Scorza, Executive Vice President, Chief Information Officer 
The Ahold USA brands and Delhaize America brands will continue to operate as independent companies in the U.S. and will continue to serve their local customers’ needs and be strong community partners in their respective markets.

			Ahold And Delhaize Agree On Merger

Koninklijke Ahold N.V. and the Delhaize Group announced that they are moving on their “merger of equals” initiative to create a company with more than 6,500 stores globally, including a large number in the eastern United States. The resulting combination, Ahold Delhaize, will serve over 50 million customers per week in the United States and Europe.
Reports value the merger deal at $28 billion, with Ahold taking a 61% stake in the new company.
Mats Jansson, Delhaize Group chairman, will become chairman of Ahold Delhaize. Jan Hommen, chairman of Royal Ahold, and Jacques de Vaucleroy, Delhaize group director, will become vice chairmen of the combined company.
Dick Boer, CEO of the Royal Ahold business, will take the same title in the combined company. Frans Muller, Delhaize Group CEO, will become deputy CEO and chief integration officer of the new entity.
The companies, which combined should generate about €54 billion, or about $60 billion, in sales, asserted that the transaction will create significant value, with anticipated run-rate synergies of €500 million, or almost $600 million, per year to be fully realized in the third year after merger completion. They added that both companies are highly cash generative, which should allow Ahold Delhaize to invest in future growth and deliver attractive shareholder returns.
At the end of March, the Belgium-based Delhaize Group operated 3,410 stores globally. In 2014, Delhaize Group posted $29.4 billion in revenues. In the United States, it operates the Food Lion and Hannaford supermarket chains totaling just over 1,300 stores.
Netherlands-based Ahold posted sales of about $36.9 billion in 2014. It operates 3,026 stores worldwide including, in the U.S., Stop & Shop, Giant Food, Giant Food Stores, Martin’s Food Markets, and online grocer Peapod. Its U.S. operation includes 770 stores and 210 product pick-up points.
