					Full Description



Hoegh LNG Partners LP, incorporated on April 28, 2014, owns, operates and acquires floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs), liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers and other LNG infrastructure assets under long-term charters. The Company's segments include Majority held FSRUs, Joint venture FSRUs and other. The Majority held FSRUs segment includes the direct financing lease related to the PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk (PGN) FSRU Lampung and the operating lease related to the Hoegh Gallant. The Joint venture FSRUs segment includes approximately two FSRUs, including the GDF Suez LNG Supply S.A. (GDF Suez) Neptune and the GDF Suez Cape Ann, which operate under long term time charters. The Company intends to acquire newbuilding FSRUs on long-term charters, rather than FSRUs based on retrofitted, first-generation LNG carriers.GDF Suez Neptune and GDF Suez Cape Ann have a storage capacity of approximately 145,000 cubic meters and a maximum send-out capacity of over 750 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscf/d) of regasified LNG, each. The PGN FSRU Lampung is located offshore in the Lampung province at the southeast coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The PGN FSRU Lampung has a storage capacity of approximately 170,000 cubic meters of LNG and a maximum send-out capacity of over 360 MMscf/d of regasified LNG via subsea and onshore pipelines connecting to the existing grid in south Sumatra. The FSRU Hoegh Gallant operates as an LNG import terminal at Ain Sokhna port, located on the Red Sea in Egypt. The Hoegh Gallant has a storage capacity of approximately 170,000 cubic meters of LNG and a maximum send-out capacity of over 550 MMscf/d of regasified LNG. Each of the GDF Suez Neptune, the GDF Suez Cape Ann, the PGN FSRU Lampung and the Hoegh Gallant has a reinforced membrane-type cargo containment system that facilitates offshore loading operations.The Company's FSRUs have high-pressure cryogenic pumps, vaporizers, dual-fuel diesel electric propulsion plant, mooring system and gas export system. Each of the GDF Suez Neptune and the GDF Suez Cape Ann is equipped with a submerged turret loading (STL) offshore mooring system, and can also be moored to a jetty. The PGN FSRU Lampung is equipped for mooring to a tower yoke. The PGN FSRU Lampung has an export pipeline on her bow, which is connected via jumper hoses to the tower yoke. The GDF Suez Cape Ann and GDF Suez Neptune have an STL buoy system, and have also been retrofitted with high-pressure gas manifold on the side, which can be connected to loading arms on a jetty. Each of the GDF Suez Neptune and the GDF Suez Cape Ann has a closed-loop regasification system, where heat for vaporization is generated by steam boilers. The PGN FSRU Lampung and the Hoegh Gallant have open-loop regasification systems, where heat for vaporization is generated by pumping sea water.The Company competes with BW Maritime Pte. Ltd., Dynagas LNG Partners LP, Excelerate Energy L.P., Exmar NV, GasLog Ltd., GasLog Partners LP, Golar LNG Limited, Golar LNG Partners LP, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd, OLT and Teekay LNG Partners L.P.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
