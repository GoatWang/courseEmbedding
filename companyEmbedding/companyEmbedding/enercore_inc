Company Overview




Ener-Core, Inc. designs and manufactures innovative systems for producing continuous energy from a broad range of sources, including previously unusable ultra-low quality gas.  The Ener-Core Power Oxidizer, our patented oxidation technology, enables the conversion of these gases into useful heat and power with the lowest known associated emissions. With the Ener-Core Power Oxidizer matched to gas turbines, Ener-Core offers systems with fuel flexibility and pollution control for power generation. The Power Oxidizer can also be customized for integration with larger existing power generation systems to offer unparalleled pollution control and achieve zero emissions.
Ener-Core has developed the Power Oxidizer 250 KW (EC250) Powerstation, the Power Oxidizer 333 KW (EC333) Powerstation and its larger counterpart, the Power Oxidizer 2 MW (KG2-3GEF/PO) Powerstation, to transform methane gas, especially "ultra-low Btu gas" from landfills, coal mines, oil fields and other low quality methane sources into continuous clean electricity with near-zero emissions. The Powerstations are specifically engineered for fuel flexibility and modularity, so that these low-Btu gas sources can be used as an energy resource instead of wasted through venting and/or flaring.
With dedication, deep expertise, and broad energy experience, Ener-Core serves several markets globally, including oil fields, biogas, coal mines, natural gas, emissions control, and utility power generation.

Ener-Core, Inc. Completes Merger Transaction With Ener-Core Power, Inc.

Jul 01, 2013, 17:32 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Ener-Core, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


IRVINE, Calif., July 1, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Ener-Core, Inc. (OTCBB: ENCR; the "Company"), announced today that it completed a merger transaction with Ener-Core Power, Inc. (f/k/a Flex Power Generation, Inc.) that had been disclosed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in April and May.  Common stock of the combined company will continue to be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and the OTC Market Group Inc.'s OTCQB tier under the symbol "ENCR."  In connection with the closing of the merger transaction, the Company received the $4.0 million in equity financing that was a condition to the closing.
The Company designs, develops, and manufactures gradual oxidizer products and technologies that aim to expand power generation into previously uneconomical markets, while at the same time reducing the emissions of gases produced from industrial processes that contribute to air pollution and climate change.
Dr. Boris Maslov, Ener-Core's President stated, "We are pleased to be in the public markets and look forward to enhancing the value of our company for all of our stockholders – old and new.  All of us at Ener-Core intend to expand our company's business horizons in a meaningful manner.  We believe that our Gradual Oxidation products and technology provides a unique value proposition in that it not only allows for the extraction of energy from previously unusable low energy fuels, while, at the same time, significantly reducing harmful pollutants and creating useful energy products such as heat and electricity."
Dr. Maslov concluded, "We believe that our customers can greatly reduce the cost of compliance with air quality regulations by avoiding the chemicals, catalysts, and complex permitting required by competitive systems."
The Company will be releasing full details of the merger transaction and the related financing on July 8, 2013.

The $75 Billion Market Opportunity in energy and the environment


 



The Untapped Market Opened by Ener-Core Oxidizer Technology
The scale of this opportunity is vast and critical to addressing the biggest culprit in the battle against climate change – methane.  We are eliminating the 2nd worst contributor to climate change and using it to generate clean energy. The EPA reports that 480 billion cubic meters of gases are released into the atmosphere each year, either through flaring or venting.   These gases represent up to 65,000 MW of local clean energy that could power 65‐80 million homes. Because standard combustion technologies don’t work on these low quality gases, this potential energy source is burned away. Companies, industries and governments are literally burning money away. With the Ener-Core oxidizer technology, the limits are removed – opening up a new untapped clean energy resource with a large market opportunity. The world can now eliminate the 2nd worst contributor to climate change and use it to generate clean energy. These waste gases exist worldwide in industrialized nations, developing countries and emerging markets.  Each of these regions generates harmful gases from landfills, coalmines, industrial facilities, chemical plants, refineries, and oil & gas fields.  Given rapid growth and development of emerging economies, market growth is nearly unlimited.   Ener-Core and its partners have estimated the total market size for its equipment at approximately $75 Billion.

The Ener-Core Power Oxidizer Technology


 



About The Ener-Core Power Oxidizer
The Ener-Core Power Oxidizer extends a historical trend in engine technology seeking to improve emissions and expand the fuel operating range. We believe that our approach provides unique value proposition, allows for the extraction of energy from previously unusable fuels, significantly reduces harmful pollutants, and creates useful energy products such as heat and electricity. The Ener-Core Power Oxidizer has been designed to provide the following features and benefits:
Economic:

Turns waste fuel into a resource:  generate power from generally unusable gas sources.
Designed to operate on a much wider range of fuels. When configured for low-quality fuels, our systems are designed to operate on gas with concentration as low as 50 Btu/scf (1700 kJ/m3). By comparison, most turbine, engine, and fuel cell systems require fuel quality of significantly higher concentration.
Flexible, configurable design; High pressure fuel injection for  extremely low emissions, and Low pressure aspiration for use of lowest quality gas.

Environmental:

Substantially lower air emissions. Particularly when configured for ultra-low emissions, our Power Oxidizer technology may produce substantially lower emissions of NOx, CO, and VOCs than competitive systems.
Designed to achieve Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) for several major air pollutants (NOx , CO, VOC, PM2.5) in non-attainment areas.

Operational:

No chemicals or catalysts used (no urea or ammonia) for emissions control. Unlike other emissions control systems such as selective catalytic reduction, our Power Oxidizer does not use chemicals or catalysts and thus cannot be rendered inactive from catalyst poisoning.
Mechanically simple: No actuating parts.
Little or no fuel conditioning may be required. When configured for low-quality fuels, our systems are designed to require minimal fuel pre-treatment or conditioning.  When configured for ultra-low emissions, we may require some additional fuel conditioning.  However, regardless of configuration, our systems are designed to require substantially less fuel pre-treatment than competitive systems.


 
 
 
 





Potential Applications Of The Ener-Core Power Oxidizer Technology
Process industries typically produce a broad range of low quality waste gases that cannot be processed by a combustion-based engine or turbine. As a result, these gases are burned off through flaring. They contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and are targeted by environmental organizations and governments.  Below are just some of the many solution opportunities for the Ener-Core oxidizer technology.

The Science Behind The Power Oxidizer
Ener-Core’s Power Oxidizer works by replacing a combustion reaction with a chemically similar, but slower chemical oxidation reaction that occurs at lower temperatures than combustion. Our approach provides a unique and unparalleled value proposition, allowing for the extraction of energy from previously unusable fuels, significantly reducing harmful pollutants, and creating useful energy products.
		 
 
 






 

 
 


 
 


			Oxidation occurs when a substance comes into contact with oxygen molecules–almost everything, over time, reacts with oxygen. Oxidation is typically a very slow process. For example, vented methane oxidized with atmospheric oxygen at very low concentrations. Over the course of many years, methane oxidation eventually results in CO2 and H2O. The Ener-Core Power Oxidizer is designed to control the oxidation process so that the reaction time and heat release are high enough to power a gas turbine, while the associated temperature remains low enough to avoid the formation of NOx. The Power Oxidizer is engineered to precisely control the gas feed rate to maintain temperature control needed to continuously power the gas turbine generator.
		 
 
 


Fuel Flexibility
Ener-Core’s patented Power Oxidizer is engineered to operate on lower quality gases that conventional reciprocating engines and gas turbines cannot. This enables the Oxidizer to overcome the acoustic and stability limitations associated with traditional technologies and provide solutions for customers intending to generate energy from low-Btu fuels, including previously unusable gases that are typically vented or flared.
		 
 
 


 
 


Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Destruction
The Ener-Core Power Oxidizer is engineered to achieve Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) for several major air pollutants (NOx, CO, VOC, PM2.5) in non-attainment areas, with the potential to become Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for these pollutants in attainment areas.
Ener-Core’s patented Power Oxidation technology is designed to control the conversion of fuel gas so that useful heat is released without the typical air pollution related to combustion. The unique design is intended to avoid NOx formation. In ultra-low emissions configuration, CO and VOCs are destroyed from the long residence time at the oxidizer operating temperature.
The Ener-Core Powerstation has the potential to greatly reduce emissions profiles, simplifying compliance and easing permitting in even the most stringent air quality regions.
The Ener-Core Power Oxidizer may benefit natural gas cogeneration systems, emissions controls, and mainstream large utility power generation from natural gas and distillates. The Power Oxidizer is designed to offer unparalleled pollution control and achieve extremely low emissions when integrated with larger existing power generation systems.
		 
 
 
 





The Ener-Core Powerstations
Ener-Core designs and manufactures innovative systems for producing continuous energy from a broad range of sources, including previously unusable ultra-low quality gas. When paired with gas turbines, the patented Ener-Core Power Oxidizer and associated oxidation process enables the conversion of these gases into useful heat and power with the lowest known associated emissions.
		 
 
 


 

 
 


 
 

 
 

Power Oxidizer 2 MW (KG2-3GEF/PO) Powerstation
