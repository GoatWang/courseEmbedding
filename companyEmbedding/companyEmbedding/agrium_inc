Wholesale


Without fertilizer, we could only produce about half as much food as we do today. As one of the largest global distributors of fertilizer, we have the capacity to produce and market about 10 million tonnes of nitrogen, phosphate and potash – to help growers worldwide increase the quality and quantity of their crops to feed the world.






 








Nitrogen is crucial to plant nourishment and fundamental to life on the planet. It is a key component of chlorophyll, which gives plants their bright green color.









Phosphate stimulates root development and flowering and encourages early crop development.









Potash is required by crops to regulate growth processes, activate enzymes involved in plant growth and help protect against drought and disease.

Fertilizer






Agrium's fertilizer products provide growers with the essential nutrients they need to make their crops thrive  – so they can produce more high-quality food to meet the growing global demand. Through our Wholesale unit, we produce and market nitrogen, phosphate, potash and sulfate-based crop nutrients. The amount of each nutrient needed to optimize yields depends on the type of soil, the crop being grown, weather conditions and the previous year’s yield.

Industrial






Our Nitrogen, Phosphate and Potash crop nutrients are primarily used for agricultural purposes, but approximately 14 percent of these sales go to industrial applications. There's a good chance your kitchen cabinets contain a urea resin. The pulp and paper industry uses phosphates and nitrogens as nutrients in wastewater treatment. And hockey arena ice is often made with ammonia as part of the refrigerant.
The majority of our industrial sales volumes come from nitrogen products — primarily ammonia, urea, ammonium nitrate and aqua ammonia — that are produced at our North American nitrogen facilities and sold in Canada and the U.S.

Business units[edit]
Agrium operates in two business segments:
Retail[edit]
Agrium operates close to 1,500 retail agricultural centres in the U.S., Canada, South America and Australia under the brand names Crop Production Services (CPS), Crop Production Services Canada (CPSC), Agroservicios Pampeanos S.A. and Landmark.[4] Crop Production Services was acquired in 1994.
On December 3, 2010 Agrium announced the completion of the acquisition of the Australian Wheat Board for a total acquisition price of $1.236-billion Australian dollars.[5] This acquisition additions to the retail division of Agrium. Roughly 40% of the AWB holdings were sold to Cargill including the Commodity Management Business.[6]
In October 2013, Agrium announced the acquisition of Viterra’s Canadian retail assets,[7] after previously acquiring Viterra retail locations in Australia.[8]
Wholesale[edit]
The Wholesale segment produces nitrogen, phosphate, potash and sulphur-based fertilizers. This segment also owns and operates a potash mine and production facility in the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No. 345 in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a phosphate mine in Conda, Idaho, U.S.
The Wholesale segment engages in the ownership of nitrogen-based fertilizer plants in Bahía Blanca, Argentina and in Damietta, Egypt.
Agrium and Saskatoon-based Potashcorp announced their merger on September 12, 2016. The new company will be headquartered in Saskatoon.[9] The merged company will be renamed as Nutrien.[10]
Environmental and social impacts[edit]
In 2006 the U.S. EPA fined[11] Agrium US$750,000 for violations of the Clean Air Act. Unpermitted modifications to the Ohio nitrogen products plant resulted in excessive releases of NOx. The US EPA report states that these nitrogen oxides "cause severe respiratory problems, contribute to childhood asthma, acid rain, climate change, smog and haze, and impairs visibility in national parks. Emissions from nitric acid plants can be carried significant distances downwind, causing air quality problems..." The plant in question was acquired in October 2006 during the takeover of Royster Clark.
In 2003 Agrium was issued an administrative compliance order for excessive emissions at a Kennewick, Washington plant.[12] Agrium discovered the violations at the Kennewick facility through a comprehensive Clean Air Act audit of the facility in late 2000. Agrium promptly reported the audit findings to EPA under EPA’s policy on Incentives for Self-Policing, also referred to as the "Self-Disclosure Policy". In 2005 Agrium was fined for failure to disclose release of toxic gases at this same plant.[13]
An Agrium ammonia/urea plant is listed by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation as a contaminated site due to spillage of ammonia, arsenic, and other contaminants.[14]

Agrium Inc. is a major retail supplier of agricultural products and services in North America, South America and Australia and a wholesale producer and marketer of all three major agricultural nutrients and a supplier of specialty fertilizers in North America.
Agrium was founded as Cominco Fertilizers, Limited (short for Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company Limited [2]) in 1931 and changed its name to Agrium, Incorporated in 1995. Agrium is headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Crop Production Services, Inc., a subsidiary company, is based in Loveland, Colorado and is the location of Agrium's Retail Business Unit head office. The company is a part-owner of Canpotex, which manages all potash exporting from Saskatchewan.[3]

Business units[edit]
Agrium operates in two business segments:
Retail[edit]
Agrium operates close to 1,500 retail agricultural centres in the U.S., Canada, South America and Australia under the brand names Crop Production Services (CPS), Crop Production Services Canada (CPSC), Agroservicios Pampeanos S.A. and Landmark.[4] Crop Production Services was acquired in 1994.
On December 3, 2010 Agrium announced the completion of the acquisition of the Australian Wheat Board for a total acquisition price of $1.236-billion Australian dollars.[5] This acquisition additions to the retail division of Agrium. Roughly 40% of the AWB holdings were sold to Cargill including the Commodity Management Business.[6]
In October 2013, Agrium announced the acquisition of Viterra’s Canadian retail assets,[7] after previously acquiring Viterra retail locations in Australia.[8]
Wholesale[edit]
The Wholesale segment produces nitrogen, phosphate, potash and sulphur-based fertilizers. This segment also owns and operates a potash mine and production facility in the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No. 345 in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a phosphate mine in Conda, Idaho, U.S.
The Wholesale segment engages in the ownership of nitrogen-based fertilizer plants in Bahía Blanca, Argentina and in Damietta, Egypt.
Agrium and Saskatoon-based Potashcorp announced their merger on September 12, 2016. The new company will be headquartered in Saskatoon.[9] The merged company will be renamed as Nutrien.[10]
Environmental and social impacts[edit]
In 2006 the U.S. EPA fined[11] Agrium US$750,000 for violations of the Clean Air Act. Unpermitted modifications to the Ohio nitrogen products plant resulted in excessive releases of NOx. The US EPA report states that these nitrogen oxides "cause severe respiratory problems, contribute to childhood asthma, acid rain, climate change, smog and haze, and impairs visibility in national parks. Emissions from nitric acid plants can be carried significant distances downwind, causing air quality problems..." The plant in question was acquired in October 2006 during the takeover of Royster Clark.
In 2003 Agrium was issued an administrative compliance order for excessive emissions at a Kennewick, Washington plant.[12] Agrium discovered the violations at the Kennewick facility through a comprehensive Clean Air Act audit of the facility in late 2000. Agrium promptly reported the audit findings to EPA under EPA’s policy on Incentives for Self-Policing, also referred to as the "Self-Disclosure Policy". In 2005 Agrium was fined for failure to disclose release of toxic gases at this same plant.[13]
An Agrium ammonia/urea plant is listed by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation as a contaminated site due to spillage of ammonia, arsenic, and other contaminants.[14]

Agrium Inc.’s (AGU  -  Free Report)	 subsidiary, Loveland Products, Inc. has announced the completion of the acquisition of Starpharma Holdings Limited's agrochemical business for $35 million. The acquired business is focused on developing its proprietary Priostar dendrimer polymer technology portfolio.The transaction includes assets such as key intellectual property and a small number of dedicated staff based in Melbourne, Australia which will support Agrium's innovation and technology strategy.With this acquisition, Priostar dendrimer polymer technology’s continued development and commercialization will take place across a broad base of Loveland Products' crop protection and specialty nutrition products. The acquisition will improve product performance and further enhance Agrium Retail's full solutions offering to farmers.The Priostar technology will provide a host of benefits. It provides better weed control capabilities, formulation stability and reduced environmental impacts. Agrium is well placed to commercialize this technology across 1,500 ag-retail centers, which caters to numerous growers in key agricultural markets globally.Agrium has outperformed the Zacks categorized Fertilizers industry over the last one year. The company’s shares have moved up around 1.8% over this period, compared with roughly 0.4% gain recorded by the industry.Agrium provided its earnings guidance for the first half of 2017 in the range of $3.75–$4.25 per share. The outlook for annual earnings was also narrowed to the range of $4.75–$5.75 per share from previous expectations of $4.50–$6.00, owing to about $200 million variability in EBITDA. Agrium's expects potash production between 2.4 million and 2.8 million tons in 2017.Agrium is likely to benefit from strategic acquisitions, capacity expansion and cost reduction actions. The proposed merger with Potash Corp. should also create significant cost and operational synergies.However, Agrium is still reeling under the effects of the depressed prices of crop nutrients which is expected to continue to weigh on its sales and earnings. Nitrogen and potash prices also remain under pressure. The crop pricing environment is also expected to remain soft in the near term. The company also faces challenging agriculture market fundamentals.Agrium Inc. Price and Consensus Agrium Inc. Price and Consensus | Agrium Inc.

LOVELAND, Colo., Aug. 26, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --  Loveland Products, a subsidiary of Agrium and a leading global provider of high-performance crop input products and proprietary products provider for Agrium Retail globally, today announced that the company has acquired a controlling interest in Agricen, a Dallas-area agricultural biotechnology company delivering biochemical-based products for efficient and sustainable plant nutrition. Agricen manufactures two of Loveland Products' fastest growing plant nutrition brands, Accomplish® LM and Titan® PBA, which are biologically derived products designed to enhance fertilizer efficiency. Agricen will operate as a Loveland Products subsidiary under its present name. Loveland Products has also acquired an interest in Agricen's sister company, Agricen Sciences, an applied sciences research company developing novel microbial and biochemical solutions for plant health and nutrition. 
"These strategic investments are the initial steps in the extension of our long-term strategy for the discovery and commercialization of next-generation technologies that enhance plant health and improve crop productivity," said Brent Smith, Vice President, Loveland Products. "We have a long history of working with Agricen and Agricen Sciences, so this is a natural place to begin a new, concerted effort to deliver innovative and sustainable plant health technologies that complement conventional growing practices around the world."
Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Smith will take on the role of Chairman of the Board of Agricen, and will serve on the Board of Agricen Sciences. Jeff Tarsi, Vice President of Strategy and International Retail for Crop Production Services will also join the Agricen Board. Loveland Products is the proprietary products provider for all of Agrium Retail in North America, Australia and South America, including Crop Production Services. Financial terms of the deals were not disclosed. 
"By combining Loveland Products' extensive reach in the agriculture industry with Agricen's and Agricen Sciences' history in agricultural biologicals, we have a significant opportunity to create value for growers with next-generation agricultural tools that complement and enhance existing plant nutrition practices," said Michael Totora, President and CEO of Agricen.
Loveland Products provides innovative input solutions to growers across more than 40 countries and is a part of publicly traded Agrium Inc. (TSX and NYSE:   AGU), a global crop input and agricultural services provider. Loveland Products and Agricen (then Advanced Microbial Solutions) had previously entered a strategic partnership agreement in 2012, which gave Loveland an ownership position in Agricen, as well as exclusive, worldwide distribution rights to existing Agricen technology and access to an integrated pipeline of new product and technology opportunities.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
