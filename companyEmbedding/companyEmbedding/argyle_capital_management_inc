Principal Investing

Our standard mandate is to partner with experienced management
teams
and corporations in industries and/or geographic markets where our
principals have extensive experience. All investments leverage our core
expertise, where we can source key intellectual capital to further our
returns.





Past transactions have, in general, taken the form of pooled
investments with select corporate and strategic partners. In such
situations, Argyle is typically a minority equity partner in a local,
country-specific joint venture. By blending the strength of our
corporate/strategic partners’ existing infrastructure and
best
practices with our local network and expertise, we are able to maximize
the probability of success of each investment.

 Josh Rudoy receives 2014 Los Angeles 5 Star Wealth Manager Award

"The recognition can be found in the February 2015 issue of Los Angeles Magazine"



 Adam Scott & Michael B. Allmon, Financing the Future
11/11/2014






"Retirement planning is a moving target in many ways. We depend on more assumptions than would ever be acceptable for a NASA engineer signing off on a multi-billion dollar rocket launch."



Argyle Capital Partners Featured in Research Magazine:  "What’s Propelling the RIA Surge?"
10/03/2014






"The RIA channel continues to surge-but what is most notable are the new entrants to the space. It's not just top-dollar breakaway brokers who are driving the trend but Gen Y advisors who see opportunity in a structure where they can be most nimble."

Adam Scott & Michael B. Allmon, Financing the Future

“Reverse engineering is another way of saying, “working backwards,” a process that can be effective when solving a crime, finding out what’s causing a health problem or locating a missing airplane. But sometimes we don’t have the luxury of looking backwards.”



Adam Scott, on Parting Ways with Clients
3/13/2013






“Clients can do whatever they want with their money--it's theirs after all. But when a client is ignoring advice from their adviser, and it becomes apparent that they're doing so to their detriment, in some cases it becomes necessary to terminate the relationship.”

NYTimes: Argyle Capital Partners profiled in “The Death of Equities Seems Exaggerated,”
11/13/2012





“So for all the talk that Wall Street chicanery or the market’s gyrations have killed investors’ appetite for equities, Americans’ commitment to stocks has been remarkably strong.
“If your time frame is 10 years or more,” said Adam B. Scott, founder of Argyle Capital Partners, a financial adviser in Los Angeles, “you’re better off in stocks.”



Dow Jones: Argyle Capital Partners profiled in “When a Client Balks at a New Fee Structure,”
9/19/2012






“Adam Scott and Josh Rudoy are experienced financial advisers and longtime colleagues who had discussed starting their own firm for years…..”
“The transition introduced one big change for clients. The new firm used a fee-only rate structure, which Mr. Scott and Mr. Rudoy thought would be an easy sell. The payment model offered significantly lower fees for many clients, compared with a commission-based fee structure. But the pair were surprised when one of their first, and biggest, clients balked at the proposal.”

The Rub of a Record-Low VIX

Posted on May 10, 2017 


Tweet

This article was also published on RealMoney at 3:00pm EDT on May 10th, 2017
We last posted here in February on the topic of euphoria, or at the very least excessive complacency. The S&P 500 was about 2,330 and the Dow about 20,500 at the time. Both indices are about 2.5% higher today, and the headlines du jour concern the record-low readings we are seeing in the VIX—the “fear index,” which measures market expectations for volatility on a 30 day forward-looking basis. The VIX is something that gets mentioned a lot at extremes, both low and high.
It is common for the VIX to rise above 20 when the market is in the midst of a typical correction. A reading of 30 or higher implies a great deal of uncertainty, and therefore rising option premiums on the S&P 500. Once you get into the 40+ range, it’s safe to assume we are closing in on the bottom of a massive correction. For some context, we got into the 80s in October of 2008 and the VIX remained above 40 until April of 2009. We all remember what was happening then….
Below is a chart of the VIX going back three years:

We are below 10 on the VIX as of yesterday’s close (9.97). A single digit VIX reading is very rare. And while many market pundits are pointing to data sets which show that a high VIX is a much more reliable indicator—meaning, a high VIX reading can reliably provide for good (low) entry points for buying stocks, but a low VIX reading does not necessarily mean a market drop is around the corner.
One thing a low VIX almost certainly doesn’t mean, however, is that large gains should be expected for the broad indices. In fact, we’ve had a sub-10 reading on the VIX on nine separate occasions since 1990. Every single one was followed by negative returns for the S&P 500 over the subsequent 12 months. You can read more about that here.
Many are speculating as to the reason for the persistently low level of volatility, especially given the current geopolitical risks in plain sight, the Federal Reserve’s newfound comfort level with raising short-term interest rates, and continued uncertainty about everything Eurozone. Explanations range from the increased popularity of “Passive investing” via index funds & ETFs; the ability for Hedge Funds to get stock market exposure by shorting volatility—via the VIX itself or other VIX-related products—since the two tend to move opposite one another; and I’ve even heard some people argue that there are simply no headwinds to the market now and that we are in the early innings of an expansion.
What I know is that the small caps (IWM), financials (XLF), and transports (IYT), are all considered leading indicators for the broader markets. And they are all signaling trouble.
Small caps:

Financials:

Transports:

Financials were a big post-election story, enjoying a tremendous rally on hopes of higher interest rates—either because of increased growth expectations, or the fact that President Trump has been an outspoken critic of Fed Chairwoman Yellen, or both—and also the hopes of deregulation. However, what we’ve seen instead is a shrinking of the yield spread (the differential between short-term and long-term interest rates). It is this margin that drives a great deal of banks’ profits, as they borrow on the short end and lend on the long end.

Not only is the picture a bit murky for net interest margins (NIMs), but loan growth is also slowing, as shown below:

So, yes, you’ll see data which demonstrates that the number of loans being issued is at a record high—which is true—but the rate at which they are increasing on a year-over-year basis is heading towards zero. The first derivative is always more useful.
Another post-election narrative that has not played out has been in the energy patch. It’s well known that President Trump is pro-energy and has promised a push towards oil and gas development in an effort to move us towards energy independence. Unfortunately, he cannot control the price of oil. After an initial pop, energy stocks have given up all of their gains since November 8th—in fact, the only sub-sector of the energy space that is in positive territory since the election is infrastructure (the MLPs).

Not everything is as it seems. We are increasingly cautious on US stocks and maintain that patience in deploying fresh capital will likely be rewarded.
Have a great rest of your week.

2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Management seems to have scared investors out of the stock by saying they were "committed to" rather than confident on the Opdivo/ Yervoy combo. We see the guidance cut as a casualty of the new era of conservatism at BMY, though the market seems convinced MRK will get KN-021(G) approved by May anyway. We see a potential acquisition of BMY as increasingly likely as the stock moves towards our ex-lung valuation of $44." (1/27/2017)
3. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Bristol-Myers key products – Opdivo, Orencia, Eliquis and Sprycel – should continue to fuel top-line growth of the company. The company raised its 2016 earnings guidance buoyed by strong trends across the business and posted an encouraging 2017 earnings outlook. Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers’ efforts to develop its pipeline are impressive. However, shares are under pressure with investors expressing disappointment over the company’s failed efforts to expand its key product Opdivo’s label to include the first-line treatment of lung cancer, which could give an edge to its competitors. The company announced that it will not seek an accelerated approval in the U.S. for Opdivo plus Yervoy, for first-line lung cancer. Shares of the company have underperformed that of the industry in the last one year. Moreover, estimates have come down ahead of the fourth-quarter results." (1/24/2017)
4. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "Our recent survey with 31 oncologists across the U.S. supports our cautious views on BMY's IO franchise. 4Q16 should be O.K. as the IO franchise will likely beat because the Street is missing ex-US deferred revenue, but the focus remains on longer term outlook. 2017 EPS guidance could be lowered to account for NSCLC competitive dynamics and 3-5% Fx headwind. With ongoing setbacks in IO, we see increased execution risk. Given increased uncertainty about the potential of the IO franchise, we think a takeout/merger is less likely. We remain cautious."

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 10 Hold Ratings, 10 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.43)Consensus Price Target: $63.06 (13.31% upside)
