Baseball and Politics
Politics and Baseball
A Dream Fulfilled
Sources
When he assumed the presidency of baseball’s National League in 1994, Leonard S. Coleman Jr. became the highest-ranking African American executive in professional sports. A native of New Jersey and a lifelong baseball fan, Coleman faces the task of restoring baseball’s public image in the wake of a lengthy players’ strike. He must also be the final arbiter in on-field disputes, whether they concern rival players, players and umpires, or managers. Coleman is deeply concerned that professional baseball has alienated its fans, who perceive both its owners and its players as greedy and concerned only with their own gains. As president of the National League, he plans to do what he can to restore the old-time feeling of baseball as a source of national pride and local identity. “We have to create a greater focus on the game for the fans so they can enjoy the game and not have to hear as much rhetoric about the business aspects of baseball,” he told Ebony magazine. “We have to understand that the business of our game is the fans.” One of those fans is Coleman himself. “The first thing I can ever remember loving is baseball,” he noted in the New York Times. “There aren’t too many people who get an opportunity to make their living at the first thing they ever loved.”
Baseball and Politics
Coleman was born in Newark, but he grew up in Montclair, New Jersey, a village not far from New York City. He lived in a two-family home which his parents shared with an uncle, and everyone seemed to root for a different baseball team. Coleman and his mother liked the Brooklyn Dodgers. Coleman’s father preferred the New York Giants. To make life interesting, the uncle cheered for the Yankees. “Everything in our house was politics and baseball,” the league president recalled in the New York Times. “That’s all we talked about.”
At Montclair High School Coleman played baseball and football, becoming best known for his football skills. He was named All-State and All-American at halfback during his senior year, an accomplishment that he still points to with pride. “I was part of an all-state backfield with Joe Theismann, Franco Harris and Jack Tatum,” he remembered in Sports Illustrated. “I’m the only one without a Super Bowl ring.”
Coleman continued playing baseball and football as an
At a Glance…


B  orn February 17, 1949, in Newark, NJ; married, wife’s name Gabriella Morris (an attorney); children: Leonard III, Christiana, Education: Princeton University, B.S., 1971; John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, M.P.A., 1975; Harvard Graduate School of Education, M.S., 1976.
Missionary in Africa for Protestant Episcopal Church, 1976-80; president, Greater Newark Urban Coalition, 1980-82; commissioner of New Jersey Department of Energy, 1982-86, and New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, 1986-88; municipal finance banker with Kidder, Peabody & Co., New York City, 1988-91; executive director of market development for Major League Baseball, 1991-94; president of National League, 1994—. Has served on numerous boards and commissions, including Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Metropolitan Opera, Waterloo Foundation, and Reviving Baseball in the Inner Cities (R.B.I.).
Addresses: Office —National League, 350 Park Ave., New York, NY 10022-6022.
undergraduate at Princeton University, becoming the first black player ever to score a touchdown for that prestigious Ivy-League school. Still he felt that he was not being given enough opportunity to prove himself with the team—and he thought his race was the reason. As a sophomore, he joined two other black players in a protest, charging the Princeton football program with violations of the university’s policy of equal opportunity for minorities. When the complaints drew national attention, Coleman and his two friends were dismissed from the team, but a panel charged with investigating the incident urged greater sensitivity toward minority students in the athletic program. Coleman told the New York Times that the experience “changed my life in many ways,” especially helping him to develop a keen social consciousness.
After earning his bachelor’s degree from Princeton in 1971 Coleman moved on to Harvard University, where he pursued dual master’s degrees in public administration and education. With such stellar academic credentials he might have entered the work force on the fast track, but instead, in 1976, he accepted a position as a missionary to Africa for the Protestant Episcopal Church. There he put his education and expertise to work as a consultant on health care, education, and community services. All told he spent four years in Africa, serving in 17 different countries and cultivating a close friendship with South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu. “I matured while I was overseas, and I found out about the warmth and affection of the people,” Coleman recalled in Ebony. “Everywhere I went, there was a new and exciting experience.”
Politics and Baseball
Returning to America in 1980, Coleman began to consider a career in politics. He first served as president of the Greater Newark Urban Coalition, an organization that sought to create liaisons between businesses, community groups, and government. In 1982 he was appointed commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Energy. There he became an important member of the administration of Republican New Jersey governor Thomas H. Kean. During this period he also married Gabriella Morris, an attorney.
Leonard Coleman was hardly the stereotypical public servant, however. Midway through his four-year appointment to New Jersey’s Energy Department, at age 35, he worked his way into the Metropolitan Baseball League, a semi-pro affiliation catering to college players and other young pro baseball hopefuls. His late fling with baseball was the source of much joking in the governor’s cabinet, but on the field Coleman was a serious competitor. Over two years of play, he compiled a .337 career batting average. He explained in Ebony that the semi-pro experience satisfied his aspirations as a baseball player. “I loved playing baseball, but I was realistic enough to know that I wasn’t going to make it to the major leagues,” he said.
Handsome and affable, Coleman proved to be a great asset to the Republican Party in New Jersey. He helped to promote Governor Kean among black voters in such cities as Newark, Trenton, and Camden, and indeed Kean earned more votes in those cities than any Republican had in years. In 1986 Kean named Coleman commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, another cabinet-level position with an annual budget of some $250 million. Coleman had greater ambitions as well, at one time entertaining the idea of running for a Senate seat. He was popular and well-known in New Jersey, especially among Republicans, but when the 1988 Senatorial campaign got underway, Kean supported Pete Dawkins, a white Republican. Dawkins was subsequently beaten soundly by Democrat Frank Lautenberg. Coleman never made an issue of the campaign, and in fact he supported Dawkins as well, but in 1988 he left the public sector for a job as an investment banker with the prominent New York firm Kidder, Peabody & Co. He has expressed no interest in returning to national politics since that time.
A Dream Fulfilled
Coleman eventually was named vice president of municipal finance for Kidder, Peabody, and he might have spent the rest of his career there. Instead, in 1991, he accepted his first position with Major League Baseball: director of market development. Coleman was charged with the task of reviving fan interest in baseball at a time when attendance was beginning to slip in many markets. He decided that the best way to prepare professional baseball for a bright future was to spark more interest in the game among youngsters. One program that caught his attention was Reviving Baseball in the Inner Cities (also known as R.B.I.), an initiative aimed at keeping city teenagers active in baseball after they leave the Little Leagues. The program began modestly but has—with Coleman’s encouragement-expanded to more than 30 cities, bringing with it new playing fields, equipment, and organized baseball programs.


In March of 1994, the owners of the National League baseball teams unanimously chose Coleman to succeed outgoing Bill White as president of the National League. Coleman described his new position in Sports Illustrated as “a dream come true.” At first glance the job does look ideal. League presidents are paid to fly around and attend big-league baseball games. They get the best seats at any sporting event—not just baseball, but everything from the Super Bowl to the U.S. Open tennis tournament to the Olympics. Their philosophies shape the game in ways both large and small, governing everything from the fines levied for a fight between players to the image of the game itself. The National League presidency is a high-profile position, one of the most important in organized professional sports, and the job holder is treated accordingly.
The dream can become a nightmare, however. Coleman began his duties with the National League just as one of the worst players’ strikes in history was taking shape. The strike brought cancellation of a good part of the regular season in 1994 as well as all post-season play, and tarnished the image of the national pastime. To Coleman fell the task of restoring baseball’s image and promoting the game as wholesome family entertainment. Asked what he would like to accomplish as National League president by the Sporting News, Coleman replied: “In terms of fans, we want an exciting product on the field that they can be proud of and relate to.” He added: “I think baseball historically has had the roots within our North American society as the national pastime. Baseball has had an impact off the field and on. I look at some of the problems in our country with education, with getting children immunized. We have a role as hopefully a community citizen to help where we possibly can.”
With such a philosophy in place, it is not surprising that Coleman has proven to be a tougher disciplinarian than his predecessors. “Violence, certainly, has become much more prevalent in our society. And I don’t think it has a place in our sport,” he commented in the New York Times. Coleman has been decisive about handing out fines and suspensions to brawling players. He has joined current and former players in a much-publicized campaign against the use of chewing tobacco during games. And he has actively encouraged players to spend more time reaching out to fans, especially children. “Baseball is going to have to provide hope and provide some type of vision in society so that kids’ lives in this country can be better because of this sport,” he explained in Ebony.
Not surprisingly, Coleman has also been a crusader for the rights of African American baseball players. He was instrumental in persuading Major League Baseball to open its health insurance plan to the players and the spouses of players who participated in the Negro Leagues. He also helped to design a plan that provides pension money to former Negro League players earned from the sale of Negro Leagues merchandise that is marketed by Major League Baseball.
Baseball purists have been relieved to discover that Coleman has no plans to introduce the designated hitter rule to the National League. “I like the National League style of play,” he said in the Sporting News. “It’s not going to be leading any movements for any change.” What Coleman would like to see change is the message professional baseball is sending to its viewers. “It used to be that baseball had a strong connection with society,” Coleman explained in the New York Times. “It was always able to transcend the field in a variety of very positive ways. Now, though, the only message we have been communicating is money, money, money. That is not a message we should be communicating.”
Instead Coleman envisions such improvements as less drug abuse among players, less fighting during games, and more promotion of baseball as entertainment for the whole family. “We need to be role models and try to encourage players to be such,” he maintained in the Sporting News. “If you look at the game of baseball, it’s been one of the great continuities of life.... There’s a certain flow to it. You don’t want to tinker with it on the field. But any ways you can enhance the fans’ enjoyment, you do that.”
Coleman continues to live in Montclair, New Jersey with his wife, son, and daughter. His busy schedule may take him to as many as five different American cities in as many days, and he sees as many ball games in person as he possibly can. “I am thoroughly enjoying my work at Major League Baseball,” he told the New York Times. “I feel blessed that I’ve had several gratifying careers.”

Where to start

Making the decision going to college, pursuing an advanced degree or obtaining an industry recognized certificate is one of the most important decisions an individual will make in their lifetime. When considering an educational institution there are numerous factors that need to be taken into account before an education decision can be made. 
Here are the main factors to consider when looking at pursuing an advanced degree or completing a certificate program:
Online VS In Person: This is the first fundamental question that prospective students need to ask themselves. If you are the kind of person that is self driven, has a tight schedule or is not in a commutable distance to an in person institution, then pursuing an online degree could be a good fit. However, if you find yourself needing to be in a physical classroom environment and learn better that way, then you should seek out in person programs that can better suite your needs. People learn in all different kinds of ways. Some are visual learners, some experiential and some need to hear things to have the information really sink in. No one knows himself or herself better than you, so listen to your gut and first determine what kind of learner you are before embarking on the next steps. Rasmssen College goes into greater depth about the plusses and minuses of online v.s. traditional educational settings. 
Career Opportunities: When exploring areas of study that you are interested in, one recommendation is to first explore the types of jobs and careers in that industry. Often times people find that after obtaining a degree that has set them back a significant amount of money, that the career field that they have their degree in is either not growing or is underpaid in relation to the cost of the degree. We suggest exploring a variety of careers and use the information contained here in conjunction with The Bureau of Labor and Statistics Data to determine if you are making a wise investment in your degree. All of the statistics we have assembled on career and degree data come from the BLS website and are intended to help students make wise decisions about their studies and career options with a degree or certificate. 



 
Time Commitment: The amount of time that you have available to apply to your studies is going to be one of the most important factors in your decision. If you are working a full time job, you will have to figure out a way of balancing your personal life, with your schoolwork. This article from US News and World Report will help you come up with a game plan for managing your time
Financial Aid, Scholarships and Student Loans: Once you have decided that you want to go to college and have a career path planned out once you obtain your degree, then it’s time to figure out how to pay for the degree. Most institutions have different financing options that you will have to do your homework on, but all usually have some form of financial aid or scholarships available. When looking for information on student aid and the resources available to students, we recommend starting at the Federal Student Aid website. This is an office of the U.S. Department of Education and here, students will find a wealth of resources and information that will help them better determine what kind of aid or grants are available to them.

Coleman graduated from Princeton University in 1971 with a degree in history, then attended Harvard University, where he earned both a master's degree in public administration (MPA) and a master's degree in education and social policy.[4]

A resident of Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, Coleman served as commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs until July 15, 1988, when he left office to enter private industry and was succeeded by Anthony M. Villane.[5] He had also served as commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Energy, and he was chairman of the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission and the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency.[6]

Leonard S. Coleman (1994-1999)










Leonard S. Coleman
NL President 1994-1999


Profile: Leonard S. Coleman was born on February 17, 1949 in Newark, New Jersey. While growing
up in nearby Montclair, Coleman developed a passion for baseball. In High
School he lettered in baseball while excelling in football, being named All-State
and All-American at halfback during his senior year. 

Leonard Coleman
continued playing baseball and football as an undergraduate at Princeton University,
becoming the first black player ever to score a touchdown for that prestigious
Ivy-League school. Still he felt that he was not being given enough
opportunity to prove himself with the team--and he thought his race was the reason.
As a sophomore, he joined two other black players in a protest, charging the
Princeton football program with violations of the university's policy of equal
opportunity for minorities. When the complaints drew national attention, Coleman
and his two friends were dismissed from the team, but a panel charged with
investigating the incident urged greater sensitivity toward minority students
in the athletic program.

After earning his bachelor's degree from Princeton
in 1971 Coleman moved on to Harvard University, where he pursued dual master's
degrees in public administration and education. With such stellar academic
credentials he might have entered the work force on the fast track, but instead,
in 1976, he accepted a position as a missionary to Africa for the Protestant
Episcopal Church. There he put his education and expertise to work as a consultant
on health care, education, and community services. All told he spent four
years in Africa, serving in 17 different countries. 

Returning to
New Jersey in 1980, Leonard Coleman began to consider a career in politics. He
first served as president of the Greater Newark Urban Coalition, an organization
that sought to create liaisons between businesses, community groups, and government.
In 1982 he was appointed commissioner of the New Jersey Department of
Energy.  Coleman was hardly the stereotypical public servant, however. Midway
through his four-year appointment to New Jersey's Energy Department, at age
35, he worked his way into the Metropolitan Baseball League, a semi-pro affiliation
catering to college players and other young pro baseball hopefuls. His late
fling with baseball was the source of much joking in the governor's cabinet,
but on the field Coleman was a serious competitor, over two years of play, he
compiled a .337 career batting average. 

Leonard Coleman proved to be
a great asset to the Republican Party in New Jersey. He helped to promote Governor
Kean among black voters in such cities as Newark, Trenton, and Camden, and
indeed Kean earned more votes in those cities than any Republican had in years.
In 1986 Kean named Coleman commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community
Affairs, another cabinet- level position with an annual budget of some $250
million. Coleman had greater ambitions as well, at one time entertaining the
idea of running for a Senate seat. After losing in the primary in 1988, Coleman
left the public sector for a job as an investment banker with the prominent New
York firm Kidder, Peabody & Co. 

Coleman eventually was named vice
president of municipal finance for Kidder, Peabody, and he might have spent the
rest of his career there. Instead, in 1991, he accepted his first position with
Major League Baseball: director of market development. Coleman was charged
with the task of reviving fan interest in baseball at a time when attendance was
beginning to slip in many markets. He decided that the best way to prepare professional
baseball for a bright future was to spark more interest in the game
among youngsters. One program that caught his attention was Reviving Baseball in
the Inner Cities, an initiative aimed at keeping city teenagers active in baseball
after they leave the Little Leagues. The program began modestly but has--with
Coleman's encouragement--expanded to more than 30 cities, bringing with it
new playing fields, equipment, and organized baseball programs.

In
March of 1994, the owners of the National League baseball teams unanimously chose
Coleman to succeed outgoing Bill White as president of the National League.
Coleman described his new position in Sports Illustrated as "a dream come true."
However the dream can become a nightmare, as Coleman began his duties with the
NL, a strike that cancelled the end of the season, postseason, and World Series,
was just beginning, tarnishing the image of the national pastime. To Coleman
fell the task of restoring baseball's image and promoting the game as wholesome
family entertainment. Baseball would eventually bounce back, but in 1999 Leonard
Coleman was out of a job as the NL and AL Presidents offices were abolished.
Coleman would go on to take a job as paid advisor to Bud Selig. 

Since
losing his job as President in 1999, Leonard Coleman has continued to use
sports as a way of community improvement, leading the efforts to build a major
sports arena in  Newark for the NHL's New Jersey Devils.

Early life and education[edit]
Born in Newark, New Jersey on February 17, 1949, Coleman was raised in Montclair, New Jersey and attended Montclair High School, where he played baseball and football, earning a selection as a New Jersey All-American halfback during his senior year.[2] He played both sports at Princeton University and became the first black athlete to score a touchdown for the Princeton Tigers football team but joined two other black players in filing charges that the university had discriminated against them in their opportunities to fairly participate on the football team based on their race, leading to the dismissal of all three players from the team.[3]
Coleman graduated from Princeton University in 1971 with a degree in history, then attended Harvard University, where he earned both a master's degree in public administration (MPA) and a master's degree in education and social policy.[4]
Career[edit]
A resident of Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, Coleman served as commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs until July 15, 1988, when he left office to enter private industry and was succeeded by Anthony M. Villane.[5] He had also served as commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Energy, and he was chairman of the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission and the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency.[6]
While serving as president of the National League, Coleman operated Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities, forging a working alliance with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America to help grow the RBI program.[7][8] He also served as President of the Jackie Robinson Foundation for 18 years.[9]
As of September 2016, Coleman is reported to own shares in Aramark, Avis Budget Group, Electronic Arts, and Omnicom Group with the total value of US$ 5.3 million.[10]

Early life and education[edit]
Born in Newark, New Jersey on February 17, 1949, Coleman was raised in Montclair, New Jersey and attended Montclair High School, where he played baseball and football, earning a selection as a New Jersey All-American halfback during his senior year.[2] He played both sports at Princeton University and became the first black athlete to score a touchdown for the Princeton Tigers football team but joined two other black players in filing charges that the university had discriminated against them in their opportunities to fairly participate on the football team based on their race, leading to the dismissal of all three players from the team.[3]
Coleman graduated from Princeton University in 1971 with a degree in history, then attended Harvard University, where he earned both a master's degree in public administration (MPA) and a master's degree in education and social policy.[4]
Career[edit]
A resident of Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, Coleman served as commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs until July 15, 1988, when he left office to enter private industry and was succeeded by Anthony M. Villane.[5] He had also served as commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Energy, and he was chairman of the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission and the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency.[6]
While serving as president of the National League, Coleman operated Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities, forging a working alliance with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America to help grow the RBI program.[7][8] He also served as President of the Jackie Robinson Foundation for 18 years.[9]
As of September 2016, Coleman is reported to own shares in Aramark, Avis Budget Group, Electronic Arts, and Omnicom Group with the total value of US$ 5.3 million.[10]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Get $100 in search advertising when you spend $25 in Bing Ads.


†Offer Details: Offer expires December 31, 2017.  Valid only for new Bing Ads customers who are first party recipients of the offer email. A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation. Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
