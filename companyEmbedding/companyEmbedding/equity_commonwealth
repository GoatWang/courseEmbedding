Stock quotes in this article: eqc


If you think there are a lot of opinions about the stock market in 2016 you should read the steady flow of real estate predictions making their way across my desk the past few weeks. As with stocks, some think the party will continue unabated, while others believe the world is about to end. Then there are the folks in the middle who lean a little one way or another.
I have to confess that I find it a bit disturbing that Sam Zell is selling in a big way and thinks it's difficult not to be a seller at current commercial real estate valuations. He may well be right about the broader market, but I have been able to find some real estate securities that I expect to do well in the years ahead and worth considering at current prices.
Let's start with Equity Commonwealth (EQC), where Zell is chairman. The CEO of the REIT, David Helfand, and Chief Operating Officer David Weinberg came up in the Zell organization and have learned real estate investing from one of the best ever. CFO Adam Markman worked at Green Street Advisors, a real estate investment firm with a great track record. These guys know what they're doing, having been investing in commercial markets for decades with a great deal of success.
Equity Commonwealth was targeted a few years ago by activist investors who forced out the old board and management and replaced them with Zell and his team. Since the new team has taken the reins, they have moved aggressively to reposition the portfolio to match their vision of the commercial real estate market. In 2015 that meant selling -- through the third quarter of the year, it had sold $1.9 billion of property.
They aren't done selling either. Helfand said on the firm's third-quarter conference call that, "With respect to our disposition program, our thesis is unchanged. We focused on executing the sale of assets in a robust investment sale environment. Market volatility in the past few months has resulted in widening of debt spreads and we'll continue to monitor activity levels and asset pricing in the investment sale market as we gear up to market additional assets in the new year."
This has created a nice pile of cash, with Equity Commonwealth reporting a total of $1.8 billion on the books. And management has been using it to reduce debt and buy back stock. Since gaining control, total debt has been cut to $1.8 billion from $2.9 billion, and debt plus preferred stock obligations have declined to $2.2 billion from $3.6 billion.
The REIT had $112 million left under its buyback plan as of the end of the third quarter and I expect that it deployed more capital to repurchase shares in the final three months of 2015. During the third quarter, Equity Commonwealth repurchased 3,410,300 common shares at an average price of $25.76 per share for a total investment of $87.8 million.
It is not all cash, however. Excluding properties for sale, the REIT owns 67 properties comprising 25.3 million square feet. Its biggest markets are Philadelphia, Chicago, Austin, Denver, Bellevue, Wash. and Indianapolis. The firm's 30 largest properties generate 86% of its total rental income and the portfolio as a whole is 91% leased right now.
According to a Barron's article last summer, the estimated net asset value (NAV) of Equity Commonwealth is about $32 per share, but I think that's a little low.
You are buying this REIT not just for the property it owns but for what it does not own. As Helfand put it, "We're positioned for growth when and if we identify investment opportunities that offer a compelling risk/reward profile. We'll continue to actively look for and evaluate investment opportunities while remaining patient. We recognize that we may not find attractive acquisition opportunities without a significant change in current market pricing. In the interim, we'll remain focused on executing our plans to create value through active ownership of our portfolio, leasing of vacant space and preparing assets for disposition."
With Equity Commonwealth, you have a collection of assets and a pile of cash that is led by Sam Zell and people he taught. The REIT is positioning itself to take advantage of current high valuations and preparing for the next decline in property prices. EQC should be a part of any long-term real estate portfolio.
Keep in mind that we are thinking very long term with this REIT. Stay small, move slow and make the market work for you and not against you as you build your positions. Buy on days when the market or the stock is down and scale into your position.
I can promise you that Zell and his team are thinking more about net asset value in 2016 than today's market quote and you should as well.
Tomorrow, we will look at some additional real estate opportunities that should do well for long-term patient investors.
