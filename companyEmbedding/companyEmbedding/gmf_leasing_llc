The Right Lease

Discover The Right Lease℠
In today's economy, more people are discovering the advantages of leasing. Whether it's the appeal of lower monthly payments or the opportunity to drive a new vehicle every few years, many drivers are exploring the possibility of leasing their next car, truck or SUV.
Leasing lets your customers consider vehicles that have more options; trade-in their vehicles for the latest model more frequently; and, drive away with peace of mind since most lease terms are within the factory warranty period. Leasing also provides an opportunity for your customer to get into a new vehicle with a similar monthly payment of a purchased used vehicle.
For you – the dealer – it's more than an alternative form of financing. It's an opportunity to generate a steady stream of repeat and referral customers that add incremental sales volume to your business. And, unlike other auto finance companies, GM Financial's The Right Lease℠ is available to a broad spectrum of consumers – from super-prime to subprime.
If you are not doing business with us, it's easy to get started! Call 1-888-556-4616 to begin the activation process. GM and GM Financial field teams are fully committed to ensure flawless integration and best-in-class levels of service for GM dealers nationwide.
Enhance peace of mind with XS Wear®
Make sure your lease customers are protected from excess wear and tear or damages with GM Financial’s XS Wear® coverage.
