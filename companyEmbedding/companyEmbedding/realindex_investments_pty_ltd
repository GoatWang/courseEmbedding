Objectives and Strategy




Fund Objective

                        To provide capital and income growth by investing in global shares and outperforming the MSCI All Country World (ex Australia) Index, hedged to Australian dollars over rolling five-year periods before fees and taxes.
                    


Fund Strategy

                        Realindex selects and weights companies according to their economic footprint defined by fundamental measures of company size (sales, cash flow, book value and dividends). The portfolio is further enhanced by applying additional factors such as quality of earnings and debt coverage. Realindex portfolios provide the benefits associated with traditional index funds, including lower cost, lower turnover, diversification and liquidity. This option aims to hedge currency risk.
