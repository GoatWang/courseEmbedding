Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

FAQ for Emerging Managers


What is the process for becoming a funded manager?


How long does the funding process take?	


What are the initial allocations a manager can expect?


Do I have to have a five-year performance track record or a certain amount of assets under management?


What is the payment structure — i.e., how does Progress get paid and how does Progress pay the managers?




What is the process for becoming a funded manager? 
					
	
						The first step in the process is to complete and submit the Manager Questionnaire. Progress conducts thorough due diligence on all qualified managers prior to funding. The process includes visits at our offices and on-site at the investment manager's offices. Click here to learn more about our manager selection process.
					
«back



How long does the funding process take? 
					

						This depends on many factors — the primary factor being what our clients are looking for in their investment lineup. On average, managers selected for our program are funded in six months to one year.
					
«back



What are the initial allocations a manager can expect? 
					
	
					   Initial allocations are based on fund construction.  Average allocations for newly funded managers range from $5 to $25 million. Allocations can grow significantly depending on client needs and the manager's  investment performance.
					
«back



Do I have to have a five-year performance track record or a certain amount of assets under management?
			 		
	
						No, we evaluate each manager on a case by case basis.  A portable track record is helpful but not required. We are comfortable being the first investor in a manager's product. 
				    
«back



What is the payment structure — i.e., how does Progress get paid and how does Progress pay the managers? 
					

						Most of our clients pay Progress one all-in fee, which Progress then splits with the managers. In a few instances, our clients pay the managers and Progress separately and directly, consistent with their organization's specific legal or contractual guidelines. It is important to emphasize that Progress never under any circumstances accepts monies from the managers. We sometimes are asked if managers pay to be in our database or to attend our Plan Sponsor and Emerging Manager Conference. The answer is no, never. We do not accept any form of payment from the emerging managers in our investment programs.

Investment Process

						Progress builds every client portfolio consistent with the five interrelated steps in our investment process.
					

Discover New Talent

				   		   	Given Progressâ role as a leading manager of early stage emerging managers, we benefit from a certain magnet effect as many new investment companies seek us out. We also actively look for new managers through diverse sourcing channels and prospecting strategies, including Internet research, networking with a variety of industry contacts and referrals.
				   		
Select Best-In-Class Emerging Firms

							Our research process combines quantitative and qualitative analysis to narrow the universe of emerging managers. First, we score managers across a variety of discrete factors relating to performance, process, people and organizational stability. We then visit selected candidates from the top-scoring firms on our Research List, conducting extensive on-site research to better understand from a qualitative standpoint the rewards and risks uncovered through the quantitative scoring process.
						
Build Portfolios

							Progress builds portfolios to meet explicit client guidelines, reflect our conviction in specific managers and control risk both at the individual manager level and at the portfolio level. We neutralize investment style exposures to ensure that portfolios are concentrated in our primary area of strength: manager selection. By systematically refreshing the Focus List of best-in-class candidates, we are ready to restructure portfolios as necessary. We restructure portfolios to ensure adherence to client goals and guidelines and to reflect evolving manager risk/reward profiles.
						
Monitor, Evaluate and Assist Managers

						   	Progressâ quantitative scoring and qualitative due diligence process is systematic and extensive. We maintain updated quantitative scores on every manager, and we visit funded firms on-site at least once a year, with significant interim contact by telephone and in meetings at our offices. The process of manager assistance and the process of manager evaluation and monitoring support one another.
						

							By providing ongoing assistance to the managers, Progress is able to anticipate and prevent any problems that may affect investment performance. Drawing from our own business experience, we also are in a better position to recognize when positive changes will affect performance, perhaps validating increased portfolio exposure to a manager.
						
Rebalance Portfolios

							 Portfolio rebalancing occurs through a constant process of quality control resulting in termination, reallocation and graduation. We conduct a formal review and fund rebalancing twice a year acting decisively to capture profits and limit losses. We want our managers to succeed. And when they do succeed and grow to mainstream status, we are ready to assist our clients in hiring these graduate managers directly. According to client research, one of the reasons some of our clients hire us is our ability to affect change more quickly than they can internally.

Originally founded in 1946 as post-secondary educational institution for World War II veterans, it evolved into a four-year college over the following two decades, and was granted university status in 1969.

 Career History



Technology Manager

                                    Current                


Progressive Investment Management Corp.


                  Progressive Investment Management Corp.'s investment management services are designed to meet social and environmental investment (SRI) criteria as defined by the firm. Progressive relies on fundamental research that combines traditional investment analysis with SRI research to create a complete picture of how each company behaves commercially, as well as how it deals with existing and emerging environmental risks and opportunities. They seek long-term capital appreciation and avoidance of excessive risk by diversifying investments in companies with what they believe are above-average financial characteristics and growth potential and that excel at managing environmental risks, opportunities, and societal impact. The Progressive Equity Strategy invests primarily in large and mid-cap US companies but may occasionally invest in small-cap equities. ADRs may be used for non-US diversification. The strategy typically holds 35-40 stocks across major industry sectors. Progressive employs a “Growth at a Reasonable Price” or GARP investment approach. They may also use US equity mutual funds or ETFs rather than individual stocks.The Progressive Equity Fund Strategy invests in mutual funds or ETFs which invest in US equities. The strategy uses primarily funds that invest in large and mid-cap companies but may occasionally invest in small-cap equities and ADRs. Progressive's Fixed Income Strategy may invest in investment grade corporate, US Government Agency, and taxable and tax-exempt municipal bonds (rated BBB or better) with a duration range of about 4-8 years. The strategy may employ corporate bonds issued by companies that adhere to the firm’s SRI criteria and seeks both taxable and tax-exempt municipal bonds that support positive environmental and social initiatives. Mutual Funds or ETFs may be used as part of the strategy.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
