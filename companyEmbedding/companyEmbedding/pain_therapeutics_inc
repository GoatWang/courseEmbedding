						Innovative New Products to Address Unmet Need within Chronic Pain and Migraine, and Tackle Opioid Abuse
						





PR-Inside.com: 2017-07-20 18:00:47
Global Pain Therapeutics Market to 2023 - Innovative New Products to Address Unmet Need within Chronic Pain and Migraine, and Tackle Opioid Abuse

Summary

The pain therapeutics market covers the drugs used for the relief of acute and chronic pain. This market has long been characterized by high levels of generic revenue, derived largely from opioids, which see high levels of usage worldwide and particularly within the US.

However, the last decade has seen the addition of new premium products to the market, including a wave of drugs approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain conditions - a patient population that previously had very poor treatment options. This influx of premium products is forecast to continue through to 2023.







The causes of the resurgence of premium analgesics are multi-faceted, but the primary driver is to meet the many unmet needs of the market, such as the treatment of neuropathic pain and migraines, and the need to limit the risk of abuse associated with many analgesics, primarily opioids. The revived interest in this market has led to a very high frequency of licensing deals for pain products over the past decade.

Post-Operative Pain Therapeutics Exhibits Emerging Pipeline with 35+ Drug Candidates

July 19th, 2017  P&S Market Research Releases

The study analyzed that the post-operative pain therapeutics pipeline comprises approximately 39 drug candidates in different stages of development. Post-operative pain is one of the most common problem experienced by a person after any surgery. The intensity of pain can vary from acute to chronic depending upon the time it lasts. It starts when pain receptors activate an electrical signal that travels to the spinal cord. The spinal cord then transmits the signal to the brain. It involves the interaction of various chemicals, known as neurotransmitters, in the body, which together act to produce the sensation of pain in a person.
Browse Report Description at: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/post-operative-pain-therapeutics-pipeline-analysis
Innocoll Holdings plc is using CollaRx technology platform for the development of INL-001 for the treatment of post-operative pain. The CollaRx technology platform produces a lyophilized porous matrix of purified collagen that can be implanted at the time of surgery or applied topically to chronic or acute traumatic wounds. The CollaRx matrices are biodegradable and bio-resorbable. The in vivo release of drugs incorporated into the CollaRx matrix takes place via a combination of dissolution, diffusion and the interactive characteristics of the active drug and the formulation that can be modified to affect controlled release.

The research also found that various companies are developing their drug candidates as small molecule in the post-operative pain therapeutics pipeline.
Some of the key players developing drugs for post-operative pain include DURECT Corporation, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cara Therapeutics, Inc. and others.

Report Hive Market Research Released a New Research Report of 147 pages on Title " Global Pain Therapeutics Market to 2023 - Innovative New Products to Address Unmet Need within Chronic Pain and Migraine, and Tackle Opioid Abuse "with detailed Analysis, Forecast and Strategies.

Global Pain Therapeutics Market to 2023 - Innovative New Products to Address Unmet Need within Chronic Pain and Migraine, and Tackle Opioid Abuse

Summary

The pain therapeutics market covers the drugs used for the relief of acute and chronic pain. This market has long been characterized by high levels of generic revenue, derived largely from opioids, which see high levels of usage worldwide and particularly within the US.

However, the last decade has seen the addition of new premium products to the market, including a wave of drugs approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain conditions - a patient population that previously had very poor treatment options. This influx of premium products is forecast to continue through to 2023.

The causes of the resurgence of premium analgesics are multi-faceted, but the primary driver is to meet the many unmet needs of the market, such as the treatment of neuropathic pain and migraines, and the need to limit the risk of abuse associated with many analgesics, primarily opioids. The revived interest in this market has led to a very high frequency of licensing deals for pain products over the past decade.
