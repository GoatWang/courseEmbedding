Goldman Sachs Employees Try To Explain Why They Used The Phrase "The Street" In Marketing Documents

David Lehman


  A funny thing happened when Goldman Sachs employees had to
  explain what they meant when they put the slang phrase "the
  Street" on marketing documents.

  When they submitted their testimonies to the Financial Crisis
  subcommittee on what caused the financial crisis, Goldman
  employees had to explain yet again why the wording in some of the
  documents Goldman used to market products didn't clearly say: we
  might have selected the assets in this product based on the
  likelihood that they are crap. 

  Of course, asking the traders these questions is barking up the
  wrong tree; if lawyers don't write the "disclaimers" in question,
  they check it over 100 times with a fine tooth comb to make sure
  the language won't land them in a losing lawsuit.

  But in one case, the committee was questioning traders anyway,
  and it asked them what most people understand the phrase "the
  Street" to mean.

  The phrase "sourced from the Street" appears on the marketing
  documents for Hudson, a $2 billion CDO that Goldman Sachs
  selected the underlying assets in. It has now emerged that the
  phrase was meant to be general, but had it been 100% accurate, it
  would have said, "sourced from Goldman's inventory [of crap they
  don't want]."





  So the investors who bought Hudson now claim that Goldman didn't
  properly disclose to them that they were shorting it. And in
  order to judge the validity of this claim and others like it, the
  committee spoke to a few traders.

  Asked what they thought the phrase "sourced from the
  Street," meant, the traders who don't work for Goldman
  had the same answer.

Andrew Davilman, a former Goldman salesperson who sold Hudson
  1 securities to investors says he thought it meant "assets being
  acquired from a variety of different broker-dealers at the best
  prices." 
  

Morgan Stanley (which bought
    Hudson) thought it meant "assets acquired from a variety of
    different broker-dealers."


  The Goldman traders, on the other hand, all had different
  answers. 

Darryl Herrick, who drafted the marketing booklet says it
  meant the assets were “sourced from a street dealer at street
  prices.”
  
Peter Ostrem, a CDO Managing Director, stated that
  “sourced from the Street” referred to the fact the underlying
  RMBS securities were not originated or underwritten by Goldman.
  
Deeb Salem, a Goldman mortgage trader who selected 40% of the
  assets in Hudson 1, described “the Street” as simply “short hand
  for all broker-dealers.”
  

  The best answer comes from these two Goldman employees:

David Lehman and Matthew Bieber
  claimed that it was accurate to say the Hudson assets were
  “sourced from the Street,” even though all the assets were
  acquired from the Goldman ABS Desk, because Goldman was part of
  “the Street.”

  It's a funny explanation to say that "sourced by the Street" is
  an accurate way of saying, "sourced by us." But here's why it's
  genius: Goldman was the *only* party short the $2 billion CDO. So
  getting rid of the CDO was its main objective.

   

  Goldman Sachs' lawyers don't get enough credit for designing the
  wording in some of these CDO marketing documents. They made
  the legal disclaimer work in their favor.

  So it might have sounded like Goldman was also an investor in
  Hudson and only bought insurance against its default as a hedge
  that would benefit every investor, when really, the opposite was
  true.

  Maybe those objecting should point less blame at Goldman's
  traders, who get too much crap for their role in the financial
  crisis, and levy more accusations at Goldman's lawyers.

 David H. Sachs Named To Direct Baltimore Leadership Program 
         










    










 






 











 









David H. Sachs Named To Direct Baltimore Leadership Program

Jun 27, 2013, 13:25 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Greater Baltimore Committee 











 
















































 

 




















 


BALTIMORE, June 27, 2013 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- David H. Sachs, a leadership development innovator, manager, teacher and consultant, has been named the new executive director of The Leadership, the highly-regarded program of the Greater Baltimore Committee for future business, civic and government leaders, the Leadership's board announced today.
Sachs will succeed Jan Houbolt, who is retiring this fall after 25 years at the helm of the year-long program for emerging leaders in the private, public and non-profit sectors that cultivates a deeper awareness of the region's strengths and challenges and develops leadership capacities to accelerate change.
Sachs has worked in leadership development for 15 years with individuals and organizations across industries, geographies and cultures.   Currently, Sachs provides strategic consulting and leadership development, design and facilitation to private, public, and non-profit organizations, including Johns Hopkins University.
He also teaches in Harvard Business School Publishing Corporation's blended executive development programs and the Maryland Institute College of Art's (MICA) Master's program in Social Design.
Sachs will begin working over the summer with The Leadership board and staff to ensure a smooth transition before Houbolt retires in the fall.
Sachs emerged from a year-long search process as the "one leader who brings an extraordinary history of developing and running the highest-level executive leadership programs, teaching leaders, and driving innovation in learning," said The Leadership's Board Chairman Paul Wolman, CEO of Feats, Inc. 
"We are remarkably fortunate to find David Sachs at the intersection of his desire to direct an organization and our opportunity to build on the legacy of Jan Houbolt," said Wolman, who praised the board's search committee led by The Leadership Vice Chair Mark Furst, president and CEO of United Way of Central Maryland, and Treasurer Karen Miller, director of finance and chief compliance officer at the Annie E. Casey Foundation.
Sachs is "exceptionally qualified to advance The Leadership's tradition of engaging participants in frank and enlightening dialogue and compelling, sometimes once-in-a-lifetime experiences," said Greater Baltimore Committee President & CEO Donald C. Fry.  
"This is the premier program of its kind. It not only educates, but bonds generations of leaders," said Fry, noting that the program has 1,500 alumni of "deeply loyal" executives including many corporate, nonprofit and education CEOs in the region.
"I'm honored to have the opportunity to steward The Leadership into its next phase," Sachs said. "I look forward to building on Jan Houbolt's work to deliver a world-class learning program that enhances the leadership capabilities of participants and their organizations to impact the Baltimore region."
Prior to establishing his independent consultancy in 2011, Sachs was vice president and head of corporate learning and development at T. Rowe Price.
Previously he led Harvard Business School's Executive Education as executive director and co-led the launch of The Erickson School at UMBC as the school's first vice-dean.
Sachs earned an MBA from Harvard Business School, a Master in Public Administration degree from Harvard Kennedy School, and a BA in History from Amherst College.  
In 2005, he returned to his hometown of Baltimore with his wife and their two sons.

GOLDMAN: Our clients recently asked us a surprising question

As you can see by the red
  line, this has been a pretty lackluster
  recovery.

Minneapolis
  Fed





  Wall Street's investment pros get paid a lot of money to answer
  all sorts of questions about the markets and the economy.


  And there's no shortage of questions to be answered right now.
  When will the 
  Federal Reserve raise interest rates? How is the 
  strong dollar affecting my portfolio? What is going on with
  China and 
  its currency? Why are we still talking about Greece?


  "One surprising question that clients have asked recently
  is the prospect for a US recession in 2016," 
  Goldman Sachs' David Kostin wrote in a new research note. "An
  economic contraction is decidedly NOT in our forecast."


  If anything, it's surprising that more people aren't asking this
  question.


  Sure, jobs
  are growing, sales
  are up, consumer 
  sentiment is elevated, 
  home prices are rising, and stocks are near record levels.


  But good things don't last forever. And there are plenty of
  ominous signs out there that suggest things could take a turn for
  the worst.


  "Investors point to the 18% collapse
  in Brent during the past six weeks, the 
  weak macro data from China, and the spillover effect on
  global demand growth, lingering uncertainty in Europe, and the
  25-bp compression in 10-year US Treasury yields during the last
  30 days (to 2.19%) as reasons for concern about a US downturn,"
  Kostin continued.


  "Our response is that, while the current US expansion is long in
  temporal terms (6 years), the magnitude of the recovery is weak
  and on that basis the expansion phase is closer to
  early-/mid-cycle," Kostin said tersely. The 
  chart above from the Minneapolis Fed illustrates this.


  Goldman Sachs' house view is that growth in gross domestic
  product accelerates to 2.4% in 2016 from 2.2% in 2015, then cools
  to 2.2% in 2017.


  This 
  isn't the first time we've heard that recoveries don't die of
  old age. Perhaps the most popular leading indicator of recessions
  is the 
  inverted 
  yield 
  curve, which is when long-term interest rates are lower than
  short-term interest rates. But as you can see below in the chart
  taking the difference between the 10-year yield (long-term) and
  the two-year yield (short-term), rates have a long way to go
  before the yield curve inverts.





That blue line usually
  goes below zero ahead of recessions.

Yammer Founder David Sacks Joins Cloud HR Startup Zenefits As COO

Google Hangouts For Android Gets Smarter, Adds Video Filters And More












David Sacks is back up in the startup game. The founder of Yammer, who sold his company to Microsoft for $1.2 billion about two-and-a-half years ago, has decided he’s had enough time off and is joining fast-growing cloud HR startup Zenefits as its new COO.
Sacks has been a Valley mainstay for the last 15 years. He joined PayPal as its first COO in 1999, leaving his management consultant job at McKinsey to become a member of the PayPal Mafia. In 2006 he founded genealogy website Geni.com, which was sold to MyHeritage in 2012, but not before the company’s internal communications tool Yammer was spun out. And we all know how that turned out.
So if you’re Sacks and you sold your last company for more than a billion dollars, why do you join Zenefits? Or really, go back to work at all?
“There’s only so much poker I can play,” Sacks said in a phone interview.
More seriously, Sacks says he’s spent the last few years angel investing and even flirted with the idea of becoming a full-time VC. But when push came to shove, he realized what he really wanted to do was go back to working on companies and building things.
The new role at Zenefits will pose a unique challenge for Sacks. Unlike his previous startups, which he either founded himself or got it at the ground floor, Zenefits has also scaled pretty substantially over the past few years. Being a part of that hyper-growth environment is part of what excites him about joining the company.
“What took Yammer three years to do, Zenefits did in one year… I’ve got experience in product and operations and issues related to hyper growth, and there’s a version of that here,” Sacks said.
When talking about the hire, Zenefits co-founder and CEO Parker Conrad said he sees Sacks as a partner in the business. And according to Conrad, all operations, finance, and product will report up through the new COO. That said, he also acknowledged that Sacks’ background at PayPal and Yammer will help to manage Zenefits through this hyper-growth phase.
“I expect David will be working on lots of different problems,” Conrad said. “Wherever the fires are hottest is where he’ll be focused.”
While he’s thrilled to have Sacks on board, Conrad said Zenefits wasn’t necessarily looking for a COO at the time discussions began. The conversation began after Conrad spoke with Andreessen Horowitz general partner and Zenefits board member Lars Dalgaard about the possibility.
As Conrad tells it, Dalgaard asked if he had considered adding a COO to reduce some of the pressure of running such a fast-growing company. But Conrad was pretty opposed to the idea until Sacks was mentioned as a possible candidate.
“I didn’t want a big company bureaucrat,” Conrad says. “But Lars asked, ‘What if it was David Sacks?’ and I was like, ‘You mean, Yammer David Sacks?'”
An intro was made soon after, with Conrad and Sacks first meeting the week before Thanksgiving. After spending several days together, it was clear they both wanted to be on the same team. Soon after they reached an agreement whereby Sacks would not only join as COO but also made an investment in the company and join the Zenefits board.
Sacks isn’t disclosing the size of the investment, but did say it was significant. “This is the biggest investment I’ve made in a startup, and it represents my commitment to the company,” he told me.
The investment shows Sacks has some skin in the game, but he says it’s secondary to the amount of work he expects to do as a part of the team. “I’ve been angel investing in companies for a long time, so that part isn’t unique… I just think this company is so exciting and special that I want to spend all my time on it,” Sacks said.
