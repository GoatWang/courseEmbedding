About Us

 ECO Energy Tech is an urban agricultural research and development company that supplies licenced technologies in Asia.

It’s ECO Energy Tech’s goal to pursue sustainabilty aspects in a commercially viable way.

Technology. Vision. Passion. 
It took all three and more than 7 years to develop EcoTech Food completely. We founded Future Growing with the dream that one day everyone on the planet in their local community would have access to healthy food.

ECO Energy Tech designs and builds the World’s best and most sustainable food growing greenhouse systems for commercial growers, urban farmers, and people who like tastier, healthier food. We knew that it would be the perfect way to reach our aim to supply a healthy diet for you and your family. Learn more about the GreenDome System. 
In 2012, we began to produce and supply Eco Energy Tech for farmers and markets in Asia.

          

What is EcoTech


 Simply put, EcoTech means new agriculture. The world’s agricultural systems are changing and EcoTech is playing a leading role. The factors that stimulate these changes are ubiquitous and transparent: efficient energy consumption, unpredictable weather and sustainable production chains. EcoTech means new agriculture, new innovations, new technologies, new strategies.

Aeroponic planting systems: aeroponics allows fast growth cycles and the elimination of soil as substrate. Exposed plant roots are periodically inmersed in a water-based mixture that is enriched with oxygen. The mixture contains carefully selected nutrients which supply the nutritional elements needed for optimal growth. The carbon dioxide concentration can be checked on the leafs. The constant, controlled climate eliminates damage from bad weather, minimizes infestation, accelerates plant growth, allows for numerous growth cycles each year und extends the length of storage of packaged plants because aeroponic plants can be packaged and sold as long as they are still alive. Crops with a potentially higher nutritional value than field crops are created because the nutrition supply is controlled and 10 times less water is used than in traditional agriculture.

The Future of EcoTech

When you use EcoTech systems collectively they offer numerous advantages for the future of food production. Commcercial planters benefit from increased crops and longer growth periods. EcoTech’s systems allow for Ecodomes to be build closer to city centers where they can be placed on roof areas.

Vertical Farming Cabinets





Eco Energy Tech is designing vertical farming cabinets to increase growing potential. In this design plantlets are placed at a forty-five degree angle to the rectangular cabinet, ideal for maximum natural sunlight absorption; and for artificial lighting regardless of light fixture positioning (horizontally above or vertically between rows). In addition, Eco Energy Tech is working to utilize aeroponic irrigation systems. Aeroponic nutrient / water management systems significantly reduce water and nutrient needs. These benefits address clientâs concerns for increased production space, plant safety protocols, and more efficient use of resources.

Press Release
-


									updated: Jul 5, 2017							

 


			KOWLOON, Hong Kong, 
			July 5, 2017			(Newswire.com) -
	Eco Energy Tech Asia Ltd. today announced that the company successfully went through the first phase of registration of its new trademark: Farm Palace. The trademark will be exclusively registered for the Chinese market. The registration process shall be completed within the next 2 months. For the next step, the trademark shall also be registered with the North American Market.
Eco Energy Tech Asia Ltd. has the intention to sell its self-produced biological food products in China under the new trademark. As the new Biodome in China shall be operating in the near future the company then intends to have its own trademark registered in China to successfully enter the Chinese food market. The Biodome technology with the vertical farming system in place will then produce a high capacity of organic Chinese vegetables, fruits and flowers. At the moment the company is running a testing system to verify the technology to be used and to find out about efficiency on the use of the vertical farming system to produce organic foods with high quantity.
Kelvin Mak, CEO of China Farm Palace Technology Ltd., a subsidiary of ECO Energy Asia which manages the companies' activities in China says: "The testing of the vertical farming for Chinese vegetables looks very promising. After the successful testing, we now expect to expand the existing system to start the commercial production this year." It is the company's goal to become a leading producer of organic food ecologically produced by using vertical farming in the company-owned Biodomes developed by Eco Energy Tech Asia Ltd.
About ECO Energy Tech Asia Limited:
ECO Energy Tech Asia Limited develops, markets and produces an ETFE insulated Biodome and Vertical Growing System that allows the year-round production of fresh food produce regardless of weather conditions and significantly reduces energy and input requirements.

The Company will receive no proceeds from this offering by the selling

Our competitive research shows that few players are developing integrative,
interdisciplinary approaches that match challenging goals of plant science with
hands-on, commercial growing methods specifically for the urban agriculture
context.
 
A handful of direct competitors address indoor vertical farming methods (mostly
hydroponics), growing produce on city rooftops, or bringing plant life to
abandoned industrial buildings. While vertical soilless growing systems are
being developed in various configurations, work is often limited to low-margin
leafy greens rather than tackling more challenging and profitable crops.
 
Many of our competitors are well established, have longer-standing relationships
with customers and suppliers, greater name recognition and greater financial,
technical and marketing resources. As a result, these competitors may be able to
respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing
opportunities or customer requirements. Existing or future competitors may
develop or offer products that provide price, service, number or other
advantages over those we intend to offer. If we fail to compete successfully
against current or future competitors with respect to these or other factors,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially
and adversely affected.


Company Description
Eco Energy Tech Asia, Ltd. is a development stage company. We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on
January 20, 2015. We have developed a proprietary growing system that designs
and builds custom biodomes ranging in size appropriate for global commercial
agricultural concerns


 as well as small local producers; delivering greater
yields per meter than traditional single level greenhouse operations resulting
from our multi-tier/multi-level growing system which permits us to grow a 
greater number of plants.

On February 27, 2015, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement to acquire 100%
of the outstanding capital stock of Eco Energy Tech Asia, Ltd. (“EETA”), a Hong
Kong corporation formed on December 27, 2012. Pursuant to the Share Exchange
Agreement, we issued 20,000,000 shares of our common stock to the sole
shareholder of EETA in exchange for 1,000,000 ordinary shares of EETA. The sole
shareholder of EETA, Yuen May Cheung, is also our Chief Executive Officer,
President and sole Director. EETA is also the owner of 83.34% of the common
stock of 7582919 Canada, Inc., a corporation originally formed pursuant to the
laws of British Columbia, Canada on June 21, 2010, as Renergy Foods Canada, Inc.
On March 6, 2012, Renergy Foods Canada, Inc. changed its name to NuAgri, Inc. On
October 1, 2013, NuAgri, Inc. changed its name to 7582919 Canada, Inc.

We have developed a proprietary growing system that designs and builds custom
biodomes ranging in size appropriate for global commercial agricultural concerns
as well as small local producers; delivering greater yields per meter than
traditional single level greenhouse operations as a result of our 
multi-tie/multi-level system which permits us to grow a greater number of 
plants. By avoiding a traditional, low-profit commoditized monoculture
environment, we can increase profitability by selling a higher yielding and
diversified range of high-profit niche produce.

Our proprietary biodomes are environmentally friendly and can be located
anywhere, including in the most climatically inhospitable areas. The Company’s
technologies provide the ability to grow high margin produce for tweleve (12)
months of the year, with faster growing times and cost-effective energy
management. As a result, clients will experience faster capital payback, 
enhanced profitability and compelling, consistent revenue growth.
