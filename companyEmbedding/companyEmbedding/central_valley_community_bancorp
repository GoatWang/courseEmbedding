Cameras stay turned off for White House press briefing


July 20, 2017 14:40·





Reporter Ksenija Pavlovic founder and editor-in-chief of Pavlovic Today on Wednesday became the first White House correspondent to rebel by posting live audio from the press briefing
The Washington press corps was a'twitter Wednesday afternoon with word that one courageous White House correspondent had dared to stream live the audio of the day's no-cameras-allowed White House press briefing held by Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
The restrictions on briefing coverage have intensified the friction between Mr Trump's communications staff and the White House press corps. Networks are pushing for the White House to put the briefings back on camera and be shown live.
Ksenija Pavlovic, a former political science teaching fellow at Yale and founder of her news site Pavlovic Today, used the Periscope app to stream audio of Wednesday's briefing, reports the Washington Post.Pavlovic's stream was cut off after roughly 17 minutes of recording, but she tweeted a new live stream that broadcast for another 31 minutes.

					A Radio 2 listener slammed presenter Jeremy Vine as "grossly overpaid" following the publication of his BBC pay packet. RTE are in no hurry to publish their list of top earners, despite calls for them to follow suit from the BBC .
				Spicer, who has been portrayed as beleaguered and overmatched by everyone from mainstream news media to "Saturday Night Live", took questions from hosts David Brody and Jenna Browder about health care repeal, daily press briefings and the possible move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Nevertheless, they have complied with the White House's rules, despite carrying devices that can stream video or audio with a few taps of the thumb. Since then, the networks have respected the White House's wishes.Roberts was stepping out to appear via satellite with FNC anchor Shepard Smith. This is mostly expressed by Jim Acosta, the CNN white House correspondent, who repeatedly asked Spicer last month, "Why we do not turn the cameras on" to Sean and did not receive an answer.

What You Must Know About Central Valley Community Bancorp’s (CVCY) ROE?



Andrew Carroll 


            				July 19, 2017			        


 Central Valley Community Bancorp’s (NASDAQ:CVCY) ROE of 10.1% over the past year stood above the industry average of 9.67%. Often called the ‘mother of all ratios’, Return on Equity tells you how much capital is created in percentage terms for the amount committed by a shareholder to a company. But there are multiple other aspects to consider before drawing a conclusion. View our latest analysis for Central Valley Community Bancorp 
Breaking down ROE — the mother of all ratios
 ROE is one of the most popular ratios to calculate the profitability of a company. The ratio is arrived by putting net earnings in the numerator and shareholders’ equity in the denominator.Any ROE north of 20%, implying 20 cents return on every dollar invested, is favourable for any investor. But investors seek multiple assets to diversify risk and an industry-specific comparison makes more sense to achieve the goal of choosing the best among a given lot.

Return on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders Equity

 ROE above the cost of equity estimate indicates value creation, which apparently is the only reason shares rally. The cost of equity can be estimated through a popular and Nobel-prize winning method called Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). With a few sets of assumptions, the CAPM pegs CVCY’s cost of equity at 8.7%, compared to its ROE of 10.1%.


 Central Valley Community Bancorp (NasdaqCM:CVCY) Last Perf Jul 19th 17
 
                         When we break down ROE using a very popular method called Dupont Formula, it unfolds into three key ratios which are responsible for a company’s profitability: net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. While higher margin and asset turnover indicate improved efficiency, investors should be cautious about the impact of increased leverage.

Dupont Formula
ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equity
ROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity)
ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverage

 A trend of profit growing faster than revenue is indicative of improvement in ROE. While investors should assess the past correlation between them, an assessment of the analysts’ profit and revenue forecast points to the most likely scenario going forward.Central Valley Community Bancorp’s ROA over the past 12 months stood at 1.2% versus the industry’s 1.04%. Although an investor should look at multi-year asset turnover to assess its effect on the latest ROE, a quick comparison with the industry tells him whether it’s acceptable. We use ROA for the comparison as along with sales, used in asset turnover, earnings, used in ROA, are also comparable within the industry.
 

 Central Valley Community Bancorp (NasdaqCM:CVCY) Historical Debt Jul 19th 17
 
 The impact of leverage on ROE is reflected in a company’s debt-equity profile. Rapidly rising debt compared to equity, while profit margin and asset turnover underperform, raises a red flag on the ROE. It’s important as a company can inflate its ROE by consistently increasing debt despite weak operating performance. CVCY’s debt to equity ratio currently stands at 0.03. Investors should be cautious about any sharp change in this ratio, more so if it’s due to increasing debt.
ROE – It’s not just another ratio
 While ROE can be calculated through a very simple calculation, investors should look at various ratios by breaking it down and how each of them affects the return to understand the strengths and weakness of a company. It’s one of the few ratios which stitches together performance metrics from the income statement and the balance sheet. What are the analysts’ projection of Central Valley Community Bancorp’s ROE in three years? I recommend you see our latest FREE analysis report to find out!

Arsenal and PSG back in talks over Alexis Sanchez transfer

Alonzo Mancillas |
Martes, Julio 18, 2017







Arsene Wenger's side are adamant they will not sell their star man to a domestic rival
Arsenal were doing double training sessions in sweltering heat in Shanghai on Monday for a sweaty start to the China leg of their preseason tour.Public remarks from Sanchez about his desire to be involved in Europe's top club competition have fuelled the theory he is trying to bolt for the Emirates Stadium exit before the transfer market closes. Let me remind you that in the 1/8 finals of the last drawing of the Champions League, Bayern by the sum of two meetings defeated Arsenal 2:10.
Alexis Sanchez knows where he wants to play his club football next season, but achieving that is easier said than done - and a former suitor are back in the race for the Arsenal superstar.Wenger is on tour with his team in China - they face Bayern Munich in a friendly on Wednesday - and has not made contact with Sanchez since his contentious remarks, made on a Chilean radio station.Arsenal are eyeing moves for Celtic striker Moussa Dembele and Southampton's Virgil van Dijk as Arsene Wenger aims to turn the Gunners into title contenders.PSG entering the fray could change things, though, as they might be able to either force City's hand or come in with a tempting bid of their own."Of course [he will stay]", the Frenchman was reported as saying.This is coming a week after manager Carlo Ancelotti signed Colombia's James Rodriguez on loan from Real Madrid, as there seems to be no more space in the club's attack. And the Daily Mail states that Sanchez's camp are 'confident' that the Arsenal board will eventually cave and give the player what he wants - a move to the Etihad.Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain have also been linked with the Chile international. "My thoughts are always positive"."My idea is to play and win the Champions League, it is a dream I have had since I was little".Most likely Arsenal's victory in the FA Cup final over Chelsea 2: 1, has become fatal in the fate of the French specialist Arsen Wenger. The decision is not to sell'. "That makes no sense".

I have a prepaid plan. Can I use Mobile Banking? Mobile Banking works with most prepaid plans but we cannot guarantee that your carrier supports standard U.S. short codes.

From your PC, attempt to Log In to your Personal Online Banking account, select the "Forgot Password" option. Follow the process to select a new password.

Mobile Deposit FAQ What is Mobile Deposit? Using Central Valley Community Bank’s Personal Mobile App, you can now deposit checks without having to visit the Bank or an ATM. It’s quick, easy and incredibly convenient. Mobile Deposit allows you to take a photo of your check and send it to Central Valley Community Bank for deposit into your designated account. View Mobile Deposit Terms & Conditions  How do I deposit a check using my Mobile device? To deposit a check using your Mobile device, follow the steps below:   To deposit a check   1.    Endorse the check that you will be depositing by signing and adding “For Mobile Deposit Only” to the back of the check  2.    Login to your Personal Mobile App and select “Deposit,” then “Deposit Check”  3.    Choose the account that you would like to make your deposit  4.    Enter the amount  5.    Take a photo of the front of the check  Tips for taking the photo:  Make sure you take a photo against a background that gives you strong contrast and remove any objects that show up in the picture, make sure that the entire check is visible, in focus and well lit. If the photo looks clear you can accept it.  6.    Repeat this process for taking a photo of the back of the check  7.    Review and if everything is correct, select “Submit”  8.    You can check the status of your deposit anytime, it will either have a pending, failed or accepted status  9.    Once accepted, write “Mobile Check Deposit” and the date on the front of the check and store it for 30 days before destroying ﻿  What types of checks can be processed through Mobile Deposit? All checks payable to you that are drawn in the US can be processed through Mobile Deposit. Checks that cannot be deposited are checks from foreign countries, food stamps, checks that have previously been deposited and any check that has poor image quality.  Is there a daily deposit limit? The current daily customer deposit limit is $2,500 per day. If your deposit activity through the Mobile Capture service exceeds your Daily Customer Deposit Limit, Central Valley Community Bank reserves the right to disable your access to the Mobile Capture service.  Is there a limit to the number of checks you can deposit? No, as long as you do not exceed the limit of $2,500 per day.  How secure is Mobile Deposit? Mobile Deposit is very secure. It features multiple layers of security, giving your account and check data the highest level of safety available.  When will deposits be posted into my account? Generally, check/item deposits received prior to 5:00 p.m., Pacific Standard Time are processed on the business day of receipt and available for withdrawal the day following the date of deposit provided that an extended hold has not been placed on the account. Any check image deposit received after this time or on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays when Central Valley Community Bank is closed will be processed on the Bank’s next business day. Acknowledgment that your check image deposit has been received by the Bank does not mean that the check image deposit was received error free.  What should I do with the original paper checks after deposits are made? Once accepted, write “Mobile Check Deposit” and the date on the front of the check and store it in a secure location for 30 days before destroying.  How do I prevent checks from being scanned and deposited twice? The software has built-in duplicate detection tools that detect items already captured. If the software detects potential duplicate checks, an alert prompts you to make a decision about the items in question. Also endorse the back of the check with "For Mobile Deposit Only" as a precaution. ﻿  How do I know the image quality is acceptable?  The software has an Image Quality Assessment (IQA) tool that automatically identifies problems with the check image. If a problem is detected, you'll be asked to retake the photo.  Text Banking FAQ Why are all of my Mobile Banking text messages coming from 39-872 (39872)? Central Valley Community Bank's registered short code is 39-872 (39872). You receive all Mobile Banking text messages from this number.  What is a short code? A short code is a shorter version of a phone number. Generally 5-6 numbers in length. You can send and receive text messages from a standard U.S. short code as well as a traditional phone number.  What does "standard messaging charges apply" mean? Every mobile service carrier has a different rate plan for text messaging and data service access. You may be charged per use or pay a flat rate for unlimited usage each month. You may also have different fees for text messaging and data services access. Contact your mobile carrier directly if you are not sure what fees you are charged for text messaging.  What is the difference between the text messaging service and the alerts service? The text messaging service allows you to request account balances, transaction history, and ATM and branch location information any time from your mobile phone. We send text message responses to your phone. The alerts service sends automatic notices to your mobile phone with information about your accounts.

Central Valley Community Bancorp Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 1.68% Yield (CVCY)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

FRESNO, CA and SACRAMENTO, CA, Apr 27, 2017 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- FRESNO, CA and SACRAMENTO, CA--(Marketwired - Apr 27, 2017) - Central Valley Community Bancorp (Company), together with its wholly owned subsidiary, Central Valley Community Bank (Bank)

                                         a bank holding company headquartered in Fresno, California, and Folsom Lake Bank (otcqb:FOLB), headquartered in Folsom, California, jointly announced today that a definitive merger agreement has been signed by both parties. Under the terms of the agreement, Folsom Lake Bank, with three full-service branches located in Folsom, Rancho Cordova, and Roseville, will merge with Central Valley Community Bank. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and Folsom Lake Bank shareholder approval. The Central Valley Community Bancorp and Folsom Lake Bank Boards of Directors have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.  As more fully described in the definitive merger agreement, and the investor presentation which is attached, Central Valley Community Bancorp will acquire Folsom Lake Bank in a stock merger in which the Folsom Lake Bank shareholders will be entitled to receive 0.80 shares of Central Valley Community Bancorp stock per Folsom Lake Bank share. Central Valley Community Bancorp will assume the stock option plan and outstanding stock options of Folsom Lake Bank as part of the transaction. Based on the closing price of Central Valley Community Bancorp on April 27, 2017, the fully diluted transaction consideration is $33.6 million, or $18.74 per Folsom Lake Bank common share. However, the deal value will fluctuate with changes in Central Valley Community Bancorp's stock price through the closing date. Central Valley Community Bancorp expects the transaction will be 1.8% dilutive to tangible book value per share initially resulting in tangible book value earnback of less than 2.5 years, 3% accretive to earnings per share in 2018 and an IRR greater than 15%.  The Central Valley Community Bancorp Board of Directors and the Central Valley Community Bank Executive Management team, led by James M. Ford, President and CEO, will continue to lead the combined team of professional bankers. Robert Flautt, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Folsom Lake Bank, will join Central Valley Community Bank through a transition period.  This merger with Folsom Lake Bank will become the fifth acquisition for Central Valley Community Bancorp, which acquired Sierra Vista Bank on October 1, 2016; Visalia Community Bank on July 1, 2013; Service 1st Bancorp and its subsidiary Service 1st Bank on November 12, 2008; and Bank of Madera County on January 1, 2005.  As of March 31, 2017, on a pro forma consolidated basis with Folsom Lake Bank, Central Valley Community Bancorp would have had approximately $1.7 billion in total assets. Existing Central Valley Community Bancorp shareholders will own approximately 90.5% of the outstanding shares following the merger and Folsom Lake Bank shareholders are expected to own approximately 9.5%.  The directors and certain executives of Folsom Lake Bank have entered into agreements pursuant to which they have committed to vote their shares of Folsom Lake Bank in favor of the acquisition.  "For nearly four decades, Central Valley Community Bank has grown profitably and sensibly, building a highly attractive franchise in Central California's San Joaquin Valley and Greater Sacramento Region. Folsom Lake Bank's like-minded business model and Greater Sacramento presence in Folsom, Rancho Cordova and Roseville presents a timely opportunity to further our northern California growth potential, providing strength and size to meet the shared service needs of customers; provide professional growth opportunities for employees; and offer greater earnings power for shareholders," stated James M. Ford, President and CEO of Central Valley Community Bancorp and Central Valley Community Bank.  "We expect that there will be abundant opportunity for businesses, customers, employees, and the community by uniting our two great banks," concluded Ford.  "Folsom Lake Bank was founded in 2007 and opened for business on April 3, 2007 with the commitment to provide the communities surrounding Folsom Lake with a true independent bank for its small businesses and residents. It is with great pleasure that we merge with Central Valley Community Bank, as their community banking roots, financial industry leadership, stability, and respected culture of professional bankers are committed to the same shared values of customer advocacy and service to the community," stated Robert Flautt, President, CEO and Director of Folsom Lake Bank.  "This partnership brings value to the shareholders of both banks, and as a combined organization, customers will benefit by higher lending limits, expanded product offerings, and a significantly larger branch network that spans to the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley," concluded Flautt.  Central Valley Community Bancorp trades on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol CVCY. Central Valley Community Bank, headquartered in Fresno, California, was founded in 1979 and is the sole subsidiary of Central Valley Community Bancorp. Central Valley Community Bank operates 22 full-service offices throughout California's San Joaquin Valley and Greater Sacramento Region. Additionally, the Bank maintains Commercial Real Estate, Agribusiness and SBA Lending Departments. Central Valley Investment Services are provided by Investment Centers of America, Inc.

Under the terms of the agreement, Folsom Lake Bank, with three full-service branches located in Folsom, Rancho Cordova, and Roseville, will merge with Central Valley Community Bank. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and Folsom Lake Bank shareholder approval. The Central Valley Community Bancorp and Folsom Lake Bank Boards of Directors have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.As more fully described in the definitive merger agreement, and the investor presentation which is attached, Central Valley Community Bancorp will acquire Folsom Lake Bank in a stock merger in which the Folsom Lake Bank shareholders will be entitled to receive 0.80 shares of Central Valley Community Bancorp stock per Folsom Lake Bank share. Central Valley Community Bancorp will assume the stock option plan and outstanding stock options of Folsom Lake Bank as part of the transaction. Based on the closing price of Central Valley Community Bancorp on April 27, 2017, the fully diluted transaction consideration is $33.6 million, or $18.74 per Folsom Lake Bank common share. However, the deal value will fluctuate with changes in Central Valley Community Bancorp's stock price through the closing date. Central Valley Community Bancorp expects the transaction will be 1.8% dilutive to tangible book value per share initially resulting in tangible book value earnback of less than 2.5 years, 3% accretive to earnings per share in 2018 and an IRR greater than 15%.The Central Valley Community Bancorp Board of Directors and the Central Valley Community Bank Executive Management team, led by James M. Ford, President and CEO, will continue to lead the combined team of professional bankers. Robert Flautt, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of Folsom Lake Bank, will join Central Valley Community Bank through a transition period.This merger with Folsom Lake Bank will become the fifth acquisition for Central Valley Community Bancorp, which acquired Sierra Vista Bank on October 1, 2016; Visalia Community Bank on July 1, 2013; Service 1st Bancorp and its subsidiary Service 1st Bank on November 12, 2008; and Bank of Madera County on January 1, 2005.As of March 31, 2017, on a pro forma consolidated basis with Folsom Lake Bank, Central Valley Community Bancorp would have had approximately $1.7 billion in total assets. Existing Central Valley Community Bancorp shareholders will own approximately 90.5% of the outstanding shares following the merger and Folsom Lake Bank shareholders are expected to own approximately 9.5%.The directors and certain executives of Folsom Lake Bank have entered into agreements pursuant to which they have committed to vote their shares of Folsom Lake Bank in favor of the acquisition."For nearly four decades, Central Valley Community Bank has grown profitably and sensibly, building a highly attractive franchise in Central California's San Joaquin Valley and Greater Sacramento Region. Folsom Lake Bank's like-minded business model and Greater Sacramento presence in Folsom, Rancho Cordova and Roseville presents a timely opportunity to further our northern California growth potential, providing strength and size to meet the shared service needs of customers; provide professional growth opportunities for employees; and offer greater earnings power for shareholders," stated James M. Ford, President and CEO of Central Valley Community Bancorp and Central Valley Community Bank."We expect that there will be abundant opportunity for businesses, customers, employees, and the community by uniting our two great banks," concluded Ford."Folsom Lake Bank was founded in 2007 and opened for business on April 3, 2007 with the commitment to provide the communities surrounding Folsom Lake with a true independent bank for its small businesses and residents. It is with great pleasure that we merge with Central Valley Community Bank, as their community banking roots, financial industry leadership, stability, and respected culture of professional bankers are committed to the same shared values of customer advocacy and service to the community," stated Robert Flautt, President, CEO and Director of Folsom Lake Bank.Read More"This partnership brings value to the shareholders of both banks, and as a combined organization, customers will benefit by higher lending limits, expanded product offerings, and a significantly larger branch network that spans to the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley," concluded Flautt.Central Valley Community Bancorp trades on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol CVCY.
