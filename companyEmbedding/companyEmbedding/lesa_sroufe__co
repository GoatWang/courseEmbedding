The Insider: Label this a clever attention-getter

Back to Gallery
















The Insider is the P-I business staff's weekly compendium of quips, quotes, observations, asides, tidbits, weird facts and gossip.
FAUX FAUX PAS?: The bilingual labels sewn into backpacks and briefcases by Tom Bihn, a Port Angeles manufacturer, earlier this week carried more than care instructions. Appended to the French version of those instructions were the words, "Nous sommes désolés que notre president soit un idiot. Nous n'avons pas voté pour lui." In English, that means, "We are sorry our president is an idiot. We didn't vote for him."



Bihn, 43, who's president of the privately held company he started 13 years ago, said he thinks the labels were meant to refer to him.
"But if someone else wants to take it as being about some other president, they're free to do that," he said.
He doesn't know who made the unauthorized amendment and doesn't much care. No one was reprimanded or fired. 



Latest business videos




 
"There are bigger fish to fry," he said.
About 1,000 of the doctored labels were sewn into products this week, and the remaining supply of about 700 will be used next week. 
Partly because of nationwide publicity over the label, sales of the company's products last week were double those of any prior week, Bihn said. 
The company has now made T-shirts bearing an enlarged reproduction of the label. All proceeds will benefit the Seattle Vet Center.
AN APPLE A DAY: It may seem like an unusual promotion for a company owned by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. But Corbis -- the Seattle digital imaging company that Gates formed 15 years ago -- is giving away an Apple G5 computer every weekday this month as a way to build loyalty among the creative professionals who use its online stock photography service.
"Don't tell the boss," joked Corbis spokesman Dov Schiff. 
Microsoft and Apple have been rivals for years, primarily because the companies make competing operating systems. While Microsoft's Windows is by far the dominant operating system on the planet, Apple still maintains a strong following among copywriters, graphic designers and photo editors.
And those creative professionals fall squarely in the middle of Corbis' market.
The Web site promotion, which features artwork of Adam and Eve sharing an apple in the Garden of Eden, is not inexpensive. An Apple G5 -- complete with a 23-inch display -- retails for $4,998. Corbis is giving away 22 this month for a grand total of $109,956. 
But that's not all. Part of the promotion includes placing chalk drawings in front of 1,800 advertising agencies, graphic design shops and news organizations that use the Corbis service. The company also is sending clients boxes of apples with Corbis' stickers on them. 
"If you think about it, we are really advertising to advertisers and marketing to marketers," said Schiff. "So we have to be really creative in terms of how we approach them."
LIVING IN LUXURY: Want exclusive seating at the Pacific Northwest Ballet, a complimentary appetizer at Metropolitan Grill or on-field privileges before a Seattle Seahawks game?
You can receive those special perks, along with many more, by paying $375 each year to join a new Seattle company called WhiteTie. Founded by Glenn Walker, the company bills itself as a "luxury membership organization." It currently has partnerships with 35 upscale hotels, restaurants, spas and entertainment venues in the Pacific Northwest. Showing the WhiteTie card at those establishments results in discounts, personalized service and other special treatment. 
Shaun Tucker, the director of food and beverage at Barking Frog, a 3 1/2-year-old Woodinville restaurant, said he is excited about the partnership.
"It is a nice opportunity for us to get exposure to the clientele that WhiteTie is tailoring to," said Tucker. "Their slogan is 'the power of recognition' and that is something we try to do is recognize all of our guests."
In addition to perks at restaurants and retailers, WhiteTie plans to run an online classified section where wealthy individuals can post items for sale. The company will hold a private launch party in the penthouse suite of the Sorrento Hotel later this month.
BACK IN BUSINESS I: Lesa Sroufe made a name for herself in Seattle's investment community as research director and later chairman and chief executive of Ragen MacKenzie Inc. After that company was acquired by Wells Fargo she stayed on as director of research and executive committee member for Wells Fargo's private asset management.
She took a year off from the business world, but is now back as president of the newly formed Lesa Sroufe & Co., which will provide advisory services to its own investment clients as well as other money managers. Sroufe said her firm will focus on her long-time interest in value, sometimes contrarian, investing, finding underpriced, overlooked and often out-of favor stocks.
One of the decisions Sroufe faced in starting her business (located in the IBM building downtown) was what to call it; while she's well known in the local investment scene, she also has a name that's frequently mispronounced and misspelled. One of her goals, Sroufe says, is to retire with people having learned how to spell and pronounce both parts correctly. For the record, the first name is pronounced like Lisa, the last like "Shroaf" (rhymes with "oath").
BACK IN BUSINESS II: A few weeks ago we reported that a long-time Renton business, the contractor yard Seattle Lumber, was going through a liquidation sale after its lease was not renewed. Now the company has had a reprieve. Another venerable Renton business, McLendon Hardware, will buy the assets of Seattle Lumber, retain the employees and continue to operate it under that name. Mike McLendon, secretary of the retailer, says acquiring Seattle Lumber will be a way "to serve contractors better than we can do it in our stores sometimes."
That's not the only project McLendon has going on. Having acquired the former Kmart store on Rainier Avenue, McLendon has completed the demolition phase and is now awaiting a construction permit to remodel the space. McLendon said the retailer hopes to open its new flagship store in September or October. 
CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THAT FUNGO STUFF: Some baseball fans have protested that the live, webcasted Major League Baseball games newly available through MSN for $9.95 per month, as described in the P-I on Wednesday, can't be had in the quantity they'd like.
Some games aren't televised at all, so MLB can't pick up that signal, digitize it and feed it into the Internet, acknowledged spokesman Jim Gallagher. Some are blacked out in their home towns, to protect the local broadcaster. Games played Sunday after 2 p.m. Seattle time are blacked out everywhere, because they're carried nationwide by Fox.
A nationwide blackout Wednesday night denied access to all the games played that night, but such occurrences will be rare, Gallagher said. With 2,430 games played every season, MLB promises to webcast an average of 280 per month -- more than the 240 per month touted on its Web site.
