General Lance W. Lord (born July 12, 1946)[1] is a retired four-star general in the U.S. Air Force, and was the Commander of Air Force Space Command at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado.
General Lord was educated at Castle Heights Military Academy[2] and Otterbein College, where he earned a Bachelor's Degree and graduated from the ROTC program. He later earned a Master's degree from the University of North Dakota.[3] After entering the Air Force in 1969, he served four years of Minuteman II ICBM alert duty and then completed a series of Air Staff and joint duty assignments in strategic missiles. He directed the Ground-Launched Cruise Missile Program Management Office in Europe. He was a Military Assistant to the Director of Net Assessment in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and represented the Air Force as a research associate in international security affairs at Ohio State University.
General Lord commanded two ICBM wings in Wyoming and North Dakota. In California he commanded a space wing responsible for satellite launch and ballistic missile test launch operations. He served as Director of Plans and as Vice Commander for Headquarters Air Force Space Command. The general led Air Force education and training as Commandant of Squadron Officer School, Commander of 2nd Air Force, Commander of Air University and Director of Education for Air Education and Training Command. Prior to assuming command of Space Command, he was the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. He retired on April 1, 2006.
In 2004 while serving as Air Force Space Command Commander, General Lance Lord announced the introduction of a new space badge. The new combined Space and Missile Operations Badge, informally known as "spings" (SPace wINGS), "Space Boomerang", or "Space Blade" replaced the Missile Badge for operators. In addition, the new badge is no longer limited to pure space and missile operators/maintainers, but is also awarded to 61XX, 62XX and 63XX (officer) AFSCs who have performed space/ICBM acquisition duties, even if they were non-operational in nature.

He later earned a Master's degree from the University of North Dakota.[3] After entering the Air Force in 1969, he served four years of Minuteman II ICBM alert duty and then completed a series of Air Staff and joint duty assignments in strategic missiles. He directed the Ground-Launched Cruise Missile Program Management Office in Europe. He was a Military Assistant to the Director of Net Assessment in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and represented the Air Force as a research associate in international security affairs at Ohio State University.
General Lord commanded two ICBM wings in Wyoming and North Dakota. In California he commanded a space wing responsible for satellite launch and ballistic missile test launch operations. He served as Director of Plans and as Vice Commander for Headquarters Air Force Space Command. The general led Air Force education and training as Commandant of Squadron Officer School, Commander of 2nd Air Force, Commander of Air University and Director of Education for Air Education and Training Command. Prior to assuming command of Space Command, he was the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. He retired on April 1, 2006.
In 2004 while serving as Air Force Space Command Commander, General Lance Lord announced the introduction of a new space badge. The new combined Space and Missile Operations Badge, informally known as "spings" (SPace wINGS), "Space Boomerang", or "Space Blade" replaced the Missile Badge for operators. In addition, the new badge is no longer limited to pure space and missile operators/maintainers, but is also awarded to 61XX, 62XX and 63XX (officer) AFSCs who have performed space/ICBM acquisition duties, even if they were non-operational in nature.

General Lance W. Lord (born July 12, 1946) is a retired four-star general in the U.S. Air Force, and was the Commander of Air Force Space Command at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado. General Lord was educated at Castle Heights Military Academy and Otterbein College, where he earned a Bachelor's Degree and graduated from the ROTC program. He later earned a Master's degree from the University of North Dakota. After entering the Air Force in 1969, he served four years of Minuteman II ICBM alert duty and then completed a series of Air Staff and joint duty assignments in strategic missiles. He directed the Ground-Launched Cruise Missile Program Management Office in Europe. He was a Military Assistant to the Director of Net Assessment in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and represented the Air Force as a research associate in international security affairs at Ohio State University. General Lord commanded two ICBM wings in Wyoming and North Dakota. In California he commanded a space wing responsible for satellite launch and ballistic missile test launch operations. He served as Director of Plans and as Vice Commander for Headquarters Air Force Space Command. The general led Air Force education and training as Commandant of Squadron Officer School, Commander of 2nd Air Force, Commander of Air University and Director of Education for Air Education and Training Command. Prior to assuming command of Space Command, he was the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. He retired on April 1, 2006. In 2004 while serving as Air Force Space Command Commander, General Lance Lord announced the introduction of a new space badge. The new combined Space and Missile Operations Badge, informally known as "spings" (SPace wINGS), "Space Boomerang", or "Space Blade" replaced the Missile Badge for operators. In addition, the new badge is no longer limited to pure space and missile operators/maintainers, but is also awarded to 61XX, 62XX and 63XX (officer) AFSCs who have performed space/ICBM acquisition duties, even if they were non-operational in nature.

 Here is something useful for people who need simple and convenient image resizing tool. Initially planned to review only ResizR but things got out of control after dicovering several good alternatives, so here you go. Normally any extensive image editing best done using desktop software like Photoshop, that can do lot more then mere resizing. But when all you need is simply to resize picture starting fat photoshop is not very convenient.
ResizR a product of  lord-lance.com, is a web based tool for resizing images online. To resize image simply go to the resizr.lord-lance.com, click on the “Browse” button to select the image, specify desired width and click ‘resize’ button. In addition to local images you can also resize images from the web. ResizR also offers a Firefox plugin to make things even easier and faster. One drawback is that it only resizes JPG files
Doing some resizing of Sofia:

Alternative Tools:

Resizr.com: this service has same name but actually different. It supports JPG, GIF and PNG formats but looks quite ugly.
Imagewell: (something for Mac users) this is free image editing software for quick manipulation and upload to an iDisk (.mac account), FTP server or other web server. I was not able to test this one, so no comments or promises here.
Microsoft image resizer(Win XP users): This needs to be downloaded and installed before use but totally worth it. Using this one images can simply be resized though ‘image right click -> resize image’.
Imagesquash.com: Nothing really extraordinary that distinguished it from above ones. Supports JPG, GIF and PNG formats.
My-I-Size.com: Allmost a copy of above reviewed resizr.lord-lance.com but with a little different look.
Resize2mail.com: Has some extra good features.(GIF, JPG formats)
[NO LONGER WORKS] Dosize.com: If you need to resize multiple images simultaneously(upto 10 images), this is a tool to use.
pxn8.com: Simple and Good looking web based photoshop alternative.
Snipshot: – One of the easiest to use, and also offers browser plugins for firefox, IE and Safari

More or less all of the services above do the same task of resizing images, however when it comes to selecting few I would give my preference to the Microsoft Image resizer, a desktop application from Microsoft. And as among web based tools I really liked tools from resizr.lord-lance.com and Snipshot.com.

Thanks for the list. I think reshade is far better than any other resizing tool. The quality that it offers in the resized pictures is one of the best and itâ€™s a lot cheaper than other competitor products .It took quite some time to discover and I wish people would talk more about it.

Thanks for putting My-I-Size in!
You said:

But actually, Resizr (the main subject of the article) supports only GIF and My-I-Size supports JPG, PNG and GIF.
Thanks!

General Lance W. Lord (born July 12, 1946)[1] is a retired four-star general in the U.S. Air Force, and was the Commander of Air Force Space Command at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado.
General Lord was educated at Castle Heights Military Academy[2] and Otterbein College, where he earned a Bachelor's Degree and graduated from the ROTC program. He later earned a Master's degree from the University of North Dakota.[3] After entering the Air Force in 1969, he served four years of Minuteman II ICBM alert duty and then completed a series of Air Staff and joint duty assignments in strategic missiles. He directed the Ground-Launched Cruise Missile Program Management Office in Europe. He was a Military Assistant to the Director of Net Assessment in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and represented the Air Force as a research associate in international security affairs at Ohio State University.
General Lord commanded two ICBM wings in Wyoming and North Dakota. In California he commanded a space wing responsible for satellite launch and ballistic missile test launch operations. He served as Director of Plans and as Vice Commander for Headquarters Air Force Space Command. The general led Air Force education and training as Commandant of Squadron Officer School, Commander of 2nd Air Force, Commander of Air University and Director of Education for Air Education and Training Command. Prior to assuming command of Space Command, he was the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. He retired on April 1, 2006.
In 2004 while serving as Air Force Space Command Commander, General Lance Lord announced the introduction of a new space badge. The new combined Space and Missile Operations Badge, informally known as "spings" (SPace wINGS), "Space Boomerang", or "Space Blade" replaced the Missile Badge for operators. In addition, the new badge is no longer limited to pure space and missile operators/maintainers, but is also awarded to 61XX, 62XX and 63XX (officer) AFSCs who have performed space/ICBM acquisition duties, even if they were non-operational in nature.

General Lance W. Lord (born July 12, 1946)[1] is a retired four-star general in the U.S. Air Force, and was the Commander of Air Force Space Command at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado.
General Lord was educated at Castle Heights Military Academy[2] and Otterbein College, where he earned a Bachelor's Degree and graduated from the ROTC program. He later earned a Master's degree from the University of North Dakota.[3] After entering the Air Force in 1969, he served four years of Minuteman II ICBM alert duty and then completed a series of Air Staff and joint duty assignments in strategic missiles. He directed the Ground-Launched Cruise Missile Program Management Office in Europe. He was a Military Assistant to the Director of Net Assessment in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and represented the Air Force as a research associate in international security affairs at Ohio State University.
General Lord commanded two ICBM wings in Wyoming and North Dakota. In California he commanded a space wing responsible for satellite launch and ballistic missile test launch operations. He served as Director of Plans and as Vice Commander for Headquarters Air Force Space Command. The general led Air Force education and training as Commandant of Squadron Officer School, Commander of 2nd Air Force, Commander of Air University and Director of Education for Air Education and Training Command. Prior to assuming command of Space Command, he was the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. He retired on April 1, 2006.
In 2004 while serving as Air Force Space Command Commander, General Lance Lord announced the introduction of a new space badge. The new combined Space and Missile Operations Badge, informally known as "spings" (SPace wINGS), "Space Boomerang", or "Space Blade" replaced the Missile Badge for operators. In addition, the new badge is no longer limited to pure space and missile operators/maintainers, but is also awarded to 61XX, 62XX and 63XX (officer) AFSCs who have performed space/ICBM acquisition duties, even if they were non-operational in nature.

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
