 Susan Mahony/Eli Lilly
Dr. Sue Mahony is president of Lilly Oncology as well as senior vice president for Eli Lilly and Company. Sue joined Lilly in 2000 with over a decade in sales and marketing roles in Europe and the United Kingdom. From there, she worked in a variety of roles in global marketing and product development, leading Lilly’s operations in Canada, later becoming senior vice president in 2009 and president in 2011.
Sue is first-generation Irish American, having been born in London to David and Anna with family hailing from Cork City and Coolea, Co. Cork. While she was raised in England, most of Sue’s family now resides in Ireland and she remembers fondly the summers she spent in Coolea saying “it’s a beautiful country with wonderful people. I am extremely proud of my Irish heritage.”
Sue learned from an early age working in a card shop the importance of hard work and dedication which she carried through to her studies. She attended Aston University in Great Britain where she received a B.Sc. in pharmacy, later completing a Ph.D. in Aston’s Cancer Research Campaign Experimental Chemotherapy Group. Sue did not stop there, but went on to the London School of Business where she completed a master’s degree in business administration. She serves on the board of the United Way of Central Indiana and in 2010 was recognized as one of Indianapolis Business Journal’s “Women of Influence.” Sue and her husband John have two children, Thomas and Rebecca.

    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings. When necessary, family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist.


    The doctors may also provide physicals, inoculations, prenatal care, treat chronic diseases, like diabetes and asthma, and provide advice on disease prevention.
