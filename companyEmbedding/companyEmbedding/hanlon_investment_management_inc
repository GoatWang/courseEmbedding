													Hanlon Investment Management Launches New Mutual Funds											

Income and tactical strategies now available in portable, mutual fund structure
October 7, 2015
Egg Harbor Township, NJ – Hanlon Investment Management, a leading tactical investment manager announced today the availability of two new mutual funds, the Hanlon Managed Income Fund and the Hanlon Tactical Dividend and Momentum Fund.
Both funds seek to attempt to limit downside risk, a goal of the Hanlon Investment Management approach for over 15 years. The Hanlon Managed Income Fund (HANAX, HANCX, HANIX, HANRX) seeks to provide current income, capital preservation and positive risk adjusted returns, while the Hanlon Tactical Dividend and Momentum Fund (HTDAX, HTDCX, HTDIX, HTDRX) seeks to provide capital appreciation and current income.

“Over the past decade and a half, we’ve had great success working with advisors on similar investing strategies in individual managed account and UMA structures”, said Sean Hanlon, CEO of Hanlon Investment Management. “Based on demand from advisors and their financial institutions, we are pleased to now offer access to this investment approach in a portable, mutual fund vehicle that will be available on all of the industry’s leading fund platforms.”
Hanlon’s philosophy on investment management is to aid clients in achieving long‐term goals by providing tactical investment strategies to take advantage of market movements and changes in the investment climate. By exiting the market when Hanlon’s proprietary science indicates market weakness, Hanlon clients can avoid large drawdowns in their assets, while at the same time being able to enjoy the benefits of market appreciation by moving back into the markets during periods of market strength.
“In today’s more volatile market environment, advisors and their clients need more sophisticated investment strategies to meet their financial goals and objectives.” Hanlon said. “Our tactical overlay approach combined with the academic and private sector research on the benefits of dividends and momentum as notable factors in generating alpha over the long term are part of that approach and our new mutual fund products will provide the industry with broader access to these strategies.”
To learn more about the Hanlon Managed Income Fund and the Hanlon Tactical Dividend and Momentum Fund, please logon to www.HanlonFunds.com for their relevant fact sheets. Both funds are available in A, C, I and R shares.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

 Career History



Founder

Hanlon Investment Management, Inc.


                  Hanlon Investment Management manages investments in equities and bonds primarily for high net-worth individuals. The firm employs a tactical and strategic asset allocation investment selection approach. The tactical component is based on a proprietary combination of technical, quantitative and volume analysis. The objective of Hanlon's tactical analysis is to decide whether to invest in the equity and/or bond markets, and if so, what amounts should be invested. The firm performs tactical analysis of the markets on a daily basis. Once they have conducted their daily tactical analysis, Hanlon administers the strategic component of their investment process. Through this process, the firm analyses all available fund styles to rank and determine which are performing best on a risk-adjusted return basis. Hanlon seeks to create portfolios with the fund styles that are providing the best return in the current environment, while attempting to reduce risk.Tactical decisions to go out of the equity market are made when the risk-adjusted return potential of the overall market deteriorates enough to partially or totally reduce equity exposure. Strategic changes occur when the risk-adjusted return potential of their investments become less favorable when compared to other available opportunities.Hanlon's bond investment consist primarily of high yield funds, although they may invest in Government and high grade corporate bonds when high yield opportunities are not available in a particular product. In general, the firm will make changes in their bond investments when the prices of their bond holdings decline or when the prices of other bond segments begin to show relative strength as compared to their current holdings.
