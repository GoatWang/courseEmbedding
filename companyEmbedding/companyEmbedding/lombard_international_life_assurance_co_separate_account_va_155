Legal Decisions Involving Admission of Economic Testimony

 This
web page includes descriptions of reported legal decisions that are
directly relevant to the admissibility of economic expert testimony,
primarily in personal injury, wrongful death and wrongful termination
cases. Decisions that establish general standard for admission of
expert witness testimny are also included. However, decisions regarding
the admissibility of "hedonic damages testimony" are not included.
Those decisions can be found at "Hedonic Damages Decisions."  The
descriptions in this list are also provided in the more general list of
legal cases of interest to forensic economists available by clicking on
      "Useful Decisions."   The same
organizational structure is used for this page that is used in the more
general list. Decisions in federal court are listed under the United
States Supreme Court,  1st Circuit  Court of Appeals,
District Court Decisons in the 1st Curcuit, 2nd Circuit,  District
Courts in the 2nd Circuit and so forth, and then by states in
alphabetic order. If  there are no decisions in one of the venues,
that venue will not be listed.

United     States    Supreme     Court

Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc., 509 U.S. 579;
                             113 S.Ct. 2786; 125 L.Ed.469 (1993)(Daubert
   I).        This     decision         states     that the Frye Test
from   Fry v.  United      States,     293 F. 1013    (D.C.     Cir. 1923)
    had  been superceded    by  Rule 702   of  the Federal  Rules  of  Evidence 
     (FRE)  that  were   adopted  by Congress     in 1975. It directed  that
    trial court    judges    should   act as “gatekeepers”     to insure
that    evidence  presented in    court was   scientifically  reliable, 
   subject    to four general  tests:   (1) Whether   the theory or technique
 underlying       the testimony can  be  or has been  tested;  (2) whether
the theory  or  technique       has been  subject  to peer review; (3)  the
known or  potential  rate of   error    should  be determined,    as should
the existence  and  maintenance  of standards    controlling the  technique’s
   operation;  (4)  whether the  theory or technique     has been  generally
accepted    by the  relevant scientific   community.              
General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136; 118 S.Ct 512
                             (1997). Deals with admissibility of expert testimony.Deals
              with     admissibility          of expert  testimony.
Joiner       is   the    second  in   the triumvirate   of   decisions  
 of the United      States   Supreme    Court  elaborating   the meaning
   of  the Daubert       decision.   The 11th    Circuit  had reversed  
the decision  of  a trial     court judge      not to  allow  testimony 
of a medical   expert, suggesting         that the  standards     for  excluding
 testimony were   more stringent     than  the   tests for admitting    testimony.
 The Supreme Court  made  it   clear that  trial   court judges  have considerable
  discretion and   reversed   the 11th  Circuit  decision.   Justice Bryer’s
concurring   opinion   strongly    encourages  trial court  judges   to make
use of Federal Rule   106,  which    allows court  appointed experts.   
     
Kumho Tire Co., Ltd v. Carmichael, 509 U.S. 579; 119 S.Ct.
                             1167 (1999). This decision made it clear that 
 while      none     of   the    original         four Daubert tests may apply
 in  a  given  instance,        the general   test  of   scientific     reliability
    applies  to all types      of expert testimony.               
Weisgram v. Marley, 528 U.S. 440; 120 S.Ct. 1011; 145 L.Ed.
                             2d 958 (2000). Held that if expert testimony
that     was    the    basis      for    a  claim    was held inadmissible,
the   cause   of   action   could be   dismissed       without   a  right
of appeal. 

Winans v. The New

 Ed. 68,    1858   U.S. LEXIS  626 (1858).     “Experience   has    shown 
 that   opposite     opinions of persons professing     to be experts   may 
   be obtained   to      any amount;   and it often occurs     that not only 
 many  days,    but   even weeks,    are consumed  in cross-examinations, 
    to test the skill      or knowledge of such   witnesses and  the correctness 
     of their opinions,      wasting the time  and wearying   the patience 
  of  both   court and jury,    and   perplexing,  instead  of elucidating, 
   the questions      involved    in the issue.”

1st Circuit 

    Court
                      of Appeals
Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 
                             175 F.3d 18 (1st Cir. 1999). Ruled specifically 
   that           Daubert               and          Kumho 
applied    to   economic analysis, stating:       "the     district     
court's gatekeeping       function extendes to all expert      evidence, 
   including    economic       analysis, not merely to evidence  involving 
   scientific     conclusions.
Cummings v. The Standard Register Company,
265 F. 3d 56 (1st Cir. 2001). This decision responds in part to an
error in testimony initially made by economic expert Martin
Duffy.  After being cross examined, Duffy realized that he had
made an error in calculating front pay at $656,867. After correcting
his figures, Duffy then testified to front pay losses of $494,712. His
figures for back pay were deemed correct. Duffy’s report was not
entered into evidence and the jury awarded $665,000  for front
pay. The 1st Circuit determined that the jury had probably been
confused by the initial error in Duffy’s calculation and offered
Cummings the option of accepting $494,712 or a new trial. The court
also determined under a Daubert standard that the district court had
been correct in determining that Duffy’s testimony was admissible
and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to
strike the testimony of Duffy.

Quinones-Pancheo v. American Airlines, Inc., 979 F.2d (1st
                             Cir. 1992)  Economic expert Mario Puchi
based      his    projections            on   the    assumption that the
injured   plaintiff       had intended to   reenlist        in  the military
   and   remain there    until   eligible to retire   on a military     
 pension.      The economic       expert   also assumed  that  the plaitiff
had   a   total  and permanent       disability,      which was not  borne
out by the   facts  of the  case.    The economic    expert was    not permitted 
 to testify.
Stevens v. Bangor and Aroostook, R.R., 97 F.3d 594 (1st Cir. 
                             1996). The plaintiff's vocational expert was 
permitted          to   testify. 
Torrez-Ocasio v. Texaco Puerto Rico, Inc.,
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56102 (D. Puerto Rico, 2007). This is was a
decision by Judge Juan M. Perez-Gimenez to grant a motion in limine to
bar the testimony of plaintiff’s Life Care Planner, Gerri
Pennachio, and economist Francisco E. Martinez based on the fact that
the plaintiff had admitted that the testimony of plaintiff’s
expert witness Dr. Jaime Zorba did not meet Daubert standards. Since
the proposed testimony of the economist depended on the testimony of
the Life Care Planner and the testimony of the Life Care Planner
depended on the testimony of Dr. Zorba, the failure of his testimony to
meet Daubert standard rendered the testimonies of Life Care Planner and
economist inadmissible.
    District
                      Courts in the 1st Circuit (MA, ME, NH, RI and Puerto 
 Rico)
Griffith v. Eastern Maine Medical Center,
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16236 (D. Me. 2009). The court granted a defense
motion to exclude the economic testimony of Dr. Ray Neveu based on his
failure to issue a complete report of his opinions by the scheduling
deadline. Dr. Neveu’s report indicated that he would provide
details of his opinions in a “timely fashion,” which the
judge did not regard as meeting the requirements of the Court. The
Court said: “This court has already specified what "a timely
fashion" is in this case in its scheduling order. That is not a matter
to be determined at the convenience of the expert witness, particularly
when no reason is given why the expert cannot comply with the deadline
set in the court's scheduling order. An expert's complete report is due
at a specific time during the discovery period in order to allow
opposing counsel to depose the expert, if desired, and to allow the
opposing party's expert witness time to respond to the opinions
expressed in the report, also within the discovery period, so that the
plaintiff's counsel will also have an opportunity to explore those
opinions before the end of discovery and the deadline for the filing of
dispositive motions. See Thibeault v. Square D Co.,
960 F.2d 239, 244 (1st Cir. 1992) (Rule 26 promotes fair play in
discovery and at trial). Allowing an expert to express his opinions
"before trial" at a time chosen by the expert would throw in disarray
the orderly procedure that the civil rules are designed to promote. See
      Ortiz-Lopez v. Sociedad Espanola de Auxilio Mutuo y Beneficiencia de Puerto Rico,
248 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir. 2001). An expert can always supplement his or
her opinions after submitting a report, should the need arise. What the
expert cannot do is dictate the timing and progress of the case; that
is a matter solely within the court's control.”
2nd Circuit
    Court
                      of Appeals
Amorgianos v. National Railroad, 2002 U.S. App. Lexis, 17792 

                             (2nd Cir. 2002). This decision affirms a trial 
 court       decision         that     had    reversed  a jury verdict in 
favor of   a  plaintiff,   followed        by a        Daubert    
hearing   to  preclude  testimony   by two   plaintiff      experts and a
summary judgement      in   favor of the  defendants   following     the decision
in the Daubert   hearing.     The  decision  of the   trial court    was
137 F.Supp.2d 147   (E.D.N.Y.  2001).       This is a  short decision
   that discusses  all four of  the United States  Supreme    Court cases
from   Daubert to  the present that  involve admissibility  of  expert  
 testimony.    The  discussion begins from       Daubert v. Merrell  
 Dow, 509    U.S.  579   (1993),  proceeds  through       Gen. Elec. 
   Co. V. Joiner,    522  U.S.    135 (1997),        Kumho  Tire Co. 
 V. Carmichael,     526 U.S. 137  and       Weisgram   v. Marley Co, 
  528 U.S. 440 (2000),      before upholding   the decision  of the trial 
court judge.   It also     cites its own decision     in       McCullock 
 v. H.B. Fuller Co,   61  F.3d 1038 (2nd Cir. 1995)     to the effect 
that the abuse of discretion    standards,  which is the standard      used 
to challenge a trial court judge    on admissibility  issues, is based   
 on how the trial court went about   determining  reliability  as much as 
 it   ultimate decision.  The 2nd   Circuit cited        In re Paoli 
  R.R. Yard  PCB Litig., 35 F. 3d   717 (3rd Cir. 1994)  as saying: “[T]he 
  reliability  analysis applies to all  aspects of an expert’s  testimony: 
 the  methodology,  the facts underlying   the expert’s opinion, the  link 
 between  the facts and  the conclusion, et   alia.”  (Submitted by Jerry 
 Martin.) 

 Boucher v. U.S. Suzuki Motor Corp., 73
                             F3d 18 (2nd Cir. 1996). Dr. Kenneth Reagles,
a   vocational           expert       and    not    an economist, projected 
 the  lost future    earnings       of John    Boucher.      Mr. Boucher 
   had  a sporadic work   history,   having    earned   $10,393 in  1983, 
   $5,800  in 1984,    $4,600   in 1985   and $7,800    in 1985.    Dr.
Reagles   assumed  that Mr. Boucher     had an earning    capacity as of
1988  of  $12,480  per year  plus 19 percent    for  fringe benefits,   based
on fringe   benefits Mr. Boucher  did not have   at the  time of his injury. 
   The court did not find this  reasonable.

Shatkin v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 727 F. 2d 202 (2nd Cir.
                             1984). The economist, Dr. Mantell for the plaintiff
       made     calculations             on   behalf of a parent suing for 
 damages      in the    death of a child.      The    court    felt  that 
there was  no   foundation     for an assumption that     the child   would 
   have  supported   the parent     in the future and "noted   a  number of
assumptions       and  assertions   made  by Dr. Mantell that were   so 
unrealistic   and contradictory         as to  suggest bad faith."
United States v. Pearson,
2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 14555 (2nd Cir. 2009). This is a decision in the
appeal of the restitution award in a child pornography case. Dr.
Kenneth Reagles had projected life care costs of counseling for two
female child victims of the child pornographer.  Reagles was
described as: “the owner of K.W. Reagles & Associates,
L.L.C., a company that provides ‘[f]orensic vocational,
rehabilitation, and economic consulting services, as well as employee
assistance, case management, and psychological counseling
services.’ Gov’t App. at 65, 132. Reagles concluded that
each victim ‘has a number of mental health issues that will
require treatment and services, presently and into the future, some of
the rest of her life’ as a result of her sexual assault by
Pearson. He estimated the future cost to Pearson’s victims of
obtaining medical care to be $2,002,732 and $921,976 for Jane Doe #1
and Jane Doe #2, respectively.” The District Court reduced those
amounts to $667,577 and $307,325, respectively, arguing that although
Reagles “who is a very good economist, [is] qualified to make
diagnoses in the case of severe psychological impediments caused by the
defendant,” the Court did not believe Reagles had the ability to
determine the amount attributable to the girls’ pre-existing
conditions. “The court concluded also that the victims’
future medical expenses should not be discounted to present value
because restitution could not be paid presently.”  The 2nd
Circuit also held that: “Where further losses are likely but the
amount cannot be calculated with reasonable certainty at the time of
the initial sentence, a victim may nevertheless be able to secure
compensation for further losses pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §
3664(d)(5). The court remanded the decision to the District Court for
further explanation of the amounts awarded by the District Court,
vacating the amounts so that the District Court could change the
amounts if it felt that such changes were warranted. 
             District    Courts in the        2nd 
 Circuit (CT, NY, VT)
Coleman v. Dydula, 190 F.R.D. 316 (W.D.N.Y. 1999). This decision 
                             is cited in some law books as interpreting the 
 requirement             for    experts        under  FRCP 26(a)(2)(B) to 
list prior testimonies           during    the  previous    four    years. 
 The district court said:     “Plaintiffs      are    precluded  from  introducing 
      the testimony    of their vocational      expert,    Herbert  Weber, 
  because they   failed       to comply with this     court 's previous  
order  of April  26, 1999.     As to Dr.   Reiber, plaintiffs      shall provide
  defendants   with  a  list of all  cases in  which Dr. Reiber     has 
testified   in the past    four years in compliance  with  Rule 26.   This
 list should  include the   name   of the court, the names  of the  parties,
    the docket number   (if  available),   and whether the testimony  was
 given     during a deposition   or  at a trial.”   This decision was submitted
 by   Jerry  Martin. 
Coleman v. Dydula, 139 F.Supp.2d 388 (W.D.N.Y. 2001). The
                             testimony of Dr.  Ronald Reiber was challenged
       under      a        Daubert              motion and upheld.
Dr.    Reiber   had   projected      lost future wages,   future       costs
    of health   care  coverage and   worklife   expectancy.    Dr. Reiber
        used  growth    rates of 3 percent  and  7.3 pecent for both  damages
    categories       using  a “sum   of annuity”  formula.   Reiber cited
the    1996 NAFE Survey     as   justifying “the   theory  that historical
  CPI    data can be used to   estimate     future inflation”    (Question
2 from     that survey)  .     Reiber was challenged    because  he
did  not   say “how   far back” he  went   in deriving his 3 percent   growth
  rate,   with  defendant’s   insisting   that this was precisely the kind
   of  thing   that made  Reiber’s   testimony    unreliable. He also justified
 his  7.3   percent growth   rate  based on Question    4 in the 1996 NAFE
 Survey.         Reiber’s worklife   expectancy  assumption      was
that the plaintiff   would   work  to age 66,  based   on the fact  that
  she did not have a   pension  in her current  employment   and   had stated
an   intention to   work to her  66th birthday. 
Hough-Scoma v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., WL 261857 W.D.N.Y.;
                             1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7046. Testimony based
on    Gamboa       tables       was    rejected         because of lack of
foundation.          
 Israel v. Spring Industries, 2006
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80863 (E.D.N.Y. 2006). Judge Robert M. Levy’s
memorandum denied the admissibility of the testimony of Dr. Leonard
Freifelder, Ph.D., president of Freifelder & Associates. Freifelder
had projected an eleven year old child’s loss of future earnings
and cost of future life care. Judge Levy noted that Dr. Freifelder had
never studied labor economics or medical economics and had never held
an academic teaching position in economics, and said: “An expert
may incorporate assumptions into his or her opinion, but those
assumptions must be ones that a reasonable juror could find correct
based on admissible evidence. . . In other words, the expert’s
underlying assumptions must be evaluated for accuracy. Dr.
Freifelder’s underlying assumptions are problematic in a few
respects. First, in determining Joseph’s pre-incident earning
capacity, he assumes that, had Joseph not been exposed to polyester in
the crip sheets, he would have had a normal work life expectancy,
meaning that he would have been ‘able to work as a typical
male[.]’ . . .His calculations do not take into account the
possibility that some of Joseph’s medical conditions were
pre-existing and would have affected Joseph’s work life
regardless of his purported exposure to polyester. . . Dr. Freifelder
testified that he knew that both of Joseph’s parents and one of
Joseph’s siblings had received high school diplomas and not
continued on to college, but he did not know whether any of
Joseph’s other siblings had plans to attend college. . .Nor did
he know what percentage of white males in the American population
complete high school or attend college. . . Again, Dr. Freifelder does
not claim to be a vocational or educational specialist; he has no
expertise in evaluating personal skill sets or predicting a particular
individual’s vocational or educational prospects. . . In making
his calculations, he did not take into account Joseph’s
individual characteristics or his family’s socioeconomic status .
. . In short, his assumption that, had Joseph been healthy, he would
have graduated from high school or completed some college is
speculative.” 

Lava Trading, Inc., v. Hartford Fire Insurance, 
   2005   U.S.   Dist  LEXIS 4566 (S.D.N.Y., 2005). This decision contains 
 extensive     discussion   of the expert report and methods used to develop 
 that report     by Dr. Eric  Clemons, the plaintiff’s principle damages expert.
 Sanctions     were awarded  to the defendant based on way Dr. Clemons report
 was handled.     The Court said  about Dr. Clemons’ report: “It failed .
. to identify  either    (1) the specific  facts or factual assumptions on
which Dr. Clemons  relied    to generate his opinions or (2) the methodology 
that he used (other  than   in the most general and unhelpful terms) or (3) 
his actual calculation  of   the losses or (4) the basis for the dramatic 
alteration of his loss  numbers   frm the first to the second report. In short,
the report – in all  of its  manifestations and supplementations – did not
disclose any of the  essential  details needed to understand and assess Dr.
Clemon’s conclusions.”  Dr. Clemens  was precluded from testifying.     
   
Liu v. Korean Airlines 
 Co.,    Ltd.,      1993           U.S.          Dist. Lexis 16233 (S.D.N.Y. 
 1993).     This    is a  memorandum  and      order     limiting and 
 excluding part   of the  proposed   testimony of the    plaintiff       economic
  expert,  Dr. Thomas  Kershner.   Dr. Kershner was  permitted  to   testify
    that  he  had studied  the Taiwanese   economy and  found a history 
    of a robust       growing  economy. He could   explain the  concept of
household       services,   but    could not  give the  figures contained
 in his report.    He   could   testify  about    the decedent’s    statistical
worklife  expectancy    and     his assumed  spread of   the growth   of
the  decedent’s income   from 1983   to   the present  (in 1993),   but would
 be required  to revise    is figures    to us  $4,800  per month as the
  1993  salary of a chief   engineer.       He was not  allowed to assume
promotions     contained   in his report or 8%   growth in  future wages
because that figure    was not  broken down into real   and inflationary 
  elements with specific  justification      for the real growth.  Dr. Kershner 
   was also not permitted  to give testimony     based on the assumption 
that   fringe benefits were 19.5 percent of earnings       because there was
no support   for that assumptin, nor was he permitted    to   testify about
the deduction   for personal consumption.

Manganiello v. Agostini,
2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99181 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). Judge Harold Baer, Jr.,
described the lost earnings calculations of Dr. Frank Tinari on behalf
of the plaintiff as “conservative” and indicated that the
size of the award did not “shock the conscience, especially in
light of the fact that defendants did not produce evidence to rebut Dr.
Latif’s or Dr. Tinari’s testimony.” (Dr. Latif was
another expert witness, but not an economist).           
Mastrantuono v. United States, 163 F. Supp. 2d 244 (S.D.N.Y. 
 2001). The court rejected the report of economist Andrew Weintraub, Ph.D., 
 regarding Samantha Bellantoni’s claim for lost future wages, saying: “Weintraub 
 was not given Bellantoni’s W-2 forms for the years 1998, 1999, and 2000, 
but instead had to estimate her annual earnings by averaging her 1995 to 1997
annual income (Tr. at 134-35.) Dr. Weintraub admitted that this rendered his
report incomplete. (Id.) Additionally, Dr. Weintraub unaccountably assumed 
 that Bellantoni’s future wages would grow at 4%, and used the same 4% rate 
 in discounting the future wage loss to present value, as if the interest 
rate would ever be as low as the rate of inflation. Because we reject this 
report, we find that plaintiff has failed to prove her future loss of wages 
by a preponderance of the evidence.”  

Pouliot v. Paul Arpin Van Lines, Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 32564 (D.CT, 2006). This decision involved Dr. Tony Gamboa for
the Plaintiff and Dr. Allan McCausland for the defendant. It appears
that Dr. Gamboa used a total offset method, which the defense
challenged as not reducing damages to present value. The judge held
that Connecticut law “requires that the parties by allowed to
present evidence on the proper method of calculating damages, and that
the jury be permitted to choose whether or not to credit any evidence
presented. He also wrote that “[a]lthough Arpin argues that Dr.
McCausland’s testimony as to the appropriate discount rate was
more correct than that of Dr. Gamboa, the jury may well have credited
Dr. Gamboa’s testimony above Dr. McCausland. The court does not
find it necessary to disturb this credibility assessment.” 

Queen v. International Paper Company, 2006 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 26725 (N.D.N.Y. 2006). This is Memorandum-Decision and Order by
U.S. Magistrate Judge David Homer, holding that an expert witness
report by Dr. James Lambrinos would not be precluded in the ground that
Dr. Lambrinos initial report was not signed and failed to include
Lambrinos’ compensation or llist of cases in which Lambrinos had
testified as an expert. These materials were served to the defendant
six weeks after the close of discovery. The court held that the
substance of the disclosures was made prior to the discovery deadline
and therefore that the error had been harmless. 
Shatkin v. McDonnell Douglas, 565 F.Supp.93 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). 
                             This is one of two decisions excoriating the 
testimony          of   Dr.    Edmund       Mantell     in related litigation 
from two    different        federal    judges.        The other    is
      Shu-Tao    Lin  v.   McDonnell   Douglas,    574 F.Supp.   
   1407 (S.D.N.Y.      1983).   Dr.  Mantell used  the same methods     used
in that     case,   as described      in that listing.  Judge Pollack said:
   “This court  finds      that Dr.   Mantell’s     assumptions  and techniques
of   calculation involve     gross    error at  almost  every  step. The
testimony   is not competent,   has  no   evidentiary    value and  no reasonable
 juror would   be justified   in relon     on or according     any weight
 to it whatsoever.   To permit   the jury  to hear   it would amount    to
irretrievable  prejudicial     projections     of an unfounded   character
  and  hopelessly prejudice   the  fairness   of the trial.”
Shu-Tao Lin v. McDonnell Douglas, 574 F.Supp. 1407 (S.D.N.Y. 
                             1983). This is one of two decisions excoriating 
   the    testimony          of   Dr.    Edmund     Mantell in related litigation 
     from  two different        federal     judges.    The other     is Shatkin 
     v.  McDonnell Douglas,        565 F.Supp.93     (S.D.N.Y.     1983). 
     Dr.   Mantell used total offset,      25  percent increases     in income 
      for    the first   four  years after     the wrongful death, $125,000 
      as an  extrapolation     from actual  earnings      in the five months 
   prior  to    the death, compared with    annual earnings       in the previous
   year of  $56,000,   a 13 percent tax rate.   However,   the   award  was
 increased   by 50 percent  for the interest income to  Mrs.   Lin  resulting
  from the   damage award.   Judge Sweet quoted Judge   Pollak  from
the       Shatkin    decision as saying:  “This court finds that 
  Dr. Mantell’s assumptions   and techniques of calculation   involve  gross
 error   at almost every  step.  The testimony is not competent,   has  no
evidentiary    value and  no reasonable  juror would be justified in  relon
 on or according    any  weight to it whatsoever.  To permit   the jury 
to hear it would amount     to irretrievable prejudicial  projections   of
an  unfounded character and       hopelessly prejudice the  fairness of the
trial.”    The discussion of   the   inadmissibility of this  testimony because
of internal    contradictions        under  Rule 703 is very  interesting.
Supply & Building Co. v. Estee Lauder International,
  2001 U.S.Dist. Lexis 20737 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). This is an order admitting
the   testimony of the defense economic expert Theodore Martens and denying
the   testimony of the plaintiff’s expert Robert Sherwin. Both were CPA’s
and this  was a business damages case. The order places heavy reliance on
the Daubert   and Kumho decisions. 
United States v. Starzecpyzel, 880 F. Supp. 1027 (S.D.N.Y. 
     1995). Judge Lawrence M. McKenna allowed the testimony of Forensic Document 
     Examiner (FDE) Mary Wenderoth Kelly in a criminal action. At 1029, Judge 
    McKenna said: “Yet, as distinguished from such discredited ventures as 
 hedonic    damages expertise, clinical ecology, trauma-cancer expertise or
 the Benedictin    plaintiffs’ statistical machinations, forensic document 
 examination does   involve true expertise, which may prove helpful to a fact
 finder.
3rd    Circuit


    Court
                      of Appeals
Benjamin v. Peter’s Farm Condominium Owners 
                             Association, 820 F.2d 640 (3rd Cir. 1987).  
        The    lost     earnings         projection  of Leonard Chasen, a 
certified        public    accountant,     had been     admitted   by the 
 trial court    judge.    It was    rejected by the    Third Circuit     Court
of  Appeals    on the  grounds   that    the only foundation     for an assumption
    that   the  plaintiff’s    post    injury earning capacity     was $10,000
per  year     was “Benjamin’s    personal     belief as to how much    money
he  could    earn together     with  his personal     records  reflecting
 money   recived    and disbursed during      the three  month  period  after
 the   injury.        Likewise the only  foundation     for  pre injury
earnings    was  business     earnings  of $24,500,  based on Benjamin’s
     1984  tax return.        The court  said, “We agree with PFCA’s
position       that, on this record,      Chasen’s       calculation  is
a “castle made  of  sand.” 
Donlin v. Philips Lighting North America Corp.,
2009 U.S. App. Lexis 8408; 106 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1 (3rd Cir.
2009). This decision affirmed the district court as to liability, but
remanded for a new trial on damages. Several issues were involved with
why the damage portion of the district court decision was remanded. One
of those issues was that the district court permitted the plaintiff to
testify at length about back pay and front pay. The 3rd Circuit said:
“[W]e find that the District Court should have barred portions of
Donlin's testimony requiring technical or specialized knowledge. Donlin
admitted that she was "not a professional," nor a finance major or
forensic economist. . . . Donlin's testimony regarding facts within her
personal knowledge (such as her current and past earnings) was
appropriate. But, much of Donlin's testimony went beyond those easily
verifiable facts within her personal knowledge and instead required
forward-looking speculation for which she lacked the necessary
training. For instance, in calculating her front pay, Donlin speculated
that Philips would provide a 3% annual pay raise; in fact, the company
did not provide an increase of more than 1.3 % in the years immediately
prior to the trial. Additionally, having no experience with retirement
benefits, Donlin misinterpreted Philips's definition of "pensionable
earnings" and erroneously assumed a flat 5% per year on pension
earnings based only on an example in the Philips pension manual. After
admitting that she had never performed a present-value discounting
calculation prior to the day before trial, Donlin testified that she
received instructions from her lawyer the night before regarding the
proper discount rate. Finally, Donlin misapplied the life expectancy
charts and therefore did not properly account for the probability of
her death. In sum, Donlin's testimony crossed  the line into
subject areas that demand expert testimony.” Suggested by Marc
Weinstein. 

Elcock v. KMART Corporation, 233 F.3d 734; 2000 U.S.
App. LEXIS 34822 (3rd Cir. 2000). This decision provides extensive
discussion reasons why the 3rd Circuit reversed the trial court
decision to admit the vocational testimony of Dr. Chester Copemann and
the economic testimony of Dr. Bernard Pettingill. It cites eight Daubert factors from In Re: Paoli Railroad Yard PCB Litigation (Paoli II), 35
F.3d 717, 742 (3rd Cir. 1994) and finds numerous faults with the
testimony of Dr. Copemann. It also discussed at length the degree to
which the fact that Dr. Copemann had pled guilty to embezzlement could
be introduced to impeach the crediblity of his testimony. The
discussion of reasons for not admitting the economic damages testimony
of Dr. Pettingill was not as extensive, saying: “In sum, we
believe that Pettingill’s economic damages model relied on
several empirical assumptions that were not supported by the record.
Although Pettingill suggested to the jury that it might discount the
100 percent disability figure he plugged into his economic model, this
suggestion is not sufficient to change the result. In the absence of
clearer instructions or emphasis by the witness or the court, a jury is
likely to adopt the gross figure advanced by a witness who has been
presented as an expert. Accordingly, the District Court abused its
discretion in admitting Pettingill’s model as evidence.”

Gumbs v. International Harvester, Inc., 718 F.2d 88 (3rd
  Cir. 1983).  S. Jones-Hendrikson, the economist for the plaintiff,
had    projected lost earnings based on the life expectancy of the plaintiff
without    consideration of worklife factors and had used a base income figure
more   than double the plaintiff's average income in the four years prior
to the   accident. 

Oddi v. Ford Motor Company, 234 F.3d 136 (3rd Cir. 2000).
                             This case does not directly evaluate economic 
 damages,         but    cites            Elcock         v. K-Mart 
and provides    Elcock's      set   of eight     Daubert tests for  admission 
       of  testimony.         
Williams v. Rene, 72 F.3d 1096 (3rd Cir. 1995). The decision 
                             of the trial court was reversed by the 3rd Circuit 
      for    several        reasons.         Among those reasons, the plaintiff 
      had presented   an   unnamed     actuarial     expert    to project 
lost     earnings.    The 6th  Circuit   found  “two serious     deficiencies” 
          that undermined     the testimony  of the actuarial expert.    
First,     “there was    no evidence     on which the  expert could properly 
base     an opinion that plaintiff’s       gross earnings  would triple in 
the remaining        seventeen years of  his  service     before  retirement. 
 Second, the   loss  was   not reduced to present  value, “an    obligation 
 that plaintiff   must  shoulder.” 

           District    Courts in the          3rd 
 Circuit (NJ, PA and Virgin Islands)

Aetna, Inc., v. Express Scripts, Inc.
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84975 (E.D. Pa. 2009).  This order denies a
motion in limine (under Daubert criteria) to exclude the testimony of
economic expert, Robert J. DeLuca, in a contract violation commercial
litigation. This decision contains a valuable discussion of
“reliability” and “disclosure” in the opinions
offered by economic experts in commercial cases. Specifically the
defendant did not disclose its method for rounding up prices of
products, but then attacked the expert in deposition for his failure to
round up prices using the defense’s undisclosed procedure. The
plaintiff expert produced an errata sheet with calculations corrected
for the now disclosed rounding procedure. The defendant then moved to
bar the errata as a new report filed after the disclosure deadline.
Similarly, the defendant did not disclose prices and costs for certain
product lines and DeLuca had to “fill-in” missing data
using projections. The defendant attacked the expert for lack of
reliability in using projected rather than actual data. The decision
held that the defendant created the need for the errata sheet and data
projections and could not use the defense’s failure to disclose
this information as the basis for disqualifying the plaintiff’s
expert. (Some language used in this description was provided by John O.
Ward.) 
Booth v. Black & Decker, 2001 U.S. 
                             Dist. Lexis 4495 (E.D.Pa. 2001).  This decision
        did    not    involve        economic     testimony, but cited the
 eight       Daubert    factors    used in        Elcock      v. K-Mart.
      The   decision   excluded the   testimony   of Richard B. Thomas  
  about    toaster    defects,    saying: "there   was no evidence  that
the  method     he  applied   was subject    to peer review,   had a known
or  potential    rate of   error,    could be measured   by existing   standards,
 or was generally   accepted.    Futhermore,  there  was no  establishiment
    of the relationship   beteen   the   technique and  the methods.  Though
 Thomas   may  be qualified   to testify  on  these matters,     he did not
 take  sufficient   care  in   supporting  the credibility   or  reliability
    of the methodology    he   applied  . . ." 
Bowman v. International Petroleum Corporation, 1995 U.S.
  Dist. LEXIS 10873 (E.D.PA 1995). The defendant appealed based in part on
   the trial court having permitted the testimony of economic expert David
 Bunin,    which was based on a flawed methodology. The Court emphasized
the  fact that  the defense had time to retain its own economic expert, but
had  not done  so in rejecting this part of the appeal. 
Gutierrez v.  Johnson & Johnson, 2006 U.S. Dist.
 LEXIS 80834 (D.N.J. 2006).  This memorandum by Judge William M. Walls
 rejects motions in limine under a Daubert standard to strike the reports
of economists Dr. Janice Madden on behalf of the plaintiff and Dr. David
Wise on behalf of the defendant in an employment discrimination at the stage
of class certification. Dr. Madden has her Ph.D. from Duke University and
is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Wise is an economist
at Harvard University. Regarding Dr. Madden’s report, Judge Walls said: “The
 Court is unpersuaded that Dr. Madden’s choice of variables renders her analysis
 so fatally flawed that it should be stricken as a matter of law. Generally,
 decisions regarding what control variables to include in an expert report
 go to weight, not admissibility. . . Since the expert accounted for experience
 and seniority within the company and tracked the employees over time, the
 data was not so incomplete to be rendered irrelevant and any inadequacies
 in the methodology could be addressed in cross examination.” Regarding Dr.
 Wise’s report, Judge Walls said: “Plaintiffs raise some serious limitations
 to Dr. Wise’s approach. However, this Court is mindful that under Daubert,
 a court is directed to focus on principles and methodolgy, not on the conclusions
 they generate. Daubert, 509 U.S. at 595. Plaintiffs do not dispute the validity
 of the statistical tests Dr. Wise performed, nor could they. As Nobel Laureate
 Dr. Daniel McFadden stated in his declaration, the Chow test, fixed affects
 models, f-tests, and t-tests are all standard, peer reviewed tests with
acknowledged  reliability. . .Rather, Plaintiffs challenge Dr. Wise’s interpretation
of  the results as they relate to the legal concept of commonality. However,
disagreements about the conclusions to be drawn from a particular test affect
the weight of a report, not its admissibility. . . Plaintiffs’ concerns about
the significance or lack of significance of the Wise Report can be adequately
addressed through cross-examination.” 
JMJ Enterprises, Inc. v. Via Veneto Italian Ice, Inc, 1998
                             U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5098 (E.D.Pa. 1998). Leon A. 
 LaRosa,        Jr.,     who    had    a  Bachelor’s     Degree in Business 
 Administration        and a  Master’s      in Taxation,      had his testimony 
    ruled inadmissible         because:  (1)   He   did very little    to 
 verify his sales projection;         (2) Did not  attempt     to verify information
   in  the tax return;     (3)    Did not consider  the owner’s     experience
with respect     to   the  company’s     potential success;   (4) Did   
not conduct industry  research;        and  (5)  Found sales  would  rise
dramatically      but  expenses would    not increase.          There
is a good discussion    in  this  decision    of Daubert standards    and
 how    they should   apply in   a business   valuation  context.

Montgomery v. Mitsubishi Motors Corp.,
2006 U.S. Dist LEXIS 24433 (E.D. PA 2006).  In this judicial
memorandum, Judge Pratter denied Mitsubishi’s move to preclude
the testimony of Dr. Anthony Gamboa. Judge Pratter denied the motion
without prejudice, meaning that the issue can be raised again later. At
least one error in Mitsubishi’s brief was a claim that Dr. Gamboa
had assumed that Montgomery would work to age 89 based on the LPE-type
calculation Dr. Gamboa had made. 
McNamara v. Kmart Corporation,
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 865 (D. Virg. Isl.). This opinion upheld a trial
court decision not to admit the testimony of economic expert Robert
Johnson and to severely limit the testimony of vocational
rehabilitation expert Susan McKenzie. The Court rejected the testimony
of physiatrist Dr. Gary Jett, upon whose testimony much of the
testimony of McKenzie and all of the testimony of Johnson rested. The
Court said: Johnson’s conclusions were premised on his
understanding of McNamara’s future medical and non-medical
expenses provided to him by McKenzie. Because future medical needs and
costs were beyond McKenzie’s expertise and her calculation of
medical expenses were derived from Dr. Jett’s unreliable chart,
the basis for Johnson’s opinions were faulty. There was simply
nothing for him to reduce to present value. His testimony would have
been a mere reiteration of Dr. Jett’s suspect numbers.” The
Court’s description of Dr. Jett’s methods and opinions was
very negative.
 
Polymer Dynamics, Inc., v. Bayer Corporation,
   2005   U.S.   LEXIS   7945 (E.D.Pa. 2005). Defendant Bayer filed motions
   in limine   under   a Daubert   standard to exclude the testimony of various
   plaintiff   experts,   including   Dr. A. Lawrence Kolbe. The court found
   that Dr. Kolbe   was qualified   to offer   the jury an opinion on damages,
   that his methodology   was reliable   and that   Dr. Kolbe’s testimony
fit   the facts of the case.                    
Schieber v. City of Philadelphia, 2000 U.S. Dist. Lexis 17952 
                             (E.D. Pa. 2000). LPE methods used by Gary French 
    were     discussed          in   detail.       French was permitted to 
 present     estimates    based   on   most    probable   earnings       scenario
 for    Shannon Schieber    as a  teacher,   but    not for a  less probable
      private sector career.    Tried  under federal     standards.  

4th   Circuit

    Court
                      of Appeals

Balance v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 7663
                             (4th Cir. 1999). This decision involved a slip-and-fall
           case     in   Wilson,        North  Carolina. At issue on appeal
   was    whether     the   medical     testimony    of   Dr. David  Tomaszek
   and  the  corresponding      life  plan testimony    of Anthony      Sciara,
   Ph.D.    should have been    admitted.    A Daubert hearing    had been 
 conducted        by the District    Court judge   and the 4th Circuit  Court 
   of Appeals     upheld    the District    Court  judge. 
Berlyn Inc. v. Gazette Newspapers, Inc., 2003 U.S.App. LEXIS 
                             16814 (4th Cir. 2003). From footnote 3: “Appellants 
       also     seek     to   rely     on   the the testimony of their proposed 
      exert witness,     Mr.    James   Shaffer.     The   district court 
correctly      ruled, however,     that   Shaffer  is unqualified     to offer
 expert    testimony    as an economist     on   the establishment   of relevant
     product  or   geographic markets.    While   Shaffer has an MBA  and
significant       executive    experience in  the  newspaper   industry,
he subscribes    to no economics      journals,  has not  published   any
economics-related     articles.   He is  also  unfamiliar    with   basic
terminology   and concepts     used by economists     who work  on  antitrust
  cases.  Furthermore,    Shaffer  admitted that  he had   never conducted
  a  relevant  market  analysis,     and that any reading he had   done on
the  subject   came from  materials     provided to him by Appellant’s  
attorneys.”                
              District     Courts in the 4th Circuit
       (DE, MD, NC, SC, VA, WV)
Berlyn Inc., et al. v. The Gazette Newspaper, Inc.,  214
    F.Supp.      2d 530 (D. Maryland). The district court excluded the antitrust
                       economics      testimony of James B. Shaffer, but
allowed        Shaffer        to   testify     about lost     profits on
the basis  of   his   experience     in   the  newspaper  industry.   Shaffer’s
    proposed   opinion   about market     power   was rejected  because:
“Shaffer  is not      qualified   to offer this    opinion.   Shaffer’s background 
  is completely    devoid     of specific  education,   training,   or experience 
 in  economics   or antitrust      analysis.  His education   is in  engineering 
 and business     administration.    He   has  never performed   a relevant 
  market analysis    for antitrust  purposes,   and    at the time he   was 
 retained  as an  expert   n this case, he was entirely     unaware   of how
  an economist  would  perform   such a study. Clearly,  Shaffer    cannot 
 qualify   under  the general  requirements   of Rule 702, which  requires 
    ‘knowledge,   experience,   training  or education.”
McMillan v. Weeks Marine, Inc.,
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20833 (D.DE 2007). A new trial on damages was
granted because Royal A. Bunin had been admitted to testify about the
plaintiff’s lost earnings, but went beyond the scope of his
expertise in his testimony. “During trial, Mr. Bunin, an
actuarial economist expert witness, was permitted to testify, over
Defendant’s objection, about the employment frequencies, hours
worked, and employment experiences of workers in the dredging industry.
He testified that ‘while earlier on in a person’s career
there may be fluctuation as they’re known in the industry picking
up work, but once they’re known in the industry, they get picked
up and their work seems to be more solid year round. (D.I. 95 at 11).
He also testified that this opinion derived from other reports he had
prepared for other workers in the dredging industry who were members of
the Union of Operating Engineers Local 25. Id. After reviewing Mr.
Bunin’s expert reports, the Court finds that these opinions were
not disclosed as required, nor did Mr. Bunin provide any bases to
support them. Moreover, the Court concludes that Mr. Bunin’s
testimony on Plaintiff’s future prospects for employment in the
dredging industry reflects vocational experience outside the scope of
his expert report, discipline and prior experience as an
actuarial-economist.” 

TFWS, Inc. V. Schaefer, 183 F. Supp. 789 (Dist. of Maryland
                             2002). Drs. Frank Chaloupka and David Levy for
   the    defendant          and    Thomas       Overstreet  for the plaintiff
   were    all found qualified         to offer   expert    opinions   in
an    antitrust    matter, with the court      emphasizing     the Kumho
  decision   in   its    ruling.  The court went  on   to say that it   found
  the testimony     of   Drs.   Chaloupka and  Levy  more   persuasive than
  that of  Dr.   Overstreet.            
5rd    Circuit


    Court
                      of Appeals
In re Air Crash Disaster at New Orleans, Louisiana on July 9,
                             1982, 795 F.2d 1230 (5th Cir. 1986). The
Fifth      Circuit        Court      of   Appeals      reversed the trial
court decision     in a  wrongful      death    matter     because:  “We
   are persuaded  that   the  evidence in   support   of   the claimed  
  loss of inheritance     was too  speculative    and that  the remaining
 awards    of the jury  were  so excessive     as to   require a  new trial.”  
  The unnamed     economist    had projected   that      the decedent’s  
 salary would   grow at an annual      real rate of  8 percent   and   would 
 have    paid  only 5 percent   of   his income   in income   taxes.   The 
 court pointed      out that this was   extremely   unrealistic    and also 
     noted evidence  in   the case  that   suggested “increasingly    significant 
     sums   had  been spent   in previous   years in gambling junkets    to
 Las  Vegas.”    On the   inheritance   issue,   the 5th Circuit said: “In
  sum,   we find  the assumptions      of plaintiff’s      economist so abusive
  of the known   facts, and so removed   from   any   area   of demonstrated
   expertise,  as to  provide no reasonable   basis  for  calculating   how
 much  of  Ted  Eymard’s  income  would have found  its way into  assets 
or savings  to  be  inherited  by his children.”       

Marcel v. Placid Oil Company, 11 F.3d 563 (5th Cir.
1994). The district court had precluded the testimony of economic
expert Dr. Kenneth Boudreaux based on the worklife expectancies of oil
field workers that had been prepared by Richard Camus & Associates.
Plaintiffs criticized the Camus study as outdated, statistically
suspect, and untrustworthy. The 5th Circuit said: “In presenting
the testimony of Dr. Boudreaux, Placid did not tender any evidence
comparing the worklife in the oilfield with the national average or
with the worklife in any other occupation. Without some indication of
how oilfield worklife differs from that of other occupations, however,
there are several bases upon which the district court could have
excluded the evidence, for example, a finding that the probative value
of the Camus study did not outweigh the prejudice of its admission or
that it was not sufficiently reliable in the present context. Upon the
record before us, we cannot hold that it was an abuse of discretion to
exclude the tendered evidence.” In a footnote, the 5th Circuit
noted that “Plaintiffs contend that Placid failed to preserve
this issue for appeal because it did not proffer either the Camus study
or the testimony of Dr. Boudreaux.”  
Randolph v. Laeisz, 896 F.2d 965 (5th Cir. 1990). A trial
                             court decision was reversed in part on the basis
    of   the    unreasonable             calculations     of an unnamed economist. 
          Randolph had worked       as   a  clerk/checker for    two unions
   that     had   merged in 1983, after    which    there    was a loss of 
 hours     worked    by Randolph. This loss of   hours had   been ignored 
  by plaintiff’s     economist.     The court also noted   that: “[T]he  
record does   not  support   the  validity     of  the economist’s    actual 
 mechanical   calculations.        His testimony      on direct and  cross 
   examination was confusing    at best and    nothing     else in  the record 
 clarifies    how the economist      reached  his end   result    figures.”

        MS, TX)
Albert v. Jordan, 2007
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85368 (W.D. La 2007). Judge James T. Trimble, Jr.,
granted a defense motion in limine to exclude testimony of vocational
expert Glen Hebert, MRC and R. Douglas Womack, Ph.D. that was based on
occupations and earnings that Hebert claimed represented the earning
capacity of plaintiffs Paul Reed and Keith Dorn. Judge Trimble held
that amounts being projected were far in excess of the earning capacity
demonstrated by the two plaintiffs in their earnings record and said
that “Plaintiffs have presented no evidence is to either
plaintiff’s aptitude or earnings history that would indicate
support for the opinions proffered by Mr. Hebert. He also held that the
Court “will allow these experts to testify as to Mr.Reed and Mr.
Dorn’s loss of earning capacity based on a wage scale proven by
their work history.” 

Arreola v. Epic Divers, Inc, 2006
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88275 (E.D.LA 2006). The Plaintiff challenged the
admissibility of testimony by the defense economist, Kenneth Boudreaux,
that Plaintiff’s work-life expectancy as a commercial diver was
five years baed on a July 1993 case study compiled by Louisiana State
University’s Department of Quantitative Business Analysis for the
benefit of the Association of Diving Contractors, Inc.
Boudreaux’s report noted that “if Plaintiff’s alleged
impairment precludes him only from diving for a living, as opposed to
undertaking a non-diving occupation, then any future wage loss
calculation should be based on Plaintiff’s remaining expected
worklife as a diver. . .  The Plaintiff argued that the LSU study
did not meet the requirements of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 509
U.S. 579 (1993), because no other court has ever ruled on its
admissibility, and because it has never been published or subject to
peer review. Plaintiff also argues that the time frame reflected in the
report (1975-1992), which was supposedly one of very unfavorable
economic conditions for buyers, does not correlate with today’s
conditions.” The Court went on to discuss the nature of the LSU
study in some detail and said: “[G]iven Boudreaux’s
impressive credentials, if the jury learns about the LSU study from his
lips then it will surely give more credence to the report than what it
could ever garner on its own. It would simply be unfair to allow the
Defendants to use the study to put the burden on Plaintiff to convince
the jury that unlike other divers in past years he would not have
voluntarily dropped out of diving. Again, unlike other divers who might
voluntarily choose to end their careers, the Plaintiff’s career
had ended not by choice but by necessity given his injury. He is
entitled to a presumption that he would have spent his entire career as
a diver.”  Boudreaux was not allowed to testify regarding
any type of reduced worklife expectancy for divers “because that
is not his area of expertise” and any testimony about the LSU
study was specifically excluded because the judge did not consider it
reliable. 

Berk-Cohen Associates,
L.L.C.     vs.   Orkin    Exterminating        Co.,          2004 U.S.
Dist LEXIS     3789   (E.D.La   2004). The District      Court  denied  
a  Daubert      motion  in limine  to bar the testimony of   “Mr.  Boudreaux”
 (possibly       Kenneth      Boudreaux)   who calculated the  present  value
of a  projected    stream     of lost     profits,   based on challenging
   the assumption     that the   contract   would have     remained in force
for   the 30 years    projected   by Boudreaux.   The court   said     that
the challenge     went  to the credibility   of Mr. Boudreaux’s     testimony,
   not its admissibility.

Bomarito v. Penrod Drilling Corp.,
929 F.2d 186 (5th Cir. 1991). The trial judge had summarily excluded
the testimony of defense economic expert Dr. Wood (first name not
provided) because that expert had relied upon the Camus report, which
is a study of the worklife expectancy of offshore oil workers performed
by Richard Camus. The 5th Circuit strongly criticized the defense for
failing to comply with F.R.Evid. 103(a)(2) by proffering a copy of the
Camus report, indicating that the 5th Circuit therefore had no basis to
determine whether the trial court’s exclusion of testimony based
on the Camus report was “manifestly erroneous.” The
decision, however, implies criticism of the trial court judge for not
providing more of his reasoning. Suggested by David Jones.
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Butler v. MBNA Technology, Inc., 2003 U.S. Dist LEXIS (N.D.Tex. 
                             2003).  A motion to exclude the expert opinion
       of   Dr.    James      T.   McClave,      an economist for the plaintiff,
       was  granted    in part   and   denied   in part.    “Dr. McClave’s
 opinion       is  traceable   to a specific,    identifiable     source,”
   which satisfied         the court that   “expert opinion    must be founded
     on facts and     data    that are capable   of independent verification.” 
      However,      Dr.    McClave’s    comparison   of plaintiff’s annual
 salary increases         with    those   of job candidates      who hold
degrees in computer   science   was      rejected as   unreliable.   The
plaintiff    had a job   grade of Senior     Software   Engineer,   based
  on a bachelor’s degree      in Management  Information   Systems,   which
 the  court did not consider   as equivalent    to degrees in  computer 
science.” 

Garcia v. Columbia Medical 
 Center     of  Sherman,       996   F.Supp.             617 (E.D.Tex. 
 1998).       The  plaintiff had    retained     Daniel J.   Slottje 
        as  its   economic    expert. The defense    had retained     Ygnacio 
   D.Garza as    its    economic     expert.  Defense    moved to  bar 
   the testimony     of Slottje.           The court  said:   “[T]he 
methods   and  principles    used   by Slottje    in reaching       his  opinions
 certainly   have  a   sound basis in  the   field of economics.   .   .
 The question of whether       Slottje’s opinions     are accurate in light
 of   his  use  of United    States    figures for worklife     expectancy
is a  question  that goes to   the weight,    not the admissibility,    
of this  evidence.  In fact,   Columbia’s    own expert    . . . used the
  same methodology   as Slottje   in reaching   his opinions    regarding 
 Garcia’s   past and future   earnings.   . . he too substituted  data   
 for worklife   expectancy in the  United    States for the unavailable Mexican
       data.” 
In Re: Vioxx Products Liability Litigation,
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40612 (E.D. La. 2007).  The plaintiff was

Rayburn, had testified that he was a board certified cardiologist when,
in fact, he was not a board certified cardiologist.  
Jack v. Schlumberger Technology Corp., 2008 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 13530 (W.D.La. 2008) This is a one page memorandum responding to
plaintiff’s motion for a Daubert hearing to determine whether Dr.
Kenneth Boudreaux could testify based on the Camus study. The judge
denied the motion as not needed because he was ruling that
Boudreaux’s testimony was excluded to the extent that it relied
upon the Camus study, for which Dr. Boudreaux’s testimony had
been excluded fourteen years earlier in Marcel v. Placid Oil, 11 F.3d
563 (5th Cir. 1994). The Camus study allegedly measured worklives over
oilfield workers. The defendant did not oppose this ruling.   

Miller v. Burlington Northern, 2001 U.S.Dist. Lexis 16650
                             (N.D.Tex 2001). This is a short, very well written
      memorandum           Robert       K  Roach,   U.S. Magistrate Judge, 
 admitting     the economic        damages   testimony        of Jeffrey 
 Opp, the economic     expert for   the    plaintiff  under the Daubert 
      standard. Judge     Roach said:  “The knowledge   and  skills used by
Opp  in   assembling    and compiling    the data, performing      mathematical 
 calculations,      selecting   the  formulae (functions)  to   be  applied 
 to the data, charting         the results,    and then summarizing    the 
   end figures in mathematics     do  not   require  special   college courses 
    or  post-graduate  education.     The methodology    is not a proper 
 subject    for  peer review. The  bachelor’s     degree in  economics  
which Opp holds    reflects  the degree  of mastery    of basic  mathematical, 
 statistical and   language   skills  necessary to   perform the compilations, 
  calculations and   formulae  selections  used  by  Opp in his analysis and
 making   his report.   Brain surgery,    it ain’t.    . . . Mathematics is
 not junk science.   Defendant’s          Daubert        motion is
overruled.    Opp can testify.” 
Owens v. Excel Management Services, Inc., 2003 U.S. Dist
  LEXIS 20296 (N.D.Texas 2003).  The testimony regarding back pay and
   front pay damages of economist J. Herbert Burkman, Ph.D., was permitted
 after    a Daubert hearing. Dr. Burkman’s testimony was challenged on the
 grounds   of  his assumption that she would maintain her earnings if she
had transitioned                             with fellow employees to a new
department and because         he   had    projected          her  earnings
to age 70.  The court       said   regarding      his age 70   projection:
         “Nor does Dr.   Burkman’s      decision to  project    plaintiff’s
  future lost    wages        to age   70   dictate that  his testimony 
  be stricken.   Dr. Burkman     based his      estimate of front  pay damages
 on  plaintiff’s stated  desire  to  work    until   age 70, if  possible.
. .  . Although  worklife expectancy    tables     estimate    that a 54-year
old college   educated  woman will  likely retire     in  her   mid-sixties,
   nothing in Daubert   or its   progeny requires   an expert’s      testimony
to be circumscribed    by statistical   averages   when evidence   in   a
particular case supports a different     conclusion.    A jury can easily
   recalculate  earnings if it finds that  retirement    at  an earlier age
 is  warranted.” 
Ostrowiecki v. Agressor Fleet, Ltd.,
2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59586. This is a memorandum denying a plaintiff
motion in limine to preclude the defense testimony of economist Dr.
Kenneth Boudreaux and a defense motion in limine to preclude the
plaintiff testimony of economic expert Holly Sharp. Daubert standards
were used. Judge Lance M. Africk rejected each defense and plaintiff
argument by saying that vigorous cross examination was the correct
method to deal with the issues being raised, not the barring of expert
testimony. Sharp had projected several damages not projected by
Boudreaux, one of which was loss of accumulations to an estate.
Boudreaux argued that any such calculation was inherently too
speculative for him to project. Sharp had provided a projection. One
other key difference between the experts was that Sharp had projected a
loss from the sale of the decedent’s business after the
decedent’s death, while Boudreaux had not done so. 

Scardina v. Maersk Line, LTD., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13468 
 (E.D.LA. 2002). This legal memorandum responds to motions to limit the testimony 
 of Dr. G. Randolph Rice, an economist, and to strike the report and testimony 
 of Dr. Fereydoun Aghazadeh, an Industrial Engineer/Ergonomist. Both motions 
 were granted. The Court said of Dr. Rice: “Dr. Rice, plaintiff’s expert economist,
 is expected to testify as to plaintiff’s economic damages, that is lost
past  and future income. In a report dated December 12, 2001, Dr. Rice set
forth  various projections using an annual wage base of approximately $30,000.00.
 Plaintiff’s average annual earnings in the three to five years preceding
the accident were approximately $26,000. His annual earnings for the five
years from 1994 through 1999 varied from a low of $15,895 to a high of $39,536.06
 in 1996. On April 29, 2002, Dr. Rice produced a second report at the request
 of plaintiff’s counsel. This report based plaintiff’s ‘impairment of earning
 capacity’ on projected annual incomes of $38,481.00 and $76,962.00, which
 of course produced much higher economic damages. . . It is the provenance 
 of the Court to assure that an expert’s testimony is not based on evidence 
 that is speculative and conjectural, but is sufficiently tied to the facts 
 of the case so that it will actually assist the trier of fact in resolving 
 a factual dispute or to understand the evidence. Daubert, 113 S.Ct at 2795. 
 The court concludes that Dr. Rice’s testimony as to his supplemental opinion 
 based on projected annual incomes of $38,000 and nearly $77,000 is not sufficiently 
 tied to the facts or supported by the evidence available to the Court at 
this time, and is therefore excluded, subject to the Court’s reconsideration 
of the issue should evidence be introduced at trial provide sufficient factual 
 basis for such testimony.”

Stewart v. Rowan Companies, Inc., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4135 
 (E.D.LA 2002). This is a memorandum allowing Shael Wolfson was permitted 
to testify about economic damages. The defendant had challenged the admissibility 
 of Wolfson’s testimony on the basis that only a Ph.D. in economics is qualified 
 to offer an opinion of plaintiff’s economic damages. The court said: “Wolfson 
 possesses a masters of science degree in economics from Florida State University, 
 and is currently pursuing a doctorate in economics at Louisiana State University. 
 In addition, he has published journal articles on the topic of calculating 
 economic damages. He has been qualified in state court cases. . .The absence 
 of a doctorate does not compel the conclusion that he is not qualified to 
 testify as an expert economist. . . . Indeed, defendant gives no reason why
 a person with a master’s degree in economics is not sufficiently schooled 
 in economics to estimate economic losses. The Court finds Wolfson sufficiently 
 qualified to render an opinion on plaintiff’s economic losses.”  
Taylor v. Air Logistics, Inc., 1988 U.S. Dist. Lexis 7409
                             (E.D. LA 1988). This memorandum and order discusses
       the    litigative           history       of a decision that was originally
       reached    on April  21,    1983     and therefore       fell under 
 Culver      I and not    Culver II.       The decision     went through 
    appeals       to the 5th   Circuit Court of  Appeals     and came back 
    again with    instructions         that the trial  court set   damages 
  for lost  household     services.       The    plaintiff’s  economist 
   was a “Dr.  Goodman,”     while the  economist      for the defense   was
 Kenneth   Boudreaux.      It is  indicated that    damages  were based
 on a  wage growth   rate  of   5.3 percent  and  the discount     rate 


was  10.25 percent,  as used   by  both economists, who  nevertheless   
 came   up with slightly different    present values for lost earnings based
    on differences  in the way taxes   were   calculated. Dr. Goodman came
up    with  $294,747.02 and Dr. Boudreaux   came up  with $294,002.00. With
respect    to household services,   Dr. Goodman    found $34,075.48  and
Dr. Boudreau  found    $25,002.00 The judge   accepted    Dr. Goodman’s figure
 in determining  final    damages. There was also    a  long discussion of
the amount  to award for  pre  judgement interest. 
Utsey v. Olshan Foundation Repair Company,
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85918. (E.D. La 2007). This memorandum by Judge
Helen G. Berrigan denied a motion to exclude the testimony of economic
expert Dr. Randolph Rice. This is a Daubert-Kumho review. Defendants
had charged that Louisiana law required the testimony of a vocational
expert as a foundation for an expert opinion of earnings loss by an
economist.  Judge Berrigan wrote: “Although
defendants’ argument may be correct regarding the amount of money
the plaintiffs could recover in state court, the defendants have not
provided any federal authority to support their argument to exclude
Rice’s expert report under the federal rules of evidence . . .
Therefore, the defendant’s concern about the factual basis of
Rice’s report is best resolved by vigorous cross examination and
the presentation of contrary evidence.”

 held    that   Barney    Hedgewood,      a  vocational      rehabilitation 
         expert,   had sufficient    training     and  experience to   be 
 allowed    to testify        about his  life  care plan     for the plaintiff 
 after      a consideration   of Daubert           standards.
Vogler v. Blackmore, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 24020 (5th Cir.
                             2003). This decision affirms a trial court decision
       to   admit      the    testimony         of “grief expert” in “thanatology,”Dr.
          Phyllis    Silverman,      who had a  bachelor’s      degree in
psychology          and sociology,    a master’s      degree in social work,
 and    a  Ph.D.      in public health.   The court added     the following:
 “Further,    even     if we were to find that  the district court    abused
its discretion    in    admitting    Dr. Silverman’s    testimony, the admission
   of that    testimony       was  harmless.   The facts    of this case
are tragic:    a mother and   child are   dead,  leaving a  grieving    father
to care   for  his   wife’s   children from a  prior marriage  while  attempting
   to care  for himself.     Evidence presented   by the collective   Plaintiffs
      at  trial included   pictures   of a happy family   and the mangled, 
    flattened     remains  of  Mrs. Vogler’s   car. It is highly unlikely 
   that  Dr. Silverman’s        testimony  aided the   jury’s resolution of
 this case    or in its awards     to  Mr.  Vogler.”     There is also

 discussion   of a 50  percent  multiplier    between  a jury’s  award  of
 economic damages  and the allowable   size of   an award for  future  mental
 anguish and future  loss of companionship.    The  5th Circuit seemed  to
 be saying that the multiple   was between economic     damages that the
jury    could have awarded  and the  allowable size of  the   award for future
 mental   anguish and loss of  companionship.  The economic   expert had
testified  to  future earnings loss between $455,000  and $700,000,   with
an addition  of $200,000   for the value of household  services.  Thus, 
 the 5th Circuit  said that $900,000   could have been awarded.  Submitted

Walker v. Yellow Freight Systems, Inc., 1999 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 
                             15012 and 1999 U.S.Dist LEXIS 16128 (E.D.La 1999).
      In   the    first      order      (9/23/99)    defendant’s motion to
 prohibit        testimony    by economic      expert     Robert Johnson 
  was denied    in   a Daubert hearing.     Kenneth  Boudreaux    was   
the economic expert        for the defense. Of   major  focus  was Johnson’s 
   assumption     that      the decedent    had contributed     35 hours 
per week of   household   services         based on the Peskin    study, 
  which projected 15.1   hours  per week.    It appears    that Johnson had
 used   the value per hour from   the Peskin    study. The court    said: 
 “Because the    Peskin study itself  is  reliable,    the Court assumes that
   any figures  it  provides   are  reliable.   In  his  affidavit, Dr. Boudreaux
  is  admittedly    unfamiliar    with   the Peskin     study and the Court
 does not give  weight   to his   objections.   The   Court  also discussed
 other questionable assumptions        in Johnson’s   report,  but  said
that  went to the weight of the evidence.       The  second   order (10/19/99),
    interpreting Louisiana law, held that     “loss  of  earning  capacity
 may be   factored   into a loss of support   calculation,    since  earning
 capacity is  relevant to   ‘the possibility   of a decrease   or  increase
  in earnings.’ 
  6th   Circuit
    Court
                      of Appeals
Leap v. Malone,
1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 33965 (6th Cir. 1996). The 6th Circuit affirmed
the jury decision to award Christina Leap $100,000 for lost earning
capacity. Dr. Anthony Gamboa had projected her earnings loss at between
$906,000 and $1.4 million. The Court noted that the former figure had
been described as “extraordinarily optimistic.” One of the
sources for the appeal was that “Dr. Gamboa’s testimony was
‘unimpeached [and] uncontradicted.’” The court
rejected that argument, say: “Defense counsel conducted an
effective cross-examination of Dr. Gamboa, exposing apparent weaknesses
in his position. And the jury could reasonably have concluded that the
dismal picture of Miss Leap’s future presented by Dr. Gamboa was
contradicted by other evidence.”  
         District  Courts
        in the 6th Circuit (KY,         MI, OH, TN)
Birge v. Dollar General Corporation,
2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS (W.D.TN 2006). This is a decision of a U.S.
District Judge affirming the decision of a Magistrate Judge’s
order to exclude the testimony of Dr. David Ciscel. The Magistrate
Judge had found that Dr. Ciscel was qualified to offer expert testimony
concerning lost future income, but conclude “that Dr.

Ciscel’s testimony was too speculative and unreliable to be
admissible at trial because it was based on insufficient information
about Dexter Birge’s income, both past and future, and B’s
Quick Shop’s payment of wages to the decedent. The Magistrate
Judge had recited testimony from Dr. Ciscel that $50-a-day wage data
provided by Robert Birge, the decedent’s father, was
“useless information.” However the appeal requested that
Dr. Ciscel be permitted to testify based on either $50-a-day or minimum
wage. This request was denied as “untimely.” 
Ogden v. St. Mary’s Medical Center, 2007
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41853 (E.D. Mich. 2007).  This is a order from
Judge Thomas Luddington denying without prejudice a motion to strike
plaintiff’s proposed economic expert, Dr. Frank Stafford of the
University of Michigan. The memorandum details of the methodology used
by Stafford to project losses in an employment discrimination case.
Stafford had assumed an earnings basis of “about” $25,000,
an assumed rate retirement age of 65, and an inflation rate of 3% which
was added to his projection of annual salaries, and a 24 percent fringe
benefit rate. Defendants raised a variety of objections under
Daubert-Kumho, including his use of a flat 24% rate for fringe
benefits, double counting involved with both salary increases and the
addition of inflation at 3% and use of a retirement age of 65 instead
of work-life expectancy tables. Judge Luddington said: “Although
Defendants criticize the selection of certain assumed values or the
selection of a particular financial information as relevant over other
data, Defendants have not suggested that the fundamental approach taken
by Plaintiff’s proposed expert departs from accepted practice in
the field of economics. Defendants have not offered any affidavit from
another economist, for example, that the proposed expert’s
methodology represents a departure from accepted discipline. The
proposed expert has not articulated the algorithm employed to produce
his projection, but neither have Defendants identified any defect on
that point.” 
Ogden v. St. Mary’s Medical Center,
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69181 (E.D. Mich. 2007). This follows a
memorandum from Judge Ludington on June 11, 2007 dismissing the motion
of defendants to bar the economic testimony of Dr. Frank Stafford
without prejudice. This allowed defendants to try to provide a
foundation for their motion. They did so in the form of an affidavit
from Dr. Calvin Hoerneman, a member of the “National Association
of Forensic Economists” (sic), a qualification cited in this
memorandum. Judge Ludington said: “Hoerneman, a professor of
economics at Delta College in Michigan, attests to all of the purported
defects previously argued by Defendants, such as the use of flat rates
for fringe benefits and wage increases, almost without elaboration. He
states that, in his professional opinion, Plaintiff’s proposed
expert’s report ‘is not based upon scientifically valid
reasoning and methodology and is not based on sufficient factual data
that pertains to . . . Plaintiff’s actual facts, making it
misleading and unreliable expert testimony’. . . He further
states that the proposed expert ‘appears to be using a data set
that is over 25 year sold and, to my knowledge, is not being used by
forensic economists in calculating future economic wage losses for a
party when actual data on a person’s work life and earning
history is known. . .Beyond those statements, Hoerneman offers no
further explanation of his disagreement with Plaintiff’s proposed
expert.” After some discussion of Daubert and Kumho, Judge
Ludington dismissed Defendant’s motion in limine, saying:
“At best, Defendants have identified an individual who might
offer competing economic testimony. Defendant’s sole
substantiated basis for challenging Plaintiff’s proposed expert,
Hoerneman’s affidavit, provides the Court little assistance in
its role as gatekeeper, with an obligation to assess the reliability of
scientific testimony or evidence. The terse contrary assertions of
Defendants’ affiant do not, in the Court’s view, prevent
the conclusion that Plaintiff’s proposed expert’s report is
supported by validation appropriate to the field of economics. On that
basis, the Court will deny Defendants’ motion to strike
Plaintiff’s expert.” 

Sokol v. Akron Gen. Med. Ctr., 1997 U.S. Dist. Lexis 22078
                             (N.D.Ohio 1997). This decision related to the 
 admissibility              of   an   affidavit        by David M. Eisenstadt, 
 Ph.d., the  plaintiff’s            economic     expert in an   antitrust 
    action.   The court    cited      Ohio  v. Louis    Trauth Dairy, 
 925  F.Supp. 1247     (S.D.Ohio    1996) as   applying    “a modified   
Daubert analysis  to  an economist’s        testimony    based on   a statistical 
   multiple regression   analysis”    and In re   Aluminum    Phosphide  
Antitrust Litigation,      893 F.Supp.     1497 (D.Ka. 1995),  in    which 
the  court applied a modified    Daubert    analysis  and held that  an  economist’s
   testimony regarding  price   declines  attributable  to  a conspiracy
 was  admissible.   The  court then   concluded that it would review Eisenstadt’s
    affidavit to  determine  whether  Eisenstadt’s  testimony   is based
on valid     economic  reasoning, saying,  “The  court’s focus  is  on the
principles  and   methodology  used by Eisenstadt  and  not on the resulting
 conclusions.”

       Court       of  Appeals
Chapman       v.  Maytag,    2002
U.S.  App. Lexis                  15131 (7th Cir. 2002).    This   short
 decision   provides    a  particularly     clear      discussion  of  how
the  Daubert   decision     can  be applied to   assess  scientific     
validity   and   reliability.      The  7th  Circuit overturned   the trial
court  decision      because  of    failure   of the  trial court judge 
 to act as a sufficiently      involved         gatekeeper   in keeping 
out expert   testimony that  would not    meet     scientific      standards.

Dura Auto. Sys. of Ind., Inc. v. CTS Corp., 285 F.3d
 609 (7th Cir. 2002). Judge Posner said: “The Daubert test must be applied
 with due regard for the specialization of modern science. A scientist, however
 well credentialed he may be, is not permitted to be the mouthpiece of a
scientist  in a different specialty. That would not be responsible science.
A theoretical  economist, however able, would not be allowed to testify to
the findings of an econometric study conducted by another economist if he
lacked expertise  in econometrics and the study raised questions that only
an econometrician  could answer.  If it were apparent that the study
was not cut and dried,  the author would have to testify; he could not hide
behind the theoretician.”  Economic issues were not central to the decision
in this case.                                                           
                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
             
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Huey v. United Parcel Service, 165 F.3d 1084 (7th Cir. 1999). 
                             This decision affirms a trial court decision 
not    to   permit       the    testimony          of Q. R. Verdier, referred 
 to    by Judge  Easterbrook       in   quotes as a  “forensic        vocational 
    expert.”  Verdier had written       a letter  to the plaintiff attorney, 
          who  had turned it over in   discovery     as the report of the 
expert.    Easterbrook         continued:  “As far as this    letter   reveals, 
Verdier    did nothing  but talk     to  Huey, read documents    that Huey’s 
 counsel    sent, and write    a letter.   Verdier     does not describe 
   the reasoning     used to reach    his conclusion.    During an   offer 
 of proof,     Verdier    was clear about    the limits of his inquiry   and
the   basis  of   his    opinion. Asked if   he did more than accept Huey’s
 view that  UPS retaliated,         Verdier replied:     ‘I think he’s the
one that [sic]  best knows    what   happened   in the   situation.’   This
will not do as the work  of   an expert.” 
In Re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litigation,
                             186 F.3d 781 (7th Cir. 1999).  This is

a  classic        Richard        Posner       decision     on an appeal of 
the  trial  court      decision in   which    the trial      court judge 

 excluded  most  of the    testimony of Dr.  Robert    Lucas, a Nobel   
  prize winning     economist     under a Daubert  standard.    Judge  Posner 
wrote:    “But    what was objectionable         about  his evidence    actually 
 had nothing     to do with Daubert,  it   was that   the evidence mainly 
  concerned    a matter  not in issue – that   the manufacturers    of brand 
name   prescription     drugs engage in price   discrimination, showing  
 that they have  market   power.   Everyone  knows   this. The question is
whether    the market  power  owes anything   to collusion.       (Even if
it did, we  remind that     to  obtain damages  the   plaintiffs   would 
   have to separate  the  price  effects    of collusion  from  the price 
 effects     of the plaintiff’s      lawful market power.    Blue  Cross 
& Blue Shield    United  of   Wisconsin   v. Marshfield  Clinic, 
152   F.3d 588, 593-94 (7th    Cit.   1998).  On   that, Lucas  had virtually 
nothing to   say. It is irrelevant,      therefore,    that, as the plaintiffs 
point out, the  district judge erred    in excluding    Lucas’s testimony 
on the grounds that he  did – that Lucas   had not studied    the prescription 
drug industry in depth  and had formulated   his tentative    opinion after 
working on the case for only  40 hours. His  opinion that there   is price 
discrimination  in the prescription   drug  industry is one that an  economist 
of Lucas’s distinction  should have   been  able to reach in even  less time. 
Indeed the existence  of price discrimination    should have been  removed 
as an issue at trial  by a stipulation of the  parties. 
Large v. Mobile Tool International, Inc.,
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55463 (N.D. Ind. 2007). This opinion and order of
Judge William C. Lee rejected defendant’s motion for summary
judgment with respect to a number of issues. One of those issues was
that “Large’s claim for future wage loss fails because he
has not identified a forensic economist and has not identified any
witness who will present admissible testimony regarding a present value
calculation of his future economic loss.” The plaintiff
identified Mr. Peder Melberg, a vocational rehabilitation expert,
regarding future economic loss.  The opinion identified the
methods uses by Melberg, which did not include a reduction to present
value. Judge Lee held that Large had presented sufficient evidence to
meet his initial burden, that the defense was free to demonstrate the
weakness of Melberg’s opinions, that 7th Circuit law did not
require reduction of a loss claim to present value, and indicated that
the defendant could challenge Melberg’s credentials in a Daubert
hearing. Judge Lee added: “If the defendants desire present value
calculations, the better reasoning is to require them to present such
evidence.” “Them” in this context appears to refer to
the defendants.
Quirin v. Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, 2006 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 36472. (C.D. IL, 2006). Economic expert Dr. Leroy Grossman
had projected personal injury losses of the Plaintiff on the basis that
the Plaintiff was totally disabled or able to earn only the minimum
wage. The defense challenged the admissibility of Dr. Grossman’s
testimony on the basis that these assumptions were not supported by the
facts of the case. The Court agreed with Defendants that expert
testimony should be excluded if it is based upon unprovable
assumptions. The defendants cited Elcock v. Kmart Corp., 233
F.3d 734 (3rd Cir. 2000) in support of their position. In denying
Defendant’s motion, the Court cited differences between Elcock
and the case at hand. There was evidence that Mr. Quirin had been
unable to obtain work since his injury. “Further, unlike Elcock,
Dr. Grossman’s calculations were based upon Mr. Quirin’s
actual pre-injury income.”  

Sokol v. Akron Gen. Med. Ctr., 1997 U.S. Dist. Lexis 22078
                             (N.D.Ohio 1997). This decision related to the 
 admissibility              of   an   affidavit        by David M. Eisenstadt, 
 Ph.d., the  plaintiff’s            economic     expert in an   antitrust 
    action.   The court    cited      Ohio  v. Louis    Trauth Dairy, 
 925  F.Supp. 1247     (S.D.Ohio    1996) as   applying    “a modified   
Daubert analysis  to  an economist’s        testimony    based on   a statistical 
   multiple regression   analysis”    and In re   Aluminum    Phosphide

the  court applied a modified    Daubert    analysis  and held that  an  economist’s
   testimony regarding  price   declines  attributable  to  a conspiracy
 was  admissible.   The  court then   concluded that it would review Eisenstadt’s

 conclusions.”            
           District     Courts
  in the 7th Circuit (IL,         IN, WI)
Brunker
v.  Schwan’s Home Service, Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77556 (N.D.IN
2006).  This is a judicial memorandum from Judge Andrew H. Rodovich granting
a motion  in limine to preclude the testimony of Dr.  Bruce Jaffe, the
economic  expert for the defendant. James Bernard, as the plaintiff’s economic
expert,  had projected that Frank Brunker would be unemployed for 30.5 years
following  a termination allegedly in retaliation for exercising his rights
under the  Americans With Disabilities Act. Bernard had projected that Brunker
would  have had earnings based on $12,480 as a pizza delivery truck driver
over that period. Jaffe issues a page and a half report saying that it was
unreasonable  to assume that Brunker would remain unemployed for 30.5 years
and that Jaffe  saw no reason why Brunker could not earn mean earnings of
a high school graduate  in the Unites States of $41,221 in 2004. Brunker’s
disability was that he  has multiple sclerosis, which Jaffe did not consider
in his report. The judge  said: “If there is a scientific basis underlying
Jaffee’s conclusions, he  has not shown it. At most, Jaffee’s admittedly
preliminary conclusions are  straightforward comparisons of Brunker to broad
categories of the population.  He does not explain why it is acceptable to
disregard Brunker’s medical condition,  education level, work experience,
or the economic and employment statistics  of the regional job market. Jaffe’s
testimony provides no basis on which the district court can determine whether
it meets the requirement of Rule 702 that expert testimony be the product
of the application of ‘reliable principles and methods’ to specific facts
of this case.” 

Bultema v. Caterpillar, Inc., 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
6301 (N.D.Ill 1999). Motions to bar the testimony of vocational expert
Steven Blumenthal, life care planning expert Michael Brethauer and
economic expert Phillip Rushing were denied in the case of Blumenthal
and granted in part and denied in part in the cases of Brethauer and
Rushing. Brethhauer and Rushing were permitted to testify to the extent
that their testimony tracked the foundation established at trial.

Peterson v. Union Pacific,
2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52064 (C.D. Ill. 2008). In this memorandum, Judge
Jeanne Scott granted motions to limit the testimony of life care
planning expert Dr. Craig Lichtblau and Dr. Anthony Gamboa with respect
to items in the life care plan for which Dr. Lictblau could not state a
probability. She denied a defense request to bar Dr. Gamboa’s
testimony based on Dr. Gamboa’s use of a total offset net
discount rate, saying that Union Pacific could challenge Dr.
Gamboa’s discount rate in arguments to the jury. 

Quirin v. Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, 2006 U.S.

Thakore v. Universal Machine Co. of Pottstown,
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87869 (N.D.Ill 2009). Motion 17 [# 160] addressed
in this Memorandum Opinion on Motions in Limine from Judge Jeffrey Cole
was a motion to bar Plaintiff economic expert Anthony M. Gamboa from
testifying under a Daubert standard. The Court declined to bar Dr.
Gamboa’s testimony, stating that although Gamboa did not have a
background in economics, he had an MBA from the University of Chicago
which was “enough to qualify him as an expert for purposes of
this case.” The Court described Gamboa’s proposed testimony
as follows: “Mr. Gamboa relied on a study conducted by the U.S.
Census Bureau, which he has used throughout his career and to which he
applies his education and experience to try to account for the admitted
limitations of the study. The methodology of using worklife expectancy
tables has been peer reviewed. Gamboa has been allowed to testify 35
times in the past two years. Other courts have heard challenges to Mr.
Gamboa and have found him competent to render expert opinions. The
district court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania found that
‘the Worklife Expectancy table really represents a statistical
exercise constructed to estimate economic loss and is not expected to
reflect actuality. The weight and credibility of the data relied upon
to construct the table may be challenged on cross-examination at
trial.’”

by plaintiff’s economic          expert Jonathan  Crane      were challenged 
  on  the  basis that   they    included    an   adjustment     of   past 
nominal wages   to  a  higher    figure  “and that increase    appears   
    to be equivalent to   an effort     to collect    prejudgment interest 
 on    those    claimed     past lost    earnings.  Federal   District  Judge

                      of Appeals
Blue     Dane   Simmental      v.  American     Simmental, 
           178 F. 3d    1035 (8th  Cir. 1999).      This  was a contract 
   violation case,      not    a personal  injury,   but   the testimony of
Dr.  Alan   Baquet,   an agricultural        economist,   was   excluded based
on Daubert       standards and the exclusion        was  upheld by
the 8th Circuit Court     of   Appeals. Dr. Baquet was found     qualified, 
      but his methodology    was  found   unreliable and "simplistic.

Children’s Broadcasting Corporation v. The Walt Disney Company,
                           245 F.3d 1008 (8th Cir. 2001). The trial court
had    granted        a  new    trial   based on   its   own failure under
a Daubert    standard      to  have  excluded     the   testimony   of Stephen
   Willis,    apparently     an accountant.    The trial     court   found
 that   the   testimony    of   Willis    was based on   an incomplete  
  model and  constituted    nothing   more than    speculation    based on
the ipse     dixit of the    expert. The    8th Circuit   upheld  the   
decision of the trial     court    judge to  grant a new  trial   on this
basis.     (Submitted by Frank   Tinari.)
Concord Boat Corp. v. Brunswick, 207 F.3d 1039 (8th Cir.
  2000). This was an antitrust action, but the trial court judge had admitted
   the testimony of Dr. Robert Hall.  The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals
   found that Dr. Hall's model was unreliable for several reasons. This is 
 notable                             because the "Reference Guide on Estimation 
 of Economic          Losses       in   Damages"         in the Reference 
 Manual on Scientific          Evidence,        first  and second    
  editions (1994 and 2000)      was    written by Robert     Hall   and Victoria
 Lazear.      Even this    kind  of   credential is not sufficient      
to  avoid not being allowed        to  testify   under       Daubert 
standards.              
Johnson v. Serra, 521 F.2d 1289 (8th Cir. 1975). Economist 
                        Edward Foster’s projections of future inflationary 
 increases           in   earnings         through the year 2002 should have 
 been inadmissible           under   Minnesota   law    according   to the 
 8th Circuit. The court      said:     “His testimony  on  future   inflationary 
   projections through      the year    2002 should . . . have  been excluded 
  as speculative   and    the  excessive    verdict obviously  derived  from 
 it must  be reduced or,    in  the alternative,    a new trial granted.” 
 The  8th Circuit  cited federal      cases  not allowing    inflationary 
projections  to  be made, as  in Johnson      v. Penrod  Drilling    Co, 
510 F.2d 234 (5th   Cir. 1975) (en  banc).
Meterlogic, Inc. v. KLT, Inc., 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 10149 
                        (8th Cir. 2004). The 8th Circuit reviewed for abuse 
 of    discretion           the    trial    court’s decision to exclude the 
 damages    testimony   of   Lawrence      Redler.   “Redler    was to testify 
 regarding    the discounted      present value     of Meterlogic’s   now-defunct 
     business   of providing     remote monitoring     services for business 

    machines.   He  predicted  financial    results ten  years   into the 
future   even   though the  parties’   contract    extended only  two years 

 and allowed   for termination   at  any time;  he   assumed that Meterlogic 
  would   be   the sole representative   of  the appellees,    even though 
 the  contract     was a non-exclusive agreement;     he  assumed   that the
  parties  would   have   30% market share in the remote  monitoring    
 and metering  market,    but admitted   that he had no market  research to
 support    that estimate;     he assumed 15%  annual growth without  any
data  indicating   that the estimate      was realistic;   he admitted  to
having  no data on how many   remote  monitoring     and metering   devices 
  would be sold; and he admitted that    he based his   analysis  on the 
so-called    Metzler report, which was  prepared   for KLT  only as an investment 
   planning   tool. . . We conclude  that the district     court did not abuse
its  discretion    by excluding  Redler’s testimony.”      Submitted 
by both David  Jones    and Ralph  Frasca.
Peitzmeier v. Hennessy Industries, Inc., 97 F.3d 293 (8th
                             Cir. 1996).  This 1996 decision of the
8th    Circuit        Court      of   Appeals        rejected the notion
that engineering     principles      were     not novel  scientific     
  testimony and therefore     not subject      to the   standards    of 
      Daubert v.   Merrell-Dow         Pharmaceutical,      Inc.,
  509  U.S.   579.  Thus, the 8th     Circuit had   anticipated    
 the conclusion     reached   by the United    States  Supreme  Court in
       Kumho Tire  Co.,   Ltd. v.   Carmichael,    526 U.S.  137 (1999).
























































                                                         District     Courts in the 8th Circuit
        (AR, IA, MN, MO, NE, ND, SD)
Hammes v. Yamaha Motor Corp. U.S.A.,
2006 U.S. LEXIS 26526 (D.MN 2006). Dr. Paul Estenson was permitted to
testify under Daubert-Kumho standards. The court cited the following
credentials: “Estensen is a trained economist with a Ph.D. in
economics from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He has taught
college-level courses, worked in the research department of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and been a member of the research
department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.” The court
also said: “The methods employed by Estensen have been utilized
by other economists. Furthermore, Estensen’s failure to employ a
specific test, the “Worklife Estimates by Occupation” which
assumes that individuals do not change careers, does not undermine the
reliability of his methods. . . Estensen’s technique has been
tested and employed by other expert economists; it has been subject to
peer review; does not have a known rate of error; and is generally
accepted in the economics community.” The Court also ruled that
Estensen’s failure to incorportate such factors as the
possibility of a previous injury and his use of a Monte Carlo
simulation to verify the accuracy of his analysis did not disqualify
him. Finally, the Court held that Estenson’s projection that
value of Hammes’ household services will increase over time did
not undermine the reliability of his conclusions. “This is an
issue of fact that goes to the weight of the evidence, not to
admissibility.”

Hernandez v. Flor, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1732 (D. Minn 2003). 
                       Defendants sought to exclude testimony about the valuation
        of   emotional          services  by economist, Dr. Gene Trevino,
based      on  the   arguments that     emotional    services  are not a
proper topic     for  expert   testimony and  that   Dr. Trevino    was not
qualified to   testify    as to the  dollar value  of emotional   services
   that the  decedent  Cruz    would have  provided to his family. The  
District Court    allowed  the testimony    saying  that “Defendants   can
make their  objections   through    cross-examination,”       but indicated
that  it would determine   at trial    whether  various parts      of Trevino’s
 testimony  lacks the  requisite    foundation  or is  admissible.
Kinnaman v. Ford, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 235, (E.D.Mo 2000).
                           The court denied the admissibility of vocational
   expert       Sherry       Browing        under   the Daubert standard,
saying:   [T]here       is simply    no   corroborating       evidence  
of Browning's   testimony      and exhibits   that  the methodology  she
   has employed     to develop   her   conclusions is  an acceptable   methodology
  and    has been tested     and   is generally accurate.    There is   nothing 
 in  the   record   to   support   Browning's   methodology   other than 
that  she promulgated   it,  and  that   it is used by other   persons  
in her   discipline. The expert's    bald assurance    of validity is not 
  sufficient   to show that her methodology     meets a  proper   standard 
of reliability.”
Norwest Bank v. K-Mart,
1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3426 (N.D. Ind. 1997). The Judge Robert L. Miller
granted defendant’s motion in limine to exclude the testimony of
Dr. Robert Voogt, a life care planning expert. Judge Miller said:
“Dr. Voogt’s ‘forecasts’ of Mrs. Frick’s
present and future medical needs are not admissible. This leaves the
other class of opinions plaintiffs wish to offer through Dr. Voogt: his
cost valuation of the life plan he outlined. Cost evaluation does not
require medical expertise, and Dr. Voogt plainly has the requisite
experience to make his opinion relevant to the trier of fact. It does
not appear, however, that those opinions are based on any evidence
other than Dr. Voogt’s inadmissible opinions on the care Mrs.
Frick will need.  It does not appear from the record that any
health care provider will testify that Mrs. Frick will need the course
of treatment upon which Dr. Voogt based his cost valuations. Dr. Voogt
testified that he has not discussed the plan’s components with
Mrs. Frick’s treating physicians, either before or after devising
the plan. No other health care provider has recommended all of the
plans components, and it does not appear that any other health care
provider recommended any single component of the plan other than Mrs.
Frick’s current pharmaceutical prescriptions. An opinion without
foundation in the record has no probative value, and so is neither
relevant with the meaning of Rules 401 and 402 nor helpful to the trier
of fact within the meaning of Rule 702.” 
Self v. Equilon Enterprises,
LLC, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47381 (E.D. Mo 2007).  This memorandum
grants a motion to strike the reports of two damages experts of the
plaintiff. The report of Richard Berliner, a petroleum marketing
executive, about the scope of competition between gasoline retail
outlets. The court cited Berlyn, Inc. V. The Gazette Newspapers, Inc,
214 F. Supp. 2d 530, 536 (D. Md. 2002) as holding that general business
experience unrelated to antitrust economics does not render a witness
qualified to offer an opinion on complicated antitrust cases such as
defining relevant markets. The court said: “Applying the
foregoing to the Berliner report, the undersigned finds that Berliner
is not qualified and even if qualified, his opinion is not reliable, in
that it is based on insufficient facts and unsound methodology for the
reasons set forth. Berliner is not an economist. As noted by
Defendants, the Court finds that Plaintiffs concede that Berliner is
not qualified to render an opinion as to the relevant geographic market
by arguing that they do not ‘rely on Mr. Berliner’s
expertise for complicated issues such as defining relevant
markets.’ Thus, Berliner’s expert report clearly purports
to render an expert opinion defining the relevant geographic market in
contradiction to Plaintiffs’ concession that he is unqualified to
offer such opinions.”

9th   Circuit
    
    Court
                      of Appeals
Cooper v. Travelers, 113 Fed. Appx. 198, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 
       21324 (9th Cir. 2004). Robert Johnson’s testimony in breach of implied 
    covenant   case was properly excluded by the district court under Rule 
 702.    “Johnson   himself testified during voir dire that in his normal 
professional    practice   he would verify client-provided data before relying 
on it to reach   a conclusion.   Yet, Johnson, who intended to base his opinion 
solely on  data provided by   Cooper, failed to follow this procedure. Because 
Johnson’s   testimony was  not based on the type of data on which experts 
in economics   would reasonably  rely, and Johnson admitted as much during 
voir dire, the   district court did  not abuse its discretion when it excluded 
the testimony.”     
Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc, 43 F.3d 1311
                             (9th Cir. 1995)(Daubert II). This is
the    decision         following          remand       from the United States 
 Supreme  Court    back     to the 9th  Circuit        Court of   Appeals. 
    It emphasizes     the value     of demonstration  that   theories    
underlying   testimony        are used    for purposes other  than litigation 
  and    lays out a  more     complete   list of Daubert  standards. 
      

Trevino v. Gates, 99 F.3d 911 (9th Cir. 1996), an unnamed
                             economist projected the lost earnings of decedent
     Juan     Bahena       on   the    basis     of an assumption that Bahena
    was employed     as a  full     time   mechanic    when  he   was killed.
    The plaintiff  was   Behena’s  infant     child,   whose last    name
 was    Trevino and with whose  mother  Bahena  lived.       The court 
 said:     “The  only  foundation   laid for  this assumption was  testimony 
      that  (1) Bahena   left  in  the morning  and returned in the  evening; 
 (2)     he gave Trevino’s  mother   money  at  fairly regular intervals; 
 and  (3) he   was observed on a few  occasions  working  on cars.” The economic
     expert’s    testimony was not  admitted.

In Re Broadcom 
    Corporation   Securities Legislation, 2005 U.S.   Dist. LEXIS 12118 
 (Central.   Dist.   Cal. 2005). “The evidentiary hearing showed   that the 
 proposed  trading  model  does not satisfy the Daubert test for submission 
   to the  jury. The  technique  has not been tested against “real world”conditions, 
     and probably  cannot  be so tested unless a different set of test protocols 
     is established.  It  has not been subjected to the sort of critical peer
   review   and publication    that one would expect as a prerequisite for
 jury   acceptance.   The potential    rate of error is highly questionable, 
 and is  based on a set   of criteria    that undermines the claimed error 
 rate as  being truly representative   of   the facts sought to be proved. 
 Although   held out by litigation professionals      as useful in securities 
 litigation,   most notably as a settlement aid,  the    technique is not 
generally accepted   in what is the relevant scientific   community   – professional 
 economists.   The Daubert criteria are not exclusive,   and the   Court has
 considered others  suggested by Plaintiffs, but the Court   is unable  
to  find other indicators  of reliability or acceptability that   would satisfy
   Daubert’s requirement.        

Lake Union Drydock Company v. United States,
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65386 (W.D.Wash. 2007). This is a memorandum in
response to a Daubert motion in limine challenging the admission of
Alan Nierenberg on the basis that Nierenberg is not an economist or a
certified public accountant and that the formula he used to calculate
plaintiff’s damages lacks an adequate foundation. The Court
denied the motion to exclude Nierenberg’s testimony (and the
testimony of two other experts) saying: “[T]his case is being
tried to the Court, and as numerous courts have observed, ‘the
Daubert gatekeeping obligation is less pressing in connection with a
bench trial’ where ‘the gatekeeper and trier of fact [are]
one and the same.’” The memorandum cites three prior
decisions that have reached that conclusion. 

Lee v. United States Taekwondo Union,
2006 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 25559 (D. Hawaii 2006). This memorandum
denied a motion in limine to exclude the testimony of economic expert
Dr. Thomas Loudat based on Daubert-Kumho standards. Judge Mollway found
that “Loudat did what economic experts typically do, applying a
discount rate to calculate presnt value, as well as examining
Lee’s work-life expectancy, and tax consequences. . . Such
typical expert testimony is generally relevant to damage claims and
helpful to the trier of fact.” She added: “For the most
part, Defendants’ claims of unreliability attack the underlying
assumptions made by Loudat, rather than his methodology.
Defendants’ arguments therefore go to the weight that should be
accorded Loudat’s testimony, rather than its admissibility.
Defendants’ arguments are analogous to a challenge to an
expert’s assumption that a person’s work-life expectancy is
20 years. That assumption is speculative in that it assumes that a
person will live and work for 20 years when, in fact, the person could
be killed in a car accident the next day. An expert’s assumption
that a person’s work-life expectancy will be a certain length and
use of that assumption in calculating that a person’s loss of
future earnings does not make the expert’s testimony inadmissible
under Daubert. Instead, the evidence is admissible and subject to
vigorous cross examination. . . The only challenge Defendants make
regarding the general acceptance of Loudat’s methodology is
to  his use of a 4% discount rate. Although Defendants cite some
case law applying a higher discount rate, they admit that a 4% discount
rate is used in some situations as the ‘lowest possible rate that
could be applied in any situation.’ .  . . Defendants are
free to introduce evidence at trial indicating that the appropriate
discount rate is higher than 4%.” 

Salomon v. Andrea C. Fishing Corporation,
2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS (S.D.Ca. 2008). This memorandum dealt with
dueling motions in limine to bar portions of the testimony of Dr.
Patrick Kennedy of LECG for the defendant and Dr. Joyce Pickersgill for
the plaintiff. The plaintiff motion was to bar testimony of Dr. Kennedy
that relied on U.S. Customs Service data to argue work-lives of persons
working on tuna boats out of Samoa are shorter than average for males
living in the United States. The plaintiff was a Philippines national.
This motion was denied under a Daubert standard.  The defense
motion was to bar testimony of Dr. Pickersgill regarding the
plaintiff’s lost health benefits. Dr. Pickersgill used costs of
American health care as a proxy for lost Filipino health care benefits
of the plaintiff. The Court held that using American data as a proxy
for Filipino data was irrelevant and unreliable under a Daubert
standard and granted this motion in limine. 

10th     Circuit

              District  
 Courts in the 10th Circuit         (CO, KS, OK, NM, UT, WY)

Alvarado v. Loftus, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19245 (D. Co.
2007). Judge Blackburn denied defendant’s motion to exclude the
testimony of economist John O. Ward. This case involved the wrongful
deaths of two Mexican nationals who were visiting the United States.
One was a 10 year old male child and the other was a seventy one year
old female. Ward had used data from the United States for growth rates,
employment data, wage data, and mortality tables. Ward used an
“average adjustment factor to deflate potential losses to
standards in Mexico.” Judge Blackburn questioned the adjustment

factor, but held that: “[T]his conversion constitutes the
application of reasonably reliable principles and methods to the facts
known to Dr. Ward, and other analyses made by Dr. Ward. Under these
circumstances, vigorous cross examination, presentation of contrary
evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the
appropriate means for challenging the principles and methods used by
Dr. Ward.”
Hayes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 294 F. Supp. 2d 1249 (E.D. 
      Okla 2003). The court granted defendant’s motion in limine to bar proposed 
      economic expert testimony by Dr. Will Clark on punitive damages. Clark 
   had   suggested using total dividends of Wal-Mart as a measure of punitive 
   damages   that would not cause irreparable financial harm to Wal-Mart. 
Citing         Voilas   v. General Motors Corp., 73 F. Supp. 2d 452, 
464 (D.   N.J. 1999), the  court said: “[H]is opinion amounts to little more 
than speculation    as to what the effect on Wal-Mart will be if the jury 
were to calculate an   award of punitive damages as equal to or less than 
dividends paid. Such a   conclusion  (so far as the present record reflects) 
has not been tested or   subjected to peer review, has no known error rate 
and has not been accepted    in the community of economists. There is no methodology
revealed by which    he reaches his conclusion. Indeed, the Court speculates
that if Dr. Clark    could, in fact, accurately predict the financial consequences
of the suggested    punitive damages, he would be making millions by conulsting

for Wall Street    investment banks. His curriculum vitae, however, does
not record such experience

Law v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, 1998 U.S.
                             Dist. LEXIS 6640 (D. Kan. 1998). The testimony
   of   Dr.    Robert       Tollison         was    challenged in a motion 
 in  limine   under    a Daubert      standard in   an   antitrust       action.
  Tollison   was the   plaintiff’s    expert  and Dr.  John  R. Umbeck was
     the   defendant’s      economic expert.    The court  began  by noting
    that Dr. Tollison’s        credentials “are   both undisputed  and  beyond
  dispute.”    The decision      is   detailed    in  its description  of
 Tollison’s   methods and   the   challenges   made  to them    by Umbeck. 
 The  court’s  treatment  of Umbeck     is less respectful,     noting   various
    things   that Umbeck did  not   do that   would have been   warranted 
   by his criticism,      saying at  the  end of which:   “Therefore,   except 
  to the  limited  extent    discussed      below,    we are left   with 
 a hodge-podge   of  miscellaneous     attacks    on so-called      ‘absurd 
 results’     and ‘faulty    assumptions,’  cute   rhetorical  strategems, 
    and  unsubstantiated      speculation   about problems  that may or may 
  not infect   Dr.  Tollison’s    work.” 
Nielberger v. FedEx Ground Package Sys.,
566 F.3d 1184 (10th Cir. 2009). The testimony of life care planning
expert Doris Shriver and economic expert Thomas Roney regarding past
medical expenses had been excluded at the trial court level based on a
failure of the Plaintiff to provide testimony by a treating physician
to establish that the Plaintiff’s medical expenses were
reasonable and necessary to treat injuries caused by the accident (as
compared with a pre-existing scoliosis condition). The plaintiff failed
to provide a record of the testimony of Shriver that included
Shriver’s testimony, but it appeared that the only basis for past
medical expenses was testimony by the plaintiff herself, which the 10th
Circuit did not consider qualified. Shriver and Roney were apparently
allowed to present testimony about future life care costs. The 10th
Circuit upheld the trial court decision.  Suggested by Bob Taylor.
      

North v. Ford Motor Company,
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4869 (D.UT 2007). Ford had filed an evidence
spoliation claim and five motions in limine under a Daubert standard in
a wrongful death action governed by Utah law. Judge Stewart provided
citations to10th  Circuit decisions regarding the interpretation
of Daubert and rejected all but one of the motions in limine, dealing
with each of them separately. The memorandum does not give the first
names of the experts. The one motion in limine that was granted was for
a “Dr. Jorgenson,” who is a psychologist. Vocational expert
“Ms. Wilson” an economist “Dr. Philips” were
allowed to testify. The judge wrote: “Dr. Philips is an
economist. Ford sees to exclude the opinion of Dr. Phillips regarding
Steven North’s future economic losses on essentially the same
grounds as it challenged Ms. Wilson’s opinion–that it
disregards the real facts of Steven North’s employment,
education, earnings and training. Ford also seeks to exclude Dr.
Philips’ opinion on Nicole North’s economic losses on the
ground of lack of foundation. This Court finds that Ford’s
objections are matters relating to the credibility of this witness and
the weight that the jury may give to his opinions. Having reviewed the
record on this Motion, the Court finds that Dr. Phillips’
opinions as to future economic losses meet the Daubert standard for
admissibility.”   
Palmer v. ASARCO Inc.,
2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59205 (N.D. Okla. 2007).  This is a
memorandum and order by Judge Claire V. Eagan precluding testimony by
economist Thomas H. Mayor of the University of Houston that was based
on a “negative” discount rate of 1 %. Dr. Mayor had
provided one calculation at a “discount rate of 1 %” and
one calculation at a “negative” (more than offset)
“discount rate” of 1%. The memorandum reviewed other court
cases that spoke to this issue. “Discount rate” is defined
in the memorandum as the difference between the annual rate of salary
growth and the rate of return on safe investments so it is a net
discount rate and not a real discount rate. Mayor was permitted to
provide testimony based on a net discount rate of 1%.

11th    Circuit


   
               District    Courts in the 11th Circuit (AL, GA, FL)
Robertson v. Hecksel, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 17201 (11th Cir. 
         2005). The mother of a 30 year old adult decedent brought an action 
   for    her  own loss of support, loss of companionship, and pain and suffering 
     resulting    from the death of her son in a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action 
    on the basis   of a deprivation of her Fourteenth Amendment right to a
 relationship     with   her adult son. This claim was dismissed by the trial
 count. The dismissal       was affirmed by the 11th Circuit on the grounds
 that there is no constitutionally-protected        liberty interest in a
continued relationship with an adult child. The    11th    Circuit pointedly 
did not minimize the value of the loss of such   a relationship,    but said: 
“[I]t is the province of the Florida legislature    to decide when    a parent 
can recover for the loss of an adult child.  We   will not circumvent    its
authority through an unsupported reading  of the   Fourteenth Amendment.”   
          
Tucker v. Fearn, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 11536 (11th Cir. 2003). 
                             This decision holds specifically that loss of 
 society         damages        resulting          from the death of a minor 
 child cannot        be recovered     by   a parent under      general   
maritime law. The     implication,    however,     is   that loss of society 
     damages  are     not allowable  under  any circumstances        in maritime 
 law. The    decision    reviews  the different   maritime acts    that  
 authorize wrongful death       litigation  and the decisions  that have 
  previously    been reached    to preclude    loss of society   damages under
   those acts.  In  1978,   the U.S. Supreme  Court    disallowed loss  
of society    damages under   the Jones Act in             Mobil Oil 
 Corp. v. Higginbotham,       436 U.S. 618  (1978)  and under the Death 
 on the  High Seas Act (DOHSA)      in       Miles      v. Apex Marine 
Corp., 498 U.S.  19 (1990). 
Kearney v. Auto-Owners Insurance Company, 2007 U. S.
Dist. LEXIS 80378 (M.D.Fla. 2007). This memorandum from magistrate
judge Thomas G. Wilson recommends denying a motion in limine by the
plaintiff to deny the testimony of Dr. Michael Piette. The memorandum
discusses Dr. Piette’s methods at some length. Judge Wilson
indicated that the arguments used by the plaintiff are arguments that
go to the weight of Dr. Piette’s testimony, not its
admissibility. One argument made by the plaintiff was that Dr.
Piette’s testimony should be excluded because “[t]he
determination of a plaintiff’s loss of earning capacity is not
something beyond the understanding of the average citizen.” About
this argument, Judge Wilson said: “The notion that the testimony
of an experienced economist would not assist the jury in determining
the plaintiff’s pre-accident earning capacity is, on its face,
preposterous, and it is belied by the plaintiff’s proffer of his
own expert economist on this issue.” 

Matter of the Adventure Bound Sports, Inc. and Andre Smith,
                             858 F.Supp. 1192 (D.Ga. 1994).  This case
   was    tried      under      the    Death      on the High Seas Act (DOHSA).
   It   involves   complex   issues      of lost   earnings       and fringe
   benefits   based  on the projection    that     the decedent   would have
       remained    in the military until eligible     for   military retirement.
      He would       then have  gone to work in the    private   sector.
The    court assesses       the impact    of the death on the   family’s
  access    to various military     benefits    and then    the projection
    of the      plaintiff economic  expert,   Dr. Costen   that private 
  employment      fringe    benefits should  be calculated    at 15 percent
   of wages.      There    is a claim   by  another   woman that    the decedent
was the      father of her     child, a child   from   a previous    marriage,
claims    for lost   college educations      by the   children of   his marriage, 
 claims  of lost household   service,   loss  of nurture  and   guidance 
(which was  allowed), gifts to the   child   from  the  previous   marriage, 
claim  of  loss of college education by   that   child, loss  of   inheritance, 
      collateral  source issues, calculations       of taxes, an   prejudgement
    interest.    The court  also provides an   assessment      of   the impact
   of Culver II and  the  fact that it was overridden  by       Monessen
           S.W. Ry Co. v. Morgan.         This  is a decision that
   is  twenty      two pages in single spaced  text,  but    all  of which 
 is  concerned  with     matters   of damages relevant  to a forensic    economist. 
Federal      Circuit

    Court
                      of Appeals
Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923). The
  source of the Frye test that was replaced by Daubert-Kumho
   standards as the basis for admissibility of expert testimony. 
Joy v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc, 999 F.2d 549 (D.C. Cir
                             1993). Dr. John Glennie had projected four earnings
       loss     scenarios          for    the   decedent, Mr. Joy. Tax returns
     indicated      that prior to   his    death,    Mr.  Joy   and his wife
   operated  a toy    store  and had reported     $14,680  on   his tax 
returns,      with   an equal    amount  reported by his  wife.    
 The  lowest    of  four   future   earnings   rates  used for future  projections
   was    $35,907,     with  values ranging     up  to $97,536 based  on
a consulting       career   Mr. Joy    had mentioned    thinking      about
on one  occasion.    The court     found all of  Dr.  Glennie’s    projections
     speculative     and did not  allow  him to testify.
Oldham v. Korean Airlines Co., LTD., 127 F.3d (C.A.D.C. 1997). 
                             Testimony by an economic expert was admitted. 
                 District    Courts in the Federal
        Circuit (Washington, D.C.)
Butera v. District
of  Columbia,        83  F.Supp.     2d  25  (D.   Dist.    Col. 1999). 
Defendants  sought   a  new   trial  on the   grounds    that  the   Court 
 had  refused  to strike     allegedly   inadmissible    testimony    by three
 experts,    including    an economist,   Dr. Richard Edelman.   The Court
  said: “Defendants     state    that  Dr. Edelman’s   testimony was speculative

   because  the   lost-future-earnings        prediction   was not based
on Eric Butera’s      work  history. That argument,    however,    goes to
the weight rather   than  the  admissibility  of the testimony.   Dr.   Edelman
   explained   in great detail    how he came to  his predictions,    and
Defendants     cross-examined him extensively.    In any event, it is   not
improper for    a calculation   to be based upon  earning    potential  rather
than demonstrated    earning capacity.”          

Arizona
Logerquist v. McVey, 1 P.3d 113 (Ariz. 2000).  
                             The Supreme Court of Arizona retained the Frye
           standard             for    admission       of expert testimony,
      rejecting Daubert.  More     importantly,          it held   
  even           Frye does  not   apply  when the nature       of
 the testimony      is   not novel scientific     evidence,  saying: “Frye
 is   inapplicable        when a qualified    witness     offers relevant
 testimony   or  conclusions     based    on experience and     observation
about  human behavior     for    the purpose of  explaining  that    behavior.”  
   This was a 3-2   decision.      The dissents  from Justice     Martone 
and Justice  McGregor     strongly     urge   the adoption of            
      Daubert  and        Kumho.                  
Arkansas
Farm Bureau Insurance Company v. Foote, 314 Ark. 105; 14 S.W.3d 512 (Arkansas 2000 ). In this decision, the Arkansas Supreme Court accepted Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, as binding in Arkansas cases. The Court pointed out that: “Two years before the Court’s decision in Daubert,
this court adopted a strikingly similar approach to the admission of
novel scientific testimony in Prater v. State, 307 Ark. 180, 820 S.W.2d
429 (1991). At issue was the contention of a plaintiff expert that a
dog had an ability to detect accelerants in an arson investigation that
exceeded that of all scientific tests. This contention was found not to
pass muster.

Manus v. American Airlines, Inc., 314 F.3d 968 (8th Cir.
  2003). Interpreting Arkansas law, The 8th Circuit upheld the trial court’s
   admission of testimony by economist, Dr. Ralph Scott. The 8th Circuit
said:      “Dr. Scott testified as the earning capacities of cosmetologists,
travel    agents  and high school graduates. He stated that travel agents
and high    school graduates  have approximately the same earning capacity,
and that    cosmetologists have  60% of the earning capacity of travel agents.
He resented    the jury with three  figures. The first was based on the value
of the loss    between the accident  and trial. The second was the present

value of the    lost earning capacity of a travel agent for twenty-one years
at full employment.    The third was half the total of the second, which
took into account the  possibility                           that Stephanie
might reenter the work  force after   approximately              ten    years
     or that she might  work at 50%   productivity.  Dr.    Scott      also
 testified     that     if the jury   wished to reduce  the   figure to 
 an  amount  appropriate      to a cosmetologist’s      earning   capacity,
   it  could  multiply  the figures   by  60%.” The   court commented:  
   “Although      we are   inclined  to agree with   the    district court’s
  observation   that    the evidence  of Stephanie’s loss     of earning
 capacity   ‘was not  particularly       strong,’   we conclude   that it
 was not materially    weaker  than the evidence     in Gibson    and Coleman.
[Gibson   v. Garrison,     824 S.W.2d 829  (Ark. 1992);          Coleman
v. Cathey,   565 S.W.2d    426.]
Wood v. State, 75 Ark. App. 22; 53 S.W. 3d 56 (Ark. App. 2001).
The Arkansas Supreme Court upheld a trial court decision to exclude the
testimony of Dr. Ann B. Tracy who would have testified that the
prescription drug Paxil caused the plaintiff to rape his two teenaged
stepsons, and thus make him innocent of the crime of rape. A Daubert
standard was applied. The court said of Dr. Tracy’s proffered testimony
that: “She testified that she did not conduct the clinical studies
herself, and that she had done no laboratory research. Dr. Tracy opined
that Paxil, Zoloft, Prozac and other SSRI antidepressants were very
dangerous and should be discontinued.”  

California

Crenshaw v. County of Los Angeles, 2004 Cal App. Unpub. LEXIS
                         4377. This decision admitted the life care testimony
    of   Sara     Gruentz,         a  certified  rehabilitation nurse, and 
 rejected      arguments     that the   testimony        of economist  David 
 Barker  should     have been   excluded.  The   defense had    argued   
that Gruentz   was   not  qualified   to testify  about   what was required 
   based    on medical   diagnosis.   The  challenge  to Barker   was based 
 on the  inadmissibility         of testimony     by Gruentz

People v. Leahy, 882 P.2d 312 (Calif. 1994). The Supreme
  Court of California emphatically retained the Frye standard for
admission                             of expert testimony, rejecting Daubert. 
        
Colorado

Lindsey v. People, 892 P.2d (Colo. 1995). The Colorado Supreme 
                             Court retained the Frye standard, but 
noted      that     its    version        of   Frye  "is not far removed from
evaluation      required      under   FRE..702,"       which   is the  basis
of the       Daubert       decision.               
Schultz v. Wells, 13 P.3d 846, 2000 Colo. J.C.A.R. 4821 (Colo.App. 
                             2000). This decision discussed the relative standings
         of   the          Frye            test and Colorado’s Rule
 702     (which     parallels       the FRE 702) in providing          the
  basis    for admission     of expert   testimony.    After extensive discussion,
           the court    said: “Accordingly,   we agree    with the defendant
   that Colorado        Rules   of Evidence,  rather than   the general acceptance
     test required      under          Frye,      provided    the
appropriate      framework   to determine    the   admissibility    of the
 evidence    at    issue here.   However, the trial court   did   not  rely
 exclusively    on     Frye, but also  analyzed the issue in depth   under
   CRE  402 and   702.   Thus,    we conclude  that the court’s consideration
   of the    Frye  test   here was   not inappropriate.”     There were
several     witnesses     in question not   in economics, but a  vocational
rehabilitation     expert     had  projected earnings    loss. The  testimony
of that expert  was  allowed       to stand.               
Connecticut

State v. Porter, 241
Conn. 7; 698 A.2d 739 (Connecticut 1997). This very long decision
adopts the standards of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 509
U.S. 579 (1993) for Connecticut.  The decision entailed admission
of polygraph evidence in Connecticut. It provided detailed discussion
of the standards for admitting evidence and provided conclusions
similar to those the U.S. Supreme Court adopted two years later in
Kumho Tire Co., Ltd v. Carmichael, 509 U.S. 579; 119 S.Ct. 1167 (1999)
that no one test, by itself, determines admissibility. 
      
      
      
      
      
      Delaware
Bowen v. E. I. Dupont de Nemours & Co., 906 A.2d 787.
 (DE 2006). The trial court had excluded the testimony of two of the Plaintiff’s
 expert witnesses, prompting a Daubert review by the Delaware Supreme Court,
 which affirmed the decision of the trial court. The Court quoted Dura Auto.
 Sys. of Ind., Inc. v. CTS Corp., 285 F.3d 609 (7th Cir. 2002) to the effect
 that: “A scientist, however well credentialed he may be, is not permitted
 to be the mouthpiece of a scientist in a different specialty. That would
not be responsible science. A theoretical economist, however able, would
not be allowed to testify to the findings of an econometric study conducted
by another economist if he lacked expertise in econometrics and the study
raised questions that only an econometrician could answer.  If it were
apparent that the study was not cut and dried, the author would have to testify;
he could not hide behind the theoretician.” Economic issues were not central
 to the decision in this case. 
Porter v. Turner,
2008 Del. LEXIS 280 (Delaware 2008). The Delaware Supreme Court
affirmed several trial court decisions, one of which was to allow the
economic damages testimony of Andrew Verzilli for the plaintiff. One
challenge to the testimony of Verzilli was that the medical expert had
never clearly stated that life care would be needed throughout the
plaintiff’s lifetime.  The Court indicated that the record
did indicate that medical expert had expressed that opinion. The second
challenge was based on the fact that Verzilli had been unaware of the
plaintiff’s income from a “side job.” The Court
indicated that the defendant had never produced any reliable figure to
quantify Turner’s additional income at the side job and said:
“To be sure, Verzilli’s failure to include an estimate of
income from his ‘side job’ casts some doubt about the
accuracy of his assumptions underlying his opinion about future lost
income. That failure does not require a wholesale exclusion of his
opinion about future lost income, however Porter’s contention
that Verzilli’s opinion should be barred in toto clearly is a
misplaced attack on the verifiability of Verzilli’s methodology
based on Daubert. Porter challenges only Verzilli’s underlying
assumptions, not the methodology that is based on the assumptions.
Moreover, by vigorous cross examination, Porter’s counsel could
highlight the inaccuracy or unreliability of Verzilli’s estimates
based on his failure to consider the “side job” income.
Porter’s counsel could and did attack the validity of the
assumptions about Turner’s capacity to work that Verzilli relied
upon when formulating his ultimate opinion. We note that the jury must
have understood the significance of the assumptions’ questionable
validity, because the jury discounted a portion of Verzilli’s
projections, and awarded less than Verzilli’s combined estimates
for future care and lost income.” 
Florida
Castillo v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 2003 Fla.

  LEXIS 1159; 28 Fla. L. Weekly S 538 (Fla. 2003).  The Florida Supreme
   Court reemphasized its commitment to the Frye standard rather than Daubert
   in quashing a Court of Appeals decision to reverse on the basis of the
insufficiency                             of plaintiff’s expert testimony
at the trial court      level.       Much     of   the    emphasis    was
on the difference between      rejecting      testimony     based   on the
  conclusions    that were   reached   versus   the   legitimacy   of  the
method    used   to reach conclusions.         The  court  cited the Illinois
    decision in    Donaldson   v.   Central   Illinois       Public Service
Co.,          313 Ill. App.    3d 1051,  740   N.E.  2d   68 (Ill. 2000)
   as drawing     a similar distinction     between the  legitimacy     of
the methodology    compared   with the correctness        of  the opinion
 derived   from the methodology.                      
Flanagan v. State of Florida, 625 So. 2d 827 (Fla. 1993).
                             This decision reaffirmed “the basic principle 
 that     novel      scientific           evidence      is not admissible 
in Florida     unless   it   meets the test     established      in      
      Frye      v.   United States,     54 App. D.C.    46, 293 F.
1013    (D.C.     Cir.  1993).        The Court    said: “[P]ure   
opinion testimony,     such  as   an expert’s   opinion  that     a defendant
is   incompetent,  does not     have to meet                Frye,
   because  this    type of testimony  is based    on the  expert’s   personal 
  experience and  training.  While  cloaked with  the   credibility of  the 
expert,  this testimony  is analyzed   by a jury as  it  analyzes  any other 
 personal  opinion or  factual   testimony   of a witness.    Profile testimony, 
 on  the  other  hand, by its  nature  necessarily  relies    on some scientific 
 principle    or test, which  implies  an infalliability   not  found in pure
 opinion  testimony.       The jury will naturally  assume  that the
scientific  principles underlying       the expert’s conclusion  are valid.
  Accordingly,  this type of testimony     must  meet the             Frye
test,   designed  to ensure that the jury     will not  be misled by experimental
  scientific  methods  which may ultimately     prove to be unsound.”   
    
Florida Power & Light Company v. Tursi, 729 So. 2d 995
                             (Fla. App. 1999). The Florida Court of Appeals
   held     that     a  treating         physician’s      testimony was admissible
    based   on  his   knowledge  and    experience     without   requiring 
   a  Frye test   that  only   applies to novel    scientific  evidence. 
Kallas  v. Carnival Corporation,
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33797 (S.D. Fla. 2009). District Judge Edwin G.
Torres granted defendant’s Daubert motion in limine to exclude
the expert witness testimony of economic expert Dr. Nitin Paranjpe on
the subject of the lost earnings of Hailey Kallas alleged to have been
caused by the death of Jonathan Kallas, the father of Hailey Kallas.
Judge Torres described Dr. Paranjpe’s method of calculation as
follows: “Dr. Paranjpe . . . purported to measure the loss in
parental training and guidance to Hailey. . . He calculated the loss as
the difference between obtaining a high school degree and a college
degree. He based this measurement on the premise that children who lose
a parent suffer from the loss of parental guidance and support
conducive to achieving higher education. In other words, Hailey is at
risk for not going to college because she has lost her father and his
presumably positive influence; accordingly, she is entitled to the
amount of money she may lose out on because of that risk. Dr. Paranjpe
calculated Hailey’s projected compensation to age 67 based on her
attaining a college degree at $7,839,003 and her projected compensation
based on her obtaining a high school degree at $4,115,982 . . He
explained that ‘the loss of her father has put her at risk, as
measured by the difference between the college degree and high school
compensation of the magnitude of $3,723,022 over four years, or an
average of $930,755 per year.” After extended analysis of the
literature, Judge Torres said: “We find that Plaintiffs have
failed to satisfy the reliability prong of Daubert with regard to their
expert’s opinion that the proper measure of the loss of parental
guidance and support to a child whose father is deceased is the
difference between her projected college degree compensation and her
projected high school compensation. Common sense tells us that the loss
of a parent may have an impact on a child in many ways, or, as Dr.
Paranjpe testified, ‘[t]he loss of a parent in the household puts
a child at risk.’ . . But the rest of Dr. Paranjpe’s theory
is not supported by any data or analysis that has been provided to
us.

Idaho
Sanchez v. Galey, 112 Idaho 609 (Idaho 1986).  The Idaho 
                             Supreme Court upheld a trial court decision to
 admit       the    testimony          of   Dr.    Barry Ben-Zion, both about
 lost   earnings      and  about lost    household        services.  
   The  discussion  of   data sources used  by  Dr. Ben-Zion     makes   this
an  interesting    decision.

Branum v. Slezak, 289 Ill. App. 948; 682 N.E.2d 1165; 1997 
                        Ill. App. LEXIS 480 (Ill.App.1997). The Illinois Court

     of   Appeals        held     that   Walter Johnson’s projection of lost
   earnings     for an  iron     worker  with   certainty   to age 65 had
been   correctly    excluded  by the   trial  court’s  judge’s   acceptance 
  of   the defendant’s    motion  in limine.   The court also  commented 
 on the   greater   reasonableness      of the testimony   of Stan Smith 
because it     had a foundation   from   the   expert testimony  of a vocational 
  expert   Fisher   that the plaintiff     would  have been able  to earn 
$9 to $10   per hour in electrical  assembly    work.    The decision is unclear
about   whether   what the court thought   lacked foundation   is Walter
Johnson’s   projection   of Branum’s earnings   as  an iron worker without
  the foundation   of a vocational   expert or Johnson’s     projection of
earnings      to age  65. It is also not clear  what assumptions     Stan 
 Smith made about    worklife    expectancy in this case.  The LEXIS   version 
  of this decision   indicates  that   the discussion of Johnson  and  Smith 
 were  “unpublishable”   under  Illinois Supreme  Court Rule 23.        
Donaldson v. Central Illinois Public Service, 199 Ill. 2d
                             63; 767 N.E.2d 314 (2002). The Illinois Supreme
   Court      said:      “Illinois          law    is unequivocal: the exclusive
   test    for  the admission     of expert      testimony       is governed
   by the   standard  first expressed     in Frye v.   United   States, 
 54     App. D.C.  46, 293  F.1013 (D.C. Cir.    1923). . . The   Frye standard,
     commonly       called  the ‘general acceptance’    test, dictates  
that    scientific    evidence    is  only admissible at trial    if the
methodology      or scientific     principle    upon   which the opinion
  is based is  ‘sufficiently’     established    to  have gained   general
    acceptance  in the particular    field  in which     it belongs.” The
 Court defines      and rejects a  “Frye-plus-reliability”           standard
as requiring   that  “having     determined that a technique     or   methodology
   is  generally accepted,     the court    must still consider       whether
the  opinion      is reliable.”   The Court    said: “[A]    technique  
    is  not generally accepted       in the  scientific community    if it
 is     by nature unreliable.”           
Indiana

Tube City  v. Matthews, 2009 Ind. App. LEXIS 190 (Ind. App. 2009). From
the decision: “At the jury trial, . . . Dr. Gamboa, a vocational
economist, testified that the present value of Matthews’s future
lost earning capacity was between $656,412 and $821,056. In addition,
Dr. Gamboa concluded that Matthews was occupationally disabled and
would lose seven years of his working life.” The Court went on to
quote and affirm the trial court judge as saying: “[Dr. Gamboa is
translating what the doctors have said . . . and putting it into work
life and economic loss based on a reduced work life and, in addition,
based on reduced earning capacity as represented by his physical
condition. Which, as a vocational economist, he’s allowed to
consider and to evaluate, because that’s what vocational
counselors do.” The decision went on to add that: “Dr.
Charles Linke, an economist and Tube City’s expert, used the same
methodology as Dr. Gamboa, including the same percentage for fringe
benefits, the same interest rate growth rate (sic), and the same data
from the Current Population Survey that is gathered by the U.S. 
Bureau of the Census.  Therefore, Tube City cannot now complain
that Dr. Gamboa’s methodology is
unreliable.”    

Kempf Contracting and Design, Inc., v. Holland-Tucker, 892
N.E.2d 672 (Ind App. 2008). Kempf argued that the trial court abused
its discretion in allowing the testimony of John Tierney of Vocational
Economics based on “sound scientific principle” under a
Daubert standard. According to the Court Tierney had based his opinion

that Tucker suffered a permanent disability under the definition used
by the American Community Survey (ACS). “Tierney then used
databases compiled by the government to determine the earning capacity
of people with a physical disability who have attained a
bachelor’s degree, as Tucker had, and to determine the work life
expectancy of people in the same category. He did not look at data
regarding people with a physical disability in Tucker’s specific
profession of engineering, as that information was not available in the
databases he utilized. Tr. at 43. The databases Tierney used in
reaching his opinion were also not specifically geared to
Tucker’s specific disability as defined by the ACS. . . . Tucker
failed to present any evidence to establish the scientific reliability
of Teirney’s methodology in determining Tucker’s reduction
in earning capacity and work life expectancy. As the proponent of the
expert testimony, Tucker had the burden of establishing the reliability
of the scientific tests upon which the expert’s testimony is
based. Tucker presented no evidence, however, that this process had
been tested or subject to peer review, or whether there was a known or
potential error rate. Further, no testimony was given that standards
existed to control how the process was utilized by people in the
vocational economic field. At the motion to exclude hearing, Tierney
testified that database and methodology he used to determine
Tucker’s future earning capacity were well known in the field of
vocational disability and that private parties have written on the
effect that disability has on earnings and employment. Tr. at 37, 40.
However, Tierney did not name any peer-reviewed publication or provide
any citation to authority that supported his bald assertion that his
methodology to determine Tucker’s lost future earnings was
generally accepted in the field of vocational economics. Additionally,
even though Tierney may have testified previously regarding this
methodology, such fact does not establish that his methodology was
scientifically reliable.” The court, however, added the footnote:
“We do not hold that the methodology utilized by Mr. Tierney is
not scientifically reliable. Rather, we hold t hat Tucker failed to
produce sufficient evidence to establish such reliability.” 

Ollis v. Knecht, 751 N.E. 2d 825 (Ind. 
                             App. 2001).  Dr. Terrence Parks used a “mirror
       image      approach”          for    projecting the plaintiff’s loss
 of    earnings.     Dr.   Parks assumed      that    the  plaintiff’s  
death    caused  a loss   of  fourteen   years of earnings      and   therefore 

 used   a fourteen    year  period from   the past to project    future  
 wage increases    and   the future    discount   rate. In a 702(b) hearing, 
    Dr.   Parks   was unable     to name  a peer reviewed    publication that
 supported    the    mirror  image  approach,    though he claimed  that
 Gerald Martin’s book    (unidentified        by title)  supported   the
mirror image approach.   Dr. Parks  did not    provide     a full citation 
to  Martin’s  book.     Since Dr.  Parks  was   unable to   provide 
any citation  to support his    assertion  that this  method  was generally 
  accepted  within  the filed    of economics,  his testimony     was not 
allowed.   (Submitted  by  Ann Neff.)
Shafer & Freeman Lakes Environmental Conservation Corporation v. Stichnoth,
2007 Ind. App. LEXIS 2680 (Ind. App. 2007). This was an appeal of a
jury verdict awarding negligence damages to Justin Stichnoth. Dr.
Edward Berla testified for the plaintiffs about Justin’s impaired
earning capacity, denying defendant’s motion in limine to bar the
testimony of Dr. Berla. The failure of the trial court to bar Dr.
Berla’s testimony was one of the issues in the appeal filed by
the defendant. The defendants had hired Dr.Gary Skoog, who testified
that “he and several peers believed that VEI’s use of the
BLS data sets constituted ‘junk science.’ . . . In short,
Dr. Skoog opined that the data sets were not designed to be used in
forecasting future earning capacity impairment.” The Indiana
Appeals Court held that the trial court’s decision to permit Dr.
Berla’s testimony was not an abuse of discretion. The Court
quoted the trial court from the transcript at length, as follows:
“I think I have questions about the data, but I, and I
haven’t actually seen the report itself. I’m still inclined
to let the witness testify. I’ll tell you why. I don’t
think this is real science. I think it’s something one can be an
expert about. I think most experts who are social science experts gain
their credibility and their ability to be an expert from some
discipline that they’re particularly trained at intellectually
and have experience at by writing or studying or doing research or
running surveys or something.  And I think you can be qualified as
an expert if you can demonstrate on the record that you have an ability
based on your experience and your training, your education, to given an
opinion that recognizes all sides of the issue and because of what you
know and study and thought and believe that you’re on the correct
side of the issue.”
Iowa
Sallis v. Lemansky,
420 N.W.2d 795 (Iowa 1998). This decision responds in part to an appeal
by a defendant that resulted in the reversal of the decision of a trial
court and the granting of a new trial. As part of the decision, the
Iowa Supreme Court considered at some length the question of whether
testimony from the plaintiff’s unnamed economist should have been
admitted. The court pointed out that the economist had not considered
time off for illness or vacation “beyond what was reflected in
1979-80 earnings” and had not worked as an over-the-road truck
driver for approximately two years before the injury to the plaintiff.
The court pointed out that the standard in Iowa is earning capacity so
that if the plaintiff had taken a lower paying job to be close to his
children, he could still have recovered for his earning capacity in
trucking. The court pointed out, however, that: “Defendants had
the opportunity to present evidence concerning the trucking industry,
plaintiff’s driving record, and plaintiff’s work history to
discredit the economist’s opinion. Plaintiff is correct that
these factors go to the weight of the evidence and not its
admissibility.” On this aspect of the appeal, the Iowa Supreme
Court held that the trial court judge had not abused his discretion by
admitting the testimony of the economist.
      
      
      
      
      
      Kansas
Armstrong v. City of Wichita, 21 Kan. App. 2d 750; 907 P.2d
                             932 (Kan. App. 1995).  This decision holds
   that     neither        the    Frye     or   Daubert standards apply to 
 decisions      of an administrative          law  judge    or the   Workers 
 Compensation      Board admission of testimony         from a treating  
 physician,    nor    must “occupational disease” be  precisely       defined.  
      The Armstrong      court quoted       Chinn v. Gay &   Taylor, 
     Inc.,       219    Kan. 196, Syl. P  3, 547 P.2d 751(1976) as follows:
     “The    existence,  nature    and extent of the   disability of an injured
     workman    is a question of fact.    Medical testimony    is not essential
     to the establishment   of these facts    and it is not necessary   
that     a workman’s disability     be given a medical    name or label.”
(Emphasis      added in the             Armstrong      decision). 
                 
Kuhn v. Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation, 270 Kan. 443;
                             14 P.3d 1170 (Kan. 2000).  This was the
most     recent       affirmation            that     Kansas retains the
      Frye     test instead      of recognizing      Daubert.    
 It  also  emphasizes    that the Frye test     does not apply to   “pure
 opinion”     expert  testimony,      citing       Florida     Power and
Light   Co. v.  Tursi,   229    So. 2d  995 (Fla. Dist. App.    1999)
as a reference   to the  “pure opinion”       exception      to the Frye
   test. It also cited       Logerquist        v. McVey,    196 Ariz.
470       (Arizona 2000) in  its extensive    discussion     of the “pure
 opinion”    exception     to the       Frye     test. In this  case,
  the issues     had to do with the admissibility      of medical  testimony,
  which   the   Kuhn  court felt did not employ   “a new or   experimental
 scientific    technique”    in a way that would   trigger the Frye  test
of general  acceptance.                
State v. Warden, 891 P.2d 1074. (Kan. 1995). Retained Frye

      than           Frye.                   
Louisiana

Anderson v. Sharp, 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis 9564 (E.D. La. 1998). 
                             Melville Wolfson was permitted to testify about 
   “sums      for    lost     income,        fringe  benefits, loss of support, 
   loss   of   household    services     and medical        expenses  in this
   case  even  though the claim   was a “lost    chance of survival”    
  claim,     interpreted  under Louisiana   law. The defense   maintained 
that  Mrs.       Anderson  [was] not entitled   to bring  a wrongful   death 
action because       Mr.    Anderson did not have   a greater  than fifty 
 percent chance of    survival   absent    any [alleged]    negligence  of 
the defendants.”    The  District Court   relied  the  Louisiana   Supreme 
  Court in Smith   v.   State, 676 So.2d   543 (1996),   as  providing 
 the framework  for   “lost   chance of survival” cases  in Louisiana    
and  admitted Wolfson’s   testimony.
Bell v. Penney, 2009
U.S. Dist. LEXIS (W.D. La.  2009). This decision denied an appeal
by the defendant based on the Report and Recommendation of the
Magistrate Judge previously filed as Bell v. Penney,
2009 U.S. Dist LEXIS 95182 (W.D. La.  2009). In that report, the
magistrate judge said: “Defendants argue that plaintiff’s
expert economist, Dr. Christensen, should be excluded because his
one-paragraph report is based on plaintiff’s own testimony of her
lost wages rather than ‘actual wage records,’ because his
testimony is not based on the opinions of any vocational rehabilitation
expert, and because there is no medical evidence as to
plaintiff’s limitations.” . . . Plaintiff’s testimony
is a sufficient factual basis for the expert’s opinions to be
admitted. The trier of fact, however, is entitled to accept or reject
the plaintiff’s self -serving testimony and, in turn, any expert
economic testimony based on it. As plaintiffs point out [i]t is
‘the r ole of the adversarial system, not the court, to highlight
weak evidence.’ . . . Nor is there a requirement that vocational
rehabilitation testimony be presented in every case. It is entirely
proper for the expert to base his report on the assumption that the
plaintiff has medical thus work limitations  – otherwise,
his testimony would be immaterial. However, if at trial, there is no
testimony supporting that assumption, then the district judge can
consider excluding Dr. Christensen’s testimony at that
time.” 

Broussard v.  Lafayette Insurance Company,
2008 La. App. LEXIS 757 (La. App. 2008). This was an appeal based on
trial court admission of testimony by vocational expert Glen Hebert and
economist Dr. Douglas Womack. The appeals court affirmed the trial
court ruling that these witnesses could testify, quoting its own
decision in Rowe v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company,
670 So2d 718 (La. App. 1996) as follows: “As a general rule, the
factual basis of an expert’s opinion goes to the credibility of
the testimony, not to its admissibility, and it is up to the opposing
party to examine the factual basis of the opinion in cross examination.
      Loudermill v. Dow Chemical Co.,
863 F.2d 566 (8th Cir. 1988). However, if an expert opinion is so
fundamentally unsupported that it can offer no assistance to the jury,
then the testimony should not be admitted at all.”
Brown v.  City of Madisonville,
2007 2104 (La.App. 1 Cir. 11/24/08); 5 So. 3d 874 (La. App. 2008). This
decision rejected an appeal based on a defense appeal that the trial
court had erred in denying its motion in limine to exclude the
testimony of Dr. Charles Bettinger, an economist, based on a Daubert
objection. The Court implicitly held that economic testimony is
“nonscientific, expert testimony,” and quoted Kumho Tire Company, Ltd. v. Carmichael,
526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct.1167 in holding that “the law grants a
district judge the same broad latitude when it decides how to determine
reliability as it enjoys in respect to its ultimate reliability
determination.” The Court went on to say: “Accordingly the
factual basis for an expert opinion determines the credibility of the
testimony. It is the responsibility of opposing counsel to explore the
factual basis [Pg 7] for the opinion and thus, determine its
reliability. An unsupported opinion can offer no assistance to the fact
finder, and should not be admitted as expert testimony. . . The trial
court’s opinion must be tied to the facts of the particular case.
The abuse of discretion standard applies to the ultimate conclusion as
to whether to exclude expert witness testimony and to the trial
court’s decision as to how to determine reliability. .
.Furthermore, when opinions of expert witnesses differ, it is for the
trial of fact to determine the most credible evidence and these
determinations will not be overturned unless it is proven that the
expert’s stated reasons are patently unsound.” At issue was
Dr Bettinger’s decision to base the lost earnings of the
Plaintiff on his past wages as a truck driver working for an employer
and to ignore the truck driver’s earnings while working as an
independent contractor. The Plaintiff had not done well as an
independent contractor and had returned to working for an employer. The
Court quoted portions of Dr. Bettinger’s testimony which clearly
explained why he had ignored Plaintiff’s earnings as an
independent contractor and said: “The reasons expressed by Dr.
Bettinger are logical, reasonable and supported by the evidence. Thus,
we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing
Dr. Bettinger to testify regarding his calculations of Mr.
Brown’s lost wages, past and future.”  Suggested by
Robert Taylor. 

D’Ambrosia v. Lang,
2008 La. App. LEXIS 631 (La. App. 2008). Thomas Meunier, a vocational
expert, was permitted to testify based on “work-life expectancy
tables for people with severe disabilities, and non-severe disabilities
compared to people of the same age and level of education,” but
did not permit Meunier to reduce future values to present value.
Meunier was also not permitted to testify about national average wages
of orthopedic surgeons. Meunier’s credentials were described as
follows: “[H]e has been a licensed rehabilitation counselor for
almost 30 years. He completed graduate course work in psychology but
did not complete his Master’s Degree in psychology. . . . Mr.
Meunier admitted that he is not an economist and does not have a degree
in business, accounting, finance or economics. Instead he works in
conjunction with economists. In this regard, he identifies the types of
work that people could do after an injury and then provides the
economist with their earning capacity. The economist then takes that
figure and discounts it to work up an analysis.”
      
      
      
      
      
      Maine
Donatelli v. Unumprovident Corporation, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
              25867 (D. Maine 2004). This decision is a judicial memorandum
   granting         in   part and rejecting in part the testimony about lost
   earnings by   plaintiff’s        expert Mary H. Fox, Ph.D. in a wrongful
   termination matter.   Dr. Fox  is   not   an expert in accounting or economics,
   but has a doctorate   in applied     adult   development-assessment and 
 has  worked in the field   of industrial    psychology   for approximately 
 25  years. The court allowed   Dr. Fox’s testimony    about future  employability
   as a result of plaintiff’s    termination, but  excluded    her damages 
   calculation. The judge provides    extended discussion  of the  reasoning
    behind  his decision that Dr. Fox’s    damages calculation  did not 
meet    the requirements  of Rule 702.  
Maryland
Reed v. State of Maryland, 283 Md. 374, 391 A.2d 364
(Md. 1978). In Maryland, a hearing on a motion in limine to preclude
false or inaccurate testimony is called a “Frye-Reed”
hearing. “Frye” refers to Frye v. United States, 54
D.C. Cir. 46, 293 F. 1013 (1923). This is the “Reed” part
of the Maryland standard and spells out how the Frye ruling applies in
Maryland. Frye has been referred to as the “general
acceptance” standard that for a scientific premise to be accepted
in court, it must be “generally accepted” in the scientific
field from which the testimony is derived. In Frye, the relevant field was persons with expert knowledge about the accuracy of lie detector examinations. In Reed, the
relevant field was determined to be persons with expert knowledge about
voice detection form telephone calls relative to voice samples taken
from an accused plaintiff. The decision contains extensive discussion
of science and applications of the Frye test in other states. It is
well worth reading by economic experts, particularly those
contemplating testimony in Maryland courts.  The dissent in this
decision is also extended and thoughtful. The Court said: “The
introduction of evidence based on a scientific process, not generally
accepted in the scientific community, is likely to distract the fact
finder from its central concern, namely the rendition of a judgment on
the merits of the litigation. Without the Frye test or
something similar, the reliability of an experimental scientific
technique is likely to become a central issue in each trial in which it
is introduced, as long as there remains serious disagreement in the
scientific community over its reliability. Again and again,
cross-examination of expert witnesses will be as protracted and
time-consuming as it was at the trial in the instant case, and
proceedings may well degenerate into trials of the technique itself.
The Frye test is designed to forestall this difficulty as well. The Court also said: “Our adoption of the Frye standard
does not, of course, disturb the traditional discretion of the trial
judge with respect to the admissibility of expert testimony. Frye sets
forth only a legal standard which governs the trial judge’s
determination of a threshold issue. . Testimony based on a technique
which is found to have gained ‘general acceptance in the
scientific community’ may be admitted into evidence, but only if
a trial court judge also determines in the exercise of his discretion,
as he must in all other instances of expert testimony, that the
proposed testimony will be helpful to the jury, that the expert is
properly qualified, etc. Obviously, however, if a technique does not
meet the Frye standard, a trial judge will have no occasion to reach
these further issues.  
Michigan
Craig v. Oakwood Hospital, 2004 Mich. LEXIS 1561 (Mich. 2004). 
                        The Michigan Supreme Court held that Davis-Frye standard 
       continues          to   be   the standard for admissibility of expert 
   testimony    in Michigan.          It reversed     a decision of the trial 
   court judge    not to hold a  Davis-Frye         hearing to   determine 
    whether the testimony    of medical  doctor’s  testimony       was admissible 
     under  Michigan’s   Rule 702 (MRE  702), saying  that expert       testimony 
   “must  (be) based    on a “recognized”  form of “scientific, technical, 

       or other specialized      knowledge.”  The decision provides definitions 
    for    the terms “recognized,”      “scientific,”   and “knowledge.” The
         Frye      part of Davis-Frye    refers   to Frye  v. United
   States, 54 App. D.C.     46 (D.C. Cir.    1923). The Davis   part
  of         Davis-Frye  refers to       People       v. Davis,
 343   Mich.   348;   72 N. W.2d 269 (Mich. 1955).         Submitted    by
 William   King.

Doren v. Battle Creek Health System, 187 F.3d 595 (6th Cir. 
                        1999). This is a decision under the Americans with 
 Disabilities              Act.     The    plaintiff alleged she was disabled 
 because of a   series       of   medical    conditions.    The court’s ruling 
 was that she   was not    disabled      under the    meaning of the    ADA.  
 The decision    discusses    an affidavit      issued  by  Dr. Robert Ancell 
    stating  that  the plaintiff     “was not able     to perform   the duties 
 (of a nurse)      on the adult  floor.”   The court  pointed   out that 
 Dr. Ancell’s  affidavit   did   not  offer “specific   facts  showing  
that there   is  a genuine issue  for trail.”      Suggested   by  Penelope
   Caragonne.

Hashem v. Les Stanford Oldsmobile, Inc, 266 Mich. 
 App.    61;   697 N.W.2d 558 (Mich. App. 2005).  Les Stanford Oldsmobile 
 argued    that   it was entitled to a new trial, or remittatur, as the result 
 of  the   trial   court’s decision to permit the testimony of economist Michael
  Thompson   about   the effect of inflation on an award of future noneconomic
  damages.   The court   of appeals held that the trial court was not in
error   to have   allowed such   testimony.       
People v. Lee, 537 N.W.2d 233 (Mich. Ct.App. 1995).  
                        Retained           Frye standard, rejecting 
       Daubert                as   more     liberal than          
      Frye. 
Minnesota
Berg v. Degreeff, 1993 Minn. App. LEXIS 409.  The Minnesota
                         Court of Appeals allowed Dr. Karl Egge to project 
 lost     earnings         both     on   the  basis that a decedent would 
have become     president    of   his  father’s     company     and that he
would not  have    been able  to  do  so.       
Goeb v. Tharaldson, 615 N.W.2d 800 (Minn. 2000). Retained
 Frye-Mack standard, rejecting Daubert  as more liberal than Frye. Frye
 refers to Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923). Mack
 refers to State v. Mack, 292 N.W.2d 764 (Minn. 1980).  The court
 said: “[B]ecause Daubert stresses a more liberal and flexible approach
 to the admission of scientific testimony, it has been viewed as relaxing
the barriers to the admissibility of scientific evidence. . . Daubert takes
from scientists and confers upon judges uneducated in science the authority
to determine what is scientific. . . By comparison, the Frye general acceptance
 standard ensures that the persons most qualified to assess scientific validity
 have the determinative voice.” 
 Prectel
v. Gonse,    396   N.W.2d    837   (Minnesota      1986).    The   Minnesota
   Supreme    Court   affirmed   the trial   court’s decision     to allow
   the   testimony     of  Dr. Karl  Egge, the plaintiff’s   economist. 
  “Dr. Egge,  an economist,        offered    his opinion that a married
  woman between    the ages  of   40  and 54  who  is employed   outside
the  home   and has a child    approximately       16 years     of age provides
 approximately    $8,000 worth of   services      to the  family    per 
year.  He based his opinion   on a study by Gaugher        and Walker entitled
     “The  Dollar Value of Household   Work.”         

ZumBerge v. Northern States Power Co., 481 N.W.3d 103 (Minn.
                         App. 1992). The Minnesota Court of Appeals upheld 
 the    admission          of   testimony       by Dr. Michael Behr. “The 
trial  court  found that     Dr.    Behr   was a qualified       economist, 
and  while his  methodology     was apparently       unique, no evidence 
   indicates    that  it was invalid.     Dr. Behr explained       in great 
detail on direct      and cross  examination     how he reached his    conclusions 
   and why   he  made the    assumptions   he  did.”

Missouri
Bennet v. Mallincrodt, 698 S.W.2d 854 (Mo. App. 1985). Mallincrodt
          was being sued for having increased the risk of cancer for the
class      of   plaintiffs.  One of the questions being resolved on appeal
was whether      plaintiffs   may recover on the theory that their increased
risk of cancer      is a present   injury. The court said: “In Missouri,
no different than    most   jurisdictions,   future damages in a personal
injury action are not   compensable   unless reasonably    certain to occur.
. . Damages based on   mere mathematical   probabilities significantly  

 undercompensate those    who actually develop   cancer and are a windfall
to  those  who do not.  No  acceptable definition   of justice would contemplate
such a result. Consequently,   this claim of injury  is fatally defective.”   
        
Callahan v. Cardinal Glennon Hospital, 863 S.W.2d (Missouri
                             1993).  This decision indicates the status
   of   Missouri         on   the    issues       of the Frye test versus
Daubert      standards  for    admitting      expert    testimony.      
The Supreme    Court  indicates  that    there was  no   objection   to the
testimony       of the  plaintiff’s  experts,    so the  Court   did not
decide    “whether   section      490.065,  RSMo Supp.    1992, supercedes
  the Frye doctrine      in the  same manner     that Daubert    held that
Federal   Rule 702  changes  the   requirements  for the    admissibility
    of expert testimony    in  federal  court.”   There  has been no subsequent
    decision on this  matter.               
First Nat’l. Bank of Fort Smith v. Kansas City Southern Ry., 
                             865 S.W.2d 719 (Mo. App. 1993). The testimony 
 of    Wilbur       Swearingen,            a  life    care planning expert, 
 was   held inadmissible       even though     the    court     ruled  that 
 Swearingen    was qualified   to   testify. The issue    was   he foundation 
     for  Swearingen’s   assumption      that the needs motivating      the 
 life care plan     would    exist in  the    future. The Court said: “It 
  is   not enough for the  doctor     to  testify    to the possibility of 
 a certain    result;    his  testimony  should   show     that it is reasonably 
 certain to   follow the    injury.  Consequences  which     are   contingent, 
 speculative,  or  merely  possible    are not proper  to   be considered 
    by the jury in ascertaining    the  damages,   for it  would   be plainly 
 unjust   to  compel one to pay  damages    for results   that may   or may 
 not ensue and which    are merely  problematical.”                      
       
Greer v. Continental Gaming Company, 5 S.W.3d 559 (Mo.App.
                             1999). The Western District Court of Appeals
held     that     John     O.   Ward’s       testimony    about lost earnings
and    lost household      services       should not    have  been admitted
    because:    “Ward’s testimony     was based      on the assumption  
 that    Greer, age   60  at the time of   trial,   would  not    be able
to work   for   the next    five or ten years  and would   be unable  to
  perform   household servies     for the  rest of her life. An   expert
may  base    an opinion on hypothesized    facts, but  when such   opinion
  (other  than  one  stated on cross examination)    is based  on hypothesized
     information,    the  facts must either be  in the  record or  admissible 
   as evidence,     citing          Lytle v. T-Mac, Inc.,  931 S.W.2d 
  496 (Mo.App.  496 1996).         
Hobbs v. Harken, 969 S.W.2d 318 (Mo.App.1998). The Western
                             District Court of Appeals held that  John
   O.   Ward’s       testimony          about      lost earnings should not
   have  been admitted       by the trial    court      because   the   necessary
   factual or evidentiary       support did  not  exist   “for   Dr.  
    Ward’s   assumption that   Mr.    Hobbs’ vestibular    or other   injuries
     would affect   his  earning    capacity   got twenty years    into the
     future in  the same way they   had  in the   past.” The court did  
not    criticize   Dr. Ward,  but pointed   to the  lack    of foundation
or the      assumption he had  been asked  to  make by the plaintiff    
 attorney.    The  Court quoted       Thienes   v. Harlin   Fruit Co,
499  S.W.2d      223 (Mo. App. 1973) as saying: “Reasonable   certainty 
 contemplates    and demands    something more than a showing of     contingent
or  speculative     occurrences,   possible   or even probable  developments,
  or conjecture,     likelihood and  probability.”                 
Kauzlarich v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Co.,
                             1995 Mo. App. LEXIS 55 (Mo. App. 1995). The
court      affirmed         the    trial      court’s     admission of Dr.
Donald    Vogenthaler,     citing       Donjon    v. Black    &  Decker,
    Inc,   825 S.W.2d 31   (Mo. App.   1992)    as follows:    “The trial
  court  is  given    wide  latitude to  determine    the need for  expert
  testimony.      As long as the   witness  has some qualifications,    the
 testimony    may be permitted;       the extent    of the expert’s experience
     or   training   goes to the  weight  of   his testimony   but does not
render         the testimony   incompetent.”  The Kauzlarich   Court then
  said:  “Clearly,       under this standard,   Dr. Vogenthaler was a qualified
 expert    as  to   Kauzlararich’s    employability       following the accident 
as  well   as his   future loss of earnings.   Dr.    Vogenthaler   had more 
education  and training     in the employability    of injured workers   and
economics  as far as calculating     future earnings       than the average 
person    does.” 
Long v. Missouri Delta Medical Center, 33 S.W.3d 629 (MO.
                             App. 2000). Rufused to reverse based on testimony
     of   Harold       Goldstein,           in   spite of quoting Goldstein
   as   follows:   "My  spread     is 3.29 percent        growth     rate, 
 and  1.64   percent  discount.  [The]    spread is 1.65, the    difference 
      between       the  two, and there  are   I know of at least a dozen 
  different    economists       that  would come up  with a spread of 1.65." 

McGuire v. Seltsam, 138 S.W.3d 318 (MO 2004).  Citing
                    State Bd. for the Healing Arts v. McDonagh, 123 
 S.W.3d       146    (Mo.  banc 2003), this decision holds that neither Frye 
 v.  United     States,      54 App. D.C. 46 (D.C. Cir. 1923) or Daubert
   v. Merrell     Dow Pharmaceuticals,      Inc, 509 U.S. 579 (1993)
governs    the admission     of expert testimony   in   Missouri. Section
490.065 is   controlling.       

Mitchem v. Gabbert, 31 S.W.3d 538 (Mo. App. 2000).  The
 fact that the life care plan of Dr. Terry Winkler was not presented in present
 value terms by an economist was held not to be in error by the trial court.
 The court also held that Dr. Winkler was qualified to testify.

Kenton v. Hyatt Hotels Corporation, 693 S.W.2d 83 (Mo. 1985). 
                             The decision upholds the admission by the trial 
   court      of   testimony          by   a  disabled law school professor 
 about  the    physical     difficulties      facing     a  disabled  law 
student.    The  Missouri  supreme     court also discusses     the   important 
   role     of  vocational  experts   in  assisting a jury to make    decisions 
   in    disability       cases.           
Parr v. Carr, 16 S.W.3d 332 (Mo 2000).  This Missouri
                             Supreme Court Decision was based on litigation
   to   the    proceeds         from     a  wrongful    death claim between
   the widow   and   parents of   a  decedent.           The parents
    claimed that   the  report prepared     by Dr. L. Kenneth  Hubbell  
      for lost business      income and lost  household    services on  behalf
   of   the    wife was   not reasonable.    The father introduced   a letter
    from Dr.   John   O.   Ward criticizing Dr. Hubbell’s    calculations
   and opined   that  Dr. Hubbell’s       methodology was “not within the 
  generally     accepted   practices   of  business    valuation or economic 
 loss calculation      in the   advent  of  wrongful  death.”     The 
 trial court had accepted      Dr. Hubbell’s     testimony as a basis for 
  dividing    the proceeds.   That  decision  had    been   appealed to the 
 Western   District Missouri      Court of  Appeals,          Parr   v. 
 Carr,   1999  Mo. App. Lexis   1843 (Mo.App.     2000),     which had 
 affirmed   the trial  court decision.   The Missouri Supreme    Court  also 
 affirmed, with   modification    that   did not have to do with    either 
   Dr. Hubbell’s report  or Dr. Ward’s    letter.       
Sampson v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, 560 S.W.2d
  573 (Missouri 1978). The Missouri Supreme Court upheld the testimony of
Dr.    Frank E. Wagner, then chair of the economics department at the University
                             of Missouri at Kansas City that was based on
worklife         expectancy           tables       that did not consider
plaintiff’s   alleged      heart condition        or   alcoholism     and
 on claiming   that Dr. Wagner’s     calculations  were     based   on “pure
conjecture         and speculation”     that the trend  of wages     from
1968  to 74   was an annual    growth    rate of 7.3 percent.   After  describing
    Dr.   Wagner’s methodology    in some detail,   the Missouri   Supreme
Court     ruled  that the trial  court had  not erred in admitting    Dr.
Wagner’s   testimony.             
State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts v. McDonagh, 
 123 S.W.3d 146 (MO 2003). The Missouri Supreme Court makes it clear in this 
 decision that the standard for admission of expert testimony in Missouri 
is Missouri’s Section 490.065, which is similar to, but not identical to Federal
Rule 702. It is not Frye, as had been previously interpreted, and not Daubert,
but Section 490.065. The Court argued while Missouri’s Section 490.065 is
nearly identical to Federal Rule 702, it contains small wording differences
that make it a more stringent standard than Federal Rule 702. Section 490.065.3
goes beyond Rule 702 “to require that the facts or data on which an expert
bases an opinion or inference ‘must be of a type reasonably relied upon by
expert in the field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject’ and
that these facts and data ‘must be otherwise reasonably reliable.’” Thus,
a court must independently assess the reliability of facts or data. Of critical
importance, this also requires that a court identify the relevant scientific
community in which the data and facts are accepted. The McDonagh court pointed
out that Daubert does not require identification of the relevant scientific
community. At issue in the case was the relevant community within which Dr.
McDonagh practiced, holding that it was the community of doctors treating
vascular disease, not all doctors and not doctors using chelation therapy
as the State Board of Registration and Dr. McDonagh had respectively argued. 
Theines v. Harlin Fruit Co., 499 S.W. 2d 223 (Mo.    App. 
   1973).   The plaintiff had based his projection of damages on a  military 
    career with   various promotions and a specific post military  employments. 
    After the trial,   the Missouri court of Appeals reversed  on damages 
only    and remanded to the   trial court on to reconsider damages,  saying: 
“Reasonable    certainty contemplates   and demands something more  than showing
of contingent    or speculative occurrences,   possible or even  probable
developments, or   conjecture, likelihood and probability.”
Weitlauf v. Parkway School District,
2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144469 (E.D.Mo 2008). Geraldine K. Weitlauf filed
an employment discrimination case pro se, and tried to introduce her
son Wade Weitlauf as her economic expert. The Court said: “Mr
Weitlauf lacks the education and/or economics background to be
qualified as an expert economist regarding the plaintiff’s
alleged economic damages. He is employed as a bank official with a
bachelor’s degree in Finance. He has never before 1) prepared an
economic loss valuation for any individual; 2) never taught a class on
evaluating the types of economic losses alleged in this lawsuit; and 3)
has never been hired as an economic loss expert. He has no formal
training in the field of economic losses as alleged in this lawsuit, no
experience or practical knowledge that would provide him with some
level of expertise in such a field; thus, he fails to meet the criteria
of Rule 702 and/or Daubert. It appears to this court that his
“expertise” was developed solely for purposes of his
mother’s lawsuit. Furthermore, Mr. Weitlauf’s analysis was
done solely on the basis of information supplied to him by the
plaintiff. He failed to consult or obtain any objective information
regarding his mother’s employment status such as her salary and
value of her fringe benefits. His “valuations” were
primarily calculated using the Missouri Public School Retirement
System’s website without any real understanding as to the
mechanics of the website’s protocol for calculating retirement
benefits. Finally, as her son, Mr. Weitlauf is listed as a primary
beneficiary on plaintiff’s retirement account, and a named
beneficiary in her will. Thus, his expert testimony is not objective
since he has a financial stake in her recovery of economic damages in
this lawsuit.”

Williams v. Daus, M.D., 2003 Mo. App. LEXIS 1213 (Mo. App.
                             2003). The appellant challenged the trial court’s
     admission          of   testimony          by economist Dr. John O.
Ward     on the grounds     that     it did  not meet  the    criterion 
   of “a   reasonable degree   of  economic     certainty.”   The Court 
cited  a previous       case, saying:     “[T] he precise     words used
  by an expert  witness    do not necessarily         ‘render his  testimony
  inadmissible     if he    intended to express  his   opinion    or judgement.’”
   The court also   referred    to the term  “reasonable   degree of   certainty”
   as “talismanic,”    and not  required. 
Wright v. American Home Products Corporation,
2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32125 (W.D. Mo. 2008). This memorandum denied a
defendant’s request to exclude the expert testimony of life care
planner Dr. Lori Hilton about life care expenses of the plaintiff and
economist Dr. Everett Dillman concerning the financial worth of the
Wyeth, Inc., for purposes of determining punitive damages. The Court
indicated that Missouri law allows testimony to establish the worth of
a company for purposes of punitive damages and reviews the relevance of
federal case law setting limits on the amount of punitive damages.
 Nebraska

Epp v. Lauby, 271 Neb. 640 (Nebraska, 2006). “We
have noted with approval nonexclusive criteria which the trial court
may consider in evaluating the reliability of a particular theory.
These include (1) whether the theory or technique can be, and has been,
tested; (2) whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer
review and publication; (3) whether there is a known or potential rate
of error; (4) whether there are standards controlling the
technique’s operation; and (5) whether the theory or technique
enjoys general acceptance within the relevant scientific community. See
      Carlson v. Okerstrom, 267 Neb. 397, 675 N.W.2d 80 (2004); Schafersman v. Agland Coop, 262
Neb. 215, 631 N.W.2d 862 (2001). These are, however, neither exclusive
nor binding; different factors may prove significant in different

cases, and additional factors may prove relevant under particular
circumstances.” Suggested by Michael O’Hara. 
McNeel v. Union Pacific Railroad, 276 Neb. 143 (Neb.
2008). Union Pacific had challenged the scientific validity a diagnosis
of toxic encephalopathy as the source of the plaintiff’s medical
condition. The Court did not reach the issue of the scientific merit of
that diagnosis, saying: “[W]e  need not reach (that issue)
because we conclude that the district court correctly concluded that
even if considered scientifically reliable, the opinions of
McNeel’s experts did not ‘fit’ the issues of this
case because they did not identify any specific causative agent for the
diagnosis of toxic encephalopathy.”  The Court went on to
say: “Under the Daubert/Schafersman analysis, expert testimony
lacks ‘fit’ when ‘a large analytic leap must be made
between the facts and the opinion.’” That is the case here.
Assuming without deciding that the diagnosis of toxic encephalopathy
was the product of scientifically reliable methodology, it is simply
too great an analytical leap to conclude that it was caused by some act
or omission on the part of Union Pacific, given that the experts could
not identify any toxic agent.” Suggested by Michael
O’Hara.  

Perry Lumber Co. v. Durable Services, Inc., 266 Neb. 517
  (2003).  The Nebraska Supreme Court determined that the trial court
   judge’s decision not to allow the defense expert to testify “concerning
 the   results of his test which Perry had previously placed in evidence
through    the testimony of its own expert” was an abuse of discretion under
the standards    of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S.
579, 113 S.Ct.    2786 (1993).  The court also said: “Because we conclude
that Perry  waived   any objection to admissibility of the test results by
adducing the  evidence  through its expert in chief, we do not reach the
issue of whether  the evidence  could have been excluded if a timely objection
had been made.”  Submitted  by Michael O’Hara. 

Perry Lumber Co. v. Durable Servs., 271 Neb. 303 (Neb.
   2006).   This was an appeal by the defendant to the Nebraska Supreme Court
   on the  basis that the decision of the trial court to treat James Wagner,
   an expert  on the causes of fires, as a lay witness rather than an expert
   witness was  reversible error. The Nebraska Supreme Court reviewed its
standards   under        Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
509 U.S.   569, and concluded that it was reversible error not to have admitted
Wagner   as an expert witness rather than a lay witness. The plaintiff also
filed   a counter  claim to preclude the testimony of the defendant’s expert
on causes  of fires  on the ground that the defendant’s expert’s testimony
was limited  to criticism  of the methods used by the plaintiff’s expert
and did not include  his own  opinion about the cause of the fire. This issue 
 was rendered moot  by the decision to remand for a new trial, but the Nebraska 
 Supreme Court  spoke to this issue in anticipation that it would become relevant
 in a new  trial. The Court stated succinctly: “Testimony criticizing the
procedures  and opinions of another expert is an acceptable form of expert 
testimony.”  Submitted by Michael O’Hara.       
Phillips v. Industrial Machine, 257 Neb. 256; 597 N.W.2d
  377 (Neb. 1999).  The Nebraska Supreme Court held that the trial court
    judge was correct in ordering a new trial based on the vocational rehabilitation 
                             expert testimony of Alfred J. Marachisio, Jr.  
       Marchisio          had    relied       on the New Worklife Expectancy 
   tables    produced   by   Vocational        Econometrics       to project 
   a shortened    worklife   expectancy   for the    plaintiff.     
The      trial  court    had “concluded   that given   the broad   definition 
 of   a  disabled      person  as used in  the New Worklife   Expectancy 
 Tables   and Marchisio’s      vague    conclusion     that Phillips   would 
 work ‘less’    as a result   of her  disability,      the testimony  ‘was 
   so generic and  lacking   in  certainty that it failed     to   make the 
 existence    of  a disputed fact    more or less probable,  and was   of 
 no value to the    jury.”   The  Nebraska   Supreme Court  went on to
say:   “The court  noted  that the definition   of  ‘disabled’ as  used in
the New Worklife      Expectancy  Tables made no differentiation     between 
 people with minor   disabilities       and those   withe serious disabilities 
      or between   people with disabilities       that affect their work and
 those       with    disabilities  which have  no  effect    on their work.
 The court   explained       that  under these  circumstances,      Marchisio
     ‘could present  virtually     the same opinion  testimony    he   presented
 in this     case  in any  courtroom,    with any injured plaintiff,    
  without modifying the      opinion at all.’  .  . . We agree.”   
     
Schaferman v. Agland Coop [Schaferman I], 631 N.W.2d 860 (Neb.
 2001). The     Supreme Court of Nebraska, which had initially rejected 
      Daubert  and   retained the Frye test, adopted Daubert 
                        in this decision.         

Schafersman v. Agland Coop [Schaferman II], 268 Neb. 138 (Neb.
 2004). This decision will be called Schafersman II. In Schafersman 
                        I, 262 Neb. 215 (Neb. 2001), the Nebraska Supreme 
    Court      reversed         a  jury   award for the Schafersmans, holding 
    that their      causation  expert,       Dr.Wallace     Wass, failed to
 meet   the Frye  general    acceptance  test.   The    Nebraska Supreme 
   Court,   however,  also ruled    that Nebraska  would   no longer   employ 
 the Frye      test and adopted the   standards of             Daubert 
  v. Merrell     Dow Pharmaceuticals,     Inc., 509  U.S.  579 (1993). 
 In this   decision,     the Nebraska Supreme    Court    upheld  a lower 
 court opinion that    the  testimony   did not meet   Daubert tests    either.

Zimmerman v. Powell, 268 Neb. 422 (Neb. 2004).  The
  Nebraska Supreme Court held that the trial court had inadequately performed
   its gatekeeping function under Daubert/Schaferman I standards and allowed
   a witness whose testimony was unreliable to testify. Daubert refers to
      Daubert   v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 509 U.S. 579, 113
S. Ct. 2786 (1993),   and its progeny. “Schaferman I” refers to Schafersman
 v. Agland Coop,   262 Neb. 14, 631 N.W. 2d 862 (2001).  The decision
 provides a history   of decisions in Nebraska interpreting Nebraska’s Rule
 702. Submitted by Michael  O’Hara.                       

Nevada

Dow Chemical Co. v. Mahlum, 970 P.2d 98 (Nev. 1999). The
  Nevada Supreme Court retained the Frye standard in preference to
      Daubert,                             saying "we do not presently
 perceive a need to adopt             Daubert."
Hallmark v. Eldredge,
189 P.3d 646 (Nev. 2008). The Nevada Supreme Court reversed a district
court decision on the basis of abuse of discretion in admitting a
physician with an engineering background to testify as a biomechanical
expert and stated standards for admission of expert testimony in Nevada
under Nevada’s NRS 50.275, which the Court said closely tracked
Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The Court said: “In
determining whether an expert’s opinion is based upon reliable
methodology, a district court should consider whether the opinion is
(1) within a recognized field of expertise; (2) testable and has been
tested; (3) published and subjected to peer review; (4) generally
accepted in the scientific community (not always determinative); and
(5) based more on particularized facts rather than assumption,
conjecture, or generalization. If the expert formed his or her opinion
based upon the results of a technique, experiment or calculation, then
a district court should also consider whether (1) the technique,
experiment, or calculation was controlled by known standards; (2) the
testing conditions were similar to the conditions at the time of the
incident; (3) the technique, experiment or calculation had a known
error rate; and (4) it was developed by the proffered expert for
purposes of the present dispute. We again note that these factors are
not exhaustive, may be accorded varying weights, and may not apply
equally in every case.” The Nevada Supreme Court also noted:
“To date . . . this court has not adopted the United States
Supreme Court of FRE 702 in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. But,
as we have stated, Daubert and the federal court decisions discussing
it may provide persuasive authority in determining whether expert
testimony should be admitted in Nevada Courts.”  Suggested

New Jersey

Cohen v. Cuomo, 2009 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 2290
(N.J. Super. 2009). Among issues on appeal was plaintiff’s
contention that treatment of his expert economist, Dr. Ronald L.
Rosenberg, undermined the credibility of his case and that the trial
court erred in prohibiting Dr. Rosenberg from testifying as to
plaintiff’s lost pension benefits. Rosenberg claimed that the
plaintiff would have had a fully vested pension based on a conversation
with Areles Alvarez of Teamster Local 641 Welfare fund. Defendant
requested a Rule 104 hearing to determine whether Alvarez was a
reliable source of information regarding plaintiff’s pension
interest as used by Rosenberg. Rosenberg did not have his complete file
with him, but affirmed that Alvarez was the “key information
source” he had relied upon. He was permitted to get the rest of
his file during lunch. After lunch he acknowledged that he could not
state with certainty who directed him to contact Alvarez regarding
details of plaintiff’s Teamster’s pension interest. The
Superior Court said: “Dr. Rosenberg could not provide
foundational support for the use of hearsay evidence attributed to
Alvarez, precluding the substantiation, and thus, the admissibility of
his testimony on that issue. The trial court did not abuse its
discretion in excluding Dr. Rosenberg’s testimony bottomed on
hearsay information received from a source not shown to be the type
reasonably relied upon by experts in the field.” 
Dombroski v. City of Atlantic City, 308 N.J. Super.
459; 706 A.2d 242 (N.J. Super. 1998). This case involved an appeal of
the decision of the trial court not to allow testimony from economic
expert Robert Wolf regarding the plaintiff’s loss of earning
capacity. The Superior Court upheld the decision of the trial court on
the ground that Wolf had not provided any evidence or basis for
assuming that the plaintiff might lose his current employment. The
trial court had determined that the plaintiff had a permanent injury
that might result in a loss of earning capacity if the plaintiff had to
find a new job. However the trial court also noted that the plaintiff
went back to work at his old job after recovering from his injury, that
the plaintiff was a valued employee who was getting raises and
“good personnel notes in his file.” Thus, the reason for
granting defense motions to bar Wolf’s testimony was that he had
not developed any statistical basis for assessing the probability that
the plaintiff would lose his job in the future. Both the trial court
and the Superior Court, however, made it clear that a worker can have a
loss of earning capacity even if the worker is making a higher income
now than before the worker’s injury. Doing so, however, must be
based on some “evidentiary and logical basis or at least,
rationally estimating a compensatory award.” Suggested by Frank
Tinari. 

Kemp v. State of New Jersey, 2002 N.J. Lexis 1260 (N.J. 2002). 
                             The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that an medical 
      doctor       expert       witness        should not have been excluded 
   from   testifying       without  a  Rule   104 hearing.         In 
 the   process,   it widened     its  acceptance    of Daubert   v. Merrell 
 Dow,     509    U.S.  579 (1993)    from toxic torts to   medical testimony, 
   rejecting    the  “general     acceptance”      standard it had  maintained 
 earlier.    The Frye decision    is not   specifically      mentioned   and
 the court    ruled directly   from   New Jersey  Rule  702.       The
 court   effectively     said that a party     was entitled to present  its
    expert at a  separate     hearing to determine   the   expert’s admissibility
     before being  excluded.             
State v. Doriguzzi, 760 A.2d 336. Althought New Jersey is
                             an avowed Frye state, this decision uses
   a        Daubert               style      for   toxic tort litigation.
            
State v. Harvey, 699 A.2d 596. Although New Jersey is an
                             avowed Frye state, this decision uses
a         Daubert               style      for    toxic  tort litigation.
         
New York 
Hernandez v. 1010 Company, 2009 NY Slip Op 52618U (N.Y.
Misc. 2009). In rejecting an appeal by defendants, the Court said:
“The Court notes that defendants failed to call their own
economist to possibly challenge plaintiff’s economist’s
calculations. His testimony, along with the record of plaintiff’s
record of earnings, and plaintiff’s medical testimony were
sufficient to justify the jury’s determination of earnings and to
survive defendant’s challenge.” The court went on to say:
“The award for economic loss is sustained with one exception. As
stated above, plaintiff produced the plaintiff’s W-2 statements
and FICA earnings statements from which his expert economist arrived at
his projections. For the cost of replacement of the plaintiff’s
insurance policy, the economic report multiplied the plaintiff’s
earnings by 14% without any evidence of the contents of the insurance
policy or the amount of premium the plaintiff paid. The evidence,
therefore, was insufficient to make such a determination. Accordingly,
the damages must be reduced by the product of that 14%
calculation.”  
Smith v. M.V. Woods Construction Company, 2003 N.Y. App.
  Div. LEXIS 10026 (N.Y. App. 2003).  The court held that “plaintiff’s

   vocational rehabilitation expert was not qualified to express an opinion
   on past and future loss of earnings, past and future loss of household
services   and past and future medical services.” The court cited several
decisions   in which an expert was qualified for one type of testimony, but
not another,    and drew the analogy that “a medical doctor is not qualified
as a ballistics                             expert,” citing a case in which
that ruling had   been     made.                                   
Walek v. Walek, 193 Misc. 2d 241; 749 N.Y.S.2d 383 (2002).
                             Dr. Frederick Floss, the economic expert for
the    plaintiff          was    opposed        by   a defense expert (unnamed)
   in the specific      area    of the   health care     benefits     of
the    New York State Retirement       system.    The   decision includes
    an   extensive     statement of  the    background   expertise   of Dr.
Floss    to  address   this question,      saying:   “Thus,  while defendant’s

  expert  is certainly  qualified   in her area,      her lack of familiarity 
  with  an employee’s health  care  benefits   significantly         dilutes 
 the  weight of her testimony. On  the other hand,   the referee      found 
      the evidence given by plaintiff’s   expert entirely credible   and 
 fully  persuasive     on all pertinent points,   and I agree with that 
 determination.”                  
Weeden v. First National Bank of Long Island, 297 A.D.2d
  803; 748 N.Y.S.2d 67 (N.Y.App. 2002). The appeals court held that the trial
    court had properly exercised its discretion in prelcuding the plaintiff’s
    expert economist from testifying based on plaintiff’s failure to comply
   with CPLR 3101 (d) (I). The plaintiff had failed to reserve his right
to    pursue claims for the cost of future medical expenses, about which
the economist   was precluded from testifying.






North Carolina

Howerton v. Arai Helmet, Ltd., 2004 N.C. LEXIS 667 (N.C. 2004).
 This decision held that North Carolina has not implicitly adopted the standards
 of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct.
 2786 (1993). The North Carolina Supreme Court held that North Carolina had
 been relying on Rule 702 rather than the Frye general acceptance standard
 long before the Daubert decision, but, after reviewing North Carolina case
 law regarding admission of expert testimony, said: “While these and other
 North Carolina cases share obvious similarities with the principles underlying
 Daubert, application of the North Carolina approach is decidedly less mechanistic
 and rigorous than the “exacting standards of reliability” demanded by the
 federal approach.” Suggested by Joe Agrusa.

Ohio

Eastman v.  The Stanley Works, 2009 Ohio 634 (Ohio App. 2009). The
Ohio Court of appeals reversed the trial court decision and remanded
the case for retrial on the basis of the testimony of vocational expert
Dr.  Bruce Growick and economist Dr. Richard Palfin. The court
concluded that the jury’s award of future economic damages was
not supported by the evidence presented by Growick and Palfin.
Growick’s testimony was that the physical difficulties and eye
impairment of the plaintiff resulting from his injury reduced the
number of jobs for which the plaintiff was qualified before his injury
by 80 to 85 percent. Growick acknowledged that plaintiff  was
earning as much after the injury as before the injury and
“admitted that it would be speculative to state that appellee

would be unable to perform his job at a particular point in the
future.” With respect to Palfin, the court said: “On cross
examination, Dr. Palfin conceded that he had based his annual earnings
calculation on a 52-week year. He also testified that he had not taken
into account the seasonal nature of appellee’s work, and the fact
that appellee’s work weeks were not uniformly 40-hour weeks.
Therefore, Dr. Palfin had used an annual future wage   of
$29,120, while appellee’s annual salary prior to the accident was
only $21,350.03. Dr. Palfin did not assign a starting year for when
appellee would experience loss of earning capacity; rather, he stated,
it would be up to the jury to determine when appellee would actually
begin to experience any loss of earning capacity.” 
Nilavar v. Osborn, 137 Ohio App. 3d 469; 738 N.E.2d 1271
  (Ohio App. 2000). The issue being decided was whether the trial court erred
   in allowing the economic damages testimony of Alan Duvall who based his 
 calculations                             on the Gamboa “worklife expectancy 
 tables.” The   court      ruled      that     the    Gamboa     study may 
 not qualify as   “scientific      information,      but   it  does   fall   
     under  the category      of either “technical”        or “other   specialized 
  information.”      No  challenge was made of  Duvall’s        qualifications. 
   The court   set a  standard     that: “A Theory is considered       ‘widely 
 accepted’       if it is propounded by  at  least a substantial  minority 
     of experts    in the   relevant  field.” It then   ruled  that the Gamboa 
  study   met   that standard    because:  “The Gamboa study   was based 
on data from    the Current Population    Survey  by the U.S. Department 
 of Commerce,   Bureau of the Census. The   Gamboa Study  had been published 
 for  least  nine years at the time of trial,   and Duvall  knew of other 
experts   who   relied on it. Duvall also testified   that if he  had based 
his damage    calculations    on the ‘Cieka (sic) Study,”   which Osborn’s 
 expert recognized      as authoritative,    his calculations   would   have 
been even  higher.    Duvall   utilized the more   conservative     study.

Pirolozzi v. Stanbro,
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42575 (N.D.Ohio 2009). This is a judicial order
denying, among other issues, defendant’s motions to bar the
testimony of vocational expert Dr. Robert Ancell and economic expert
Dr. Michael Thomson. The Court said: “The Defendants rely on the
Ohio wrongful death statute, OR.C. § 2125.02(B), and Ohio caselaw
interpreting the statute to require that any calculation of lost
earnings must be reduced for personal consumption costs. . . With
respect to Dr. Ancell, the Defendants claim that his report merely
summarizes general data without any application as to the specific
facts and circumstances of the Pirolozzi situation. . . As to Dr.
Thompson’s report, the Defendants find it unreliable because it
depends on baseless assumptions and does not factor in the
decedent’s disability at the time of death, his risky behaviors,
or an offset for personal consumption, among other factors. . . 
Further, the Defendants challenge Thompson’s testimony that
considers the decedent’s children’s potential future
earnings loss, arguing that it does not rely upon a cognizable economic
theory of recovery. . .With regard to the children, and their potential
earnings if they do not attend college, the Plaintiff explains that the
argument is not that the children will not be able to afford college
without the financial contribution of their father, but that they will
be less likely to attend without the emotional support of the father. .
. Noting that both parties will have expert testimony on these issues,
and that both parties can cross examine the other’s experts, the
Court finds the testimony of Dr. Ancell and Dr. Thomson to be
admissible. With respect to the specific issue of the Ohio wrongful
death statutue and the need to deduct personal consumption from lost
earning capacity, the Court concludes that these issues go to the
weight of Ancell’s and Thomson’s testimony, not the
admissibility of their testimony.  The Court next considers the
issue of whether the decedent’s children can recover a loss of
their own earnings on the theory that the loss of consortium of their
father, in terms of emotional support, will make them less likely to
attend college. Without the experts present at the Daubert hearing to
testify as to the reliability of this theory and whether there exists
peer-reviewed literature on the topic, the Court defers a ruling until
trial. The economic experts are permitted to testify generally, but the
Court will separately voir dire before the experts testify on this
particular theory.” Suggested by Robert Taylor

Oregon

                             Or. 285 (Or. 2000). This decision sets out the
   standards           to   be   used     in   determining   the admissibility
   of expert   testimony       in   Oregon,   which     recognizes   the
Frye      test, but   relies on  Rule     702  in a manner   similar    to
Daubert.    The  trial  court  had excluded    the testimony   of a  physician
 about      plaintiff’s   silicone breast  implants     causing her  neurological 
   difficulties.     The Oregon  Court of Appeals      had reversed   the 
trial  court  decision  on  this   basis. The  Oregon   Supreme  Court  reversed
     the Court of Appeals  decision    and affirmed   the trial  court decision. 
      In doing so,  it relied   on   its own decision  in        State
v.   Brown,  297 O4. 404; 687   P.2d 751 (1984)   to set out  a list
 of seven  factors to  determine admissibility:   “(1) The  technique’s 
general  acceptance  in the  field; (2) The expert’s   qualifications   
and stature;  (3)  The  use which has  been made of the  technique; (4) The
  potential  rate  of  error;  (5) The existence  of specialized  literature;
  (6) The novelty   of the invention;  and (7) The  extent to which the technique
  relies on  the  subjective interpretation    of the expert.” The      
      Jennings      court  also cited a footnote from            
    State v. Brown        containing      11 additional factors a
court    may consider: “(1)  The potential rate   of   error in using the
technique;    (2)   The existence  and maintenance   of standards  governing
its use; (3)   Presence    of safeguards  in the characteristics    of  the
technique; (4) Analogy  to other    scientific  techniques whose  results
  are admissible; (5) The extent to which    the  technique has been  accepted
  by scientists in the field involved; (6)    The nature and breadth  of
the  inference adduced; (7) The clarity and simplicity     with which the
 technique  can be described and the results explained;  (8)   The extent
to  which the  basic data are verifiable  by the court and  jury;  (9) The
availability  of  other experts to test and  evaluate the  technique;  (10)
The probative  significance   of the evidence  in the circumstances  of the
 case; and (11)  The care with   which the technique  was employed  in the

 said: “In our  view,     Frye’s ‘general      acceptance’ test is a proven
  and   workable rule,    which when faithfully    followed,    fairly serves
its   purpose   of assisting    the courts in determining    when scientific
   evidence   is reliable    and should be admitted.” Submitted       by
Terry Dinneen   and Joseph   Agrusa.  

Vinitski v. Adler, 69 Pa.. D. & C.4th 
78  (Pa    D.  &    C.  2004). The trial court had rejected a medical 
expert’s  testimony    based    on  the requirements of the Frye test. The 
trial court  decision   was upheld    by  the Common Pleas Court. The decision 
contains  extensive   discussion of   the  Frye test and the Frye hearing 
that was held on this   issue. The Court   said:  “It is important to understand 
two terms as defined   by the Superior   Court.  The first term, methodology, 
is ‘[1] a method  of  research in which   a problem  is identified, [2] relevant 
data are gathered,   [3] a hypothesis   is formulated  from these data, and 
[4] the hypothesis   is empirically tested.’         Trach v. Fellin, 
817 A.2d 1102 (Pa.   Super. 2003). ‘Empirical’   is defined as ‘provable or
verifiable by experience   or experiment.’” The  court determined that the
“methods” of the medical  expert “appear to be nothing   more than a few
anecdotal references and a  cursory review of several studies   tangentially 
related to benzodizepines   and possible permanent effects.”

Degen v. Bayman, 90
S.D. 400; 241 N.W.2d 703 (S.Dak.1976). The trial court decision had
been appealed by the plaintiff on several grounds. One of those grounds
was that the trial court: “did not fully instruct the jury
instruct the jury on damages for pain, suffering and mental anguish, as
well as for time lost from pursuing normal activities. While the
specific words ‘personal inconvenience and loss of ability to
enjoy life’ were not used, their meaning was embodied therein.
Had the court given the refused instruction, it would have been only
cumulative of those already given and might very well have only
confused the jury in its deliberations.”
Garland v. Rossknecht, 2001 SD 42; 624 N.W.2d 700 (S.Dak.
                             2001). The economic expert testimony of Don
Frankenfeld            was    ruled      inadmissible        because: “Frankenfeld
had  concluded          that  Garland   had    suffered from “a   ten   
percent  ‘disability’      or   earning  capacity   reduction.    When questioned 
   about    how   he   arrived   at this  percentage,   Frankenfeld    stated, 
 ‘it was  a   judgment      call.’   In fact,  his opinion   was based solely 
    on information   provided   by   Garland. Garland reported   that when 
 he worked    on a  four-hour  graphic   design  project, he had to   take 
 a half hour break.     Frankenfeld  extrapolated       a half  hour break 
  every four hours into  one  hour  of  nonproductivity     a day.   He then 
  took  ‘one and divided  it by eight,   one  hour out of   an  eight-hour 
   day is one-eighth,      twelve and a half percent.’    He   then  discounted 
 the rating  to ten  percent.”     Frankenfeld then admitted      that “a 
vocational expert has   competence  I do not  have to take physical      
limitations and translate  them  into vocational    limitations.”  In  spite 
   of  this, the trial  court admitted   Frankenfeld’s    testimony.  The 
South    Dakota  Supreme  Court reversed on this   grounds.
Kay v.  Lamar Advertising of South Dakota, Inc., 2009
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74520 (D. South. Dakota 2009). This was an order
denying defendant’s motion in limine to limit the testimony of
Dr. Walter Lierman, an economist, on behalf of the plaintiff. Judge
Karen E. Schreier applied a Daubert standard as interpreted by the 8th
Circuit in Lauzon v. Senco Products, 207 F.3d 681 (8th Cir. 2001) in
holding that the proposed testimony of Dr. Lierman was based on
sufficient facts and data, was a product of reliable principles and
methods, and that Dr. Lierman applied the methodology reliably to the
facts of the case. In her analysis of “sufficient facts and
data,” Judge Schreier said: “Rule 702 does not require Dr.
Lierman to have all of the facts or even the best facts. It only
requires ‘sufficient facts.’ See Fed. R.  Evid. 702.
Any weakness perceived by defendants in the factual basis of Dr.
Lierman’s opinions are capable of being brought out in
cross-examination and argued to the jury.” 

Tennessee



McDaniel v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 955 S.W.2d 257
(Tenn. 1997). This Tennessee decision explains the standards for the
admission of scientific testimony in Tennessee. It can be described as
a Daubert Plus decision. The Court held that Tennessee Rules 702 and
703 govern the admissibility of scientific evidence and explicitly
reject the Frye test of general acceptance as the only test for
admissibility in Tennessee. The Court points out that the Tennessee
versions of Rules 702 and 703 are uniquely different from the
corresponding Federal Rules. Tenn. R. Evid. 702 requires that
scientific evidence “substantially assist the trier of
fact” while Federal Rule 702 only requires that scientific
evidence “assist the trier of fact.”  Similarly, Tenn.
R. Evid. 703 states that “the court shall disallow testimony in
the form of an opinion or inference if the underlying facts or data
indicate lack of trustworthiness.” The Court points out that
there is no similar language in Fed. R. Evid. 703. The Court went on to
say that the tests in Daubert were useful, but that: “No
framework exists that provides for simple and practical application in
every case; the complexity and diversity of potential scientific
evidence is simply to vast for the application of a single test.”
The Court summarized its conclusions as follows: “Simply put,
unless the scientific evidence is valid, it will not substantially
assist the trier of fact, nor will its underlying facts and data appear
trustworthy, but there is no requirement in the rule that it be
generally accepted.” 
      
      
      
      
      
      Texas
E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d
                             549; 38 Tex. Sup. St. J. 852 (1995).  In 
 this     case,      the    Texas      Supreme       Court took a very strong 
 position     in favor     of scientific      considerations        for  admission
 of   expert   testimony,      paralleling  the          Daubert v. Merrell
         Dow   Pharmaceuticals,      Inc, 509  U.S.    579 (1993) decision
   at the federal          level.   The   Robinson Court  discussed    Rule
  702 at length before   providing      a  list of six non inclusive factors
     that a trial court   should consider:        (1)  the extent to which
  the theory    has been or  can be tested; (2)    the  extent     to which
  the technique relies    upon  the subjective interpretation      of the
    expert;   (3) whether the theory    has been subjected to peer   review
      and/or   publication;   (4) the  technique’s   potential rate of  error;
   (5)  whether the  underlying theory   or technique   has been generally
   accepted    as valid by the  relevant  scientific   community;   and (6)
  the  non-judicial    uses which  have  been made of the theory   or technique. 

































































                                             Gammill v. Jack Williams Chevrolet, 
    Inc.,      972   S.W.2d    713   (Tex.    1998).    This decision 
could    be called   the   Kumho   decision    of Texas   although    it was
   reached    before   the United  States   Supreme    Court reached   its
decision     in             Kumho   Tire  Co.,  Ltd v. Carmichael, 
    509  U.S.   579; 119  S.Ct.   1167 (1999).      It holds that the 
 specific    scientific      factors mentioned   in             Daubert 
 v.  Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals        Inc.,  509 U.S. 579;    113 S.Ct. 
 2786; 125 L.Ed.469  (1993) and   in        E.I.   du Pont  de  Nemours 
 &   Co. v. Robinson, 923   S.W.2d      549; 38 Tex.   Sup. St.  
J. 852 (1995) may  not be applicable   in all  cases,   but  that the   gatekeeper
   role of trial courts   under   Rule 702  applies   in all instances  
  of expert    testimony, both in terms    of  the reliability   of the expert
  and his  or  her  testimony. The court  said:    “[E]ven if  the  specific
 factors   set out  in             Daubert  for  assessing  the  reliability
  and relevance    of scientific    evidence  do  not fit other expert  
testimony,   the court    is not relieved  of   its responsibility to evaluate
the  reliability   of   the  testimony in determining     its admissibility.”
 In this  decision,     there is stress on the fact  that  the   fact that
an  expert  would  be qualified     to testify on some  matters  does not
  imply  that the expert would be qualified     to testify  on the matters
 at hand.     
GMBH v. Davis, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 1904 (Tex. App. 2005). 
          A Texas Court of Appeals upheld the admission of Dr. Keith Fairchild
     on   behalf  of the plaintiff in a case involving a claim of damages
based     on  commercial  misrepresentation by GMHB. The standard of review
under         E.I.    du Pont de  Nemours & Co. v. Robinson 923
S.W.2d   549 (1995) (the         Daubert       of  Texas) is short
and clear.   Fairchild has a  doctorate in economics and teaches  a university
course   in corporate valuation,   so he is qualified. Fairchild’s  testimony
aided   the jury in resolving a  factual dispute. In the absense of  contrary

evidence,   Fairchild’s methods  had a reliable foundation.       
Guzman v. Guajardo, 761 S.W.2d 506 (Tex.App. 1988). Dr. Everett 
                             Dillman had presented a benchmark for the value 
   of   the    loss     of   society        of  decent’s society to his mother, 
    based   on   one hour     per  day over the    life    expectancy  of 
the    mother,   valued   at salaries     in the helping professions,    
   including    clergy,    social    work and counselors.       The Texas 
Court of Appeals           did  not reverse    on  the basis of this     admission. 
  Dr.   Dillman also      provided     testimony about  lost   earnings 
and lost   household    services.                           
Manasco v. Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania,
                             2002 Tex. App. Lexis 7252. The trauma-cancer
testimony          of   Dr.           Richard      Hamer was not admitted.
Dr. Hamer,       a  board-certified     neurologist        testified    
 that the plaintiff’s         head injury caused     his cancer. The    Texas
  Court of   Appeals     applied    the standards of   Texas  Rule 702, based 
    on the   standards      laid out    in       E.I. du  Pont de Nemours 
 & Co.   v. Robinson,        923    S.W.2d 549 (1995) to  exclude 
 the testimony.  The  court discussed      the    literature  concerning 
  head injury  trauma and  cancer  and  concluded       that  the trial court
 had   been  correct  in refusing   to admit  Dr.    Hamer’s   testimony.  
   This   is of special  interest  becauase  the    theory of   cancer caused 
 by trauma   was the leading  example   of “junk    science” in   Peter Huber’s 
 definition  of   that term in  Galileo’s   Revenge:      Junk Science   
 in the Courtroom, Basic Books,   1991. 

Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation
     v.  Smoak,      134   S.W.3d    880   (Tex.    App. 2004). The defense
     appealed  based  on   the admission   of   testimony   by  two  experts,
    including economist  Dr.   Dale Funderbunk,   on   the basis of  insufficient
       evidence of causation,     past and future   lost   earning capacity,
     or future  medical  care,  to   sustain a judgment.   Pilgrim’s   Pride
   contended   that Dale  Funderbunk      was not a qualified  vocational
expert    or employment   specialist  and    that his  methodology was flawed.
The   decision  describes    Funderbunk’s   assumptions and  methodology
 in some   detail, including  the fact that Funderbunk    had used several
 different    assumptions about  worklife  expectancy. The   court  held
that Funderbunk    was properly qualified  and that  his testimony   was
not  based on an unsound   methodology.  
SeaRiver Maritime v. Pike,
2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 4904 (Tex. App. 2006). SeaRiver appealed the trial
court decision to allow Dr. Robert Voogt to testify, relying
significantly on the exclusion of Dr. Voogt in the case of Norwest Bank  v. K-Mart,
1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3426 (N.D. Ind. 1997).  The Court held that:
“Norwest is plainly distinguishable. As we read Dr. Voogt’s
testimony, his approach in this case avoided the mistakes in Norwest.
He based much of his cost evaluation upon the records and
recommendations of the treating physicians. Unlike Norwest, other
qualified health care providers testified and related many of the
components of the health care plan. Further, unlike Norwest, SeaRiver
also provided health care evidence through its own life care expert.
The pharmaceutical prescriptions were based on Pike’s past
treatment history, which Voogt delineated. Taken as a whole, Dr. Voogt
demonstrated special knowledge concerning most of the very matters on
which he gave an opinion. . . . Under these circumstances, we cannot
say the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to exclude the
totality of the expert’s testimony.” (Parts of Dr.
Voogt’s testimony were excluded, but those parts were not part of
the appeal.)              
Strauss v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 67 S.W.3d 428 (Texas
                             App. 2002). This decision involves a claim by 
 a  New    Orleans        attorney         that     his injury while boarding
   a Continental    flight       cost him a  line     of  business     in
Kosciusko,   Mississippi    because     of  difficulties  in travel     even
though    it did not impair    his ability     to  work in New Orleans. The
  decision     provides   extensive    discussion     of the legal meaning
of earning     capacity,   pointing out     that there  is   a right to recover
for past   loss  of earning capacity   but that  the  burden    of proof
for past lost   earnings  is greater than   that  for loss  of future   
earning capacity.    The court  said: “In   determining  what  evidence
  is sufficient to support   a claim of  lost earning  capacity,  no  general
rule   can be laid down,   except that each  case must  be judged on   its
peculiar    facts,  and the  damages proved with that degree  of certainty
  of which the   case is  susceptible.”  The review of prior case in the
decision   is very  interesting.   The decision   then examines    the theories
of damages    advanced  by the plaintiff    and concluded: “Strauss’s   
  damages were   susceptible   to showing a  higher degree   of certainty. 
     As a  result, the jury  lacked   any evidence from which  to intelligently
   determine   what the reasonable  value  of his ability to generate   contingency
    fee   cases  from Kosciusko  was prior  to this injury or the amount
  of past   impairment.”  

Virginia
Belshe v. Pinecrest Cluster Association, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 
       56 (2005). Testimony of plaintiff’s exert orthopedist was excluded 
because       plaintiff failed to meet scheduling deadlines for providing 
a report.   The    court the testimony of Anthony Bird, a vocational expert 
because Bird   was    unable to formulate his own opinions in the absence 
of the orthopedist’s      report. The court also excluded the testimony of 
Richard Edelman, an economist,      to the extent that his opinions would 
have depended on either the opinions      of the orthopedist or Mr. Bird, 
but allowed Dr. Edelman to compute and   testify    about pre-judgment interest 
to the jury.              
John v. Im, 263 Va. 315; 559 S.E.2d
                             694. This Virgina Supreme Court decision used 
 Daubert        standards          to   uphold       the decision of the trial
 court   judge     in denying   the    admissibility      of   a  psychologist 
  and   an expert     on QEEG testing    of   electrical functioning     
  of the   brain. The    defense argued that    the  court properly excluded 
 the     testimony      because the  testimony    lacked  a sufficient factual 
 basis,    did not  take   into   account all   testing variables and did 
not assess  the  effect  of those   variables   on the  test results.  
The Virginia  Supreme  Court agreed.

Vasquez v. Mabini, 269 Va 155; 606 S.E.2d 809 (Va. 2005). 
         “At trial, the plaintiff presented the testimony of Richard B. Edelman, 
       a  Professor Emeritus of Finance at American University, as an expert 
   witness      with regard to the decedent’s loss of income and the economic 
   value of   the   loss of her services, protection, care and assistance. 
 No   objection   was made  to his qualifications. He testified that Mrs. 
Mabini’s   lost income   and benefits  would have amounted to $121,533 if 
she had worked   until age   60 and $203,145  if she had worked until age 
66. He gave the value  of her   lost services as  $343,287 and reasonable 
funeral expenses as $12,403.  His   calculation of the  total loss to the 
beneficiaries was thus $477,223  based   on retirement at age 60 and $558, 
835 based on retirement at age  66. These   conclusions were necessarily dependent
upon certain assumptions    to which  the defendants objected: that the decedent
would have found full-time    employment   the day after the accident at
a wage of $8.00 per hour ($16,000    per year)   and would have remained
so employed until retirement; that her    employer would  have provided additional
 contributions amounting to 3.7%    of her income in  the form of a “401(k)”
or  similar retirement benefit;   that her income would  increase at 4.25
percent  per year, and that Pomeroy,   her dependent adult  son, would have
continued  to live 24 years into the   future even though the  witness knew
that he had  died before trial. The defendants  also objected   to the witness’
failure to  consider the life expectancy  of the decedent’s   husband in
arriving at the  economic value of her lost  household services.”   Based
on that summary, the  Virginia Supreme Court  held: “Because the expert 
 testimony was based upon  fictional assumptions    not supported by the
evidence,   it was speculative and  unreliable as a   matter of law and should
have been   stricken.” The decision  was remanded   to a lower court for
a new trial limited   to the issue of damages.     Suggested by Michael
J. Piette.                
Washington
State v. Copeland, 922 P.2d 1304 (Wash. 1996). The Washington 
                             Supreme Court retained the Frye standard in lieu
    of   Daubert,         saying       that     the application of Frye in
 that    state   "has not    been     so difficult       as to  call   for
 its abandonment."             
State v. Riker, 869 P.2d 43 (Wash. 1994). The Washington
  Supreme Court, while formally retaining the Frye standard, expressly
   incorporated some Daubert factors into Frye jurisprudence. 
West Virginia
Craighead v Norfolk and Western Railway Co., 197 W.Va 271;
                             475 S.E.2d 363. Dr. Michael Brookshire’s testimony
      about      lost     earnings         was   challenged as speculative 
 because     the  plaintiff      had   been unemployed         for six to 
nine months    prior  to his death    in  a train   accident. The  decedent 
      had  taken   the  Army admission   test  and been  placed in Category 
  4, which     was     not  being taken at  the time  of death,  but was being
 taken   six months      later.    The projection   of lost earnings  was
based on  the vocational    experts     opinion   that  the plaintiff would
 have served  20 years in   the  Army.      The West    Virginia Supreme
Court  found  this testimony     as not unduly  speculative.

Best life insurance plans and rates | LifePlans.com

































Compare the Top Online Life InsuranceCarriers in Michigan

Life Insurance Helps the Ones You Love with:

Mortgage Payments

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

The parties to this arbitration agreement acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Healthplans.com IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.
You shall have thirty (30) days from the date that you submit your personally identifiable information to opt-out of this arbitration agreement.

The parties to this arbitration agreement acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Healthplans.com IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.
You shall have thirty (30) days from the date that you submit your personally identifiable information to opt-out of this arbitration agreement.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

Term Life Insurance
A Term Life policy offers coverage only if death occurs during a specific period of time, which coincides with the terms in which the insured member is required to make a monthly premium. A Term Life policy pays a benefit to the beneficiaries only if the policy holder dies during the time period for which the policy was initially contracted and has remained current on their annual or monthly premium payments.
This type of policy is beneficial for parents of young children, people with debt obligations and also home buyers. It can be renewed after the initial term has ended and it may also be converted to a whole life policy. The premiums are based on your age and your health status. Purchasing a new Term policy at the expiration of your existing policy will result in a higher premium and you may not qualify if you have disqualifying health issues.
Term Life is a "death benefit only" policy that you buy for a specified length of time. Think of it like leasing a car: you pay for the use of the car for a specified period and when the contract period is over, you return the car.
Term Life is referred to as "benefit only" insurance because unlike the various types of permanent life such as Whole Life, it carries no "cash surrender value". Because of this, Term Life insurance premiums tend to be very affordable. Young and relatively healthy individuals can often obtain a policy with limited or no medical background check. It is ideal for families that are just starting out, or for the family income provider who wants to make sure his or her family will be protected, but may not be able to afford, or desire a permanent life policy. However, understand that as a person ages over the period of the term, monthly premiums may increase.
It is often an ideal option to insure a second spouse, or for single people, even for children, just to make sure the often unexpectedly expensive costs of a funeral are covered. There are many insurance and financial professionals who suggest that those who purchase a Term Life policy can make up for the investment component of a Permanent Life insurance policy by investing the cost savings between the two on their own.
The earlier you purchase a term life policy and the healthier you are, the cheaper the premiums will be over the term of the policy.
Annual Renewable Term Life policies are those that are purchased year-by-year. The next year you do not have to prequalify. Simply choose to renew at what may or may not be an increased rate. Rates for Annual Renewable policies are at historic lows. A young healthy person can get $250,000.00 for only a few hundred dollars per year.
There are very good rates these days on Term Life. The premium is fixed and will not go up for the life of the term, usually 10,15, 20 or 30 years. It is not uncommon for a healthy non-smoking 40 year-old male to obtain a 20 or 30-year policy with a fixed premium of less than $30 per month.
So just how much Insurance should you buy? Many things factor into that answer, but at the minimum the experts say purchase enough insurance to equal at least 5-7 years of your present salary. If you have young children, make that around 10 years. So, if you make $50,000 a year that means at least $250,000 to $500,000 in coverage. Feel free to use our Life Insurance Calculator to help determine the right amount for your circumstances.
Term Life Insurance is an affordable life insurance product to ensure that your loved ones are protected in the event of your unexpected death, for a specific term period of time.
