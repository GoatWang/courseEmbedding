This letter allows you to provide information needed to assess how Canadian regulatory requirements do or may apply to transactions between counterparties.Register your interest in Canadian Representation Letter   Product SummaryThe ISDA Amend tool, built on the Markit Counterparty Manager platform enables dealers and their clients to centrally manage Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) documentation requirements, as well as track and control counterparty access at the fund and account level.ISDA Amend 2.0 builds upon existing functionality and applies a multi-jurisdictional approach.

The Letter will be expanded to cover additional jurisdictions that may be subject to the margin requirements in due course.Variation Margin (VM) ProtocolThe Variation Margin Protocol is designed to help market participants comply with new rules on margin for uncleared swaps, by providing a scalable solution to amend derivatives contract documentation with multiple counterparties. The Protocol addresses documentation changes necessary to comply with the variation margin requirements that will apply to a large number of market participants in various jurisdictions from March 2017.ISDA Jurisdictional Modular Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA JMP)The ISDA Jurisdictional Modular Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA JMP) enables parties to comply with new restrictions on termination rights in financial contracts. Each Jurisdictional Module of the ISDA JMP is aimed at facilitating compliance with regulations in a different jurisdiction. ISDA Amend 2.0, in conjunction with the ISDA JMP, allows you to make certain elections related to a Jurisdictional Module and to inform counterparties of relevant adherence information, such as the capacity in which you have adhered (as an entity subject to applicable regulations, as a counterparty to such entities or both), which parties you choose to amend your third-country law financial arrangements with and which underlying funds or principals you have adhered on behalf of, as applicable.UK (PRA Rule) Jurisdictional Module to the ISDA Jurisdictional Modular Resolution Stay ProtocolThis enables compliance with the Prudential Regulation Authority's (UK PRA) final rule on contractual stays in financial contracts governed by third-country law (PRA 2015/82) (UK PRA Stay Rule). Entities subject to the UK PRA Stay Rule must amend 'third-country law' financial arrangements with counterparties so that their counterparties agree to be bound by stays on or overrides of termination rights under the UK Banking Act if such entities enter UK bank resolution proceedings.German Jurisdictional Module to the ISDA Resolution Stay Jurisdictional Modular ProtocolThis enables compliance with Section 60a of the German Recovery and Resolution Act (German Legislation). Entities subject to the German Legislation must obtain from certain counterparties a contractual recognition of the application of stays on termination in financial contracts governed by the law of a 'third country' (a jurisdiction other than that of a member of the European Union) or with a place of venue in a third country.Japanese Jurisdictional Module to the ISDA Resolution Stay Jurisdictional Modular ProtocolThis module enables compliance with the amendments to the Comprehensive Guidelines issued by Japanese Financial Services Agency regarding contractual stays in certain financial contracts governed by non-Japanese law (Japanese Regulation). Entities subject to the Japanese Regulations will require certain counterparties to include a contractual stay in certain contracts governed by non-Japanese law and as specified in the Japanese Regulation.ISDA Regulatory ToolsAugust 2012 Dodd- Frank Protocol/ March 2013 Dodd-Frank ProtocolCFTC’s External and Internal Business Conduct rules and standards.Cross-Border Representation – US/Non US PersonOn July 26th 2013, the CFTC published an “Interpretive Guidance and Policy Statement Regarding Compliance with Certain
							Swap Regulations” providing guidance as to when the CFTC will assert jurisdiction over swap transactions that have a
							non-U.S. element. This allows market participants to provide counterparties with status representations needed to
							determine whether compliance with various CFTC swap regulations is required by the Interpretive Guidance.CFTC IM Segregation Right NoticeIn November 2013, the CFTC published Regulation 23.701, implementing requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants to notify counterparties of their right to require segregation of margin (other than variation margin) for uncleared swap transactions.
							The rule became effective on January 6, 2014.  For market participants that became “new counterparties” of a swap dealer or major swap participant after that date (for example, by putting in place an ISDA Master Agreement to begin trading uncleared swaps), the relevant swap dealer or major swap participant must comply with the requirements by May 5, 2014. For market participants that were existing counterparties on or before January 6, 2014, the compliance date is November 3, 2014.EMIR Counterparty and Clearing Classification ToolsThe EMIR Counterparty Classification Tool and the EMIR Clearing Classification Tool allows entities to communicate the classification status between counterparties to help ensure compliance with EMIR. By answering a series of questions, derivative counterparties can classify themselves according to the EMIR taxonomy for various purposes, including obligations on mitigation of risks associated with cleared and uncleared OTC derivatives.Canadian Representation Letter #1The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), the Manitoba Securities Commission (MSC) and the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), respectively, published Rule 91-507 requiring “reporting counterparties” to report certain derivatives data to “designated” or “recognized” trade repositories with respect to transactions involving “local counterparties”.  The OSC, MSC and AMF have also published companion policies. In these three jurisdictions, for trades involving a “clearing agency” or a Dealer, trade reporting begins on October 31, 2014 and, for trades that do not involve such entities, on June 30, 2015. The securities regulatory authorities in certain of the remaining provinces of Canada have indicated their intention to introduce substantially identical rules by way of a multi-lateral instrument.  Canadian federally regulated financial institutions may become subject to similar federal or national rules, orders or directives.
							It is anticipated that other rules and instruments to be published and finalized by Canadian Regulators with respect to Derivatives will include a substantially equivalent definition of “local counterparty” to that in the TR Rules. 
							This letter allows you to provide information needed to assess how Canadian Regulatory Requirements do or may apply to Transactions between counterparties.Australian Single-Sided Reporting LetterISDA Australian Single-Sided Reporting Letter allows certain market participants to take advantage of the Australian single-sided reporting regime for Phase 3 Entities. The letter allows market participants to provide counterparties with status representations that can be used to help determine whether single-sided reporting is applicable for those entities with total gross notional outstanding positions of less than A$5b (Phase 3 Entities), provided they engage in derivatives transactions with counterparties that are already required or agree to report.
							Australian Mandatory Clearing Classification Letter
The ISDA Australian Clearing Classification Letter allows counterparties to bilaterally communicate their status by answering a series of questions and enable counterparties to notify each other of their status for clearing requirements under Australia’s mandatory central clearing regime for over-the-counter derivatives. ISDA prepared the appendices in order to help counterparties provide classification-status information to determine the application of certain requirements under the ASIC Derivative Transaction Rules (Clearing) 2015. The letter and the appendices may be used by a named entity to meet its requirements under Rule 3.1.2 of the ASIC clearing rules.UK (PRA Rule) Jurisdictional Module to the ISDA Jurisdictional Modular Resolution Stay ProtocolThis tool enables compliance with the Prudential Regulation Authority’s (UK PRA) final rule on contractual stays in financial contracts governed by third-country law (PRA 2015/82) (UK PRA Stay Rule).

Product Knowledge & Case Design






Your producers count on you to know the market and products better than anyone. At LifeMark Partners, we have a relationship with LifeTrends, the premier product-benchmarking tool in the industry used by many major carriers in the product analysis and development process. This tool allows you to:

•Determine in a matter of minutes which product and carrier is right for a given scenario
•Demonstrate that you scanned the market of the top 30 carriers before you made a recommendation, including access to competitive heat maps for all products
•Access product analysis and positioning for new products within 48 hours of their release—enabling you to share expert knowledge of new products before anyone else in the marketplace. 
•Dramatically reduce the number of illustrations you output while quickly and thoroughly creating case designs for your producers




Additionally, our exclusive LifeMark Partners login website provides its own library of resources:

VitalSales Suite from Ebix & LifePipe from iPipeline 
To provide a true product comparison, we offer quote reporting for all carriers, not just our contracted partners. These tools also share underwriting capacity for every carrier so you know how to position those large cases. 
Operations Database 
We have created a database that will be the only tool your operations teams will need. From carrier requirements for new business processing, to underwriting guidelines and detailed contact information, everything you will require will be right at your fingertips.

Intertek and AHJs: Partners in Protecting People and Property from Harm.
As Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJs), one of your top priorities is keeping people and property safe. In order to do that, you need to know that the products, equipment and systems you are evaluating meet current safety requirements. Standards outlined by organizations such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) are constantly evolving, and it can be challenging to keep pace. Nationally Recognized Testing Labs (NRTLs) like Intertek are your partners in safety and believe that safer products save lives.The following links will provide more information about product testing and certification:Understanding Product Testing and CertificationWhat’s In a Certification Mark?What Is An “NRTL” and What Is Its Role?Helpful Resources in Your Role As An AHJAHJ Blog Archive

What’s In a Certification Mark?

Testing and Certification Marks Provide Safety Assurance That You Can Rely on.
They are on your telephone, hair dryer and laptop. You notice them on product packaging and the products themselves. What do they mean and why do they matter?Certification Marks, such as ETL, UL and CSA, signify that a qualified, independent testing laboratory has tested a product and certified its compliance to national safety standards.When you see a certification mark on a product, you know it:Passed the testing processMeets the standardsParticipates in an ongoing quality inspection program to ensure continued complianceIf you don’t see a mark, you should question whether or not the product has been tested and is safe for use.How do Marks differ?Each Mark is evidence that a product has been tested to national or international industry specific standards. The primary difference between the Marks from different laboratories is in the service behind them. When you see the ETL Listed Mark, for example, you know the product has been tested, found in compliance with industry standards and meets the necessary requirements to be sold in the market.
