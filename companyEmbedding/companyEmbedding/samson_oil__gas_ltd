(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected aspects of our financial position and the results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying Condensed Financial Statements. You should read this in conjunction with the discussion under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the audited Financial Statements for the year ended June 30, 2016, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein.  Throughout this report, a barrel of oil or "Bbl" means a stock tank barrel ("STB") and a thousand cubic feet of gas or "Mcf" means a thousand standard cubic feet of gas ("Mscf").  Overview  We are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration, exploitation and development of oil and natural gas properties. Our strategy is to focus on the exploration, exploitation and development of our major oil plays - the Madison Group reservoirs in the Williston Basin in Williams and McKenzie Counties, North Dakota, and Roosevelt County in Montana.  In March 2016 we closed on an acquisition (the "Foreman Butte Acquisition") of certain assets located in North Dakota and Montana, which we refer to as the "Foreman Butte Project," for a purchase price of $16 million. The acquired assets consist of producing oil and gas wells, shut in wells and associated facilities. The wells are located in the Madison and Ratcliffe formations. The majority of these wells will be operated by us, however there are a number of non-operated wells also included in this package.  Our net oil production was 64,632 barrels of oil for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to 41,927 barrels of oil for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  Our net gas production was 58,209 Mcf for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to 92,399 Mcf for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Coupled with the decrease in production following our North Stockyard sale, one of our significant gas wells has been down since October 2016 while undergoing workover operations. It appears these workover operations have not been successful and the operator is recommending that this well be plugged and abandoned. We do not have an expected timetable for this operation as yet. Associated gas produced in the Foreman Butte project area is not as significant as the oil production, therefore the acquisition has not offset decline from the sale.  Our net oil production was 230,756 barrels of oil for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 154,156 barrels of oil for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. Production has increased as a result of our acquisition of the Foreman Butte project and our subsequent workover activity in this project area. This activity offset the decrease in production as a result of the sale of the North Stockyard property, which closed on October 29, 2016.  Our net gas production was 93,526 Mcf of gas for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 271,469 Mcf of gas for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. Coupled with the decrease in production following our North Stockyard sale, one of our significant gas wells has been down since October 2016 while undergoing workover operations. It appears these workover operations have not been successful and the operator is recommending that this well be plugged and abandoned. We do not have an expected timetable for this operation as yet. Associated gas produced in the Foreman Butte project area is not as significant as the oil production, therefore the acquisition has not offset decline from the sale of the North Stockyard project area.  For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, we reported a net gain of $0.2 million and a net loss of $1.3 million, respectively. The small gain in the current period reflects $0.4 million in depletion and amortization and $1.4 million in gain on derivative instruments while the loss in the prior period reflects a $0.8 million in depletion, amortization and impairment.  For the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, we reported a net loss of $2.7 million and a net loss of $18.1 million, respectively. The loss in the current period reflects $1.5 million in depletion and amortization while the loss in the prior period reflects a $4.3 million in exploration expenditure and impairment expense of $9.9 million.  See "Results of Operations" below.  In the execution of our strategy, our management is principally focused on economically developing additional reserves of oil and on maximizing production levels through exploration, exploitation and development activities on a cost-effective basis.  Notable Activities and Status of Material Properties during the Quarter Ended March 31, 2017 and Current Activities  Acquisition: Producing Properties  Foreman Butte Project, McKenzie County, North Dakota  Mississippian Madison Formation, Williston Basin  Samson 87% Operated Average Working Interest  We are continuing with our workover operations to return several shut-in wells back to production in the Foreman Butte Project. A fluid-level/production efficiency study has been completed on all the wells in the field to optimize well pump efficiency. We have discovered that many of the wells have sub-performing pump stroke lengths and/or improperly sized pumping units as evidenced from high-fluid levels located inside the wells. Concurrently, a number of wells with behind-pipe pay zones have been identified as recompletion candidates.  During the current quarter, we commenced the first of the identified recompletion targets. The Davidson #1, a vertical wellbore in Williams County, was perforated in the Ratcliffe zone of the Madison formation. The initial 24 hour production rate after perforating was 64 BOP. Additional recompletions and well optimizations are scheduled for the upcoming quarter that may add to the production from this project.  Additionally, two new horizontal laterals are currently being planned to be drilled out of the Maris 1-16H wellbore this spring. The first will test the Ratcliffe Formation of the Mississippian Madison Group. The second will test the Mission Canyon Formation of the Mississippian Madison Group. The lateral in the Ratcliffe Formation will help define the pressure depletion radius from the existing producing wellbores which will ultimately determine the number of PUD's (proven undeveloped drilling locations) we can drill in this reservoir. Third-party pressure modelling of the Ratcliffe reservoir shows that relatively high reservoir pressure resides approximately 500 feet away from the Maris 1-16 surface location. It is estimated that this new lateral could produce at around 300 BOPD if the third-party pressure modelling proves to be correct. The second lateral in the Mission Canyon Formation will test an undeveloped reservoir that could prove up a new oil field with the potential for many additional well locations. These are expected to be drilled in the third quarter of calendar 2017.  Undeveloped Properties: Exploration Activities  Hawk Springs Project, Goshen County, Wyoming  Permo-Penn Project, Northern D-J Basin  Samson 37.5% working interest  Following a delay due to bad weather in the latter part of 2016, the recompletion of the Bluff #1-11 well has been further delayed due to our current focus on more capital efficient projects in the Foreman Butte project area. The Jurassic Canyon Springs Formation will be perforated and flow tested first. If this is unsuccessful, the Cretaceous Dakota Formation will subsequently be perforated and flow tested. This well will be plugged and abandoned should these two operations be unsuccessful.  Spirit of America US34 #2-29 well  Samson 100% Working Interest  This well was plugged and abandoned during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  Cane Creek Project, Grand & San Juan Counties, Utah  Pennsylvanian Paradox Formation, Paradox Basin  Samson 100% Working Interest  On November 5, 2014, we entered into an Other Business Arrangement ("OBA") with the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration ("SITLA") covering approximately 8,080 gross/net acres located in Grand and San Juan Counties, Utah, all of which are administered by SITLA. We were granted an option period for two years in order to enter into a Multiple Mineral Development Agreement ("MMDA") with another company who hold leases to extract potash in an acreage position situated within our project area. In November 2015, we paid an extension fee of $40,000 in order to extend the option period to December 2016. In November 2016, we paid a further extension fee of $40,000 to extend the option period to December 2017.  The MMDA has been finalized and is awaiting signature by both parties. Upon entering into the MMDA, SITLA is obligated to deliver oil and gas leases covering our project area at cost of $75 per acre to us.  This acreage is located in the heart of the Cane Creek Clastic Play of the Paradox Formation along the Cane Creek anticline. The primary drilling objective is the overpressured and oil saturated Cane Creek Clastic interval. Keys to the play to date include positioning along the axis of the Cane Creek anticline and exposure to open natural fractures. The 3-D seismic is currently being designed to image these natural fractures. The seismic shoot was surveyed and permitted this past summer. While we can make no assurances, we believe this project has the potential to provide robust economics in a low priced oil environment using the evidence obtained from a nearby competitor well that has produced 802,967 barrels of oil("BO") in just over two years.  Developed Properties: Drilling Activities  North Stockyard Oilfield, Williams County, North Dakota  Mississippian Bakken Formation, Williston Basin  Bakken & Three Forks infill wells  Samson ~25-30% working interest  The sale of this project area was completed on October 28, 2016. The project was sold for $14.95 million.  Rainbow Project, Williams County, North Dakota  Mississippian Bakken Formation, Williston Basin  Samson 23% and 52% working interest  In 2013, we acquired 656 acres in a 1,255 acre drilling unit and 294 acres in a 1,280 acre drilling unit. Both drilling units are located in the Rainbow Project, Williams County, North Dakota. The Rainbow Project is located in Sections 17, 18, 19 and 20 in T158N R99W.  Samson acquired the net acres in the Rainbow Project from the vendor as part of an acreage trade and is obligated provide a $1 million carry (10% of expected costs to drill and complete the first well) to the vendor, for the first development well to be drilled in the Rainbow Project.  Samson has assessed the project based on offset well data and believes that the project will support 16 wells, 8 in the middle Bakken and 8 in the first bench of the Three Forks. These wells would be expected to be configured as north-south orientated 10,000 foot horizontals.  In the western drilling unit of the acquired acreage, we hold a 52% working interest. In the eastern drilling unit, our interest is 23%. Continental Resources has been designated as operator, due to their larger working interest.  The first well in this project area, the Gladys 1-20H well (23% working interest), was drilled and completed in January 2014. During the quarter the Gladys 1-20H well produced 6,448 barrels of oil (gross). We have no further drilling planned in this project area until there is a sustained recovery in the oil prices, however six additional wells could be drilled in the 1,280 acre unit.  Results of Operations  For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we reported a net gain of $0.2 million compared to a net loss of $1.3 million for the same period in 2016.  For the nine months ended March 31, 2017, we reported a net loss of $2.7 million compared to a net loss of $18.1 million for the same period in 2016.  The following tables set forth selected operating data for the three months and nine months ended:   Three months ended 31-Mar-17 31-Mar-16 Production Volume Oil (Bbls) 64,632 41,927 Natural gas (Mcf) 58,209 92,399 BOE (Barrels of oil equivalent - based on one barrel of oil to six Mcf of natural gas) 74,334 57,327 Sales Price Realized Oil ($/Bbls) $ 45.53 $ 22.91 Impact of settled derivative instruments $ (2.29 ) $ 13.78 Derivative adjusted price $ 43.23 $ 36.69 Realized Gas ($/Mcf) $ 2.34 $ 1.69 Expense per BOE: Lease operating expenses $ 22.93 $ 8.58 Production and property taxes $ 3.80 $ 2.96 Depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 5.45 $ 13.80 General and administrative expense $ 17.27 $ 15.74   Nine months ended 31-Mar-17 31-Mar-16 Production Volume Oil (Bbls) 230,756 154,156 Natural gas (Mcf) 93,526 271,469 BOE 246,344 199,401 Sales Price Realized Oil ($/Bbls) $ 41.99 $ 34.26 Impact of settled derivative instruments $ (4.78 ) $ 4.46 $ 37.21 $ 38.72 Realized Gas ($/Mcf) $ 3.69 $ 2.15 Expense per BOE: Lease operating expenses $ 26.89 $ 13.76 Production and property taxes $ 3.81 $ 3.76 Depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 6.06 $ 18.43 General and administrative expense $ 15.23 $ 14.42  The following table sets forth results of operations for the following periods:   Three months ended 3Q17 to 3Q16 31-Mar-17 31-Mar-16 change Oil sales $ 2,942,564 $ 960,705 $ 1,981,859 Gas sales 136,430 156,333 (19,903 ) Other liquids 9,987 9,580 407 Interest income 75 255 (180 ) Gain on derivative instruments 1,424,590 - 1,424,590 Other (174,923 ) 879,330 (1,054,253 ) Lease operating expense (1,986,860 ) (661,394 ) (1,325,466 ) Depletion, depreciation and amortization (404,893 ) (791,104 ) 386,211 Impairment - (49,126 ) 49,126 Exploration and evaluation expenditure (12,360 ) (21,399 ) 9,039 Accretion of asset retirement obligations (79,320 ) (15,353 ) (63,967 ) Interest expense (309,143 ) (207,650 ) (101,493 ) Loss on derivative instruments - (358,514 ) 358,514 Amortization of borrowing costs (66,849 ) (35,485 ) (31,364 ) Acquisition costs - (215,853 ) 215,853 General and administrative (1,284,076 ) (902,455 ) (381,621 ) Income tax benefit - - - Net loss $ 195,222 $ (1,252,130 ) $ 1,447,352   Nine months ended 3Q17 to 3Q16 31-Mar-17 31-Mar-16 change Oil sales $ 9,690,287 $ 5,281,528 $ 4,408,759 Gas sales 344,708 583,292 (238,584 ) Other liquids 36,560 38,127 (1,567 ) Interest income 352 2,457 (2,105 ) Gain on derivative instruments 379,442 214,055 165,387 Other 1,625,194 897,232 727,962 Lease operating expense (7,563,746 ) (3,492,564 ) (4,071,182 ) Depletion, depreciation and amortization (1,492,214 ) (3,674,347 ) 2,182,133 Impairment (244,480 ) (9,852,113 ) 9,607,633 Exploration and evaluation expenditure (36,905 ) (4,214,118 ) 4,177,213 Accretion of asset retirement obligations (235,381 ) (45,357 ) (190,024 ) Interest expense (1,275,791 ) (594,046 ) (681,745 ) Amortization of borrowing costs (200,547 ) (106,457 ) (94,090 ) Acquistion costs - (215,853 ) 215,853 General and administrative (3,750,748 ) (2,874,973 ) (875,775 ) Net loss $ (2,723,269 ) $ (18,053,137 ) $ 15,329,868  Comparison of Quarter Ended March 31, 2017 to Quarter Ended March 31, 2016 and for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 to the nine months ended March 31, 2016.  Oil and gas revenues  Oil revenues increased from $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $2.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as a result of the increase in the oil price and an increase in oil production. Oil production increased from 41,927 barrels for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 64,632 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was due to our Foreman Butte Acquisition which was completed in April 2016. This project added 64,049 barrels of oil to our production total for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to nil for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This increase was offset by the decrease in production associated with the sale of the North Stockyard project which was completed on October 29, 2016. The North Stockyard field contributed 92% of the revenue during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 compared to nil for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  The realized oil price also increased from $22.91 per Bbl for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $45.53 per Bbl (excluding the impact of derivatives) for the three months ended March 31, 2017 following a recovery in the global oil price.  Oil revenues increased from $5.3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 to $9.7 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, as a result of the increase in the oil price and an increase in oil production. Oil production increased from 154,156 barrels for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 to 230,756 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was due to our Foreman Butte Acquisition which was completed in April 2016. This increase was offset by the decrease in production associated with the sale of the North Stockyard project which was completed on October 29, 2016. The North Stockyard field contributed 90% of the oil revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 compared to 13% for the nine months ended March 31, 2017.  The realized oil price also increased from $34.26 per Bbl for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 to $41.99 per Bbl (excluding the impact of derivatives) for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 following a recovery in the global oil price.  Gas revenues decreased from $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Due to the timing associated with receiving gas revenue checks, approximately $0.1 million of gas revenue recognized in the March 2017 quarter, related to production periods prior to January 2017. The production associated with this revenue was 49,104 MCF.  This decrease in the revenue recognised for the current quarter is due to a decrease in gas production which has offset an increase in the realized gas price. Production decreased from 92,399 Mcf for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 to 58,209 Mcf for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in production was primarily due to the sale of the North Stockyard project area which was completed on October 29, 2016. The Foreman Butte Acquisition has not added significantly to the gas production as the wells in the acquisition area do not have a high gas content. The decrease in production was offset by an increase in the realized gas price from $1.69 per Mcf for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 to $2.34 per Mcf for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  Gas revenues decreased from $0.6 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 to $0.3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. This decrease is due to a decrease in gas production which has offset an increase in the realized gas price. Production decreased from 271,469 Mcf for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 to 93,526 Mcf for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in production was primarily due to the sale of the North Stockyard project area which was completed on October 29, 2016. The Foreman Butte Acquisition has not added significantly to the gas production as the wells in the acquisition area do not have a high gas content. The decrease in production was offset by an increase in the realized gas price which increased slightly from $2.15 per Mcf for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 to $3.69 per Mcf for the nine months ended March 31, 2016.  Sale of Assets  For the three months ended March 31, 2017 we recognized $0.2 million in sale costs following the completion of the post settlement reconciliation with the purchasers of the North Stockyard property. These expenses related to invoices received after the settlement of the sale but relating to time periods prior to the effective date of the sale.  For the nine months ended March 31, 2017, we recognized $1.6 million in income from sale of assets as a result of the sale of our North Stockyard property. As at the sale date, the value of the property was $13.7 million and $0.3 million in asset retirement obligation. The sale value of the property was $14.95 million and we recognized $1.6 million in income from sale of assets after taking into account costs associated with the sale.  Exploration expense  Exploration expenditures for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 were less than $22,000 for either quarter.  Exploration expenditures decreased from $4.2 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2016, to $0.04 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Exploration costs in the current period relate to general exploration expense. Exploration costs in the prior period related to previously capitalized exploration expenditure written off in relation to our Hawk Springs project in Wyoming and wells drilled in this project area. With the continued weak oil price, exploration expenditure has been significantly reduced. Leases have been let go as they expire or delay rental payments not made causing the leases to expire.  Impairment expense  During the three months ended March 31, 2016 we recognized $0.05 million in impairment expense compared to nil million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The impairment expense recognized in the prior quarter relates primarily to our Rainbow field and was driven by the sustained decrease in the oil price witnessed during the first quarter of 2016 calendar year.  During the nine months ended March 31, 2016 we recognized $9.8 million in impairment expense compared with $0.2 million in impairment expense for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. The impairment recognized in the current period relates to a write down in the value of oil inventory held on the balance sheet related to our accounting policy of the holding inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The impairment recognized in the prior period relates mainly to our North Stockyard property and was a result of the sustained decrease in the global oil price.  Lease operating expense  Lease operating expenses ("LOE") increased from $0.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, to $2.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Costs per BOE, excluding the impact of the workovers and production taxes were $16.56 a barrel. Costs have increased from $8.58 for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 due to increased salt water disposal costs in our Foreman Butte project area. The wells in the Foreman Butte project area are also older wells than those we have previously owned and require additional fresh water and hot oil cleanouts which increase in the operating costs of the wells. We are continuing to review our lease operating expenses and will shut wells in that are not economic to produce in the current oil pricing environment. We are also reviewing our salt water disposals options in order to ensure we are minimizing costs.  Lease operating expenses increased from $3.5 million for the nine months ended March, 2016 to $7.6 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 for similar reasons to those disclosed above for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Costs per BOE have increased from $13.76 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 to $26.89 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Excluding the impact of workovers, LOE and production taxes for the period ended March 31, 2017 was $21.52 per BOE.  Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense  Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense decreased from $0.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 to $0.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in depletion is a result of the increase in the reserve base over which depletion is calculated following the Foreman Butte Acquisition. The per BOE cost decreased from $13.8 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $6.12 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense decreased from $3.7 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 to $1.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in depletion is a result of the increase in the reserve base over which depletion is calculated following the Foreman Butte Acquisition. Depletion has not been charged on the North Stockyard assets, as is customary when assets are held for sale. The per BOE cost decreased from $18.43 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 to $6.06 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017.  General and administrative expense  General and administrative expense, excluding share based payments of $0.3 million, increased slightly from $0.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 to $1.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. We have been actively trying to reduce our general and administrative costs in recent periods. The BOE costs decreased slightly, excluding share based payments, from $15.74 for the . . .
