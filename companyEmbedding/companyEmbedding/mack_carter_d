Mack King Carter: The Voice And The Vision - tribunedigital-sunsentinel




 


 Home→Collections→Hand



Mack King Carter: The Voice And The VisionAugust 27, 1989|BY JONATHON KINGTHE VOICE HAS CAPTURED them again. It has raised three of them to their feet. It has forced one woman to her knees. Reverberating off the balcony facade, rebounding around the huge sanctuary, The Voice is barking and sonorous, rasping and liquid.Its owner, a short, stocky keg of a man, stands solidly before his audience, gripping the lectern like a captain at the wheel of his ship in a storm.``CHOOSE YOU THIS DAY!`` he shouts, letting the thunderous echo take its effect.The keeper of The Voice removes his eyeglasses and wipes the sweat from his face.``Choose you this day,`` he repeats.This time it is a barely audible plea, calculated to resemble a quiet thought in each listener`s head.``CHOOSE YOU THIS DAY WHOM YE WILL SERVE!`` explodes the Rev. Dr. Mack King Carter yet again.It is the Shechem Call, Joshua`s words to the tribes of Israel, and today it is the subject of Reverend Carter`s sermon.Carter is the proprietor of The Voice and the pastor of Fort Lauderdale`s Mount Olive Baptist Church. He is also a rarity. At 43, he is a black preacher who is called on by national politicians to mobilize his community and by network news shows to air his views.An example of his power from the pulpit blossomed three weeks ago after U.S. Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. called Carter to ask what could be done to combat drugs and crime in the black community.On Aug. 6, Carter stood with his fellow city pastors before hundreds of people massed in the streets of Fort Lauderdale to voice a citywide cry against the ravages of crack cocaine and drug abuse.The next night, more than 1,000 people packed Mount Olive to back Carter`s initiative. It was a most unusual town meeting, drawing Florida legislators and the regional heads of the Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Customs, the Coast Guard, the U.S. Attorney`s Office, federal judges, police chiefs, county commissioners and local mayors.The meeting also caught the attention of President Bush, who addressed the gathering by speaker phone from the White House.``Dr. Carter, I want to praise you for your work, and I hope that in the near future I will have the opportunity to personally shake your hand,`` Bush said.``I know of nowhere else in the United States where this has happened,`` Congressman Shaw says about the grass-roots gathering.``When we were trying to put this anti-drug project together there was just no other choice than to go to Dr. Carter,`` adds Shaw. ``His personal involvement ensured its success. He is tremendously influential and important to South Florida.``As the spiritual leader of the largest black congregation in South Florida, Mack Carter`s voice grows stronger.``Choose you this day whom ye will serve!``On this hot summer Sunday, Carter is bellowing the Shechem Call. It is one that he holds dearly, for his own answer to the call came long ago in tiny Ocala, Fla., and it is the reason he stands where he does today.IT WAS 1953. DWIGHT EISENHOWER HAD SWEPT the presidency from the Democrats. Brown vs. The Board of Education was on its way to the Supreme Court. In a few months a 24-year-old minister named Martin Luther King, Jr. would become pastor of a Baptist church in Montgomery, Ala.And sitting in an old Ford, wedged between his mother and grandmother was a 6-year-old boy taking the weekly ride from the family farm into Ocala to attend Sunday service.It was a special day for Mack Carter. This was the day he would become a member of the New Bethel Baptist Church. Four years later, at age 10, he would become New Bethel`s youngest deacon ever.``Basically, a 10-year-old deacon does whatever his pastor tells him, brother King,`` says Carter, recalling his early days as a church leader. It is the reverend`s habit to address everyone as ``brother.``Carter says that New Bethel`s pastor, Rev. A.D. Lonon, ``Saw something in me, even as a young kid, and really gave me a chance to develop my gifts.``I was brought up in the church. I am a product of the church. It has been my very life.``But the man who elicited a phone call from the president of the United States and was featured on network TV interviews during the 1988 Democratic National Convention did not gain his insight into politics, economics and world history in the pews of a small church in Ocala.One of the gifts the late Reverend Lonon saw in his young protege was an intellect bound for a higher calling.In 1965, after high school, Carter went on to the Central Florida Community College where he was an honors student, and then attended Florida Memorial College in St. Augustine.``It was during those early college years that I was called to my first church,`` Carter recalls. ``During my third year in college I was leading two congregations near Ocala.``When Florida Memorial moved its campus to Miami just before his senior year, Carter transferred to the University of Florida rather than abandon his congregations.1 | 2 | 3 |  Next
