Welcome to Maton Guitars
HANDMADE FOR THE WORLD STAGE








From a small backyard workshop started in 1946 Maton Guitars has grown into a truly great Australian success story. Currently Maton employs 60 people and remains 100 per cent family owned and operated.

From the initial selection and grading of rough sawn timber to the careful levelling and polishing of the frets, every step of the guitar making process is overseen by our luthiers in Melbourne Australia. It is their attention to detail that ensures that every guitar we produce deserves to bear the name Maton.
Maton Guitars is where some of the finest quality guitars in the world come to life, each with a unique character and tone. Every Guitar embodies the passion and skill of the craftsmen who are part of our team, each of them drawing on the years of experience and dedication necessary to produce a truly remarkable instrument.
Maton specialises in creating superbly crafted guitars from Australian timbers such as Blackwood, bunya, Queensland Maple, Queensland Walnut and now Satin Box. Bill May pioneered the use of many Australian wood species in guitar construction and is regarded by many Australian luthiers as the founding father of their industry. The Maton team are constantly investigating new materials and techniques in the pursuit of creating the world's finest guitars.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
