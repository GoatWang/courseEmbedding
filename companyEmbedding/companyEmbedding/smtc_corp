New Product Introduction




From Concept Design to Prototyping to Mass Production: Our Talent of Experience and Knowledge to the New Product Introduction Process
SMTC has formed New Product Introduction Technical Centers to compliment our strengths in engineering solutions, manufacturing solutions, supply chain solutions and transition management
SMTC provides a dedicated and focused approach to new product introduction and time to market. We provide fast-track processes for NPI purchasing and logistics. And these are combined with effective tracking and customer-focused progress reporting. Our procurement professionals are focused on collaborating with our customers and suppliers to reduce costs, accelerate their time to market and streamline their supply chain processes. Our integrated supply chain system differentiates SMTC, making us unique when it comes to design, delivery and after-market services. We understand and anticipate the product lifecycle. We ensure continuity of supply and always look for opportunities to reduce and avoid costs.
NPI is a vital cross-functional business process. It enables new products to be manufactured and addresses their entire lifecycle from conception to end-of-life.
SMTC New Product Introduction Solutions

Supplier/Component Selection, Qualification and Optimization
Product Development & Production Pricing Models
Design for Manufacturability & Test Strategy
Rapid Procurement & Rapid Proto-type Production

Our facilities use the same manufacturing equipment and systems, and follow the same standardized and controlled processes. The NPI team is focused on the timely transition of customer builds into production. This allows production to ramp up in a localized facility, then quickly transition to a higher volume, lower cost facility in Mexico or China. SMTC customers receive regular progress updates and have access to real-time performance metrics.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
