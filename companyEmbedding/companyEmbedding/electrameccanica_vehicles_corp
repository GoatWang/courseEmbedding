 From the Desk of Jerry Kroll			 July 2, 2017/0 Comments/in Blog /by adminSeveral major boxes have been checked so far this month.  Our Canadian production facility has completed and delivered our first customer car, with the next 4 (chassis 10-14) all lined up in various stages of completion.  We should deliver the next SOLO the first week of July, and then between 2 and 10 per month from then on.  As our C.O.O. Henry Reisner said, “This sounds like it’s an easy thing to do, just build a SOLO and deliver to customers, but it’s the culmination of years of effort by some of the most talented people in the world, and millions of dollars of resources to get the job done.  The result is spectacular.  You cannot buy a vehicle for this price anywhere in the world, ever, and get this level of happiness.  Not even close!  I’m not even aware of any product you can acquire for that amount of money that could do what SOLO does.”
The final proof, of course, will be in the comments coming from our customers, initially in British Columbia, who will be experiencing the SOLO in the real world using it as they commute, deliver, shop, cruise…whatever.
I’m so proud of our entire team!
Also, ElectraMeccanica Vehicles Corp. has just been granted our trading symbol “ECCTF” and will be listed on the OTCQB venture stock exchange in the United States; you can look it up online at www.otcmarkets.com. As I’m writing this CEO Update, they have not yet populated the filings and financials, and I’m told this will be done over the next 30-60 days.  Put the ticker symbol into your stock watcher, and join me in this exciting adventure.  Congratulations to our public company listing team, and the dozens of early investors who stepped up to make this dream come true.   Further information on our public company activity can be found on the “Investors” section of our website, or by emailing Sam Woolf in our Investor Relations department at IR@electrameccanica.com.
Our current SOLO reservation list now stand at 536 (not including industrial orders) and the Tofino is at 96.  New SOLO reservations can expect their deliveries in 2018 and the Tofinos in 2019.  Our President Mark West has initiated an ongoing SOLO Test Drive program at our Vancouver Headquarters, which you can book by emailing testdrive@electrameccanica.com.  There is a big electric car show here in Vancouver on July 15th, called “Electra Fest” where we’ll have hundreds of people completing test drives.  If you’re available, you can get more information at https://electrameccanica.com/event/electrafest-2017/.
I’d like to see our reservations top the 1,000 mark before the end of this year, and we’ve opened a special offer for those people who have made a reservation on ANY other kind of car, to email us an image of that reservation and we’ll honour it for a place in line for a SOLO, up to $1,000.00 Cdn.  How can you beat that??   Even if you put in a reservation for a DeLorean, and it never showed up, just email me a copy of that reservation and we’ll send you a matching one for a SOLO! reservation@electrameccanica.com.
As the US and Canadian federal compliance work for the SOLO continues along, and I expect to see it completed later this year. Once that happens, we’ll begin US deliveries, as well as opening SOLO stores in the US.  San Francisco and New York are very big targets for us, and we are planning some amazing events in the months to come.  Stay tuned for more information on my future updates.
Our next EMV Broadcast will be at 6pm PST on Monday July 3rd.  You can view via our Facebook page and submit your questions to me — no questions are off limits!  As always we’ll be giving away a beautiful “Mangia la Mia Polvere” t-shirt to the best question that day.
See you on the road!

admin2017-07-02 11:47:042017-07-02 11:48:30From the Desk of Jerry Kroll Electra Meccanica Delivers First Solo Vehicle			 June 22, 2017/0 Comments/in Blog /by adminNew Westminster, Canada, June 22, 2017 –(PR.com)– Electra Meccanica Vehicles Corporation delivered the first 2017 SOLO all-electric vehicle to proud new owners Leona and Matthew Green of New Westminster, British Columbia. The Greens plan to use their innovative and unique new SOLO for both daily commuting and for their successful local restaurant and catering delivery business. They own the popular Greens and Beans Deli Cafe and ordered the SOLO in British Racing Green to match with their name and the business. Watch the video of the delivery at the following link: https://vimeo.com/222425784.

“We love our new SOLO,” states Leona Green, Proprietor of Greens and Beans Cafe. “We park it in front of our business and you should see how much attention it gets.”
“We are thrilled to be able to deliver our very first SOLO to a family right here in the Vancouver area,” said Mark West, President of Electra Meccanica. “We think it fits perfectly with their local healthy food business as an attention-getting, environmentally-friendly vehicle with enough storage for all of their daily needs.”
The SOLO, an innovative all-electric commuter vehicle, made its world debut at Vancouver’s Luxury and Supercar Weekend in 2016 and is being produced at their Braid Factory in New Westminster, British Columbia. The SOLO’s unique design is powered by a 16.1 kWhs lithium ion battery and the drive system is tuned for both speed and mobility. With a range of 160kms (100 miles), and a top speed of 130kms/h (80 mph), the SOLO delivers superior performance and spirited driving.

admin2017-06-22 10:49:512017-06-22 10:49:51Electra Meccanica Delivers First Solo Vehicle Electra Meccanica CEO Update – May			 May 17, 2017/0 Comments/in Blog /by adminFinally, after years and years of planning, designing, building, organizing, and all the other things that go into an automotive launch, we will begin our first Vancouver area deliveries of our Electra Meccanica (EMV) SOLO!
We believe it is best to have the first group of cars close to our operations center so we can keep tabs on the vehicles and assure that our customer experience is everything it should be.  Our social media squad will also be kept busy with sightings and reactions to the various SOLO cars free-ranging in their natural habitat amongst traffic. Our SOLO reservation holders have been wonderfully supportive and patient as Henry Reisner and the team craft a car that will redefine how the world describes the word “automobile”. It’s a big job, and one that has been challenging and rewarding at the same time. We will keep everyone updated on the specific delivery dates, and customers will be contacted approximately 30 days prior to your delivery date.
For those who have yet to experience the SOLO, we are planning on having two “pre-production” SOLO cars available for a test drive experience close to our Vancouver-based production facility. This will be a good chance for our reservation holders who can make it in to have their first taste of actually driving the SOLO. My sales and marketing team will provide an exciting time for everyone (including the media guests) prior to taking the show on the road later this year. We’ll share photos and video on our website and social channels and we’ll also post an event schedule for the test drive road show, so stay tuned!
Our new Braid Street assembly facility open house in April was a big success, with guests joining us from all across North America. We should be able to produce up to ten SOLOs per month from this assembly line, and then replicate and scale up for the proper volumes we need to deliver the 500+ orders that we have on the books. I anticipate many, many more reservations coming from people who will be seeing our early adopters, advocates and owners — our SOLO pilots — enjoying your new rides. Our company’s success will ultimately be determined by our overall production volume within the next 12 months so I assure you we are working on some world-class plans for our current and future facilities!
This year’s Vancouver Auto Show was a big success for us with the media in attendance reporting that EMV “stole the show” with our exciting SOLO and SOLO R. On day 1 of the event, we also introduced our new all-electric convertible coupe called the Tofino. In less than a month after the reveal, we have almost 100 orders for this gorgeous and innovative sports car. The vehicle’s design and engineering team are progressing nicely and I hope to have something new to show you all by this September’s Vancouver Luxury and Supercar show, where we introduced the SOLO last year.
We have been running a path to complete our federal certification for the United States and Canada. The SOLO is scheduled to complete the required certification and compliance testing for US by the end of May. Following an additional 4 to 6 weeks of final compliance approval, we expect the vehicle to be certified for use nationwide. From there, we can begin expansion into U.S. markets with delivery of production-quality SOLOs. We can also begin with the implementation of SOLO intro stores in the US similar to those already established in the Vancouver area.
I hope you and your families are enjoying a pleasant spring, and getting ready to make the most of summer 2017. I’ll provide a further update again next month and don’t forget, we also have our regular live online updates at 6:00 PM PT on the first Monday of each month on our Facebook page. Details of that will continue to be emailed out to everyone as a reminder.
All the best,

admin2017-05-17 12:39:252017-05-18 10:00:54Electra Meccanica CEO Update - May Electra Meccanica Reveals Two New Vehicles at 2017 Vancouver Auto Show			 March 29, 2017/0 Comments/in Blog /by adminCompany shows off images of the Tofino all-electric roadster and displays the race-prepped SOLO R performance vehicle
(VANCOUVER, B.C.) – March 28, 2017 – Vancouver’s Electra Meccanica Vehicles Corporation (EMV) revealed two new vehicles at the Vancouver Auto Show today. The first is a vehicle called the “Tofino.” The Tofino is an all-electric, two-seat roadster representing an evolution of the classic Intermeccanica Roadster, an example of which can be seen in the EMV show stand. The other reveal vehicle on display is called the SOLO R which is a high-performance version of the SOLO electric car which debuted in September. Visitors to the show, which is being held at the Vancouver Convention Center from March 28 through April 2, can also see and experience the ground-breaking 2017 SOLO all-electric commuter vehicle.
 
“We are very proud to showcase our company, along with a couple extremely exciting new vehicles at our hometown show,” states Mark West, President of Electra Meccanica. “The passion behind these cars are a massive step-forward for our brand and they represent the best of what we can achieve from a performance standpoint. Vancouver auto show attendees and others around the world will not be disappointed.”
 
Designed by a world-class coach-building team from Intermeccanica with an all-electric drivetrain, the Tofino will provide a spirited and powerful driving experience. The vehicle will be hand-crafted with an evolutionary design nod to the popular Intermeccanica Roadster. In short, the Tofino will give you a classic car look with the technology from today. The electric custom coach sports car will be made with advanced components and its long-range electric motor will take you anywhere you want to go in exceptional comfort and style. The Tofino has remarkably good looks with the lightweight retractable hard top up or down — and it will have enough storage space for a weekend getaway or an adventurous cruise along the highways and backroads.
 

The Tofino is equipped with a high-performance, all-electric motor with a top speed of 200 kph (125 mph) and a 0-100 kph (0-60 mph) in under 7 Seconds. The chassis and body are made of a lightweight aerospace-grade composite and the car is capable of up to 400 km (250 Miles) of range on a full charge. The roadster will be available in five stunning colors including Titanium Silver, Electric Red, Raven Black, Arctic White, and Bionic Bronze with a suggested retail price starting at $50,000*. Estimated deliveries will begin by 2019 and interested individuals can make a $1,000* reservation for the Tofino at the show or by logging on to https://electrameccanica.com.
 
The SOLO R is a race-prepped performance variant of the innovative all-electric SOLO commuter vehicle, which made its world debut at Vancouver’s Luxury and Supercar Weekend in September. The SOLO R has a high-performance battery system mated to performance brakes, oversized wheels and racing slicks. All of the updates come courtesy of Electra Meccanica’s Advanced Performance team making the SOLO R a spec racer to be reckoned with on the road and on the track. More information on the EMV race program can be found at http://EMVRacing.com. Both the SOLO and SOLO R are being exhibited at the Vancouver Auto Show for the first time. Electra Meccanica is currently offering dealer opportunities and accepting fully-refundable $250* deposits for the SOLO which can be made at the show or placed online at https://electrameccanica.com.

*Plus taxes, subject to finalization upon delivery. Prices shown do not include any applicable taxes. All prices are in Canadian dollars. Financing available OAC. All specifications subject to change without notice

admin2017-03-29 09:40:002017-03-31 16:48:47Electra Meccanica Reveals Two New Vehicles at 2017 Vancouver Auto Show Electra Meccanica CEO Update			 March 17, 2017/0 Comments/in Blog /by adminMarch is a special month for Electra Meccanica, as it is the time for the famous Vancouver International Auto Show. Years ago, I had just got my drivers license, the day after my birthday on December 26th, 1976, and drove to the Pacific National Exhibition where the early editions of the Vancouver Auto Show were held during the holiday season. It was magical to drive the old 68 Beetle to the show all by myself, pay my three dollars to see the show and walk in like an adult and collect all the printed car brochures. I loved the new Bertone Fiat X-19, I was enchanted by someone who had made a recreation of the dark green Jaguar D Type with the vertical fin and leather strap over the bonnet, but I was mostly transfixed by an amazing orange Lamborghini Countach LP400 with white interior, on a raised eye level platform. I stood there with my mouth open in disbelief. Behind me stood a couple of older people, and one said to the other “Only an idiot would want a car like that”. I didn’t say a thing, but I’m certain that everyone reading this knows what I thought of THAT opinion!
Its that type of automotive magic that I’m reminded of each time we exhibit at the Vancouver Auto Show, and I wonder how many young people will walk down the aisle this year and see our exciting new 2017 Solo for the first time in real life, and become inspired in the same way that I was all those years ago! And we will have an inspiring display!
For the first time ever we will have the 2017 Electra Meccanica Solo on full Autoshow display for people to see, touch, sit in and order! First Solo deliveries are now planned for May, and with over 500 orders already on our books I expect new orders placed will deliver around July 2018 when we have our production lines ramped up. I can’t decide if we should display an Electric Red, Arctic White, Raven Black or Titanium Silver one. Send in your vote for your favourite!
As a special treat to everyone, we will also have our amazing bright green Solo R racing vehicle on display, with acclaimed race driver Scott Hargrove making autograph appearances throughout the show. You will see some amazing video of Scott putting the Solo R through its paces, to demonstrate the performance capabilities of the Solo as well as to develop technologies for the future of the car.
As if THAT was not enough!! I’m excited to say that we will have a VERY exciting announcement about our next EMV car, Code named “TOFINO”. You will have to wait until opening day of the Autoshow to find out what it is, but I’m here to tell you that our development team has created a true dream machine. When you see it, you will understand!

If you’re in the Vancouver area during the show, please come visit the team March 28th to April 2. Our social media team will be excited to see your posts and pictures at our booth. Best photo will win a legendary EMV “Mangia la Mia Polvere” t-shirt, autographed by Henry and myself! A keeper!!
For those of you not able to be in Vancouver during the show, because you live in Europe, Australia, China, Japan or some other far away place, I want you to know that our President Mark West is working hard to open new Solo stores in all areas. The first store opened in Vancouver three weeks ago, the next store in Richmond BC will open in April, with 23 more slated still for this year! Could a Solo store open in your town? Let’s see!!
Next month will bring more details on our pending public company stock listing, which will be an indicator of how well our cars and business plan are being received by investors around the world. I believe that Solo is the car that Tesla WISHES it would have built, as the amazing electric car that everyone can afford, like a Beetle for the 21st Century. We will soon find out if I’m right or wrong!
 
Until next month, I’ll see you in the HOV lane!
 
Sincerely,
Jerry Kroll, CEO

Please visit our Facebook site for videos and more images from the event.
Vancouver, British Columbia – February 15, 2017 – Electra Meccanica Vehicles Corp., (EMV), a Canadian-based designer and manufacturer of the SOLO, an all-electric single passenger vehicle developed to revolutionize the way people commute, opened its first retail Intro Store today in downtown Vancouver. Located in Bentall Centre, the Intro Store welcomes interested customers to learn more about the SOLO, talk with EMV representatives and place their reservations.
Jerry Kroll, founder and CEO of Electra Meccanica explains, “Our stores will lay the groundwork for the distribution of the SOLO and serve as an introduction to the public of this unique, new clean energy vehicle. The stores also represent a blueprint for interested individuals who would like to own an Intro Store dealership.”
“Our business is expanding quickly and we will be working with our Intro Store operators to introduce new retail locations across North America and internationally,” added Mark West, President of Electra Meccanica. “Located in high foot-traffic locations, our Electra Meccanica stores are designed to engage and inform customers and show the benefits of driving electric.”
Developed by Electra Meccanica, the SOLO is the first all-electric, single-seat vehicle designed to reduce traffic congestion, air pollution and vehicle operating costs. The SOLO has been engineered as a perfect vehicle for the more than 80% of drivers who commute and drive less than 50 km/36 miles per day as a single occupant. It can comfortably achieve highway speeds and has a 160 km/100 mile range on a full charge, making it the ideal supplementary vehicle that is also fun to drive. Available in four stunning colors: Titanium Silver, Electric Red, Raven Black and Arctic White, the SOLO retails at CAD$19,888 (approx. USD$15,500) and with various incentives and rebates, it is the most affordable EV in the market.

admin2017-02-16 07:30:152017-02-16 10:03:25ELECTRA MECCANICA OPENS FIRST SOLO INTRO STORE IN DOWNTOWN VANCOUVER CEO Report, February 2017			 February 8, 2017/0 Comments/in Blog /by adminI have just returned from China, where I toured the future home of our SOLO manufacturing facilities. We will initially use these facilities for mass production of parts — and eventually for complete cars beginning later this year and into 2018. Our Canadian production facilities in Vancouver are great, but they don’t have the capacity to fulfill the growing number of orders we will need to produce in a timely fashion, or the ability to ship them around the world in a cost-effective way.
 
I have always been impressed by the efficiencies and scale of manufacturing in Asia, and our partners are some of the best on the planet. They have world-class quality control standards and a reputation for making some of the best vehicles for very large and well-known global motoring companies. It’s also encouraging to see the enthusiasm being applied now to clean energy vehicles — and in particular to the SOLO — as a way of disrupting the harmful effects of fossil fuel vehicles. Not only do governments “get it”, but also now industry, consumers and investors are making this a priority in their decisions. We have truly passed a tipping point towards the closing down of harmful carbon emissions from fossil fuel.   There are STILL some naughty companies coercing governments to allow for new fracking and pipelines, but even they can see the writing on the wall.
 
We are nearing the end of our initial pre-production run of ten SOLOs, and have been sorting out the build procedures and, once complete, I am looking forward to making the first customer deliveries soon. If all goes to plan, we will begin delivering the first of our pre-orders locally, likely around the time of the Vancouver Auto Show which runs from March 28-April 2. Once we have a number of customer cars happily driving around the Vancouver area, we’ll start sending them further afield and out of the country.   I’m happy to say that our US Compliance Certification continues to move along and we will announce the results in due time.
 
Our Advanced Performance Division is working hard on our amazing SOLO R race car for its upcoming debut in Silicon Valley. We’ll have a private test at one of my favourite race tracks, and provide video and details to you on the results of this first running.   We’re targeting the third week of March for this, so brace yourself! Not only will it be fast, it’ll look amazing. That’s what racing is all about, right? We may even consider making the SOLO R race car available to select clients who have the appropriate racing license.   Noisy race tracks are one of the biggest problems in the industry, and SOLO is the ultimate solution. Now let’s see if it can pass the cars that currently make up the grids!
 
Our SOLO orders from individuals have now eclipsed 450. We’ve introduced a new program for people who have standing deposits on other cars. The program allows those people to send their current deposit receipt to us and we’ll credit the full amount of the receipt towards the purchase of a SOLO. You can check out SmallEV.com for more details. We still also accept $250 as a fully refundable deposit on any one of the four colours of EMV SOLO. Silver is now the most popular colour ordered, with red and white close behind. We’ll soon have a full running example of the SOLO in black when our pre-production #6 car is finished, and we’ll get our marketing team to post images on our website and social media channels when ready. Kind of like a one person electric Batmobile!!
 
February will see us opening up our first two SOLO Intro Stores in the Vancouver area, which will be replicated around the world. I’m excited about getting the cars in front of people in high traffic areas. It’ll create awareness and provide a platform for how best to stage future SOLO dealerships and retail outlets.
 
Speaking of high traffic, please make plans to visit us at the Vancouver Auto Show, which will take place at the Trade and Convention Centre from March 28-April 2. I hope to display the freshly tested SOLO race car, one or two shiny new SOLOs, and of course the SOLO chassis so people can see the magic that happens underneath the cool SOLO exterior. I should be there every day, along with the rest of our SOLO team. Show hours and other details will be posted on the EMV website over the next few days, and make sure to sign up for the EMV newsletters.   Much, much more to come in the next few weeks and months!
 
See you soon!

Aside from having a blast in the SimRaceway school cars, I had a chance to drive a gasoline powered Mercedes-Benz rental from Hertz. I don’t usually drive gasoline cars, so this gave me a chance to experience what today’s gas cars are like and compare it to our own SOLO electric car.
The weirdness of having a gasoline motor being turned on and idling is the first reminder that we’re back in the 1900’s. There was a small “battery” logo on the dashboard that would charge up instantly and fully under any braking, and then drain instantly on acceleration. The other annoying thing was the internal combustion engine stopping and starting at every traffic light. How do people find THAT pleasant? I enjoy my analogy of gasoline cars being like fax machines, and electric cars being the internet. I’m more convinced of that now than ever.
And speaking of racing, you can expect some interesting activity early in the new year as the Electra Meccanica (EMV) “Advanced Performance Team” takes to the track with our first few Racing SOLOs. To me, this is the best way to both develop our road car technology, AND to showcase the SOLO performance envelope. I was twenty seconds a lap off the times of race prepared cars in the street stock SOLO, so with some tweaking, racing slicks and some other top secret tweaks, I would suggest you don’t put your Ferrari out there with us until after you’ve seen a few passes! The Racing SOLO team will be introduced at a trade event early in the new year.
The busiest department currently at Electra Meccanica is our production team, who have settled into our newly expanded production facility in New Westminster, British Columbia. I’ve driven the first pre-production SOLOs, one of which has gone to complete US Federal compliance and certification testing. I expect us to complete pre-production by the end of the year and get right into production for those of you who are eagerly awaiting your cars. They perform wonderfully, and are super eye-catching in traffic. Our marketing team is looking forward to taking photos of all of you as you get your keys and drive off in your new SOLO and so am I.
2017 will likely be the most profound year in the history of Electra Meccanica. So much work has been done, so much is ready to roll out in the way of cars, dealerships and general corporate development. Lots of work ahead, and I’m excited by what we’ll do and where we’ll be in December 2017.
We have booked EMV to be at the Vancouver Auto Show from March 27th to April 2nd, and we’ll announce other exhibits around the world as they are confirmed. On behalf of everyone at Electra Meccanica, I sincerely thank you for your interest and support, and I look forward to meeting you in person in the new year–and watching your first drives in your very own SOLO!!
Happy Holidays and the best for 2017,
Jerry Kroll, CEO
ElectraMeccanica Vehicles Corp.
