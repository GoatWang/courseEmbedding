Over 30 Years of Edgebanding Experience











Edge Banding Supplies


With 30 years of experience in the edge banding wholesale industry, it has enabled us to build solid working relationships with many edge tape distributors and extruders located throughout the world. This translates into PRI’s UNIQUE ability to source the edge banding supplies you need, in the time frame you want. We can even ship same day if you need it.
The Benefits of Working with PRI for Your Edgebanding Needs
1. PRI is able to offer the most attractive pricing in the industry because our extrusion plant enjoys lower overhead compared to our competitors. This is due to superior state of the art production equipment, a very fast line speed and large capacity with our present 6 extruders
2. PRI can offer low production minimums and short lead times which often can be extremely advantageous in servicing your needs. Our standard lead time for production orders is two weeks or less.
3. We are able to offer grain through as well as surface print on our thick edgebanding.
4. Flexible 3mm banding is also available
5. Most Melamine and HPL colors have already been matched and are readily available
6. Gloss pricing is the same as other textures
7. We offer rush orders (3 days or less) and below normal minimum order quantities with the lowest upcharges in the industry
8. The upcharge to produce ABS as opposed to PVC is far less than charged by other extruders
9. PRI maintains stock of several million feet of edge banding in our Chicago area warehouse that is available for same day shipping. This includes a multitude of colors, textures, sizes and thicknesses
10. PRI has access to a variety of other edge banding stocking programs which can save time, effort and cost when you need to search for a specific immediate need
11. With more than 30 years of specializing in edgebanding sales and production, PRI is in a position to provide technical assistance on all matters related to our industry.
As a client of PRI, you’ll enjoy our purchasing power and the best edge band material pricing in the industry. The savings doesn’t stop at a single order. Our industry relationship means the manufactures will assist PRI in developing stocking programs for your business. PRI can ship to you from its own inventory, or work with the distributors and manufactures to ship directly from their stock.
The bottom line is, you get what you want, when you want it, with unmatched savings. As you work with PRI we can track what you order and build a stocking profile that insures your future orders are on hand and available. Wether its just regular colors like white, black, silver, grey, blueberry, chocolate… all the way to custom edge tape matchs we got you covered.

The Best Travel Apps of 2015


More





Kayak 

Free
Travel search website Kayak.com is one of my favorite sites for finding the best deals on flights, especially when I'm picky about the details: what time to leave, number of layovers, and which airlines I can use. In its early days, Kayak only handled search (although it was one of the best at that end of the game), but now you can prepay for flights, hotel reservations, and even car rentals. Additionally, Kayak includes in its searches other aggregation services, like Orbitz and Priceline, to truly make sure you find the best deal.
Available on: Android, iOS, Kindle Fire, Windows Phone, Web

  

Maps.Me
Free
The Maps.Me mobile app lets you browse around the globe, zoom in on any region or city, and download a detailed map of that area to use offline. You'll see an option to download just the map or the map with directions enabled to get you from point A to B without an Internet connection. What I like about Maps.Me is the great level of detail on maps for lesser traveled places, such as Freetown, Sierra Leone (shown), which isn't well mapped by Google Maps. It's a must-have travel app for those who wander off the beaten path.
 Available on: Android, Amazon Fire, BlackBerry, iOS

  

MenuPages
Free
When on road trips, you can often find restaurants nearby using Google Maps or Yelp, but you can't always see how much the food costs or what's on the menu. MenuPages fills in those gaps, telling you whether a cup of coffee is going to run you a dollar or an arm and a leg. Even when menus are rotating, MenuPages gives you a sample menu from a previous day. It's a great travel tool, currently covering New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, South Florida, and Washington, D.C.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

OpenTable
Free
Snag a dinner reservation in less than a minute with the OpenTable app. OpenTable is pretty widely used in major cities in the U.S. and Canada, as well as in London. It lets you find restaurants that meet your criteria, see opening times, read reviews, and make reservations online at no charge. It's a great restaurant resource when you're in any city, but especially while traveling.
Available on: Android, Amazon Fire, BlackBerry, iOS, Web, Windows Phone

  

Orbitz Flights, Hotels, Cars

Free
Orbitz Flights, Hotels, Cars searches for the best travel deals, lets you book them, and offers a price guarantee if another user books the same travel as you for less. Orbitz's app is the kind that anyone would want for planning a trip ahead of time to find low prices, as well as last-minute bookings from the road.
Available on: Android, iOS, Kindle Fire, Web

  

Packing Pro

$2.99
Packing Pro is a mobile app made for list makers. It helps you remember what to pack and can also serve as evidence of what you packed if your luggage were ever lost. It has plenty of sample lists of items to pack for different types of travel, or you can create your own and tick off items as they go into your luggage. The $3 app may seem like overkill to those who have packing down to a science already, but it can be an excellent tool for parents who are packing for multiple family members before leaving on vacation.
Available on: iOS

  

Roadtrippers
Free
Tell Roadtrippers your starting location and destination, dates of travel, and what kinds of things you're interested in finding along the way, and this app will plot your journey for you. Roadtrippers can find offbeat attractions, restaurants, museums, amusement parks, camp sites, and more. When you find a site you like, just add it to your trip, and Roadtrippers will redraw your travel map accordingly.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

Roomer Travel
Free
We all know we can save a good deal of money by booking hotels in advance. The problem, especially on road trips, is that we don't always get to the destination in time for the reservation, and if you've paid ahead, you're out of luck. Not so if you use Roomer. This app and website (roomertravel.com) helps travelers sell their prepaid reservations to people who can use them to recoup some of that otherwise lost cost. If you need a hotel in a pinch, you can also see if anyone on Roomer is trying to offload a hotel room in your desired location. Everyone wins.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

SkyScanner
SkyScanner's mobile app has such a Free
wonderful search interface for finding cheap flights. I love that you can look for a flight on certain dates from your home airport to anywhere in the world based on where it might be inexpensive to fly during that time. You can then adjust your search using a wonderfully intuitive and interactive graph to find the cheapest surrounding dates to travel. SkyScanner partners with a site called ebookers.com for the actual sale, and note that SkyScanner's prices appeared for me in U.S. dollars while ebookers' showed up in GBP. The company makes separate apps for hotel and car rentals.
Available on: Android, BlackBerry, iOS, Windows 8, Windows Phone, Web

  

TripAdvisor
Free
TripAdvisor is one of the most best online sources for travelers, particularly because it has in-depth reviews of hotels, restaurants, and sites to see. Photos uploaded by other users are also helpful for getting a glimpse of a place from an unbiased point of view. TripAdvisor is one of the richest resources you'll find because it has a huge and active community.
Available on: Android, iOS, Nokia, Windows Phone, Web

  

TripCase

Free
TripCase is a free app that helps you organize your itineraries. You use the app by forwarding confirmation emails from travel services to a special address. TripCase then pulls the most important information from those confirmation emails and arranges them into a day-by-day or even hour-by-hour summary of your trip. It's very similar to the next app in this list (TripIt), except that TripIt pulls information directly from your email account while TripCase relies on you sending it along.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

TripIt

Free
TripIt is a mobile app for Android and iPhone that connects to your email accounts and automatically compiles your travel information based on confirmation emails you receive. TripIt finds the important details for flights, hotels, rental car reservations, and even restaurant bookings, then collates them in order into an itinerary. If you worry about not having all your details in one place, TripIt is a wonderful travel organizer.
Available on: Android, BlackBerry, iOS, Windows Phone

  

Tripomatic

Free
Tripomatic helps you plan what to do and see on your next trip, and on which days. You can use it in advance of your trip to put together a daily agenda, or use it on the spot to find sites to see, a cafe to have coffee, or restaurant in which to eat. Tripomatic has more than thousands of attractions listed in hundreds of destinations. The app syncs with the website Tripomatic.com, so you can tinker with your itineraries on a full sized screen if you prefer. Many of the top destinations have offline content, such as maps, photos, and visitors guides.
Available: Android, iOS

  

Triposo
Free
Driving through the desert or deep into mountains, you can't be sure you'll have Internet access. Triposo puts offline maps and travel guides onto your phone so you can use them even in dead zones. Before you download maps and guides for any destination, Triposo tells you how much space they will take up on your phone, too. When you pull up a destination on Triposo, it offers top sightseeing suggestions, a weather forecast, and more ways to explore the destination.
Available on: Android, iOS

  

TV Food Maps
Free
A friend turned me onto TV Food Maps after she raved about its value on her last big U.S. road trip. This interactive app and website finds restaurants and eateries that have appeared on various television food shows, such as Bizarre Foods American, Top Chef, $40 a Day, Restaurant Impossible and (groan) Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. What could be more American than eating your way through a road trip?
 Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

Uber
Free
Getting around a foreign city can be a royal pain, especially if you don't speak the language, don't have any currency, or don't know the etiquette rules for tipping or haggling. Uber eases all these pains and others. With this car service app, you can request a car and tell the driver where to pick you up by dropping a pin on a map. The app gives you a fare estimate for a ride to your destination, and the driver can see it on the map, too. When your ride is over, Uber charges your credit card the right amount, and you don't have to tip. Uber is worldwide, with service more than 50 countries.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web (mobile browser required)

  

 Viator
Free
Looking to save some money but still do some interesting site-seeing? Viator shows you deals and discounts either nearby or in the place you're going to visit next--provided that location is in Viator's list of potential cities, regions, and countries. It's great for ideas of what to see and do, especially when you're feeling clueless, although the quantity and quality of the deals varies dramatically by place.
Available on: Android, iOS

  

Wanderu
Free
If you don't drive but want to take a road trip, try Wanderu. This app and website is a search aggregator and price comparison tool for bus and train tickets. Enter the dates you want to travel, plus your beginning and ending point, and Wanderu will look for fares on Amtrak, Greyhound, MegaBus, Bolt Bus, TrailwaysNY, BestBus, and other bus and train carriers.
 Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

Waze
Free
Waze is a community-driven app for traffic and other information about the road, including police speed traps, potholes, and accidents. While Google Maps tells you about major reported road problems, Waze knows the nitty-gritty. You can even see the speeds at which cars are traveling in congestion. In cities, it's popular among taxi and car service drivers, but it's equally useful on highways. Beware, though: Waze needs to use your location information all the time, even in the background, which will take a toll on your battery.
Available on: Android, iOS, Windows Phone

  

Yelp

Free
The beauty of Yelp, an app that offers user-generated recommendations for businesses, is that it's used widely by a lot of people. If you show up at a destination and want to find a decent cup of coffee within walking distance, Yelp will probably do the best job. While some other travel apps have plenty of recommendations from other travelers, Yelp is more likely to be used by locals. It's especially good with restaurants, but Yelp can also help you find auto repair shops, health clinics, and other places you might need to visit unexpectedly while on a trip.
Available on: Android, BlackBerry, iOS, Web, Windows Phone

  How it works







            A community built on sharing
          

            Airbnb began in 2008 when two designers who had space to share hosted three travelers looking for a place to stay. Now, millions of hosts and travelers choose to create a free Airbnb account so they can list their space and book unique accommodations anywhere in the world.
          










                Profiles
              

                No two hosts or travelers are the same, so personal Airbnb profiles help hosts and guests learn more about each other before sharing a space. Airbnb doesn't display full names or contact information on public profiles, so the community can feel confident that their information is safe.
              



                Listings
              

                From futons on the floor to castles on the hilltop, each Airbnb listings is unique. Search results feature entire homes, private rooms, and shared rooms at every price point. Hosts describe their space in detail, including available amenities and arrival and departure times, and guests leave reviews about their experience.
              



                The Community Center
              

The Community Center is a place to connect with other hosts, share stories, ask for advice, and get updates from the Airbnb team. You can also plan or join meetups.
              











            Trusted services
          

            Airbnb helps make sharing easy, enjoyable, and safe. We verify personal profiles and listings, maintain a smart messaging system so hosts and guests can communicate with certainty, and manage a trusted platform to collect and transfer payments.

                Airbnb puts hosts and travelers at ease with features like Verified ID and public reviews. Having a Verified ID indicates that you've completed a specific set of verifications—offline ID, online ID, profile photo, email address, and phone number. Hosts and guests also build trust and cultivate their reputations by writing reviews about their experiences after each trip.
              



                Messaging
              

                Our messaging system ensures that communication between hosts and guests stays on Airbnb so your contact information remains private until you have a confirmed reservation. For your peace of mind, we've added reporting features so you can easily notify us if you ever feel uncomfortable.
              



                Payment System
              

                Our convenient payment system supports many currencies and several types of payment and payout methods. Airbnb collects guest payments from the moment they make a reservation and waits until 24 hours after arrival before releasing funds to the host. This way, guests and hosts can feel confident knowing that Airbnb will process and deliver payments when a reservation is honored.

  How to travel







            Search
          

            Airbnb hosts share their spaces in 190 countries and more than 34,000 cities. All you have to do is enter your destination and travel dates into the search bar to discover distinctive places to stay, anywhere in the world.
          










                Tools that help you search
              

                We display photos of listings, host profiles, and reviews to help you make informed decisions when considering a host's space. We've also created search filters so you can narrow your results by type of accommodation, price, and location. For example, if you’re looking to make friends and stay with a host, select Private Room or Shared Room. Or if you’re looking for an entire space to call your own, go ahead and select the Entire Place filter.
              



                Contacting hosts to book a stay
              

                Once you complete your profile to give hosts a good idea of the kind of guest you are, you can request to book a host's space by clicking the Contact Host or Request to Book buttons, or you can use  Instant Book to confirm your stay without having to wait for a host's approval.
              











            Book
          

            There are a few ways to book spaces on Airbnb. Some hosts want to get to know a guest before they confirm a reservation while others prefer to reduce the time it takes to manage requests by using Airbnb's Instant Book feature.
          










                Buttons to book a stay on Airbnb
              

                The Request to Book button sends a reservation request to a host for the specific trip dates you select. The host has the option to either accept or decline the request, or ask you questions about your trip. When a host responds to your request, we send you an email to let you know. If they don't respond within 24 hours, your request simply expires.
              

                The Instant Book button immediately confirms your reservation and closes the host's calendar to other incoming requests. We send you a receipt by email with your trip's details, and your host may follow up with you, too.
              

                The Contact Host button lets you start a conversation about their space and hosting style through our secure messaging system. You can use our messaging system to discuss trip details, request special prices, or ask about specific amenities.
              



                Payment and confirmation
              

                Whether you use the Request to Book button or the  Instant Book button, we'll ask for your payment details so we can hold your reservation.
              

                If you use the Request to Book button to send a request, the host has 24 hours to respond. We won't charge your payment method until the host accepts your reservation. Once the host accepts, we process your payment and send you a congratulatory email that includes your receipt, trip details, and best wishes for a great trip. If you don't hear back within 24 hours, your request automatically expires.
              

                If you use the Instant Book button, your reservation will be immediately confirmed and we'll process your payment right away.
              











            Travel
          

            Once you know where you’re traveling and whose space you'll be staying in, all you have to do is get going!
          










                Before you get there
              

                Send a message to your host to arrange a check-in time and arrival details like picking up the key. Then  download the Airbnb app  so you can stay in the know while on the go.
              

                We'll send you an email that includes your trip itinerary, receipt, and host contact information. You can also view your reservation details, alter your plans, or cancel your reservation from the My Trips section on your personal account page.
              



                During your trip
              

                We encourage you to have the time of your life! Enjoy your host's home and city as if it were a friend's, and remember to be considerate of your neighbors. If any issues arise during your trip, be sure to get in touch with your host. In most cases, they'll be the person best equipped to help you. If your host can't solve the problem, please  contact us.
              



                After you travel
              

                Write a review about your host and their space so other travelers can learn through your experience. Your host will also have a chance to write a review for you, too. Then, pick the next place you'd love to go and find a space on Airbnb!
