The table below reflects the performance of all active PE partnership investments as of September 30, 2016. At the end of each quarter, the General Partners report on the value of invested capital. The General Partners have 120 days to provide Limited Partners with financial data, so there is generally a 2-quarter delay in performance reporting.

Not Meaningful: Funds with a vintage year of 2012 or later are in the initial stages of their investment life cycle. Any performance analysis done on these funds would not generate meaningful results as private equity funds are understood to be long-term investments.
Partnership investment is using a cash adjusted market value.

Overview

Asset classes are a result of a period strategic asset allocation process and approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration.
CalPERS' investment portfolio is diversified into several asset classes.
Strategic asset allocation is the dominant determinant of portfolio risk and return; a well-diversified portfolio shapes our long-term performance, protects the Retirement Fund, and ensures any weaknesses in one area are offset by gains in another.
To review the specific asset and investment types available for investment proposal submissions, including submissions documents and other items related to the proposal process, visit Investment Proposal Submission.
