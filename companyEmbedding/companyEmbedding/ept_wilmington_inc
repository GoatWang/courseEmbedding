Quality Certifications
Quality Certifications
Close
Quality Certifications are issued to suppliers by an accredited third party, verifying that the supplier complies with 
		established quality standards.Quality standards are usually documents written by developing bodies such as the International 
		Organization for Standardization (ISO) or trade organizations such as the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). Quality standards 
		are used to compare an organization to what the authorities say are best practices for a quality management system. Quality standards 
		can either be written in terms general enough to be used across any industry or written with requirements for a specific industry. 
		Industry specific quality standards may be written with the help of experts in that industry.
