Exhibit 99.2
 
 

DESCRIPTION OF DUE DILIGENCE PERFORMED
 
(1) Type of assets that were reviewed.
AMC Diligence, LLC (“AMC”) performed certain
due diligence services described below on small balance commercial mortgage loans. The review was conducted on behalf of Residential
Credit Opportunities II, LLC (“Client”) from July 2015 through October 2016 via files imaged and provided by Client
(the “Review”).
 
(2) Sample size of the assets reviewed.
All 948 loans were reviewed by AMC.
 
(3) Determination of the sample size and computation.
Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC (“Morningstar”),
who is the only NRSRO providing a rating on the transaction at the time of this disclosure, does not have published guidelines
for this asset class; however, diligence was performed on 100% of the securitization population.
 
(4) Quality or integrity of information or data
about the assets: review and methodology.
AMC collected data fields during the course of the
review and compared it to the tape provided by the Client. The data reconciliation, where such information was available, involved
twelve (12) potential fields as listed below:
 


Property Address
Original Rate
Original Purchase Price
Original LTV

Origination Date
Original Balance
Occupancy
Original DSCR

Maturity Date
Original Appraisal Value
Credit Scores
Borrower

 
(5) Origination of the assets and conformity to
stated underwriting or credit extension guidelines, standards, criteria or other requirements: review and methodology.
AMC reviewed asset origination to determine conformity
to the stated underwriting or credit extension guidelines, standards, criteria or other requirements that were provided to AMC
and/or as directed by Client. The credit review focuses on the borrower’s experience in property rehabilitation, credit profile
and adherence to guidelines. The borrower’s assets were analyzed to determine whether there were sufficient funds for necessary
repairs and the required equity in the project. Conformity to applicable guidelines was also assessed during the review.
 
Credit Application 
AMC verified that the application: (i) was signed
by all listed borrowers, (ii) was substantially filled out, (iii) contained all known borrower-owned properties on the Real Estate
Owned section or attachments, and (iv) contained information concerning the borrowers’ property management / landlord experience.
 
Credit Report 
AMC verified that a credit report was present for each applicable borrower
and gathered data from such credit report including (i) representative FICO, (ii) credit scores from Equifax, Experian, and Transunion
(if available), and (iii) the number and length of trade lines. In addition, AMC verified that any public records listed were disclosed
on the application and adequately explained and in

1| Page 
 
compliance with guidelines. Credit reports were not provided for Foreign
Nationals.
 
Employment and Income 
AMC determined whether applicable supporting employment
and income documentation required by the guidelines was present in the mortgage loan file. While AMC did not calculate a borrower
DTI, AMC did calculate a “Property DTI” per guidelines.
 
Documentation was also reviewed in order to verify
employment and income. This documentation included (i) monthly rental income information, (ii) property vacancy status, and (iii)
the presence of Articles of Incorporation. In addition, a reserve calculation was performed in accordance with the guidelines.
 
Asset Review 
AMC assessed whether the asset documentation required
by the guidelines was present in the mortgage loan file. AMC verified that assets presented by the Borrower(s) supported the proposed
renovations. Such assets included (i) depository account statements, (ii) stock or security account statements, (iii) settlement
statement(s) or other evidence of conveyance and transfer of funds (if a sale of assets was involved), and (iv) operating accounts
from other properties.
 
Insurance
AMC reviewed insurance information in the file to verify (i) the presence
of Rent Loss insurance equal to six (6) months, (ii) that hazard insurance meet the minimum required amount of coverage in the
guidelines, and (iii) that flood insurance certification was for the correct borrower, property, lender and loan number and was
a “Life of Loan” certification. For properties in a flood zone per the flood certification, AMC confirmed that flood
insurance met guidelines requirements (including coverage amount).
 
Title 
AMC verified whether the appropriate vestee was on
the title document (if a purchase, the seller; if a refinance, the borrower) and reviewed the Title Commitment for the disclosure
issues such as assessments; covenants, conditions and restrictions; access problems; the vicinity of property to military airports;
prior leases; court orders/divorce decrees; public probate issues; foreclosures; bankruptcies; judgment liens; state and federal
tax liens; and environmental liens. AMC’s review looked for instances of delinquent taxes (non-liens) and the presence of
oil, gas, water, or mineral rights.
 
(6) Value of collateral securing the assets: review
and methodology.
AMC reviewed the appraisal included in the loan file
for the following information: (i) property type, (ii) age of appraisal, (iii) verification of the property address, (iv) completeness
and appropriateness of the appraisal form, (v) the analysis of demand, supply, and marketing time as contained in the appraisal,
(vi) property values, (vii) appraiser comments regarding lot size, zoning, and well and septic conditions as well as legal use
restrictions, (viii) a comparable sales analysis including age, distance, and adjustments, (ix) property age, (x) predominate market
value, and (xi) a quality and condition ratings. In addition, AMC sought to verify the licensing of the appraiser, if possible.
 
AMC did not perform a secondary valuation review;
however, AMC has been informed that such a review was performed.
 

2| Page 
 
(7) Compliance of the originator of the assets
with federal, state and local laws and regulations: review and methodology.
AMC did not review residential mortgage compliance
on any loans within the securitization.
 
(8) Other: review and methodology.
In addition to the procedures above, AMC conducted
the following supplemental reviews:
 
Document Review
For each mortgage loan, AMC reviewed the loan file to verify whether the
following documents, if applicable, were included in the file and if the data on these documents was consistent and logical.
 


Initial Application
Hazard and/or flood insurance policies
Mortgage/Deed of Trust
Operating Agreement
Personal Guarantee

Credit Report
Appraisal
Note
Lease(s) and evidence of payment
 

Asset Documentation
Title / Preliminary Title
Certificate of Business Purpose / Non-Owner Occupancy
Landlord Experience
 

Sales Contract
Final HUD-1
Article of incorporation, if applicable
Fraud/OFAC reports
 

 
Compliance / Owner Occupancy Review
AMC reviewed the information contained in the mortgage file in order to:
(i) verify the presence, signature presence, and correct address of a business purpose certificate and non-owner occupancy declaration,
(iii) verify that the application and other supporting documentation (income/asset documentation, hazard insurance, license/passport/Visa,
credit report, certificate of non-owner occupancy declaration) lists a borrower’s address different from the property address,
(iii) verify that the appraisal states the property is tenant occupied or vacant, (iv) verify that the same person signed the application
and non-owner occupancy declaration, (v) verify the presence of insurance (hazard coverage plus liability coverage; landlord/rent
loss insurance) on the subject property, (vi) verify that the property appraisal contains a current rent / rental analysis, (vii)
for a refinance and if in the guidelines, verify that there is a lease on the subject property, (viii) verify the presence of rental
assignment language in the borrower contract, (ix) provide an indication whether the borrower is a renter or homeowner (if renter,
reasonableness review of whether borrower is occupying the property based upon factors above and proximity), and (x) if part of
the guidelines, confirm real estate landlord experience is present for the borrower (if not part of the guidelines, reasonableness
review of whether borrower is occupying the property based on factors above and other indications as reasonably appropriate).
 
Servicing Review
AMC conducted a collection comment review on sixteen (16) mortgage loans
that were seasoned greater than six (6) months but had exhibited a prior payment delinquency.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS OF REVIEW
AMC reviewed 948 mortgage loans in the securitization
population. Of these loans, eleven (11) mortgage loans had an exception related to credit items and/or guideline adherence.
 
CREDIT REVIEW RESULTS SUMMARY
AMC conducted a credit review on all 948 loans in
the securitization population. Eleven (11) mortgage loans were found to have exhibited a guideline exception; however, these exceptions
were waived by the Client. Of the eleven (11) exceptions, nine (9) were DSCR exceptions, one (1) was an exception related to aged
documentation, and one (1) was for items related to the reserves account.

Firms that offer loans to small-time landlords have been slow to tap the securitization market. So far there has only been one transaction with a public credit rating, in December 2016.  Yet bundling these loans into collateral for bonds provides attractive financing.Lima One Capital, which originated much of the mortgages backing the $114 million RCO 2016-SFR1 Trust, is passing the lower funding costs along to borrowers. The company is cutting the base rate on its rental product by nearly 2.41 basis points, to 4.99% from 7.4%

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
