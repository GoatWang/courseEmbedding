What I learned while working there was how to run 5-7 machine(lasers) that cut out parts called stents. Management was at its highest with the effort and cooperation of everyone around for the best and possible healthy environment. My co-workers were hard working and very helpful if I were to have any questions. The hardest part of the job was if you couldn't multitask and remember what you previously have done before you were working on another machine, then you would have had a hard time without the proper training. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and learning new things job related.ProsBig mess hallConsHuge parking lot(winter)Was this review helpful?Yes No Report Job Work/Life BalanceCompensation/BenefitsJob Security/AdvancementManagementJob CultureGreat place to work, Good chance of job advancementProduct Builder (Former Employee) –  Boston, MA – January 6, 2015Worked on medical supplies, assembly, and packaging.
