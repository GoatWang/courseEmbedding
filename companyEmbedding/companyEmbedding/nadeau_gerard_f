Gerard F. Nadeau - AIA Orlando              Gerard F. NadeauJuly 20, 2017 I have recently relocated to the Orlando area after 7 years teaching and practicing in southwest Missouri, but most of my professional development occurred in the Boston area, as a designer and project architect for residential, commercial and hospitality projects at small and medium size firms. I have excellent communication and interpersonal skills. My technical abilities bridge traditional and cutting-edge techniques for creating quality architecture suited to client needs and aspirations.I have designed, prepared CDs, and in most cases overseen the construction of projects that engage a broad range of issues and techniques, from working with historically sensitive urban sites and protected buildings, to minimizing energy consumption through innovative passive cooling strategies, to employing parametric/algorithmic modeling software to create singular architectural effects utilizing straight forward, cost conscious detailing. Fully interested and engaged in the technical issues of construction, I have collaborated on the design and coordination of building systems in virtually all of my projects. An obsessive craftsman and passionate designer across scales, I am highly attuned to the impact of details on the quality of space. As an architect, I welcome working closely with colleagues and owners, and with engineers, consultants, city officials and contractors to produce innovative designs representing thoroughly considered construction and functionality.I am technically versatile, having used a range of software in my years of practice and teaching, including Revit, AutoCAD, SketchUp and Vectorworks, but I specialize in Rhino+Grasshopper as powerful design tools for leveraging parametric and algorithm aided design workflows--coupled with computer aided manufacturing--to produce striking and cost effective contemporary designs.If you are interested in having me join your team, I would love to provide work examples and references upon request.Thank you for your interest and consideration!Gerard  GerardNadeau_Resume_Arch__2.pdf (303.1 KiB)Go backResources Post a JobPost a Resume
