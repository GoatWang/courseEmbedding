Led by Managing Partner Michael Lay, ONCAP has invested in 21 companies its 16-year history, and generated a gross return of 43 percent and a gross multiple of 5.2 times capital invested from realized and substantially realized investments. PE Hub Canada earlier this year reported about the launch of ONCAP IV, as well as the firm's most recent platform investment, Tecta America.

Most Influential Technology BlogsHow Does Big Data Affect IP Rights?By Larry AltonPatents are a good step towards shielding your IP data, but they’re not a seamless solution. Legal protection regarding intellectual property isn’t definite and has some holes in it. The constant stream of big data has made this problem even worse, obscuring the specifics about original ownership.

We are in the fast  pace of replacing manual human efforts with machines and process...Jul. 27, 2017 10:52 AM EDT  Reads: 112DX and Competitive Decision MakingBy Kevin BenedictThe winning trinity in competitive decision-making includes people, ideas and things according to the renowned military strategist John Boyd. Although competitive decision-making is not yet an Olympic sport, it affects us all.  Leaders (people) must become trained experts at using digital technologies to make fast decisions.  Leaders must use the right strategies and methodologies (ideas) to make ...Jul. 27, 2017 10:15 AM EDT  Reads: 383What Business Leaders Need to Know About MLBy William SchmarzoSometimes I write a blog just to formulate and organize a point of view, and I think it’s time that I pull together the bounty of excellent information about Machine Learning. This is a topic with which business leaders must become comfortable, especially tomorrow’s business leaders (tip for my next semester University of San Francisco business students!). Machine learning is a key capability that...Jul. 27, 2017 09:45 AM EDT  Reads: 454American Airlines Adopts Public Cloud ComputingBy Kevin JacksonDid you know that the reservations systems of the biggest carriers mostly run on a specialized IBM operating system known as Transaction Processing Facility (TPF). Designed by IBM in the 1960’s it was designed to process a large numbers of transactions quickly. Although IBM is still updating the code, the last major rewrite was about ten years ago.

The problem with this is the future is rarely like the past, and trying to fit new data into old paradigms often forces us to perform irrational mental gymnastics, which leaves us fart...Jul. 27, 2017 08:00 AM EDT  Reads: 421What Is Continuous Integration? By Automic BlogWith continuous delivery (CD) almost always in the spotlight, continuous integration (CI) is often left out in the cold. Indeed, it's been in use for so long and so widely, we often take the model for granted. So what is CI and how can you make the most of it? This blog is intended to answer those questions.
Before we step into examining CI, we need to look back. Software developers often work in...Jul. 27, 2017 08:00 AM EDT  Reads: 361Managing Your Hybrid CloudBy Kevin JacksonRunaway cloud computing cost may be causing an information technology industry crisis.

 All the World’s a Cloud
        All of Cloud Is at Cloud Expo!

 Cloud Computing - Big Data | Analytics - Internet of Things 
          Containers - Microservices - WebRTC - DevOps 


Join Us at the Javits Center in New York, NY, June 6-8 

          Cloud computing software is eating the world, and each day is bringing new developments in this world. 

          Yesterday's debate about public vs. private has transformed into the reality of hybrid cloud: a recent survey shows that 74% of enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy. 

          Meanwhile, 94% of enterprises are using some form of XaaS – software, platform, and Infrastructure as a Service.

          Big Data | Analytics and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) are driving exponentially increased demands on datacenters and developers alike, as we cross the zettabyte horizon this year.

          Containers and microservices are now part of every PaaS conversation, and IaaS providers are increasingly competing for platform customers. 

          WebRTC continues to reform web communications, and DevOps is pushing its way into an enterprise IT world that is increasingly agile, lean, and continuous.

          Through all this, Cloud Expo remains the single independent event where delegates and technology vendors can meet to experience and discuss the entire world of the cloud.

        Only Cloud Expo brings together all this in a single location: 
        
          •	Cloud Computing
            •	Big Data | Analytics
            •	Internet of Things
            •	Containers | Microservices
            •	WebRTC
            •	DevOps


        Cloud computing budgets worldwide are reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and no organization can survive long without some sort of cloud migration strategy. Each month brings new announcements, use cases, and success stories. 

          Cloud Expo offers the world's most comprehensive selection of technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100+ exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies. 

          The floor also features a Demo Theater that give delegates the opportunity to get even closer to the technology they want to see and the people who offer it. 

          Attend Cloud Expo. Create your own custom experience. Learn the latest from the world's best technologists. Talk to the vendors you are considering, and put them to the test.

          See you in New York!
