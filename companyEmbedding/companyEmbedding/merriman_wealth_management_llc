Who we are
Merriman was founded in 1983 as a fee-only investment advisory firm with a strong focus on excellent service, smart investing and long-term goals. We’ve grown significantly since then, and have also come to realize that investment advice is only a small piece of the puzzle.

 
 
 




Our process
To help our clients be truly successful in achieving their goals, we offer a comprehensive approach to wealth management that includes not only investment planning, but also encompasses taxes, estate planning, insurance, risk management, charitable giving and more.

 
 
 




How we think about investing
Investing is a sort of science. Our investment philosophy is grounded on decades of academic research, and relies on objective data rather than emotions and forecasts. Above all, we seek to balance return and risk considerations over longer-term time horizons.

When creating and monitoring a retirement plan, and providing advice on how to best achieve your financial goals, we often run into a roadblock on implementation when a large portion of your wealth is tied up in an employer retirement plan. This isn’t to say that...

Ask Merriman: SIPC Coverage
by Chris Waclawik  |  Jul 10, 2017  |  Ask Merriman, Chris Waclawik, Wealth Protection Q: Brokerage houses have additional insurance that covers certain events relative to my deposit. Should I be concerned when the funds on deposit at a major brokerage exceed the insurance limits?
Let’s assume this refers to SIPC coverage brokerage firms use. While loosely similar to the more familiar FDIC insurance to cover bank deposits, SIPC insurance is much more limited in scope.
Essentially, SIPC insurance provides coverage from loss due to the brokerage firm going out of business. It provides up to $500,000 of protection on securities and up to $250,000 in cash in excess of what is recovered. It does not provide coverage from a decline in the value of investments.
To help visualize an example of when SIPC would come into play, let’s use an example of a $5 million client account:
· Assume the brokerage firm fails, resulting in $5 billion of client claims on assets.
· Assume 90% of clients’ assets ($4.5 billion) are recovered. The actual historical recovery rate is 98.7% according to SIPC.
· The client in this example holding $5 million in SIPC eligible assets would receive $4.5 million from recovered assets and $500,000 from SIPC. The loss to the $5 million client account would be zero.
It’s exceedingly rare for a client to be entitled to recover damages under SIPC and not be made whole because of the $500,000 limit.
Also, most large brokerage firms purchase “excess of SIPC” insurance, which insures clients for any losses above the $500,000 limit.
Ultimately, clients do not need to be concerned when funds at a brokerage exceed the coverage limits.
More detailed information about SIPC coverage can be found here.

How to report a backdoor Roth IRA contribution on your taxes
by Geoffrey Curran  |  Jun 29, 2017  |  Geoff Curran, Wealth Enhancement In practice, the process of making a backdoor Roth IRA contribution is straightforward, but the documentation and reporting at tax time may be confusing. Whether you work with a professional tax preparer, use tax software such as TurboTax or complete your taxes by hand, understanding the mechanics of the money movements can help ensure you file your taxes correctly.
Let’s say you make a contribution to your Traditional IRA. If your income is too high to qualify for a deduction for the IRA contribution, the contribution is considered non-deductible. Your advisor doesn’t let the custodian (such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity or TD Ameritrade) know whether the contribution is deductible – you report it at tax time on IRS form 8606, Nondeductible IRAs. You use the form to keep track of basis in your Traditional IRA, and basis in this sense means after-tax contributions, to make sure you don’t pay tax on those exact dollars twice.
After you make the non-deductible IRA contribution, it’s converted, i.e., transferred from your Traditional IRA to your Roth IRA account. From that point on, those dollars are now Roth IRA assets and aren’t subject to future tax on earnings. If the conversion is never made, you’ll have basis, i.e., after-tax contributions in your Traditional IRA that you’ll need IRS form 8606 to keep track of. This ensures you aren’t subject to income taxes on withdrawals of that basis in the future, such as in retirement.
Around tax-time, you’ll receive a 1099-R from your custodian showing the distribution from your Traditional IRA that was converted to your Roth IRA the previous year. After tax time, closer to May, you’ll receive an information reporting Form 5498 that shows the contribution you made to the Traditional IRA, and the amount that was converted to Roth IRA for purposes of reconciliation and recordkeeping.
Let’s walk through the reporting process for a backdoor Roth IRA. read more…

 

Things to Remember Around Tax Time if You’ve Made a Qualified Charitable Distribution
by Geoffrey Curran  |  Jun 12, 2017  |  Charitable Giving, Geoff Curran, Wealth Enhancement Form 1099-R is issued around tax time to report distributions you took during the previous year from a retirement account. Among other things, this form tells you and the IRS how much was withdrawn in total, how much of the distribution was taxable and whether there was any withholding for federal and state income taxes.
For those who gave part or all of their required minimum distribution directly to charity through making a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), this amount is still included in the taxable portion of your total distribution on form 1099-R. As you’ll see, the QCD is included in your gross distribution (box 1) and taxable amount (box 2a); however, the box for “taxable amount not determined” (box 2b) will be checked. Whether you work with a professional tax preparer, use software like TurboTax or prepare your own taxes by hand, it can be easy to forget that the QCD portion of your distribution should not be included in your taxable income on your tax return. It’s important to keep a record of any QCDs made during the year and hold on to the receipts or letters that you receive from the charities confirming receipt of the funds.
Below is a blank version of the 1099-R available on the IRS website.

 
This is a copy of a 1099-R issued by TD Ameritrade.

In this example, the individual had a $70,000.00 gross (line 1) and taxable distribution (line 2a). The box next to “taxable amount not determined” (line 2b) is checked. Federal income tax of $8,000.00 was withheld (line 4). The distribution was considered a “normal distribution” because the distribution code 7 was used (line 7). What this 1099-R doesn’t tell you is that $20,000 of this individual’s RMD was a QCD, while the remaining $50,000 of the withdrawal was taxable.
You should put the information from the 1099-R on the first page of your tax return (Form 1040) on line 15a and 15b (shown below). In the example, the individual had a total IRA distribution of $70,000. Of this distribution, $20,000 was a QCD. This means that the QCD won’t be included in your taxable income. If you have the option, write “QCD” to the left of box 15b on your tax return. You need to add the $8,000 federal income tax withheld from this IRA distribution to any other federal withholdings from W-2s and/or 1099s for the year on line 64 (page 2) of your tax return.

If you had basis (after-tax contributions) in the Traditional IRA from which you made the QCD and took a regular distribution, you must remember to file IRS Form 8606 Nondeductible IRAs. You must also file this form if you made a QCD from your Roth IRA. While we would not suggest making a QCD from a Roth IRA since the account is after-tax versus pre-tax, you can do that.
By reporting QCD’s correctly on your tax return, you rightfully receive the benefit of income exclusion.

 

Ask Merriman: Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)
by Chris Waclawik  |  Jun 8, 2017  |  Ask Merriman, Chris Waclawik Q: I turned 70 ½ in 2016, but waited until March 2017 to take my first required minimum distribution (RMD). I planned to wait until 2018 to take my next distribution. Am I understanding correctly that I must take the second RMD in 2017, too?
You are only allowed to delay your RMD the first year you take it. You can delay as late at April 1 of the year after you turn 70 ½.
In every subsequent year, the RMD must be completed by December 31 of that year. If you delay taking your RMD the first year, it means you will have to take two RMDs in your second year.

 
Q: Are Roth accounts subject to an annual required minimum distribution (RMD)? I thought only traditional retirement accounts were, but I’ve been hearing differently.
Roth IRAs are not subject to an annual RMD. However, if your employer offers a Roth 401(k), that is subject to annual RMDs upon reaching age 70 ½.
Fortunately, if you want to avoid taking distributions, it’s possible to complete a rollover from the Roth 401(k) to the Roth IRA. This should allow you to avoid having to take an annual RMD from your Roth money.

 
Q: Do the required minimum distributions (RMDs) from IRAs that become effective in the year I turn  70 ½ apply only to IRAs, or do they also apply to 401(k)s? More specifically, if I am still working full time, does the RMD requirement apply to my 401(k)?
If you’re still working when you turn 70 ½, you may not need to take an RMD from the 401(k) at your current employer if the following conditions are met:

You’re employed throughout the entire year
You own no more than 5% of the company
You participate in a plan that allows you to delay RMDs

You must take your first RMD from the 401(k) the year you retire. In that year, you have until April 1 of the following year to take the distribution. However, if you delay, you‘ll end up taking two RMDs the second year.
The RMDs that become effective the year you turn 70 ½ still apply to all traditional IRAs, and all other 401(k)s and Roth 401(k)s.

 
Q: If I decide to give my RMD to my church, do I need to give the entire withdrawal amount required by the IRS, or can I just give a portion and keep the rest for other living expenses?
You don’t need to give the entire RMD amount to your church (or any charity) to complete a Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD). The QCD can be less than or more than the RMD, up to a $100,000 limit per taxpayer per year.
A taxpayer with a $19,480 RMD in 2017 could certainly make a $5,000 QCD, and take the rest as a regular distribution for living expenses.
The key points to remember when completing the qualified charitable distribution from an IRA to a charity are that the IRA owner must:

Already be age 70 ½ on the date of distribution.
Submit a distribution form to the IRA custodian requesting that the check be made payable directly to the charity.
Ensure that no tax withholding is being made from the QCD to the charity.
Send the check directly to the charity, or to the IRA owner to be forwarded along to the charity.

A More Efficient Way to Give: Donor-Advised Funds
by Geoffrey Curran  |  May 9, 2017  |  Charitable Giving, Geoff Curran Being philanthropic can mean you donate your time, expertise and/or financial resources to support a charitable organization. When donating financial resources, there are ways to give that maximize the benefit of the gift. Did you write a check? If so, where did that cash come from? Did it require you to withdraw from a retirement account, or realize any capital gains to create this cash? If you have a taxable investment account, then using a donor-advised fund is a more efficient way to give.
What is a donor-advised fund? 
A donor-advised fund (DAF) acts like your own mini-charitable foundation. DAFs have been around since the early 20th century, but more recently have become the fastest growing method of giving in the United States. Grants to qualified charities in 2015 alone from donor-advised funds totaled $14.52 billion. You can donate assets to a DAF and receive the tax benefit that year, while having the flexibility to distribute the funds in increments, and over whatever period you’d like. Unlike private foundations, DAFs don’t have legally required annual distributions.
What can be put in a donor-advised fund? 

Cash
Publicly traded securities including stocks, bonds and mutual fund shares
Restricted and controlled stock * Privately held stock
Real estate
Proceeds from life insurance or from a full-paid policy
Private foundation grants or terminations
Bequests
Named beneficiary of charitable remainder trust
Named beneficiary of an IRA, 401(k) or other retirement account
Tangible personal property

Most commonly, families donate appreciated securities such as stocks and mutual fund shares from a taxable investment account to a DAF.  read more…

As of December 31, 2014, Merriman manages over $1.5 billion in client assets, giving ongoing investment advice to thousands of clients across the country. Merriman seeks to construct well-balanced and globally-diversified portfolios based on academic research, with the goal of providing investors with superior risk-adjusted returns. The firm s two core investment products primarily use mutual funds and exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) to help clients achieve their investment objectives, as follows: (i) Merriman MarketWise ( MarketWise ): client assets are allocated and rebalanced across what Merriman believes to be a carefully selected mix of mutual funds to maximize returns and manage risks; and (ii) Merriman TrendWise ( TrendWise ): employs a disciplined markettiming approach maintained by Merriman s research team. Merriman offers two variations of TrendWise: TrendWise100 and TrendWise80. Merriman is also the Investment Manager of the Leveraged Global Opportunity Fund, L.P. ( LGO ), a private investment fund that seeks to achieve capital appreciation primarily through a market-timing approach. Merriman provides limited financial planning advice to its clients, at no extra charge Merriman has discretionary authority over all managed accounts and LGO (as explained in Item 16). When operationally feasible, Merriman strives to accommodate client requests for certain restrictions on their accounts. Each of these products is described in additional detail in Item 8. Merriman provides services to its clients under two service models, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Investment Management services are only available to clients with assets up to $500,000 and includes investment management services and limited financial planning advice, with quarterly performance reporting and an offer for an annual review meeting. Wealth Management clients receive the additional benefit of more in-depth financial planning services and comprehensive Investment Strategy planning, along with access to the expertise of Merriman s professional network and more frequent review meetings. The financial planning advice given by Merriman includes assistance with answers to questions like these: When will I be able to retire? What is the best withdrawal strategy for me when I am retired? How can I use my portfolio to help fund my lifestyle in retirement? Will I need to make any changes to sustain a long retirement? When should I take Social Security? What are the best ways to save for my kids and grandkids college educations?5 How can I build a financial legacy? How can I maximize charitable gifts? Merriman may also provide referrals to professionals who specialize in taxation, estate planning, mortgage financing, insurance and other areas, as needed. Item 4 (cont.) As a fee-only advisory firm, Merriman is compensated through fees paid by its clients, and does not work on commission or sell investment products. Merriman believes this compensation structure enhances its ability to select the best investment options for its clients. For all investment products except LGO*, Merriman charges management fees on a monthly basis. These management fees are calculated and paid monthly (unless otherwise agreed with a client) by applying the annual rates shown below to the average daily balance for the billing period. Annual Fees for Wealth Management Clients: MarketWise: 1% on balances up to $1 million, plus 0.8% on balances between $1 million and $3 million, plus 0.6% on balances between $3 million and $5 million, plus 0.4% on balances over $5 million TrendWise: 1.35% on balances up to $500,000, plus 0.9% on balances over $500,000 Minimum Wealth Management Household Fee: $5,000 minimum annual fee, calculated and applied monthly Annual Fees for Investment Management Clients: MarketWise: 1.25% on all assets (up to a $5,000 annual maximum) Minimum Investment Management Household Fee: $2,000 minimum annual fee, calculated and applied monthly Clients are subject to the terms and conditions per the client s most recent Investment Advisory Agreement. Minimum account requirements and management fee rates may differ among clients. Except when other arrangements are agreed upon, Merriman deducts these fees automatically from each managed account after the completion of the monthly billing period. Each fee withdrawal is reflected on the client s monthly account statement sent by the relevant custodian. Merriman directly invoices a limited number of clients (i.e., less than 1% of all clients) quarterly, in advance, because of special circumstances. The fees for these accounts are based on each account s market value at the end of the previous quarter. Because these fees are paid outside the clients accounts, they are not reflected on statements sent by the custodian. Accounts initiated or terminated during a billing period are charged a Item 5 Fees and Compensation Merriman does not work on commission *LGO pays Merriman, as its Investment Manager, a monthly allowance for expense reimbursement, calculated as 1% of LGO s net assets per year and a performance allocation equal to 20% of profits earned by LGO during each fiscal year, subject to a highwater mark. Each LGO investor bears its proportionate share of that compensation except when Merriman has agreed to waive or reduce any such amounts for an investor. In addition to the foregoing compensation payable to Merriman, third-party fund administration and audit expenses are paid out of LGO assets.  56 Item 5 (cont.) prorated fee based on the number of days the account was under Merriman s management in the relevant period. When an account is terminated, Merriman promptly refunds any prepaid, unearned fees; any earned, unpaid fees become due and payable at that time. Merriman charges a 1% monthly penalty for overdue accounts plus reasonable collection costs if necessary. In addition to the fees described above, clients are responsible for any brokerage commissions, transaction fees, transfer fees and taxes as well as other related costs and expenses which may be charged by custodians, brokers, mutual funds and other third parties. When managed account assets are invested in mutual funds or other investment products, Merriman strives to select low-cost, no-load funds for its clients. All clients should be aware that investment products generally charge their investors internal management fees and investment-related expenses incurred on their behalf. These fees can be found in the investment product s prospectus, and generally are reflected in the reported performance information. No part of the third-party fees and costs described above is received by Merriman or any of its employees. See Item 12 for more information about how Merriman chooses and recommends broker-dealers for client transactions and evaluates the reasonableness of their charges. Item 6 Performance-Based Fees and Side-By-Side Management In addition to the performance allocation from LGO described in Item 5, Merriman has negotiated performance-based fee arrangements (collectively performance fees ) for managed accounts in a limited number of cases for qualified clients. Merriman structures performance fees in accordance with Section 205(a)(1) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act ) and the available exemptions thereunder, including the exemption set forth in Rule The performance fees payable to Merriman for these accounts are based on both realized and unrealized gains and losses in each account. Merriman manages performance-based fee accounts and LGO side-by-side with accounts not subject to performance fees. Because of this, Merriman faces certain conflicts of interest, including the incentive to allocate potentially more favorable investment opportunities to the accounts subject to the performance fees, because Merriman shares in the potentially superior performance of such investment opportunities. To minimize these conflicts of interest, Merriman chooses to manage all accounts, including the performance-based fee accounts, using the same models for all accounts within a trading strategy. Additionally, Merriman has procedures in place to address such conflicts of interest with trade order allocations. For example, if an investment is not fully available for all accounts for which Merriman seeks to make the investment, the amount of7 available investment will be allocated to the relevant accounts pro rata, based on the amount of the order originally made for each account. Further, if block trades in such an investment are made at different prices, the investment will be allocated to all affected accounts on the basis of the average price for such trades. Item 6 (cont.) The majority of Merriman clients are individuals and households who are either saving money and planning for retirement or already retired. Merriman also manages some accounts for pension and profit-sharing plans, trusts, estates, charitable organizations, as well as corporations or other business entities. Merriman program- or account-level requirements are as follows: MarketWise: no restrictions apply TrendWise: $350,000 minimum in each TrendWise100 account; $350,000 minimum in each TrendWise80 account Leveraged Global Opportunity Fund: $250,000 minimum in the program, available only to investors who meet the eligibility requirements described in LGO s offering documents Merriman, at its discretion, may reduce the foregoing minimum investment requirements. LGO eligibility requirements generally cannot be waived. Item 7 Types of Clients Most Merriman clients are individuals and households who are planning for retirement or are already retired No investment is free of risks. Current and prospective Merriman clients are cautioned that investments in securities involve risk of loss, including the possibility of a complete loss of the amount invested. All investors should be prepared to bear these risks. One of Merriman s top priorities is to make sure clients understand the investment risks they choose to take and help them select investment strategies that are appropriate for their risk tolerance. Investors should note that all Merriman-advised portfolios and LGO invest all or a substantial portion of their assets in mutual funds and ETFs. Investors are urged to consult the prospectus or other offering document of each such mutual fund or ETF for additional risks and other considerations. Item 8 Methods of Analysis, Investment Strategies and Risk of Loss Core Investment Programs Merriman offers two core investment programs for its clients, which can be used individually or in combination as appropriate for the client s investment portfolio. MarketWise generally remains fully invested, with an adjustable asset allocation to meet client return objectives and risk tolerances. TrendWise is an actively-managed trend-following strategy, applying active risk management techniques to shift investments across asset classes as market conditions change. Each of these programs seeks to achieve favorable long-term growth with less risk than other similar investment products.  78 Item 8 (cont.) MarketWise portfolios are generally fully invested MarketWise MarketWise is a globally diversified core investment program based on academic research. It relies primarily on low-cost mutual funds and is generally fully invested. The mutual funds used and their allocation are determined by Merriman s Research Team, subject to oversight by Merriman s Investment Committee. The portfolios are not actively traded but are regularly rebalanced to target allocations. MarketWise is managed with the view that: Markets for traditional asset classes are generally efficient. Most active managers fail to beat their benchmark over the long term (after fees and taxes) and it is very difficult to predict which few managers will outperform the indexes in the short term. Careful allocation of investments across a wide variety of diverse asset classes and wide diversification within each asset class helps to improve returns and reduce risk. It is best to invest with a longer-term perspective, as it is difficult to forecast the relative performance of markets and asset classes over the shorter term. Within stocks, overweighting value and small-cap has historically resulted in superior longer-term returns. Investors benefit from periodic rebalancing in order to maintain desired portfolio weights respectful of the client s risk/reward objectives. This leads to trimming asset classes which have done well, and buying those asset classes which have not done as well (selling high and buying low). MarketWise applies a portfolio of mutual funds selected by Merriman s Research team after thorough evaluation and due diligence which considers the fund strategies, potential risks and returns (net of fees), as well as considerations regarding the associated fund company. Merriman updates its analysis regarding the funds it uses on a regular basis, no less than annually, and also regularly considers other available alternative funds and vendors. Funds are replaced if Merriman s risk and return objectives are not being satisfied, if another alternative appears more appropriate, or based on a strategic shift in asset allocation. Merriman receives no compensation from any investment product company. Since 1995, the stock allocations of MarketWise portfolios have been invested in no-load stock mutual funds managed by Dimensional Fund Advisors ( DFA ), available to individuals only through registered investment advisers such as Merriman. DFA stock portfolios are similar to index funds in that expenses and turnover tend to be low. DFA equity funds are distinguished from typical index funds as they are managed with tilts toward value and small-cap stocks, and also companies meeting certain profitability criteria. For taxable client accounts, Merriman may seek greater tax efficiencies by relying on tax-managed stock funds. The stock exposure in MarketWise generally includes U.S. and international9 stock markets (including emerging markets), with small-cap, mid-cap and large-cap funds, as well as U.S. and international real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) in tax-deferred accounts. MarketWise bond allocations generally rely on mutual funds that hold short-term and intermediate-term bonds to control risk. In taxable accounts, Merriman seeks greater tax efficiency by relying on municipal bond funds. Non-traditional asset classes may also be used within MarketWise portfolios to enhance diversification and/or potential returns. One such asset class, introduced for Wealth Management clients in late 2013, is Insurance Linked Securities (ILS). ILS is an emerging asset class which offers equity-like returns, bond-like return mechanics, and a potential yield dependent on property and casualty reinsurance risk premiums rather than interest rates or economic trends. As such, Merriman believes this asset class offers unique diversification attributes due to its very low correlation with traditional asset classes. This non-correlation enables materially enhanced portfolio diversification, particularly at times of financial crises when traditional asset classes have tended to decline in tandem. MarketWise portfolios are generally fully invested, which exposes clients to the risk of market declines. MarketWise accounts can have different levels of exposure to stocks, and thus, different levels of risk. In general, each MarketWise account makes an allocation to both stocks and bonds, although accounts holding only stocks or only bonds may be possible in certain circumstances. Each account is customized to a client s individual risk tolerance by adjusting the individual stock/bond allocation (e.g., 60% invested in stocks and 40% in bonds). Merriman periodically rebalances client accounts to maintain the agreed-upon target allocations. MarketWise portfolios are subject to material risks, including but not limited to: General Economic Conditions and Market Disruptions: Prices of the securities in which the MarketWise portfolios invest may be volatile due to general economic conditions and market movements. Market movements are difficult to predict and are influenced by, among other things, government fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs; changing supply and demand relationships; political and economic conditions; and interest rate trends. Imbalances in Financial Markets: Adverse economic conditions may affect the financial markets in the United States and elsewhere and may promote supply and demand imbalances within stock, bond and other markets. Because the securities held by the MarketWise portfolios are marked to market and fluctuate in value based on supply and demand, this in turn could adversely affect the value of the portfolios assets. If many mutual fund investors sought to redeem their shares at the same time, mutual fund companies could be forced to sell their investments at lower prices in order to meet redemption requests. Investments in Mutual Funds and Other Investment Vehicles: MarketWise portfolios may invest all of their assets in mutual funds, ETFs and other Item 8 (cont.)  910 Item 8 (cont.) investment vehicles. As described above, such vehicles incur management and other fees and expenses related to their investment programs, as further described in the offering documents of such vehicles. These fees and expenses will reduce the returns achieved by the portfolios. Investments in Equity Securities: In general, the valuations of stocks are subject to market risk, including changes in economic conditions, profit levels, growth rates and interest rates. While offering greater potential for long-term growth, stocks are more volatile and more risky than some other investments. Investments in Small-Cap Companies: MarketWise portfolios may invest in the stocks of small-capitalization companies. These companies tend to be subject to more limited product lines and end-markets, and/or fewer financial resources than larger companies. Smaller companies may also be more dependent on a few key members of management and may issue securities that are more thinly traded, which may therefore be subject to greater volatility and potential losses than the securities of larger companies. Non-U.S. Investments: Investments made through MarketWise portfolios in non-u.s. issuers or securities principally traded outside the United States may involve special risks due to economic, political and legal developments, including changes in currency exchange rates; exchange control regulations; expropriation of assets or nationalization; imposition of withholding taxes on dividends or interest payments and less comprehensive accounting reporting and disclosure requirements. Investments in Debt Securities: Debt securities, or bonds, are subject to various types of risk, including but not limited to: Interest-rate risk is the likelihood that bond prices will decline if interest rates rise. Merriman believes that MarketWise portfolios mitigate, but do not eliminate, interest-rate risk by emphasizing shortand intermediate-term maturities and avoiding long-term bonds, which are most sensitive to interest rate changes. Credit risk is the possibility that some issuers of bonds will default on all or part of their interest and principal obligations. Merriman believes credit risk can be mitigated, but not entirely eliminated, by investing some or all of the bond portion of a portfolio in obligations of the U.S. Treasury and U.S. agencies. Treasuries and government agency bonds are generally considered to be subject to less credit risk than most other bonds, but return premiums tend to be lower due to the perceived lower risk. For some accounts, Merriman invests in municipal bonds, which generally have higher credit risk than Treasuries and government agency bonds. Merriman generally does not invest in corporate debt for MarketWise accounts. Based on an assessment of each MarketWise client s investment objective, Merriman may incorporate a mix of investments to appropriately balance the risk/ reward characteristics11 Prepayment risk is the risk that mortgage borrowers may prepay their loan more quickly when interest rates decline, and prepay at a slower pace when interest rates rise, which could result in adverse return implications for holders of mortgage-related investments such as bonds backed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). Investments in Insurance Linked Securities: Investments in Insurance Linked Securities (ILS) are subject to various types of risk: The primary risk relates to reinsurance triggering events, for example: (i) natural catastrophes, such as hurricanes, tornados, or earthquakes of a particular size/magnitude in a designated geographic area; or (ii) non-natural events, such as large commercial accidents (e.g., marine or aviation). Such events, if they occur at unanticipated frequencies or severities, could result in reduced investment returns for ILS investors and even the loss of principal. There is no way to predict with complete accuracy whether a triggering event will occur, and because of this significant uncertainty, ILS carry a high degree of risk. Merriman will seek to mitigate the risks associated with ILS investments by pursuing a strategy of broad diversification within the asset class, across geographies and triggering events. Valuation risk is the risk that the ILS is priced incorrectly due to factors such as incomplete data, market instability, model & human error. In addition, pricing of ILS is subject to the added uncertainty caused by the inability to generally predict whether, when or where a natural disaster or other triggering event will occur. Investments in Illiquid Securities: MarketWise portfolios may invest in alternative investment funds and/or securities which may be subject to liquidity constraints. Such limitations may affect the timing and degree of desired fund purchases and sales, and thereby portfolio rebalancings. Merriman considers the client s objectives, and may consult with some clients, in its determination whether such investments holdings may be suitable, and if so to what extent. TrendWise TrendWise uses active risk management through a trend-following strategy in an attempt to decrease losses in major bear markets. This program may be beneficial for clients who are especially anxious about the ups and downs of the markets; who have a history of liquidating investments at the wrong times; who believe in the benefits of trend following; or who prefer to diversify by investing in both active and passive risk-management strategies. TrendWise portfolios may invest in ETFs, ETNs (Exchange Traded Notes) and mutual funds (excluding DFA funds) and employ a disciplined trendfollowing approach maintained by Merriman s research team. These systems are applied to U.S. stocks, international stocks, bonds, REITs and potentially other asset classes such as commodities. Within each asset class, Item 8 (cont.) TrendWise uses active risk management in an attempt to decrease losses in major bear markets  1112 Item 8 (cont.) Merriman offers two variations of TrendWise to accomodate differences in risk tolerance among clients Merriman may invest in multiple funds, each of which is governed by an independent trend-following timing system. When a trend-following system triggers a buy or sell signal, the purchase or sale is made and the funds are withdrawn from, or invested in, a money market fund or a short-term Treasury fund. Merriman s Research Team is responsible for managing the investment and reinvestment of assets in TrendWise accounts. Merriman offers two variations of TrendWise: TrendWise100, which has been used for Merriman portfolios since 1995; and TrendWise80, which was started in When conditions warrant, TrendWise100 portfolios can be completely out of the market and fully invested in cash or short-term Treasuries. In TrendWise80 portfolios, Merriman always maintains some stock exposure, which allows a maximum of 80% of the stock portion to be out of the market and invested in cash or short-term Treasuries. This increases the risk of market losses as well as the potential for market gains, relative to TrendWise100. Twenty percent of the stock allocation of TrendWise80 is always invested in an asset class rotation strategy in which various asset classes are purchased and sold based on price momentum. That means, for example, that a TrendWise80 account which allocates 60% to stocks would always have at least 12% of its assets in stock funds (i.e., 20% of 60%). The investment objective for each TrendWise portfolio is to attain a long-term return similar to that of the broad markets (without trend following) for a comparable allocation between stocks and bonds with less risk. Merriman believes that TrendWise80 provides a slightly higher risk-adjusted return than TrendWise100 over the long run. However, TrendWise100 may be a more suitable program for investors who want to be completely in cash or short-term Treasuries when stock markets are falling. While TrendWise portfolios are designed to reduce long-term investment risk, no timing system eliminates risk, and in general none react quickly enough to protect investors from a sudden, dramatic market decline. Because Merriman s timing systems follow trends instead of trying to predict them, short-term trading losses cannot be eliminated in TrendWise portfolios. When prices of stock, bond and other asset class securities begin falling, there is always some lag time before Merriman s trend-following systems indicate assets should be sold. Thus, Merriman will rarely, if ever, sell TrendWise assets at the most advantageous prices. Likewise, when market prices begin rising, there is always some lag time before Merriman s systems indicate purchases should be made. Therefore, Merriman will rarely, if ever, buy TrendWise assets at the most advantageous prices. As a result, it is common for parts of TrendWise portfolios to be negatively affected by short-term market volatility such as whipsaw trades. This can occur, for example, in the following sequence: 1. A fund s price falls enough for Merriman s trend-following system to trigger a sell signal;13 2. The fund is sold and the proceeds are invested in cash or short-term Treasuries; 3. The fund s price begins rising; and 4. Merriman s trend-following system does not trigger a buy signal until the fund s price is higher than the price at the time of sale. As a result, a TrendWise portfolio could end up holding fewer shares of a fund than it previously owned. Although such events are counterproductive in the short term, Merriman believes the systems are worthwhile in the long term. While Merriman s systems are designed to protect clients from major bear markets, there is no guarantee they will succeed. While Merriman adjusts the sensitivity of its systems to minimize false alarms, it involves a tradeoff. Any system that is more sensitive will generate more short-term volatility and frustrations, while a less-sensitive system that avoids volatility may not react quickly enough to avert major market losses. In addition to the material risks applicable to MarketWise portfolios set out above, TrendWise portfolios are subject to material risks, including but not limited to: High-Yield Bonds: TrendWise portfolios may invest in high-yield bonds, which are generally rated below investment grade or unrated and may be considered speculative. In general, issuers of high-yield bonds are particularly susceptible to adverse business, financial and economic conditions and are generally more highly leveraged and have fewer financial resources than issuers of investment-grade bonds. Any adverse economic development affecting an issuer of high-yield bonds may cause the issuer to be unable to make timely interest or principal payments. Accordingly, high-yield bond values are generally more susceptible to adverse economic developments and market disruptions than investment-grade bond values. Bank Loan Funds: TrendWise may invest in bank loan funds, which may have substantial credit risk similar to high-yield bonds. Bank loan funds are generally more susceptible to adverse economic developments and market disruptions than investment-grade bond values. Build America Bonds: TrendWise may invest in Build America Bonds (BABs) which are taxable, long-term bonds issued by municipalities. These bonds have the credit risk of the municipalities, substantial interest rate risk since they are long-term, and may be impacted by political decisions to implement new BABs programs or curtail current programs. Emerging Market Debt: TrendWise may invest in emerging market debt, denominated either in U.S. dollars or local currency. Emerging market debt may be rated below investment grade or unrated and may be considered speculative. Emerging market debt will be influenced by economic and political factors specific to each country and region. Emerging market debt may be less liquid than other bonds during times of a financial crisis. Commodities: TrendWise may use ETFs or ETNs to invest in gold, other commodities and commodity producers in an effort to offset the impacts Item 8 (cont.)  1314 Item 8 (cont.) of inflation on the portfolio. Investing in commodities involves a variety of risks, including potential price volatility, the shape of the forward demand curve for the commodity, supply and demand shocks, and the lack of perfect correlation with short and long-term inflation. Currency Carry: TrendWise may invest in ETFs or ETNs which look to benefit from the carry trade of borrowing in a low interest rate currency and investing in a high interest rate currency. Adverse movements in currencies, interest rates and liquidity could decrease the price of these securities. Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs): Unlike ETFs, ETNs depend on the credit risk of the issuer, which is typically a major financial institution. ETNs are structured as unsecured debt of the issuer. Any financial instability of the issuer may impact the price of the ETNs independent of the underlying asset class. If the issuer went bankrupt, ETN holders would become unsecured creditors of the issuer. Trend-Following Limitations: Merriman s trend-following systems, which generate buy and sell decisions for the TrendWise portfolios, use historical information and analysis of current trends to determine when to buy and sell investments. Because past performance does not guarantee future results, there is no assurance that Merriman s trend-following systems will make favorable buy or sell decisions or protect clients from adverse consequences of significant or unprecedented market volatility or disruptions. LGO is available only to qualified investors who have substantial assets Aggressive Investment Program Leveraged Global Opportunity Fund, L.P. Leveraged Global Opportunity Fund is a Washington limited partnership intended only for sophisticated investors who are accredited investors and qualified clients under applicable securities laws. LGO s investment objective is capital appreciation. It seeks to achieve this objective by investing in a wide range of assets, including domestic and international stocks, debt, currencies, options, commodities and futures, in an attempt to generate high returns. LGO may invest directly in these assets, but generally invests in them through mutual funds, ETFs, closed-end funds, ETNs and other types of investment vehicles. LGO may engage in frequent trading. Merriman s Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager of LGO is responsible for managing the investment and reinvestment of LGO s assets on behalf of Merriman in its capacity as Investment Manager. LGO is subject to the material risks applicable to MarketWise, and TrendWise portfolios set out above and to additional risks, including but not limited to: Borrowing: LGO may borrow money to leverage its investments. This magnifies the potential for both gains and losses, which may be substantial. Borrowing also adds to LGO s expenses, which are paid by LGO investors. Assets Magnifying Exposure: LGO may invest in assets that are designed to magnify the movements of a particular market segment. This, like borrow15 ing, magnifies the potential for losses as well as gains. Assets with Inverse Correlations to Market Segments: LGO may invest in assets that are designed to produce the opposite result of a particular market segment, producing returns that may vary significantly from market averages. Frequent Trading: LGO may engage in frequent trading, which can, in turn, generate transaction-related costs and expenses, possibly including brokerage commissions that may reduce LGO s return. Tax Considerations: LGO s investment program is not managed for tax efficiency. Frequent trading and high turnover can produce short-term capital gains that may reduce the overall after-tax performance achieved by investors. Item 8 (cont.) LGO invests in Peer-to-Peer loans ( P2P ) that do not have readily available pricing so Merriman has adopted the following valuation process. The P2P loan portfolio is valued on a discount cash flow basis reflecting expected losses, voluntary prepayments, discount rates based on latest published risk-adjusted expected rates of return, and cure rates for non-current loans. The monthly rates of principal prepayment and loss timing are based on grade-level average principal balance vectors. Grade level loss rates are scaled to reflect the expected loss rates at origination for each loan. For each credit grade, the appropriate discount rate is assumed to be the current lossadjusted expected return for the same type of product further adjusted for the remaining duration of the loan. The Net Present Value of each non-current loan is scaled down by the Payment Status Multiplier reflecting the historical probability of returning to current status. Research and accounting departments independently follow a checklist for completing the valuation and creating the necessary accounting entries on a monthly basis for backup and control purposes. The Valuation Committee (consisting of Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager of LGO, Portfolio Manager, Director of Finance, Trading Manager and Controller) has been formed to review the valuations, model adjustments, and discount rates on a regular basis. The LGO P2P note investments are exposed to other risk factors, including but not limited to: Default risk: The possibility that a borrower fails to make any payments on the corresponding borrower loan related to our note. Prepayment risk: The possibility that the borrower decides to pay some or all of the principal amount on a borrower loan earlier than originally scheduled. Liquidity risk: The possibility that the Note Trader platform, on which notes may be sold by lender members to other lender members, does not develop the necessary liquidity, in the event the fund elects to liquidate some portion of the loan portfolio, instead of awaiting loan maturity. Servicer risk: The possibility of the loan company not being able to service  1516 Item 8 (cont.) the notes due to exorbitant operating losses, contingent liability, or adverse regulatory events resulting in delays and increased costs in respect of the payments of our notes or inability to collect borrow repayments by the back-up servicer that the lending company has arranged. LGO is available only to qualified investors who have substantial assets, are able to bear the risk of the loss of their entire investment, and who meet other requirements set by federal law and in LGO s subscription and organizational documents. Detailed information about LGO s investment strategy, additional risks and other relevant matters is included in LGO s offering documents. Item 9 Disciplinary Information Like all other investment advisers, Merriman is required to disclose all material facts regarding any legal or disciplinary events that would materially impact a client s evaluation of Merriman or the integrity of Merriman s management. No events have occurred at Merriman that are applicable to this item. Item 10 Other Financial Industry Activities and Affiliations Merriman is part of the Focus Financial Partners, LLC ( Focus ) network. As such, Merriman is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Focus Operating, LLC, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Focus. Focus also owns other registered investment advisers, broker-dealers, pension consultants, insurance firms, and other financial service firms (the Focus Partners ). The Focus Partners provide wealth management, benefit and investment consulting services, serving individuals, families, employers, and institutions. Some Focus Partners also manage or advise limited partnerships, private funds or limited liability companies as disclosed on their respective Form ADV Part 1 Schedule Ds. Merriman s clients are not solicited to invest in any other Focus Partners advisory services, and generally Focus Partners do not recommend securities, services, or other investment products of other Focus partner firms, unless so disclosed on their respective Form ADVs and with the clients informed consent, nor are any transactions executed through another Focus Partner s affiliated broker dealer. Further, the Focus Partners do not market their services or share client information amongst each other without prior client consent. Management of other Focus Partners are not involved in the management of Merriman. A list of the related person investment advisers and broker dealers can be found on Merriman s Form ADV Part 1 Schedule D and additional information about Focus can be found at  Merriman is not actively engaged in a business other than giving investment advice. However, Merriman does, at no additional cost to its clients, provide limited financial planning as described in Item 4. Neither Merriman nor any of its management persons is registered or has an application pending to register as a broker-dealer, futures commission merchant, commodity pool17 operator, commodity trading adviser, or associated person of the foregoing, and Merriman does not anticipate such affiliations in the future. As further described in Item 6, Merriman serves as the Investment Manager of LGO. As fiduciaries, Merriman and its employees have certain legal obligations to put clients interests ahead of their own. Merriman has adopted a written code of ethics based on principles of openness, honesty, integrity and trust. At least once a year, each Merriman employee is required to acknowledge this code in writing and agree to be bound by it. Merriman s code of ethics covers confidentiality of client information, personal securities transactions, restrictions on accepting and giving of significant gifts, and reporting of certain gifts and business entertainment items, among other things. In rare cases, Merriman s business may provide Merriman and its employees with access to material nonpublic ( insider ) information. The code includes a prohibition on insider trading and outlines strict policies that dictate how any such information is treated. As described under Item 8, Merriman serves as the Investment Manager of LGO and solicits investment in that partnership from qualified clients when it reasonably believes those clients meet all of the qualifications for investment under applicable law and as set forth in LGO s subscription and organizational documents. Clients may invest in LGO only after the client s Advisor determines the investment is suitable for them and meets their investment objective. See Item 13 for more information regarding Merriman s Advisors. Merriman employees may have investments in some securities that are also owned by clients. The code of ethics is designed to assure that the personal securities transactions, activities and interests of the employees of Merriman will not interfere with making or implementing decisions in the best interest of clients, while at the same time allowing employees to invest for their own accounts. Employee accounts may trade in the same securities with client accounts on an aggregated basis when consistent with Merriman s obligation of best execution. In such circumstances, the employee and client accounts share commission costs proportionally and receive securities at a total average price. Merriman retains records of each trade order (specifying each participating account) and its allocation, prior to the entry of the aggregated order. Completed orders are allocated as specified in the initial trade order. Partially filled orders are allocated on a pro-rata basis based on the amount of the order for each account. Any exceptions will be explained on the trade order. Investors should note that, because Merriman employees may invest in the same securities as clients, there is a possibility that employees might benefit from market activity by a client in a security held by an employee. However, Item 10 (cont.) Item 11 Code of Ethics, Participation or Interest in Client Transactions and Personal Trading Merriman has a legal obligation to put clients interests ahead of its own  1718 Item 11 (cont.) given the modest size of employee trades in relation to the size of the mutual funds and ETFs in client portfolios, Merriman believes that employee trading is unlikely to have any material impact on purchase or sales prices experienced by clients. Employees are not provided advance notice of LGO trades. In addition, employees are required to report their trading activity quarterly and their securities holdings annually and these reports are reviewed internally. The code of ethics designates certain classes of securities (including, without limitation, shares of open-end mutual funds) as exempt from reporting, based upon exemptions provided under applicable federal securities laws. Currently, it is Merriman s policy that Merriman will not affect any principal or agency cross securities transactions for client accounts. Merriman will also not cause client accounts to enter into securities trades with each other. Principal transactions are generally defined as transactions where an adviser, acting as principal for its own account or the account of an affiliated brokerdealer, buys from or sells any security to any advisory client. A principal transaction may also be deemed to have occurred if a security is traded between an affiliated fund, such as LGO, and another client account. An agency cross transaction is generally defined as a transaction in which a person acts as an investment adviser in relation to a transaction in which the investment adviser acts as a broker for both the advisory client and for another person on the other side of the transaction. Agency cross transactions may arise if an adviser is dually registered as a broker-dealer or has an affiliated broker-dealer. Neither of these circumstances currently applies to Merriman and this brochure will be updated if that changes in the future. Merriman will provide a copy of its code of ethics to any actual or prospective client upon request to Merriman s Chief Compliance Officer, David Spratt, at or Item 12 Brokerage Practices Merriman investment portfolios can be held at Charles Schwab, Fidelity or TD Ameritrade In seeking best execution through a broker-dealer on behalf of Merriman s clients, the determinative factor for Merriman is not the lowest possible cost, but whether the transaction represents the best qualitative execution. Merriman takes into consideration the full range of broker-dealer services, including historical relationship, reputation, financial strength, the value of any research provided, execution capability, commission rates and responsiveness. Merriman s best execution responsibility is qualified by the fact that the majority of securities that it purchases for client accounts are mutual funds that trade at net asset value as determined at the daily market close. In addition, Merriman diligently seeks favorable prices on ETF trades. Merriman believes Charles Schwab & Co. Inc. ( Schwab ), Fidelity Investment Services ( Fidelity ), TD Ameritrade, Inc. ( TD Ameritrade ) and Interactive Brokers, LLC ( Interactive Brokers ) are financially solid companies that provide reliable, quick, responsive and efficient brokerage and other services. Merriman believes these companies give Merriman clients low-cost access to the funds used in the portfolios, and they have19 demonstrated that they can handle complex trades accurately and are willing to resolve problems quickly and favorably for Merriman clients. The accounts in Merriman s MarketWise and TrendWise programs may be held at Schwab, Fidelity or TD Ameritrade as follows: MarketWise: the client may choose Schwab, Fidelity or TD Ameritrade as the custodian TrendWise: can be held only at Schwab or TD Ameritrade, both of which provide a negotiated fee agreement to minimize trading costs in TrendWise accounts Most of LGO s assets consist of investments in mutual funds, ETFs, ETNs and similar vehicles and instruments, which are custodied at Schwab and Interactive Brokers. P2P notes are purchased through Prosper Marketplace, Inc. If LGO invests directly in other securities, it may effect such transactions through a variety of broker-dealers. Merriman may recommend that clients establish brokerage accounts with Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade or Interactive Brokers (collectively The Custodians ) to maintain custody of clients assets and to effect trades for their accounts. The Custodians provide Merriman with access to their institutional trading and operational services, which are typically not available to retail investors. These services are generally available to independent investment advisors such as Merriman on an unsolicited basis, and at no additional cost to Merriman or its clients. The Custodians services include brokerage, custody, research, and access to mutual funds and other investments that are otherwise generally available only to institutional investors or that would require a significantly higher minimum initial investment. The Custodians generally do not charge separately for custody of Merriman client accounts, but are compensated by account holders through commissions, transaction-related fees or assetbased fees for securities trades. Fee schedules vary between The Custodians so Merriman clients in the same investment program, but with accounts at different custodians, will have varying costs. In addition, The Custodians may not offer the exact same securities for trading, so individual securities in client accounts may vary within investment programs. The Custodians also make available to Merriman other products and services that benefit Merriman s business but may not directly benefit its clients accounts. This is not a material consideration for Merriman when it recommends that a client utilize a particular custodian s services. Some of these other products and services assist Merriman in managing and administering clients accounts. These include software and other technology that provide access to client account data (such as trade confirmations and account statements); facilitate trade execution (and allocation of aggregated trade orders for multiple client accounts); provide research, pricing information and other market data; facilitate payment of Merriman s fees from its clients accounts; and assist with back-office functions, record keeping and client reporting. These services generally may be used to service Item 12 (cont.)  1920 Item 12 (cont.) Merriman is not affiliated with any broker-dealer all or a substantial number of Merriman s accounts. The Custodians also make available to Merriman other services intended to help Merriman manage and further develop its business enterprise. These services may include consulting; publications and conferences on practice management; information technology, business succession; regulatory compliance and marketing. In addition, The Custodians may make available, arrange and pay for these types of services rendered to Merriman by independent third parties. The Custodians may discount or waive fees it would otherwise charge for some of these services or pay all or a part of the fees of a third-party providing these services to Merriman. While, as a fiduciary, Merriman endeavors to act in its clients best interests, Merriman s recommendation that clients maintain their assets in accounts at The Custodians may be based in part on the benefit to Merriman of the availability of some of the foregoing products and services and not solely on the nature, cost or quality of custody and brokerage services provided by The Custodians, which creates a conflict of interest. Ultimately, it is the client s decision to custody assets with a particular custodian. Merriman is independently owned and operated, and not affiliated with The Custodians. There is no corresponding commitment made by Merriman to The Custodians or any other entity to invest any specific amount or percentage of client assets in any specific mutual funds, securities or other investment products. Merriman, consistent with its best execution obligation, negotiates fee arrangements with The Custodians that Merriman believes are beneficial to all of its clients. In addition, a substantial portion of trading activities undertaken by Merriman on behalf of its clients involves the purchase and sale of no-load mutual funds that are priced at Net Asset Value (NAV). Merriman does not have any directed brokerage arrangements with clients. Merriman participates in the institutional advisor program (the Program ) offered by TD Ameritrade Institutional. TD Ameritrade Institutional is a division of TD Ameritrade Inc., member FINRA/SIPC/NFA ( TD Ameritrade ), an unaffiliated SEC-registered broker-dealer and FINRA member. TD Ameritrade offers to independent investment advisors services which include custody of securities, trade execution, clearance and settlement of transactions. Advisor receives some benefits from TD Ameritrade through its participation in the Program. (Please see the disclosure under Item 14. below.) David Spratt, Chief Operations Officer and Chief Compliance Officer of Merriman, serves on the Schwab Advisor Services Technology, Operations and Service Advisory Board (the Board ). The Board consists of approximately 20 representatives of independent investment advisory firms who have been invited by Schwab management to participate in meetings and discussions of Schwab Advisor Services services for independent investment advisory firms and their clients. Board members serve for two-year terms  View more

                                    Current                


Merriman Wealth Management LLC


                  Merriman Wealth Management seeks to construct well-balanced and globally-diversified portfolios based on academic research, seeking to provide investors with superior risk-adjusted returns. The firm’s two core investment products, MarketWise and TrendWise primarily use mutual funds and ETFs to help clients achieve their investment goals. The firm's MarketWise strategy is a globally diversified core investment program based on academic research. It relies primarily on low-cost mutual funds and is generally fully invested. Client assets are allocated and rebalanced across a carefully selected mix of mutual funds (typically no-load stock mutual funds managed by DFA). The stock exposure in MarketWise generally includes U.S. and international stock markets (including emerging markets), with small-cap, mid-cap and large-cap funds, as well as U.S. and international real REITs in tax-deferred accounts. Bond allocations generally rely on mutual funds that hold short-term and intermediate-term bonds. In taxable accounts, Merriman seeks greater tax efficiency by relying on municipal bond funds. Merriman's TrendWise is an actively-managed trend-following strategy that applies active risk management techniques to shift investments across asset classes as market conditions change. Portfolios may invest in ETFs, ETNs and mutual funds (excluding DFA funds). These systems are applied to U.S. stocks, international stocks, bonds, REITs and potentially other asset classes such as commodities. Within each asset class, Merriman may invest in multiple funds, each of which employs as independent trend-following timing system. Merriman offers two variations of TrendWise: TrendWise100 and TrendWise80.

Why a Raymond James Advisor






Our advisors have a 
legacy of serving clients differently.

                    It’s a more personal approach that goes far beyond an investment portfolio. It’s an ongoing and open dialogue about all aspects of your life, your goals and your financial vision. And it’s developing a long-term relationship built on understanding and trust. Your advisor is there for you throughout the planning and investing process, giving you objective and unbiased advice along the way.
                



Who Our Advisors Serve


Raymond James advisors serve clients with a variety of sophisticated financial planning needs. From families and individuals to business owners and institutions, your Raymond James advisor has the expertise and experience to provide guidance for a wide range of financial planning needs. They’ll take care of the big picture and the finer details with an approach that is as disciplined as it is strategic.
Learn More



Working with an Advisor


Your advisor is there to help you reach major milestones and all of the smaller ones in between. You’ll work together to build a customized plan just for you, taking into account all of your objectives, while weighing risk, prioritizing trade-offs and accounting for “what ifs.” And because your plan is a living document, your advisor will continually adapt it while utilizing the latest technology to identify potential unknowns and your changing needs, making adjustments that will help you reach your financial goals.
