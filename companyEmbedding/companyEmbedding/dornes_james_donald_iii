    Mr. James Donald “J.D.” Doby, Sr. 83, passed away Tuesday, May 10, 2016 at his home. He was born in Alamance County on April 4, 1933 to Walter Henry and Ollie Parker Doby. He was owner of Doby Auto Rentals in Winston-Salem. Mr. Doby had a passion for improving farm land and worked tirelessly for many years with his cattle on his Rowan County farm and his Davie County farm, which is the Doby home place. Mr. Doby was preceded in death by 5 sisters, 4 brothers, and one nephew. Surviving are a daughter, Janeen Doby, a son James Donald “Sarge” Doby, Jr and wife Kathy, a special friend Jacque Spaugh, his grandchildren Jason Ralston and wife Charlotte, James Donald (Jesse) Doby, III, Tristin Adams, and Reagan Poole, great-grandchildren Marley Ralston and Jackson Ralston, three special nephews Steve, David, and Bradley Doby, and several other nieces and nephews. He is also survived by his special farming friends Eddie and Judy Atkins. A memorial service will be held at a later date. Hayworth-Miller Silas Creek Chapel is assisting the Doby family.
