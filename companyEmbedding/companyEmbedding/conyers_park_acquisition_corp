	transaction, including the likelihood and ability of the parties to successfully consummate the proposed transaction, future opportunities

	of Conyers Park’s management and are not predictions of actual performance. These statements are subject to a number of
	risks and uncertainties regarding Conyers Park’s businesses and the transaction, and actual results may differ materially.
	These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in the business environment in which Conyers Park operates,
	including inflation and interest rates, and general financial, economic, regulatory and political conditions affecting the industry
	in which Conyers Park operates; changes in taxes, governmental laws, and regulations; competitive product and pricing activity;

	of the parties to successfully or timely consummate the proposed transaction, including the risk that the required regulatory

	or the expected benefits of the transaction or that the approval of the stockholders of Conyers Park is not obtained; failure
	to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction, including as a result of a delay in consummating the transaction or a

	be filed with the SEC by Conyers Park. There may be additional risks that Conyers Park presently does not know or that Conyers
	Park currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking
	statements. In addition, forward-looking statements provide Conyers Park’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events
	and views as of the date of this communication. Conyers Park anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Conyers
	Park’s assessments to change. However, while Conyers Park may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point
	in the future, Conyers Park specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied
	upon as representing Conyers Park assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this communication.

PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK and DENVER, April 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Conyers Park Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: CPAA) (“Conyers Park”), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, and an affiliate of Atkins Nutritionals, Inc. (“Atkins”), a leading developer, marketer and seller of branded nutritional food and snacking products currently owned by affiliates of Roark Capital Group (“Roark”), announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Conyers Park and Atkins will combine under a new holding company, The Simply Good Foods Company (“Simply Good Foods”), which will list on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol SMPL upon closing of the proposed transaction. The new company will have an anticipated initial enterprise value of approximately $856 million, or 11.6x Atkins’ estimated Calendar Year 2017 Pro Forma EBITDA of $74 million.
Jim Kilts and Dave West, executive founders of Conyers Park and longtime business leaders in the consumer food sector, will serve as Chairman and Executive Vice Chairman of Simply Good Foods, respectively. Brian Ratzan, also an executive founder of Conyers Park, will become a director of Simply Good Foods. Joseph Scalzo, current Chief Executive Officer of Atkins, will continue in that role and lead the new company.
Mr. Kilts commented: “I am excited to help build the Atkins® brand and its promise of simply good and nutritious food. Throughout my career, I have worked on numerous brands that both delight and satisfy consumers. We plan to add to our Simply Good Foods portfolio over time with brands that bring simple goodness, happiness and positive experiences to consumers and their families.”
“Atkins is an iconic American brand that has pioneered innovative food and snacking products for consumers who are focused on overall health and wellness,” said Mr. Scalzo. “Atkins is the original innovator of the low-carb, low-sugar, protein-rich approach to nutrition and healthier weight that has been very compelling to our consumers who want to make smarter and healthier choices. As a result, Atkins has become a destination brand in its aisle, and the company has achieved eight consecutive years of retail sales growth.
“Roark has been a uniquely valuable and supportive partner to the entire Atkins management team. Their insights and support have helped us thoughtfully grow the brand and business. Looking forward, access to public capital markets, combined with the operating experience and wisdom of Jim and Dave, will allow us to build on Atkins’ brand heritage and consumer loyalty as we focus on growing our brand and introducing it to new consumers,” continued Mr. Scalzo.
Mr. West said: “Atkins has many of the attributes that we find compelling: ownership of a unique consumer idea, a solid business model, relevance with key retailers, and a very exciting growth opportunity. With Atkins as the first part of the platform, Simply Good Foods is poised to become a dynamic vehicle for future long-term growth and M&A within both the snacking space and broader food category.”

(1) Includes gross proceeds from this offering of $375,000,000 (or $402,500,000
    if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full) as well as
    amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in
    connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    the date of this prospectus, we had borrowed $225,000 under the promissory
    note with our sponsor. These amounts will be repaid upon completion of this
    offering out of the offering proceeds that has been allocated for the
    payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and
    amounts not to be held in the trust account. In the event that offering
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be
    used for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that the
    offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may fund such
    excess with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to
    3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $13,125,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or $14,087,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us
    and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or
    for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only, and do not include interest which may be
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. We
    are also entitled to up to $1,000,000 in interest from the trust account to
    be used for working capital purposes. The amount of interest available to us
    from the trust account may be less than $1,000,000 as a result of the
    current interest rate environment.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $375,000,000 (or $402,500,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $13,125,000 (or $14,087,500 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $75,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per year.
Except with respect to up to $1,000,000 of interest earned on the funds held in
the trust account that may be released to us to fund working capital
requirements, as well as amounts released to us to pay our franchise and income
tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest
rates, we do not expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of
income taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of the
date of this prospectus, we had borrowed $225,000 under the promissory note with
our sponsor. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the
earlier of December 31, 2016 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be
repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the offering proceeds not held
in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in
our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock”
rules) and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within
24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and
as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability
to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in
connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may
reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these
factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating
an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Delaware
corporation on April 20, 2016 and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger,
capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or
similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we


 refer to
throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not
identified any potential business combination target and we have not, nor has
anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or
indirectly, with any potential business combination target.

While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector, we
intend to focus on the consumer sector and consumer-related businesses, which
complements our management team’s expertise and which will benefit from our
operational value add. We believe that the experience and capabilities of our
management team will make us an attractive partner to potential target
businesses, enhance our ability to complete a successful business combination,
and bring value to the business post-business combination. Not only does our
management team bring a combination of operating, investing, financial and
transaction experience, but also has worked closely together in the past at
multiple consumer companies, creating value for shareholders.

Our management team is led by James M. Kilts, our Executive Chairman, and David
J. West, our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Kilts’ and Mr. West’s careers have
centered on identifying and implementing value creation initiatives within the
consumer industry. They have collectively created approximately $50 billion in
shareholder value throughout their combined 70+ year careers in the consumer
industry by relying on what we believe to be tried-and-true management
strategies: cost management and productivity enhancement, and reinvesting the
savings behind product innovation, marketing, and brand building.

Mr. Kilts is a renowned leader in the consumer industry, with over 40 years of
experience leading a range of companies and iconic brands. Mr. Kilts served as
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of Gillette from
2001 until it merged with The Procter & Gamble Company in 2005; at that time he
became Vice Chairman of the Board of The Procter & Gamble Company. Before Mr.
Kilts joined Gillette, the company’s sales had been flat for 4 years, and it had
missed earnings estimates for 14 consecutive quarters. Mr. Kilts took steps to
rebuild the management team, cut costs and reinvest the savings in innovation
and marketing. During his tenure as Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kilts oversaw
the creation of approximately $30 billion in equity value for Gillette’s public
shareholders, with Gillette’s share price appreciating 110% while the S&P 500
declined 3% over the same time period. Under Mr. Kilts’ leadership, Gillette
rejoined the top ranks of consumer products companies as sales increased an
average of 9% each year. The Harvard Business Review cited Mr. Kilts’ leadership
as the driving force behind Gillette’s turnaround. Prior to Gillette, Mr. Kilts
served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Nabisco from 1998 until its
acquisition by The Philip Morris Companies in 2000. Before joining Nabisco, Mr.
Kilts was an Executive Vice President of The Philip Morris Companies from 1994
to 1997 and headed the Worldwide Food group. In that role, Mr. Kilts was
responsible for integrating Kraft and General Foods and for shaping the group’s
domestic and international strategy. Mr. Kilts had previously served as
President of Kraft USA and Oscar Mayer. More recently, Mr. Kilts served as
Chairman of the Board of Nielsen Holdings N.V. from 2009 to 2014, during which
time Mr. Kilts worked closely with management to defend key existing customers
and win new business. During their investment period, the investor group’s
equity value creation was nearly $7 billion.

Mr. West is an established leader in the consumer industry, with nearly 30 years
of experience leading a range of companies and well-known brands. Mr. West
served as Chief Executive Officer and President of Big Heart Pet Brands
(formerly Del Monte Foods) from 2011 to 2015. Mr. West worked closely with Mr.
Kilts during this time period, as Mr. Kilts was Chairman of the Board of Big
Heart Pet Brands. Mr. West repositioned the business to focus on growth and
innovation, enhance distribution, and develop a marketing culture to focus on
brands and products. The J. M. Smucker Company purchased Big Heart Pet Brands in
March 2015. During his tenure as Chief Executive Officer of Big Heart Pet
Brands, Mr. West oversaw the creation of approximately $2 billion of equity
value for investors. Prior to joining Big Heart Pet Brands, Mr. West served as
the Chief Executive Officer, President and a director of Hershey from 2007 to
2011. Under Mr. West’s leadership, Hershey enjoyed net sales and profit growth
and strong shareholder returns, and was recognized as one of the World’s 100
Most Innovative Companies by Forbes Magazine in 2011. The success created by Mr.
West’s leadership led to public shareholders of Hershey experiencing more than
$5 billion of equity value creation during his tenure. Hershey’s share price
appreciated 68% during this time period, while the S&P 500 grew 0%. Prior to
joining Hershey in 2001, Mr. West spent 14 years with Nabisco, where he worked
closely with Mr. Kilts during Mr. Kilts’ tenure as Chief Executive Officer.

Our sponsor is an affiliate of Centerview Capital. Founded in 2006, Centerview
Capital sponsors multiple investment funds, including consumer (also known as
Centerview Capital Consumer) and technology funds. Our management team,
including James M. Kilts, David J. West and Brian K. Ratzan, are all partners at
Centerview Capital Consumer. Mr. Ratzan, our Chief Financial Officer, brings
over 20 years of private equity investing experience. The deep operating
experience of Mr. Kilts and Mr. West complement Mr. Ratzan’s financial and
transactional expertise to create a team capable of identifying attractive
investments and executing deals in the consumer sector. Centerview Capital
Consumer has made investments across the consumer industry spectrum, including
the food and beverage, household/personal care, and consumer services sectors.
Centerview Capital Consumer has a track record of identifying high-quality
assets, businesses and management teams. Centerview Capital is associated with
Centerview Partners. Certain partners of Centerview Partners are partners
(either directly or indirectly) in the ultimate general partner and the manager
of Centerview Capital Consumer’s investment funds, and serve on Centerview
Capital Consumer’s investment committee. Centerview Partners is a leading
independent investment banking and advisory firm which provides advice on
mergers and acquisitions, financial restructurings, valuation, and capital
structure to companies, institutions and governments. Since the founding of
Centerview Partners in 2006, the firm has advised on over $1 trillion of
transactions. Centerview Partners’ clients include over 20% of the 50 largest
companies in the world by market capitalization, including many of the world’s
most influential consumer companies, which we believe further broaden our reach
and network of deal contacts.

We believe that companies operating in the consumer sector have characteristics
which make them attractive investments. Many companies in the consumer industry
generate high margins and strong free cash flow, maintain operational stability
throughout economic cycles, and serve as good platforms for future acquisitions.
Furthermore, these companies can create significant value by introducing new
products and/or services to the marketplace, growing distribution, and building
brands that resonate in households worldwide. Our management team has executed
on these growth strategies throughout their careers.

Recently, many large consumer companies have announced plans to cut costs and
divest non-core brands, which is expected to result in the sale of assets. All
members of our management team have had extensive experience undertaking mergers
and acquisitions and overseeing business integration and synergy realization. We
believe that our management team of consumer industry veterans is uniquely
capable of identifying attractive businesses, executing acquisitions, and adding
value post deal completion.

Conyers Park Acquisition Corp. and Atkins Nutritionals, Inc. Complete Business Combination to Form The Simply Good Foods Company
The Simply Good Foods Company Will Trade on NASDAQ Under “SMPL” and “SMPL.W”



















July 07, 2017 16:05 ET

 | Source: The Simply Good Foods Company






GREENWICH, Conn. and DENVER, July  07, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conyers Park Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ:CPAA) (“Conyers Park”), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, and an affiliate of Atkins Nutritionals, Inc. (“Atkins”), a leading developer, marketer and seller of branded nutritional food and snacking products, announced today that they have completed their business combination. The transaction had been previously unanimously approved by the board of directors of Conyers Park and was approved at a special meeting of Conyers Park’s stockholders on July 5, 2017. Per the terms of the merger agreement, Conyers Park and Atkins have combined under a new holding company, The Simply Good Foods Company (“Simply Good Foods”). The common stock and warrants of Simply Good Foods will be listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange beginning July 10, 2017 under the symbols “SMPL” and “SMPL.W,” respectively. As previously announced, along with the $402.5 million of cash held in Conyers Park’s trust account raised from its IPO in July 2016, $100 million of capital for the acquisition was received from investors including certain funds managed by Fidelity Management and Research Company or its affiliates, one or more funds managed by Capital Research and Management Company, and certain funds and accounts advised by T.
