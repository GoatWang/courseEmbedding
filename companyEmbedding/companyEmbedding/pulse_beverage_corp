Mr. Kendrick was instrumental in designing and developing new products and packages for Clearly Canadian, improving its marketing capabilities and lowering its production costs.

Click here for their report 			  PULSE BEVERAGES ARE HERE!  AVAILABLE ONLINE NOW!  WWW.PULSEBEVERAGE.COM 			           ??         			    Business Summary       			   			 About Us   			Based in vibrant Colorado, we’re committed to providing awesome tasting, healthy nutritional beverages. We know there’s so much to choose from these days in the beverage world, but believe we’re uniquely different by providing the absolute best in quality nutritional beverages, that are also good for your health. We aren’t one of the big beverage conglomerates dominating the supermarket shelves, but rather we excel at what we put in our beverages to benefit the human race, not the rat race. We’re middle-America committed to making a healthy difference in the beverage industry, while having fun living life healthy, active and large! Mission Our mission is to be one of the market leaders in the development and marketing of nutritional/functional beverage products that provide real health benefits to a significant segment of the population and are convenient and appealing to consumers. We have an experienced management team of beverage industry executives that have successfully launched and/or managed the distribution for more than twenty-five major brands over the past twenty years. They have strong relationships with distributors and buyers who supply thousands of retail outlets, supermarkets and convenience stores. Products Our initial commercial product is Natural Cabana® Lemonade. Our flagship product is PULSE® brand of functional/nutritional beverages (“PULSE®”) in three health platforms: PULSE® Heart Health Formula™, PULSE® Women’s Health Formula™, PULSE® Men’s Health Formula™. We presently manufacture, through co-packers, distribute and market both products. In early 2011 we developed and then, in October, 2011, produced and distributed Natural Cabana® Lemonade. We launched Natural Cabana® Lemonade ahead of PULSE® in order to establish a comprehensive nationwide and international distribution system. Lemonades are widely considered to be an easily understood product as compared to a highly nutritional product such as PULSE® which requires more education at the distribution and retail level. To ensure that the flavor profiles and nutritional platforms of our products meet the needs of consumers’ taste, health and life-style, we contract the services of Catalyst Development Inc. (“Catalyst”), a highly respected beverage product development firm located in Burnaby, BC, Canada. Catalyst developed the formulations for PULSE® under license, for Baxter Healthcare Corporation. Our product development team has ensured PULSE® is a lower calorie, great tasting functional /nutritional beverage that provides the benefits we claim on PULSE® labels. We use a hot-fill process of production to allow the PULSE® product to have all natural ingredients without the use of preservatives.     2013- Q1 UPDATE The Pulse Beverage Corporation (OTCQB: PLSB) ("Pulse"), makers of PULSE(R) brand of functional beverages and Cabana(TM) 100% Natural Lemonade, today announced its 1st Quarter results for 2013 and issued a corporate update. Q1-2013 Highlights: Case sales during Q1-2013 for Cabana(TM) increased 169% quarter over quarter and 133% as compared to Q1-2012. Revenue during Q1-2013 for Cabana(TM) increased by 232% quarter over quarter and 115% as compared to Q1-2012. Investment Highlights PULSE® was originally developed by a major healthcare company The Pulse® 'functional' beverage products were scientifically researched and formulated by a major healthcare company and licensed to Pulse. Pulse owns the right to use the following Side Panel Statement for PULSE formulations for heart health, men's health and women's health: “Formulation developed under license from Baxter Healthcare Corporation”. This right is in perpetuity and does not require any royalty payments. The PULSE BRANDS may be the only refreshment beverage developed that actually have sufficient dosages of functional ingredients to actually promote health. Pulse’s product mix is calculated to exploit niches that are either unoccupied or have yet to attract significant attention. Currently, Japan is the largest consumer of vitamin enriched drinks, with 2009 sales of $8.9 billion. However, the growing popularity of the category in the United States has caused some experts to predict it will overtake Japan in 2014. Pulse goes beyond vitamin enhancement by using 100% natural ingredients and nutritional additives. The United States has more than 2,600 beverage companies and 500 bottlers of beverage products. Collectively they account for more than $105 billion in annual sales. It is estimated that globally, more than $300 billion worth of non-alcoholic beverages are sold annually. Financing  			Pulse has in excess of $4.5 million in working capital as at March 31, 2013 including cash of $3.8 million, as such, Pulse will likely not need additional capital to finance the growth of its operations for its PULSE(R) and Cabana(TM) products. Pulse has received several offers for additional financing but has turned the offers down as it doesn't require additional financing for the foreseeable future.   http://www.pulsebeverage.com/uploads/files/Letter_to_Shareholders_of_Pulse_March_29,_2013.pdf   SEC filings SEC.gov 			       Company Name Form Type  Filling Date  File/Film number         PULSE BEVERAGE 8-K 2013-02-04 000-53586 13568881       PULSE BEVERAGE  10-Q/A 2012-12-17 000-53586 121268923            PULSE BEVERAGE  10-Q/A 2012-11-14 000-53586 121200217            PULSE BEVERAGE  10-Q 2012-11-13 000-53586 121196023                   ??          ??               ??          ??          ??          ??          ??        						         Headlines yahoo OTC Markets  http://nbtequitiesresearch.com/report/research-update-pulse-beverage-strong-buy-and-10x-upside 			     			RULES of THE ROAD  			All messages, including iBox content, are the opinion of the posters, are no substitute for your own research, and should not be relied upon for stock trading or any other purpose. 			  			Also, keep in mind that moderators may or may not have a position in said stock.  Being a moderator isn't a sign of endorsement. 			  Please keep your posts on topic because your message(s) may be removed when: 			* Posting content that's off-topic to the subject of this board; (ie on topic is about the company, not people who post) 			* Posting statements that don't add value to the discussion; or 			* When you violate any other posting term of the iHub User Agreement: http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/complex_terms.asp http://ihwiki.advfn.com/index.php?title=Handbook#Deletion_of_Posts
