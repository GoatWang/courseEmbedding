SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 9, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Cayenne Medical, Inc., a private sports medicine device company specializing in the soft tissue reconstruction segment, announced that effective immediately, David B. Springer will succeed James Hart as President and Chief Executive Officer, who has transitioned to Executive Chairman due to health reasons.
Hart, who has led Cayenne Medical as Chairman, President and CEO since the company's inception in 2005, will continue to work with management and the Board in guiding the strategic direction of the company.
"As a founding member, I have a personal commitment and passion for Cayenne and its proven soft-tissue reconstruction technology platform," said James Hart, Executive Chairman, Cayenne Medical.  "I plan to work with David to ensure a smooth transition, and am confident that his medical device leadership experience will be invaluable to the ongoing growth and success of the company, particularly as we continue to see increased surgeon demand for our AperFix® System."
Springer, 46, joins Cayenne with over 20 years executive leadership experience in Healthcare Fortune 500, and emerging, entrepreneurial companies in the medical device industry.  His significant experience includes the successful commercialization of numerous products, improved sales performance and operational strategy implementation.
"I am looking forward to leading Cayenne Medical through its next phase of growth and expansion by capitalizing on its unique technology platform and impressive surgeon adoption momentum," said Springer.  "I see great opportunity to execute on the company's corporate vision to be a leader in the sports medicine market and bring a full line of innovative solutions to customers so they can better serve their patients."
Most recently, Springer served as President & CEO of CHF Solutions, Inc. in Brooklyn Park, MN, where he successfully led the company to profitability and the eventual sale to Gambro, a global medical device company, in 2010.  In his four years with CHF, Springer was responsible for substantially growing revenue, product utilization and penetration by developing and executing on commercialization and market development strategies.  Prior to this, he served as Senior Vice President of the U.S. division of St. Jude Medical, where he had primary brand management accountability and was influential in driving the U.S. strategic and operational plan.  Previously, Springer was the Chief Operating Officer at AnyDevice (acquired by Hiddenmind Technology).
In 1997, he was a member of the founding management team of WebMD (formerly QDCS, Inc.) where he held the positions of Executive Vice President of Business Development and Senior Vice President of Sales.  Prior to WebMD, Springer served in various leadership positions in sales, corporate accounts and marketing at Intermedics, Kimberly Clark Healthcare and Procter & Gamble.  Springer graduated from Purdue University in 1986 with a B.S. in industrial management and a minor in industrial engineering.
Cayenne Medical currently offers products that address previously unmet clinical needs in knee ligament reconstruction and meniscal repair, including the AperFix® System, CrossFix™ Meniscal Repair System and iFix™ System.  For more information Cayenne Medical, please visit www.cayennemedical.com.
