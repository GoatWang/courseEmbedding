There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

      FCB Financial Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FCB) (the "Company") today reported 
      second quarter 2017 net income of $35.1 million, or $0.76 per share on a 
      fully diluted basis, and adjusted net income of $32.5 million, or $0.71 
      per share on a fully diluted basis. Net income rose 49% year-over-year 
      and net income per diluted share rose 39%. Adjusted net income rose 34% 
      year-over-year and adjusted net income per diluted share rose 25%. This 
      resulted in a ROA of 147 basis points and an adjusted ROA of 136 basis 
      points.
    

        Fully tax equivalent net revenue of $83.0 million;
      

        Reported and Adjusted EPS of $0.76 and $0.71 per share, respectively, 
        on a fully diluted basis;
      

        New loan portfolio grew sequentially at an annualized rate of 25% when 
        excluding the impact of reducing the syndicated loan portfolio and 
        mortgage sales;
      

        New loan fundings of $536.1 million during the quarter and reduction 
        of syndicated loan portfolio of $24.9 million;
      

        Demand deposits grew by $125.9 million, or 24% annualized, during the 
        quarter;
      

        Reported and Adjusted Efficiency ratio of 43.3% and 42.0%, 
        respectively;
      

        Reported and Adjusted ROA of 147 and 136 basis points, respectively; 
        and
      

        Tangible book value per share was $23.88.
      

      The Company views certain non-operating items, including but not limited 
      to merger related and restructuring charges, gain/(loss) on investment 
      securities and their corresponding tax effect, as adjustments to net 
      income. Non-operating adjustments for the second quarter of 2017 include 
      $223 thousand of severance expense, $21 thousand of other operating 
      expense and $255 thousand gain on sale of investment securities. 
      Additionally, the Company expects its 2017 annual GAAP tax rate to be 
      between 20-25% due to the accounting impact of option and warrant 
      exercises in concordance with ASU 2016-09 which was effective January 1, 
      2017.
    

      The reconciliation of non-GAAP measures (including adjusted net income, 
      adjusted efficiency ratio, adjusted ROA, tangible book value and 
      tangible book value per share), which the Company believes facilitates 
      the assessment of its banking operations and peer comparability, is 
      included in tabular form at the end of this release.
    

      Kent Ellert, Chief Executive Officer and President of FCB Financial 
      Holdings, Inc., commented, “The second quarter was another strong 
      quarter for FCB, as we are knocking on the door of $10 billion in assets 
      and continuing to generate record and improving profitability. Moving 
      forward, we remain committed to being the leading independent bank in 
      Florida and continuing to make FCB better for its shareholders, 
      customers and employees.”
    

Loan Portfolio and Composition


      During the quarter, the total loan portfolio, gross of the allowance for 
      loan losses, grew by $333.0 million to $7.3 billion as of June 30, 2017, 
      an increase of 5% from $6.9 billion as of March 31, 2017, and 21% from 
      $6.0 billion as of June 30, 2016.
    

      The Bank’s new loan portfolio totaled $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2017, 
      an increase of 5% from $6.6 billion as of March 31, 2017 and 25% from 
      $5.5 billion as of June 30, 2016. Loan growth during the quarter was a 
      result of $536.1 million of organic new loan fundings, consisting of 
      $184.3 million of commercial and industrial, $205.7 million of 
      commercial real estate and $146.1 million of residential and consumer. 
      Additionally, during the quarter the Company reduced its syndicated loan 
      portfolio by $24.9 million and sold $34.2 million of residential loans. 
      As of June 30, 2017, new loans made up 95% of the total loan portfolio 
      as compared to 95% and 92% as of March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, 
      respectively.
    

      The Bank’s acquired loan portfolio totaled $351.0 million as of June 30, 
      2017, a decrease of 4% from $366.2 million as of March 31, 2017 and a 
      decrease of 26% from $474.1 million as of June 30, 2016. The decrease in 
      the current quarter was driven by the resolution of $5.9 million of 
      loans as well as scheduled loan amortization. As of June 30, 2017, 
      acquired loans made up 5% of our total loan portfolio as compared to 5% 
      and 8% as of March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively.
    

Asset Quality


      The provision for loan losses of $2.1 million recorded for the second 
      quarter of 2017 includes a $2.3 million provision for new loans and net 
      recoupment of valuation allowance of $0.2 million for the acquired loan 
      portfolio. The provision for new loans served to increase the related 
      allowance to $37.6 million, or 0.55% of the $6.9 billion in new loans 
      outstanding. The nonperforming new loan ratio as of June 30, 2017 was 
      0.02%.
    

Deposits and Borrowings


      Deposits totaled $7.7 billion as of June 30, 2017, in line with $7.7 
      billion as of March 31, 2017 and an increase of 19% from $6.5 billion as 
      of June 30, 2016. During the second quarter of 2017, demand deposits 
      increased by $125.9 million, or 6%, from March 31, 2017 and increased by 
      $738.3 million, or 49%, from June 30, 2016. Demand deposits represent 
      29% of total deposits as of June 30, 2017 as compared to 28% and 23% as 
      of March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. The cost of deposits 
      was 82 basis points for the quarter, representing a seven basis points 
      increase from the first quarter of 2017 and a 13 basis points increase 
      from the second quarter of 2016. The primary driver of the increase over 
      the periods is attributable to the Federal Reserve rate hikes in 
      December 2016, March 2017 and June 2017.
    

Net Interest Margin and Net Interest Income


      The net interest margin for the second quarter of 2017 was 3.16%, a 
      decrease of 8 basis points from the first quarter of 2017 and a decrease 
      of 35 basis points from the second quarter of 2016. The decrease from 
      the first quarter of 2017 was due primarily to increase in funding costs 
      associated with extending the duration of our FHLB borrowings.
    

      Net interest income totaled $71.9 million in the second quarter of 2017, 
      an increase of 3% from $69.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 and an 
      increase of 11% from $64.9 million in the second quarter of 2016. 
      Interest income totaled $90.6 million for the second quarter of 2017, an 
      increase of 6% from $85.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 and an 
      increase of 17% from $77.2 million in the second quarter of 2016. 
      Interest income from new loans increased by $5.9 million, or 10%, from 
      the first quarter of 2017 due to yield expansion and continued growth in 
      the new loan portfolio. Interest income on acquired loans decreased by 
      $1.0 million, or 12%, from the first quarter due to balance runoff and a 
      reduction in loan resolutions. Interest expense was $18.7 million for 
      the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 20% from $15.6 million in the 
      first quarter of 2017 and an increase of 52% from $12.3 million in the 
      second quarter of 2016. The increase from the first quarter of 2017 was 
      a result of a 51 basis point increase on cost of borrowings associated 
      with increased duration as well as the impact of the March 2017 and June 
      2017 Federal Reserve rate hikes on deposit costs.
    

Noninterest Income and Noninterest Expense


      Noninterest income totaled $8.9 million for the second quarter of 2017 
      as compared to $10.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $8.2 
      million for the second quarter of 2016. The primary components of 
      noninterest income for the quarter were loan and other fees, bank-owned 
      life insurance income and other noninterest income of $3.0 million, $1.4 
      million and $3.0 million, respectively.
    

      Noninterest expense totaled $35.3 million for the second quarter of 
      2017, an increase of 1% from $35.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 
      and an increase of 4% from $34.0 million in the second quarter of 2016. 
      For the quarter, the Company recorded non-operating expenses of $244 
      thousand consisting of $223 thousand of severance expense and $21 
      thousand of other operating expense.
    

Financial Position


      Capital ratios continue to be strong and well in excess of regulatory 
      requirements. Our tangible common equity, Tier 1 leverage, and total 
      risk-based capital ratios were 10.5%, 10.6% and 12.9% for the second 
      quarter of 2017 respectively, compared to 10.3%, 10.5% and 12.8% for the 
      first quarter of 2017, respectively. Stockholders’ equity totaled $1.12 
      billion as of June 30, 2017, an increase of 5.9% from $1.06 billion as 
      of March 31, 2017 due to net income of $35.1 million, $18.0 million of 
      additional paid-in capital and an increase in accumulated other 
      comprehensive income of $9.0 million. The Company did not repurchase 
      common stock during the quarter. Tangible book value per common share is

Forward-Looking Statements


      This release may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning 
      of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any 
      statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, 
      predictions, forecasts, objectives or assumptions of future events or 
      performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. These 
      statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or 
      phrases such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “can,” “could,” 
      “may,” “predicts,” “potential,” “opportunity,” “should,” “will,” 
      “estimate,” “plans,” “projects,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expects,” 
      “seeks,” “intends” and similar words or phrases. Accordingly, these 
      statements involve estimates, known and unknown risks, assumptions and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual strategies, actions or results to 
      differ materially from those expressed in them, and are not guarantees 
      of timing, future results or other events or performance. Because 
      forward-looking statements are necessarily only estimates of future 
      strategies, actions or results, based on management’s current 
      expectations, assumptions and estimates on the date hereof, and there 
      can be no assurance that actual strategies, actions or results will not 
      differ materially from expectations, you are cautioned not to place 
      undue reliance on such statements. Additional information regarding 
      certain risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual 
      strategies, actions and results to differ materially from those 
      contemplated in forward-looking statements is included from time to time 
      in our filings with the SEC, including under the heading “Risk Factors” 
      in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any forward-looking 
      statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and FCB 
      Financial Holdings, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update any 
      forward-looking statement, whether to reflect events or circumstances 
      after the date on which the statement is made, to reflect new 
      information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, or otherwise.
    

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      Adjusted net income, adjusted efficiency ratio, adjusted 
      return-on-assets ("adjusted ROA"), tangible book value and tangible book 
      value per share are each non-GAAP financial measures used in this 
      release. A reconciliation to what we believe to be the most directly 
      comparable GAAP financial measures - net income in the case of adjusted 
      net income and adjusted ROA, total net interest income, total 
      noninterest income and total noninterest expense in the case of adjusted 
      efficiency ratio, and total shareholders' equity in the case of tangible 
      book value and tangible book value per share - appears in tabular form 
      at the end of this release. The Company believes each of adjusted net 
      income, adjusted efficiency ratio, and adjusted ROA is useful for both 
      investors and management to understand the effects of certain 
      noninterest items and provides additional perspective on the Company’s 
      performance over time and in comparison to the Company's competitors. 
      Neither Adjusted net income nor Adjusted ROA should be viewed as a 
      substitute for net income, nor should Adjusted efficiency ratio be 
      viewed as a substitute for total net interest income, total noninterest 
      income and total noninterest expense. The Company believes that tangible 
      book value and tangible book value per share are useful for both 
      investors and management, among other things, as these are measures 
      commonly used by financial institutions, regulators and investors to 
      measure the capital adequacy of financial institutions. The Company 
      believes these measures facilitate comparison of the quality and 
      composition of the Company's capital over time and in comparison to its 
      competitors. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for 
      total stockholders' equity.
    

      These non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations, are not required to 
      be uniformly applied and are not audited. They should not be considered 
      in isolation or as a substitute for financial results and analyses of 
      results reported under GAAP, and should be read in conjunction with the 
      Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These 
      non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures 
      reported by other companies.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Surpasses $9.9 Billion in Assets and Reports Second Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsBusiness WireJuly 25, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareWESTON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--FCB Financial Holdings, Inc. (FCB) (the "Company") today reported second quarter 2017 net income of $35.1 million, or $0.76 per share on a fully diluted basis, and adjusted net income of $32.5 million, or $0.71 per share on a fully diluted basis. Net income rose 49% year-over-year and net income per diluted share rose 39%. Adjusted net income rose 34% year-over-year and adjusted net income per diluted share rose 25%. This resulted in a ROA of 147 basis points and an adjusted ROA of 136 basis points. Fully tax equivalent net revenue of $83.0 million;  Reported and Adjusted EPS of $0.76 and $0.71 per share, respectively, on a fully diluted basis;  New loan portfolio grew sequentially at an annualized rate of 25% when excluding the impact of reducing the syndicated loan portfolio and mortgage sales;  New loan fundings of $536.1 million during the quarter and reduction of syndicated loan portfolio of $24.9 million;  Demand deposits grew by $125.9 million, or 24% annualized, during the quarter;  Reported and Adjusted Efficiency ratio of 43.3% and 42.0%, respectively;  Reported and Adjusted ROA of 147 and 136 basis points, respectively; and  Tangible book value per share was $23.88. The Company views certain non-operating items, including but not limited to merger related and restructuring charges, gain/(loss) on investment securities and their corresponding tax effect, as adjustments to net income. Non-operating adjustments for the second quarter of 2017 include $223 thousand of severance expense, $21 thousand of other operating expense and $255 thousand gain on sale of investment securities. Additionally, the Company expects its 2017 annual GAAP tax rate to be between 20-25% due to the accounting impact of option and warrant exercises in concordance with ASU 2016-09 which was effective January 1, 2017.The reconciliation of non-GAAP measures (including adjusted net income, adjusted efficiency ratio, adjusted ROA, tangible book value and tangible book value per share), which the Company believes facilitates the assessment of its banking operations and peer comparability, is included in tabular form at the end of this release.Kent Ellert, Chief Executive Officer and President of FCB Financial Holdings, Inc., commented, “The second quarter was another strong quarter for FCB, as we are knocking on the door of $10 billion in assets and continuing to generate record and improving profitability. Moving forward, we remain committed to being the leading independent bank in Florida and continuing to make FCB better for its shareholders, customers and employees.”Loan Portfolio and CompositionDuring the quarter, the total loan portfolio, gross of the allowance for loan losses, grew by $333.0 million to $7.3 billion as of June 30, 2017, an increase of 5% from $6.9 billion as of March 31, 2017, and 21% from $6.0 billion as of June 30, 2016.The Bank’s new loan portfolio totaled $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2017, an increase of 5% from $6.6 billion as of March 31, 2017 and 25% from $5.5 billion as of June 30, 2016. Loan growth during the quarter was a result of $536.1 million of organic new loan fundings, consisting of $184.3 million of commercial and industrial, $205.7 million of commercial real estate and $146.1 million of residential and consumer. Additionally, during the quarter the Company reduced its syndicated loan portfolio by $24.9 million and sold $34.2 million of residential loans. As of June 30, 2017, new loans made up 95% of the total loan portfolio as compared to 95% and 92% as of March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively.The Bank’s acquired loan portfolio totaled $351.0 million as of June 30, 2017, a decrease of 4% from $366.2 million as of March 31, 2017 and a decrease of 26% from $474.1 million as of June 30, 2016. The decrease in the current quarter was driven by the resolution of $5.9 million of loans as well as scheduled loan amortization. As of June 30, 2017, acquired loans made up 5% of our total loan portfolio as compared to 5% and 8% as of March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively.Asset QualityThe provision for loan losses of $2.1 million recorded for the second quarter of 2017 includes a $2.3 million provision for new loans and net recoupment of valuation allowance of $0.2 million for the acquired loan portfolio. The provision for new loans served to increase the related allowance to $37.6 million, or 0.55% of the $6.9 billion in new loans outstanding. The nonperforming new loan ratio as of June 30, 2017 was 0.02%.Deposits and BorrowingsDeposits totaled $7.7 billion as of June 30, 2017, in line with $7.7 billion as of March 31, 2017 and an increase of 19% from $6.5 billion as of June 30, 2016. During the second quarter of 2017, demand deposits increased by $125.9 million, or 6%, from March 31, 2017 and increased by $738.3 million, or 49%, from June 30, 2016. Demand deposits represent 29% of total deposits as of June 30, 2017 as compared to 28% and 23% as of March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. The cost of deposits was 82 basis points for the quarter, representing a seven basis points increase from the first quarter of 2017 and a 13 basis points increase from the second quarter of 2016. The primary driver of the increase over the periods is attributable to the Federal Reserve rate hikes in December 2016, March 2017 and June 2017.Read MoreNet Interest Margin and Net Interest IncomeThe net interest margin for the second quarter of 2017 was 3.16%, a decrease of 8 basis points from the first quarter of 2017 and a decrease of 35 basis points from the second quarter of 2016. The decrease from the first quarter of 2017 was due primarily to increase in funding costs associated with extending the duration of our FHLB borrowings.Net interest income totaled $71.9 million in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 3% from $69.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 and an increase of 11% from $64.9 million in the second quarter of 2016. Interest income totaled $90.6 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 6% from $85.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 and an increase of 17% from $77.2 million in the second quarter of 2016. Interest income from new loans increased by $5.9 million, or 10%, from the first quarter of 2017 due to yield expansion and continued growth in the new loan portfolio. Interest income on acquired loans decreased by $1.0 million, or 12%, from the first quarter due to balance runoff and a reduction in loan resolutions. Interest expense was $18.7 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 20% from $15.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 and an increase of 52% from $12.3 million in the second quarter of 2016. The increase from the first quarter of 2017 was a result of a 51 basis point increase on cost of borrowings associated with increased duration as well as the impact of the March 2017 and June 2017 Federal Reserve rate hikes on deposit costs.Noninterest Income and Noninterest ExpenseNoninterest income totaled $8.9 million for the second quarter of 2017 as compared to $10.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $8.2 million for the second quarter of 2016. The primary components of noninterest income for the quarter were loan and other fees, bank-owned life insurance income and other noninterest income of $3.0 million, $1.4 million and $3.0 million, respectively.Noninterest expense totaled $35.3 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 1% from $35.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 and an increase of 4% from $34.0 million in the second quarter of 2016. For the quarter, the Company recorded non-operating expenses of $244 thousand consisting of $223 thousand of severance expense and $21 thousand of other operating expense.Financial PositionCapital ratios continue to be strong and well in excess of regulatory requirements.

Stockholders’ equity totaled $1.12 billion as of June 30, 2017, an increase of 5.9% from $1.06 billion as of March 31, 2017 due to net income of $35.1 million, $18.0 million of additional paid-in capital and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $9.0 million.

Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, predictions, forecasts, objectives or assumptions of future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “can,” “could,” “may,” “predicts,” “potential,” “opportunity,” “should,” “will,” “estimate,” “plans,” “projects,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expects,” “seeks,” “intends” and similar words or phrases. Accordingly, these statements involve estimates, known and unknown risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual strategies, actions or results to differ materially from those expressed in them, and are not guarantees of timing, future results or other events or performance. Because forward-looking statements are necessarily only estimates of future strategies, actions or results, based on management’s current expectations, assumptions and estimates on the date hereof, and there can be no assurance that actual strategies, actions or results will not differ materially from expectations, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. Additional information regarding certain risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual strategies, actions and results to differ materially from those contemplated in forward-looking statements is included from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including under the heading “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and FCB Financial Holdings, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made, to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, or otherwise.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted net income, adjusted efficiency ratio, adjusted return-on-assets ("adjusted ROA"), tangible book value and tangible book value per share are each non-GAAP financial measures used in this release. A reconciliation to what we believe to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures - net income in the case of adjusted net income and adjusted ROA, total net interest income, total noninterest income and total noninterest expense in the case of adjusted efficiency ratio, and total shareholders' equity in the case of tangible book value and tangible book value per share - appears in tabular form at the end of this release. The Company believes each of adjusted net income, adjusted efficiency ratio, and adjusted ROA is useful for both investors and management to understand the effects of certain noninterest items and provides additional perspective on the Company’s performance over time and in comparison to the Company's competitors. Neither Adjusted net income nor Adjusted ROA should be viewed as a substitute for net income, nor should Adjusted efficiency ratio be viewed as a substitute for total net interest income, total noninterest income and total noninterest expense. The Company believes that tangible book value and tangible book value per share are useful for both investors and management, among other things, as these are measures commonly used by financial institutions, regulators and investors to measure the capital adequacy of financial institutions. The Company believes these measures facilitate comparison of the quality and composition of the Company's capital over time and in comparison to its competitors. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for total stockholders' equity.These non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results and analyses of results reported under GAAP, and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.About FCB Financial Holdings, Inc.FCB Financial Holdings, Inc., parent company of Florida Community Bank, N.A., (FCB) is the second largest Florida-based independent bank, and among the most highly capitalized banks in the state.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of our Class A Common 
Stock in the offering will be approximately $      million, or approximately
$      million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
full, assuming an initial public offering price of $      per share, the 
midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. This 
assumes the deduction of estimated offering expenses of $      million in 
addition to underwriting discounts and commissions. Each $1.00 increase 
(decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $      per share, 
the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus, 
would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us of the offering by $      
million, or $      million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is 
exercised in full, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth 
on the cover of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting 
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses. 
  
We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate 
purposes, including the acquisition of depository institutions through 
traditional open bank transactions and failed bank acquisitions with the 
FDIC, as well as through selective acquisitions of assets, deposits and 
branches that we believe present attractive risk-adjusted returns or provide 
a strategic benefit to our growth strategy.


The banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in 
our markets from many other financial institutions. Competition among 
financial institutions is based upon interest rates offered on deposit 
accounts, interest rates charged on loans, other credit and service charges 
relating to loans, the quality and scope of the services offered, the 
convenience of banking facilities, reputation in the community and, in the 
case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. We compete 
with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage 
banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, 
insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as 
super-regional, national and international financial institutions that 
operate offices within our market areas and beyond. Our largest banking 
competitors in our markets include Bank of America, BankAtlantic, BB&T, 
JPMorgan Chase, Regions Bank, SunTrust Bank, TD Bank and Wells Fargo. 
  
We believe that the Bank’s operation as a Florida-based regional bank with 
a broad base of local customers, as well as the local relationships of the 
Bank’s senior management team and existing and future relationship-oriented 
lending officers, enhances its ability to compete with those non-local 
financial institutions now operating in its market, but no assurances can be 
given in this regard.


Company Description
We are a bank holding company with one wholly-owned national bank subsidiary, 
Florida Community Bank, National Association, headquartered in Miami, Florida.
The Bank currently operates 44 full-service retail bank branches in Florida. 
We were formed in April 2009, and since that time have raised


 an aggregate 
of approximately $740 million of equity capital. Since January 2010, we have 
acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities (including 
substantially all deposits) of eight failed banks in Florida from the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, as receiver, including three 
acquisitions in 2010 and five acquisitions in 2011, which are collectively 
referred to as the “Acquisitions.” Six of the eight Acquisitions include 
assets that are covered by loss share arrangements, pursuant to which the 
FDIC bears a substantial portion of the risk of loss. Such acquired assets, 
including loan portfolios and other real estate owned, or OREO, that are 
covered under loss share arrangements with the FDIC are referred to as 
“Covered Assets.” 
  
Our goal is to become a leading regional banking franchise that focuses on 
commercial business relationships and provides customers with a high level 
of service. Since our first Acquisition in January 2010, our operational 
focus has been on the stabilization of our deposit base, the workout, 
collection and sale of loan and real estate assets acquired in the 
Acquisitions and positioning the Company for future growth. We intend to 
continue our acquisition strategy by selectively identifying, acquiring 
and integrating depository institutions through traditional open bank 
acquisitions and failed bank acquisitions with the FDIC. In addition, we 
may acquire assets, deposits and branches which we believe offer attractive 
risk-adjusted returns or provide a strategic benefit to our growth strategy. 
As of June 30, 2011, consolidated assets totaled approximately $3.1 billion, 
customer deposits were approximately $2.1 billion and stockholders’ equity 
totaled approximately $733.4 million. We are pursuing the offering to comply 
with our obligations under registration rights agreements we have with 
certain of our stockholders and to ensure that we maintain an appropriate 
level of regulatory capital while we continue to pursue our growth strategy.
