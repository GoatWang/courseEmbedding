What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Contingent Income Auto-Callable Securities due August 27, 2013




Based on the Performance of the Common Stock of The Dow Chemical Company




Contingent Income Auto-Callable Securities offer the opportunity for investors to earn
 a contingent quarterly
payment equal to 2.69% of the stated principal amount with respect to each quarterly determination date on which
the closing price of the underlying stock is greater than or equal to 70% of the initial share price, which we
refer to as the downside threshold level. In addition, if the closing price of the underlying stock is greater
than or equal to the initial share price on any determination date, the securities will be automatically redeemed
for an amount per security equal to the stated principal amount plus the contingent quarterly payment. However,
if on any determination date the closing price of the underlying stock is less than the initial share price, the
securities will not be redeemed and if that closing price is less than the downside threshold level, you will not
receive any contingent quarterly payment for that quarterly period. As a result, investors must be willing to
accept the risk of not receiving any contingent quarterly payment and also the risk of receiving shares of the
underlying stock, if the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the closing price of the underlying
stock is below the downside threshold level on the final determination date, in which case investors will be
exposed to the decline in the closing price of the underlying stock and the value of those shares investors
receive at maturity will be significantly less than the stated principal amount of the securities and could be
zero. Accordingly, the securities do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity and investors could lose
their entire investment in the securities. Investors will not participate in any appreciation of the underlying
stock. The securities are senior notes issued as part of Barclays Bank PLCs Global Medium-Term Notes Program.
The securities are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party, and any payment to be
made on the securities depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due.

Contingent Income Auto-Callable Securities due August 27, 2013




Based on the Performance of the Common Stock of The Dow Chemical Company



 

 


Hypothetical Examples
The below examples are based on the following terms: 



 


 




Hypothetical Initial Share Price:


$29.67




Hypothetical Downside Threshold Level:


$20.77, which is 70% of the initial share price




Hypothetical Exchange Ratio:


0.34, which is  the stated principal amount divided by the hypothetical initial share price




Hypothetical Adjustment Factor:


1.0




Hypothetical Contingent Quarterly Payment:


$0.269 (2.69% of the stated principal amount).




Stated Principal Amount:


$10 per security



In Examples 1 and 2, the closing
price of the underlying stock fluctuates over the term of the securities and the
determination closing price of the underlying stock is greater than or equal to the
hypothetical initial share price of $29.67 on one of the first three determination dates.
Because the determination closing price is greater than or equal to the initial share
price on one of the first three determination dates, the securities are automatically
redeemed following the relevant determination date. In Examples 3 and 4, the determination
closing price on the first three determination dates is less than the initial share price,
and, consequently, the securities are not automatically redeemed prior to, and remain
outstanding until, maturity.

* The Early Redemption Payment includes the unpaid
 contingent quarterly payment with respect to the determination date on which
 the determination closing price is greater than or equal to the initial share
 price and the securities are redeemed as a result.




 




■


In Example 1,
 the securities are automatically redeemed following the first determination
 date as the determination closing price on the first determination date is
 equal to the initial share price. You receive the early redemption payment,
 calculated as follows:




 




 


     stated
 principal amount + contingent quarterly payment = $10 + $0.269 = $10.269




 


 




In this
 example, the early redemption feature limits the term of your investment to
 approximately 3 months and you may not be able to reinvest at comparable
 terms or returns. If the securities are redeemed early, you will stop receiving
 contingent payments. 




 


 




■


In Example 2,
 the securities are automatically redeemed following the third determination
 date as the determination closing price on the third determination date is
 greater than the initial share price. As the determination closing price on
 the first determination date is greater than the downside threshold level,
 you receive the contingent payment of $0.269 with respect to such
 determination date. Following the third determination date, you receive an
 early redemption payment of $10.269, which includes the contingent quarterly
 payment with respect to the third determination date. 



In this example, the early redemption feature limits the term of your
investment to approximately 9 months and you may not be able to reinvest at
comparable terms or returns. If the securities are redeemed early, you will
stop receiving

contingent payments. Further, although the underlying stock has
appreciated by 25% from its initial share price on the third determination
date, you only receive $10.269 per security and do not benefit from such
appreciation.

* The final contingent quarterly
payment, if any, will be paid at maturity. 
Examples 3 and 4 illustrate the payment at maturity per security based
on the final share price. 



 


 




■


In Example 3,
 the closing price of the underlying stock remains below the downside threshold
 level throughout the term of the securities. As a result, you do not receive
 any contingent payments during the term of the securities and, at maturity,
 you are fully exposed to the decline in the closing price of the underlying
 stock. As the final share price is less than the downside threshold level,
 investors will receive a number of shares of the underlying stock equal to
 the product of the exchange ratio and the adjustment factor or the cash value
 thereof, calculated as follows: 



the cash value of 0.34 shares of the
underlying stock = the exchange ratio times
the adjustment factor times the final
share price = 0.34 x 1.0 x $14.00 = $4.76
In this example, the value of shares you
receive at maturity is significantly less than the stated principal amount.



 


 




■


In Example 4,
 the closing price of the underlying stock decreases to a final share price of
 $26.69. Although the final share price is less than the initial share price,
 because the final share price is still not less than the downside threshold
 level, you receive the stated principal amount plus a contingent quarterly
 payment with respect to the final determination date. Your payment at
 maturity is calculated as follows: 



$10 + $0.269 = $10.269
In
this example, although the final share price represents approximately a 10%
decline from the initial share price, you receive the stated principal amount
per security plus the contingent quarterly payment, equal to a total payment of
$10.269 per security at maturity.

Contingent Income Auto-Callable Securities due August 27, 2013 




Based on the Performance of the Common Stock of The Dow Chemical Company



 

 


Risk Factors
An investment in the Securities involves significant risks. We also urge you to
consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors in
connection with your investment in the Securities. Investing in the Securities
is not equivalent to investing directly in the common stock of The Dow Chemical Company. The following is a non-exhaustive list of certain
key risk factors for investors in the Securities. For further discussion of
these and other risks, you should read the sections entitled Risk Factors in
the prospectus supplement, including the risk factors discussed under the
following headings: 



 


 


 




 





Risk FactorsRisks Relating to
 All Securities; 




 





Risk FactorsAdditional Risks
 Relating to Notes Which Are Not Characterized as Being Fully Principal
 Protected or Are Characterized as Being Partially Protected or Contingently
 Protected;




 





Risk FactorsAdditional Risks Relating
 to Notes Which Pay No Interest; 




 





Risk FactorsAdditional Risks
 Relating to Securities with a Barrier Percentage or a Barrier Level; 




 





Risk
 FactorsAdditional Risks
 Relating to Securities Which We May Call or Redeem (Automatically or Otherwise);
 and




 





Risk FactorsAdditional Risks
 Relating to Securities with Reference Assets That Are Equity Securities or
 Shares or Other Interests in Exchange-Traded Funds, That Contain Equity
 Securities or Shares or Other Interests in Exchange-Traded Funds or That Are
 Based in Part on Equity Securities or Shares or Other Interests in
 Exchange-Traded Funds.







 


 




■


The securities do not guarantee the return
 of any principal. The terms of the securities differ from those of
 ordinary debt securities in that the securities do not guarantee the payment
 of regular interest or the return of any of the principal amount at maturity.
 Instead, if the securities have not been automatically redeemed prior to
 maturity and if the final share price is less than the downside threshold
 level, you will be exposed to the decline in the closing
 price of the underlying stock, as compared to the initial share price, on a 1
 to 1 basis and you will receive for each security that you hold at maturity a
 number of shares of the underlying stock equal to the exchange ratio times the adjustment factor (or, at our
 option, the cash value of such shares). The value of those shares (or that
 cash) will be less than 70% of the stated principal amount and could be zero.




 


 




■


The
contingent quarterly payment is based solely on the determination closing price
or the final share price, as applicable. Whether the contingent quarterly payment will be made
with respect to a determination date will be based on the determination closing price or the final share price, as
applicable. As
a result, you will not know whether you will receive the contingent quarterly payment until the related determination
date. Moreover, because
the contingent quarterly payment is based solely on the determination closing
price on a specific determination date or the final share price, as
applicable, if such determination closing price or final share price is less
than the downside threshold level, you will not receive any contingent
quarterly payment with respect to such determination date, even if the closing
price of the underlying stock was higher on other days during the term of the
securities. 




 


 




■


You
 will not receive any contingent quarterly payment for any quarterly period
 where the determination closing price is less than the downside threshold
 level. A contingent quarterly payment will be made with respect to a
 quarterly period only if the determination closing price is greater than or
 equal to the downside threshold level. If the determination closing price
 remains below the downside threshold level on each determination date over
 the term of the securities, you will not receive any contingent quarterly
 payments. 




 


 




■


Investors
 will not participate in any appreciation in the price of the underlying
 stock. Investors will not participate in any appreciation
 in the price of the underlying stock from the initial share price, and the
 return on the securities will be limited to the contingent quarterly payment
 that is paid with respect to each determination date on which the
 determination closing price or the final share price, as applicable, is
 greater than or equal to the downside threshold level. It is
 possible that the closing price of the underlying stock could be below the
 downside threshold level on most or all of the determination dates so that
 you will receive little or no contingent quarterly payments. If you do not earn
 sufficient contingent quarterly payments over the term of the securities, the
 overall return on the securities may be less than the amount that would be
 paid on a conventional debt security of the issuer of comparable maturity.




 


 




■


Contingent
 repayment of principal applies only at maturity. You should be willing to hold
 the securities to maturity. If you sell the securities prior to maturity in
 the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell the securities at a loss
 relative to your initial investment even if the price of the underlying stock
 is above the downside threshold level.



Page 7





 









 



 

 



Contingent Income Auto-Callable Securities due August 27, 2013 




Based on the Performance of the Common Stock of The Dow Chemical Company



 

 






 


 




■


Early redemption risk. The term of your investment in the
securities may be limited to as short as approximately three months by the automatic early redemption feature
of the securities. If the securities are redeemed prior to maturity, you will
receive no more contingent quarterly payments and may be forced to invest in
a lower interest rate environment and may not be able to reinvest at comparable
terms or returns. 




 


 




■


Reinvestment risk. If your securities are called
 early, the holding period over which you would receive the contingent
 quarterly payment could be as little as three months. There is no guarantee
 that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the
 securities in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the
 event the securities are called prior to the maturity date. 




 


 




■


Market price influenced by many unpredictable factors. Several factors will influence the
 value of the securities in the secondary market and the price at which
 Barclays Bank PLC may be willing to purchase or sell the securities in the
 secondary market. Although we expect that generally the closing price of the
 underlying stock on any day will affect the value of the securities more than
 any other single factor, other factors that may influence the value of the
 securities include: 







 


 


 


 




 


 


o


the trading price
 and volatility (frequency and magnitude of changes in value) of the underlying
 stock,




 


 


 


 




 


 


o


whether the
 determination closing price has been below the downside threshold level on
 any determination date,




 


 


 


 




 


 


o


dividend rates on
 the underlying stock,




 


 


 


 




 


 


o


interest and yield
 rates in the market, 




 


 


 


 




 


 


o


time remaining
 until the securities mature, 




 


 


 


 




 


 


o


geopolitical
 conditions and economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events
 that affect the underlying stock and which may affect the final share price
 of the underlying stock, 




 


 


 


 




 


 


o


the occurrence of
 certain events affecting the underlying stock that may or may not require an
 adjustment to the adjustment factor, and 




 


 


 


 




 


 


o


any actual or anticipated changes in our
 credit ratings or credit spreads. 




 


 


 


 




 


The price of the underlying stock may be, and has recently been, volatile, and we
can give you no assurance that the volatility will lessen. See The Dow Chemical Company Overview below. You may receive less, and possibly
significantly less, than the stated principal amount per security if you try to
sell your securities prior to maturity. 




 


 




■


The securities are subject to the credit risk of the
 Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC. The securities are senior
 unsecured debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not,
 either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment
 to be made on the securities depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to
 satisfy its obligations as they come due and are not guaranteed by a third
 party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays
 Bank PLC may affect the market value of the securities and, in the event
 Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive the
 amounts owed to you under the terms of the securities.




 


 




■


Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing in the common stock of The Dow Chemical Company. Investors in the securities will not own the
 underlying stock or have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or
 other distributions or any other rights with respect to the underlying stock.




 


 




■


No affiliation with The Dow Chemical Company. The Dow Chemical Company is not an
affiliate of ours, is not involved with this offering in any way, and has no
obligation to consider your interests in taking any corporate actions that
might affect the value of the securities. We have not made any due diligence
inquiry with respect to The Dow Chemical Company in connection
with this offering.




 


 




■


Single
 equity risk. The price of the underlying stock
 can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the underlying stock and
 its issuer, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions,
 corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and
 decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as
 general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political
 conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed
 periodically with the SEC by the issuer of the underlying stock.

■


We may engage in business with or
involving The Dow Chemical Company without regard to your interests.
We or our affiliates may presently or from time to time engage in business
with The Dow Chemical Company without regard to your interests
and thus may acquire non-public information about The Dow Chemical Company. Neither we nor any of our affiliates undertakes to
disclose any such information to you. In addition, we or our affiliates from
time to time have published and in the future may publish research reports with
respect to The Dow Chemical Company, which may or may not
recommend that investors buy or hold the underlying stock.




 


 




■


The antidilution adjustments the
 calculation agent is required to make do not cover every corporate event that
 could affect the underlying stock. Barclays Bank PLC, as calculation agent, will adjust
 the amount payable at maturity for certain corporate events affecting the
 underlying stock, such as stock splits and stock dividends, and certain other
 corporate actions involving the issuer of the underlying stock, such as
 mergers. However, the calculation agent will not make an adjustment for every
 corporate event that can affect the underlying stock. For example, the
 calculation agent is not required to make any adjustments if the issuer of
 the underlying stock or anyone else makes a partial tender or partial
 exchange offer for the underlying stock, nor will adjustments be made
 following the final determination date. If an event occurs that does not
 require the calculation agent to adjust the amount payable at maturity, the
 market price of the securities may be materially and adversely affected.




 


 




■


The securities will not be listed on any securities
exchange and secondary trading may be limited. There
may be little or no secondary market for the securities. We do not intend to
list the securities on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of
Barclays Bank PLC intend to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but are not required to do
so and may cease any such market making activities at any time. Even if a
secondary market develops, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you
to trade or sell the securities easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary
market for the securities, the price, if any, at which you may be able to trade your securities is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which
Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing
to buy the securities. Accordingly, you should be willing to hold your securities to maturity. 




 


 




■


The inclusion of commissions and projected profit
 from hedging in the original issue price is likely to adversely affect
 secondary market prices. Assuming no change in
 market conditions or any other relevant factors, the price, if any, at which
 Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC is willing to
 purchase the securities in any secondary market transactions will likely be
 lower than the original issue price since the original issue price includes,
 and secondary market prices are likely to exclude, commissions paid with
 respect to the securities, as well as the projected profit included in the
 cost of hedging the issuers obligations under the securities. In addition,
 any such prices may differ from values determined by pricing models used by
 Barclays Bank PLC, as a result of dealer discounts, mark-ups or other
 transaction costs and the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and
 other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC will be willing to purchase the
 securities from you in secondary market transactions will likely be lower
 than the price you paid for the securities, and any sale prior to the
 maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.




 


 




■


Hedging and trading activity by the
calculation agent and its affiliates could potentially affect the value of
the securities. Hedging or trading activities of the issuers
affiliates and of any other hedging counterparty with respect to the
securities on or prior to the pricing date and prior to maturity could
adversely affect the value of the underlying stock and, as a result, could
decrease the amount an investor may receive on the securities at maturity.
Any of these hedging or trading activities on or prior to the pricing date
could potentially increase the initial share price and, as a
result, the downside threshold level which is the price at or above which the
underlying stock must close on each determination date in order for you to
earn a contingent quarterly payment or, if the securities are not called
prior to maturity, in order for you to avoid being exposed to the negative
price performance of the underlying stock at maturity. Additionally, such
hedging or trading activities during the term of the securities could
potentially affect the price of the underlying stock on the determination dates
and, accordingly, whether the securities are automatically called prior to
maturity and, if the securities are not called prior to maturity, the payout
to you at maturity. 




 


 




■


The calculation agent will make
determinations with respect to the securities. As calculation agent, among other things, Barclays Bank PLC will determine the initial share price, the
determination closing prices, the downside threshold level, the final share price, whether the contingent
quarterly payment will be paid on each contingent payment date, whether the securities will be redeemed following
any determination date, whether a market disruption event has occurred, whether to make any adjustments to the
adjustment factor and the payment that you will receive upon an automatic early redemption or at maturity, if
any.  Determinations made by Barclays Bank PLC, in its capacity as calculation agent, including with respect to
the occurrence or nonoccurrence of market disruption events, may affect the payout to you upon an automatic early
redemption or at maturity.

Potential
 conflicts. We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the
 issuance of the securities, including acting as calculation agent and hedging
 our obligations under the securities. In performing these duties, the
 economic interests of the calculation agent and other affiliates of ours are
 potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities.




 


 




■


Higher
 contingent quarterly payments are generally associated with a greater risk of
 loss. Greater expected volatility with respect to the
 underlying stock reflects a higher expectation as of the pricing date that
 the price of the underlying stock could close below the downside threshold
 level on the valuation date of the securities. This greater expected
 risk will generally be reflected in a higher contingent quarterly payment for
 that security. However, while the contingent
 quarterly payment is set on the pricing date, the underlying stocks volatility may change
 significantly over the term of the securities. The price of the underlying
 stock for your securities could fall sharply, which could result in a
 significant loss of principal. 




 


 




■


Suitability of the securities for
investment. You should reach a decision to invest in the securities after
carefully considering, with your advisors, the suitability of the securities in
light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in
this pricing supplement, the prospectus supplement, and the prospectus. Neither
the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the
suitability of the securities for investment. 




 


 




■


In some circumstances, the payment you
 receive on the securities may be based on the stock of another company and
 not the underlying stock. Following certain corporate events relating to
 the issuer of the underlying stock where the issuer is not the surviving
 entity, your return on the securities paid by Barclays Bank PLC may be based
 on the shares of a successor to the respective underlying stock issuer or any
 cash or any other assets distributed to holders of the underlying stock in
 such corporate event. The occurrence of these corporate events and the
 consequent adjustments may materially and adversely affect the value of the
 securities. For more information, see the section Reference AssetsEquity
 SecuritiesShare Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security
 as the Reference Asset of the prospectus supplement. 




 


 




■


The U.S. federal income tax treatment of an
 investment in the securities is uncertain. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the securities is uncertain and the Internal Revenue Service could assert
that the securities should be taxed in a manner that is different than described below.  As discussed further in
the accompanying prospectus supplement, the Internal Revenue Service issued a notice in 2007 indicating that it
and the Treasury Department are actively considering whether, among other issues, you should be required to
accrue interest over the term of an instrument such as the securities at a rate that may exceed the contingent
quarterly payments (if any) that you receive on the securities and whether all or part of the gain you may
recognize upon the sale, exchange, early redemption or maturity of an instrument such as the securities could be
treated as ordinary income.  Similarly, the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department have current
projects open with regard to the tax treatment of pre-paid forward contracts, contingent notional principal
contracts and other derivative contracts.  While it is impossible to anticipate how any ultimate guidance would
affect the tax treatment of instruments such as the securities (and while any such guidance may be issued on a
prospective basis only), such guidance could be applied retroactively and could in any case (i) increase the
likelihood that you will be required to accrue income even if you do not receive any payments with respect to the
securities until early redemption or maturity and (ii) require you to accrue income in excess of any contingent
quarterly payments received on the securities.  The outcome of this process is uncertain.  In addition, any
character mismatch
 arising from your inclusion of ordinary income in respect of the contingent
 quarterly payments and capital loss (if any) upon the sale, exchange, early redemption or maturity of your securities may result in
 adverse tax consequences to you because an investors ability to deduct
 capital losses is subject to significant limitations. You should consult your tax
 advisor as to the possible alternative treatments in respect of the
 securities.

Additional Provisions:


 


 




Record date:


One business day prior to the related contingent payment date.




 


 




No fractional shares:


At maturity, if the payment on the securities, if any, is
to be made in shares of the underlying stock, we will deliver the number of
shares of the underlying stock due with respect to the securities,  as described
above,  but we will pay cash in lieu of delivering any  fractional  share of the
underlying  stock in an amount  equal to the  corresponding  fractional  closing
price of such fraction of a share of the underlying  stock, as determined by the
calculation agent as of the final determination date.




 


 




Postponement of maturity date:


The maturity date will be postponed if the final determination
date is postponed due to the occurrence or continuance of a market
disruption   event  with  respect  to  the   underlying   stock  on  such  final
determination  date. In such a case,  the maturity date will be postponed by the
same number of business days from but excluding the originally  scheduled  final
valuation date; provided that, the final determination date may not be postponed
to a  date  later  than  the  originally  scheduled  maturity  date,  or if  the
originally  scheduled  maturity date is not a business day, later than the first
business day after the  originally  scheduled  maturity  date. See Terms of the
Notes  Maturity Date and Reference AssetsEquity SecuritiesMarket Disruption

Tax considerations:


The material tax consequences of your investment in the
securities are summarized below.  The discussion below supplements the
discussion  under  Certain  U.S.  Federal  Income  Tax  Considerations  in the
accompanying  prospectus  supplement.  Except as noted under Non-U.S.  Holders
below,  this section applies to you only if you are a U.S. holder (as defined in
the accompanying  prospectus supplement) and you hold your securities as capital
assets for tax purposes and does not apply to you if you are a member of a class
of  holders  subject  to  special  rules  or are  otherwise  excluded  from  the
discussion in the prospectus  supplement  (for example,  if you did not purchase
your securities in the initial  issuance of the securities).  In addition,  this
discussion  does not apply to you if you purchase your  securities for less than
the principal amount of the securities.




 


 


 




 


The United States federal income tax consequences of
your investment in the securities are uncertain and the Internal Revenue Service
could assert that the  securities  should be taxed in a manner that is different
than described below. Pursuant to the terms of the securities, Barclays Bank PLC
and you  agree,  in the  absence  of a  change  in law or an  administrative  or
judicial ruling to the contrary, to characterize your securities as a contingent
income bearing executory contract with respect to the underlying stock.










 


 


 




 


If your securities are properly treated as a contingent
income bearing executory contract, it would be reasonable (i) to treat any
contingent quarterly payments you receive on the securities as items of ordinary
income  taxable in accordance  with your regular  method of accounting  for U.S.
federal income tax purposes and (ii) to recognize  capital gain or loss upon the
sale, exchange,  early redemption or maturity of your securities (subject to the
discussion  below  regarding  the receipt of shares of the  underlying  stock at
maturity) in an amount equal to the  difference  (if any) between the amount you
receive at such time (other than amounts  attributable to a contingent quarterly
payment) and your basis in the securities for U.S.  federal income tax purposes.
Such gain or loss should generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have
held your securities for more than one year, and otherwise  should  generally be
short-term capital gain or loss.  Short-term capital gains are generally subject
to tax at the marginal tax rates  applicable to ordinary  income.  Any character
mismatch arising from your



Page 13





 









 



 
 



Contingent Income Auto-Callable Securities due August 27, 2013




Based on the Performance of the Common Stock of The Dow Chemical Company



 

 






 


 


 




 


 


 




 


inclusion of ordinary income in respect of the contingent
quarterly payments and capital loss (if any) upon the sale, exchange, early
redemption or maturity of your securities may result in adverse tax consequences
to you  because an  investors  ability to deduct  capital  losses is subject to
significant  limitations.  Moreover,  in the  event  you  receive  shares of the
underlying stock upon the maturity of the securities,  such loss may be deferred
(as described in the following  paragraph).






 


 


 




 


 


 




 


If  you receive shares of the
underlying stock upon the maturity of your  securities,  it is not clear whether
the receipt of shares of the underlying stock should be treated as (i) a taxable
settlement  of the  securities  followed  by a purchase  of the shares or (ii) a
tax-free  purchase  of  the  shares  pursuant  to  the  original  terms  of  the
securities.  Accordingly,  you should  consult  your tax  advisor  about the tax
consequences  to you of  receiving  shares  of the  underlying  stock  upon  the
maturity  of your  securities.  If the  receipt  of the  shares is  treated as a
taxable  settlement of the securities  followed by a purchase of the shares, you
should (i) recognize  capital loss in an amount equal to the difference  between
the fair  market  value of the  shares  you  receive  at such time plus the cash
received  in lieu of a  fractional  share,  if any,  and your  tax  basis in the
securities,  and (ii) take a basis in such  shares  in an amount  equal to their
fair market value at such time. If, alternatively,  the receipt of shares of the
underlying  stock upon the maturity of your  securities is treated as a tax-free
purchase of the shares,  (i) the receipt of shares of the underlying  stock upon
maturity of your securities  should not give rise to the current  recognition of
gain or loss at such time, (ii) you should take a carryover basis in such shares
equal to the basis you had in your  securities  (determined as described  below,
less the basis  attributable  to a fractional  share,  if any), and (iii) if you
receive cash in lieu of a  fractional  share upon the stock  settlement  of such
securities, you should recognize short-term capital loss equal to the difference
between  the  amount of cash you  receive  and your tax basis in the  fractional
share. In general,  your tax basis in your securities will be equal to the price
you paid for the securities.  Your holding period in the shares you receive upon
the  maturity of your  securities  will begin on the day after you receive  such
shares.




 


 


 




 


In the opinion of our special tax counsel, Sullivan &
Cromwell  LLP, it would be  reasonable  to treat your  securities  in the manner
described  above.  This opinion assumes that the description of the terms of the
securities in this pricing supplement is materially correct.




 


 


 




 


NO STATUTORY, JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY DIRECTLY
DISCUSSES HOW YOUR SECURITIES SHOULD BE TREATED FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME
TAX PURPOSES.  AS A RESULT,  THE U.S.  FEDERAL INCOME TAX  CONSEQUENCES  OF YOUR
INVESTMENT IN THE SECURITIES ARE UNCERTAIN.  ACCORDINGLY, WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT
YOUR  TAX   ADVISOR   AS  TO  THE  TAX   CONSEQUENCES   OF   INVESTING   IN  THE
SECURITIES.




 


 


 




 


Alternative  Treatments.  As discussed further
in the  accompanying  prospectus  supplement,  the Treasury  Department  and the
Internal Revenue Service are actively considering various alternative treatments
that may apply to instruments such as the securities,  possibly with retroactive
effect.  Other  alternative  treatments for your securities may also be possible
under  current law. For example,  it is possible  that the  securities  could be
treated  as  debt  instruments  subject  to  the  special  tax  rules  governing
contingent payment debt instruments.  Under the contingent  payment  obligations
rules,  you generally would be required to accrue interest on a current basis in
respect of the  securities  over their  term based on the  comparable  yield and
projected  payment  schedule for the  securities and pay tax  accordingly,  even
though these amounts may exceed the contingent  quarterly payments (if any) that
are made on the securities. This comparable yield and projected payment schedule
are  determined  solely to calculate the amount on which you will be taxed prior
to maturity  and are  neither a  prediction  nor a guarantee  of what the actual
yield and actual  payments on the securities will be. You would also be required
to make  adjustments  to your accruals if the actual amounts that you receive in
any  taxable  year  differ  from  the  amounts  shown on the  projected  payment
schedule. In addition,  any gain you may recognize on the sale, exchange,  early
redemption  or maturity of the  securities  would be taxed as ordinary  interest
income and any loss you may recognize on the sale, exchange, early redemption or
maturity of the securities would generally be ordinary loss to the extent of the
interest  you  previously  included  as income  without an  offsetting  negative
adjustment  and  thereafter  would be capital loss.  You should consult your tax
advisor  as  to  the  special   rules  that  govern   contingent   payment  debt
instruments.




 


 


 




 


It is also possible that your securities could be
treated as an investment unit consisting of (i) a debt instrument that is issued to
you by us and (ii) a put  option in  respect  of the  underlying  stock  that is
issued by you to us. For a discussion  of the tax  considerations  applicable to
this alternative treatment, please see the discussion under the heading Certain
U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsCertain Notes Treated as Deposits and Put
Options in the accompanying prospectus supplement.




 


 


 




 


In addition, it is possible that (i) you should not
include the contingent quarterly payments in income as you receive them and
instead  you should  reduce your basis in your  securities  by the amount of the
contingent quarterly payments that you receive;  (ii) you should not include the
contingent  quarterly  payments in income as you receive them and instead,  upon
the sale, exchange, early redemption or maturity of your securities,  you should
recognize short-term capital gain or loss in an amount equal to



Page 14

the difference between (a) the amount of the contingent
quarterly payments paid to you over the term of the securities (including the
contingent  quarterly  payment  received at early  redemption or maturity or the
amount  of  cash  that  you  receive  upon a sale  that is  attributable  to the
contingent  quarterly  payments to be paid on the securities) and (b) the excess
(if any) of (1) the amount you paid for your  securities  over (2) the amount of
cash you receive upon the sale,  early  redemption or maturity;  or (iii);  if a
contingent  quarterly  payment is paid at early  redemption  or  maturity,  such
contingent  quarterly  payment  should not  separately  be taken into account as
ordinary  income but  instead  should  increase  the  amount of capital  gain or
decrease the amount of capital loss that you  recognize at early  redemption  or
maturity.




 


 


 




 


You should consult your tax advisor with respect to these possible alternative treatments.




 


 


 




 


For a further discussion of the tax treatment of your
securities as well as other possible alternative characterizations, please see
the   discussion   under  the  heading   Certain   U.S.   Federal   Income  Tax
ConsiderationsCertain   Notes   Treated  as  Forward   Contracts  or  Executory
Contracts in the accompanying  prospectus  supplement.  You should consult your
tax  advisor  as to  the  possible  alternative  treatments  in  respect  of the
securities.  For  additional,  important  considerations  related  to tax  risks
associated  with  investing  in the  securities,  you should  also  examine  the
discussion in Risk  ConsiderationsThe  U.S. federal income tax treatment of an
investment    in   the    securities    is    uncertain,    in   this   pricing
supplement.






 


 




 


 
 Specified Foreign Financial
Asset   Reporting.  Under  legislation  enacted  in  2010,  owners  of
specified  foreign  financial  assets  with an  aggregate  value in  excess of
$50,000 (and in some circumstances,  a higher threshold) may be required to file
an  information  report  with  respect to such  assets  with their tax  returns.
Specified  foreign financial  assets generally include any financial  accounts
maintained by foreign  financial  institutions,  as well as any of the following
(which may include your  securities),  but only if they are not held in accounts
maintained  by  financial  institutions:  (i)  stocks and  securities  issued by
non-U.S.  persons,  (ii) financial instruments and contracts held for investment
that have  non-U.S.  issuers or  counterparties  and (iii)  interests in foreign
entities.  Holders  are  urged to  consult  their  tax  advisors  regarding  the
application of this legislation to their ownership of the securities.
Non-U.S. Holders. Barclays currently
does not  withhold  on  payments  to  non-U.S.  holders.  However,  if  Barclays
determines that there is a material risk that it will be required to withhold on
any such payments, Barclays may withhold on any contingent quarterly payments at
a 30% rate,  unless you have provided to Barclays (i) a valid  Internal  Revenue
Service  Form  W-8ECI  or (ii) a valid  Internal  Revenue  Service  Form  W-8BEN
claiming tax treaty benefits that reduce or eliminate  withholding.  If Barclays
elects to withhold and you have provided  Barclays with a valid Internal Revenue
Service  Form W-8BEN  claiming  tax treaty  benefits  that  reduce or  eliminate
withholding,  Barclays  may  nevertheless  withhold  up  to  30%  on  contingent
quarterly payments it makes to you if there is any possible  characterization of
the   payments   that   would  not  be  exempt   from   withholding   under  the
treaty.In   addition,   the  Treasury  Department  has  issued  proposed
regulations  under  Section  871(m) of the  Internal  Revenue  Code which  could
ultimately  require  us to treat all or a portion  of any  payment in respect of
your  securities  as  a  dividend   equivalent  payment  that  is  subject  to
withholding  tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable  treaty).
You could also be required to make certain  certifications  in order to avoid or
minimize such withholding  obligations,  and you could be subject to withholding
(subject to your  potential  right to claim a refund from the  Internal  Revenue
Service) if such certifications were not received or were not satisfactory.  You
should consult your tax advisor  concerning  the potential  application of these
regulations  to payments you receive with respect to the  securities  when these
regulations are finalized.

for each security they sell.
We expect that delivery of the securities will be made
against payment for the securities on or about the issue date indicated on the
cover of this pricing supplement, which will be the third business day following
the expected  pricing date (this  settlement  cycle being referred to as T+3).

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
