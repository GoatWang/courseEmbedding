History[edit]
Sigma Designs was founded in 1982 and is based in Fremont, California, with locations in Canada, Denmark, France, Israel, Japan, Netherlands and Singapore. In September 2002, Sigma Designs and Thirdspace, the broadband TV enablement company, announced that they were combining technologies to improve the quality of streaming video solutions over broadband Internet Protocol (IP) networks.[5]
Sigma Designs began making boards for computers, such as the ReelMagic MPEG decoder.[6] Its products were used in many of the first Blu-ray players since 2005.[7] Sigma media processors also have more than ten-year history in the IPTV market.
In late 2007 Sigma Designs released the first 1080p capable media player chipset, the SMP863x. It spawned a series of stand-alone media players from early 2008 onwards.[3][4]
Sigma Designs' products are sold worldwide through a direct sales force and distributors. Sigma's Common Stock, publicly traded since 1986, is listed on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol SIGM.
Acquisitions[edit]
On February 8, 2008, Sigma Designs completed its acquisition of Canadian manufacturer Gennum’s VXP image processing business.[8] This technology was used in video projectors. In January 2011, Sigma announced it was adding the VXP technology to its SMP8910 system-on-a-chip.[9]
On December 18, 2008, Sigma Designs announced the acquisition of California-based Zensys, a company that provides the wireless mesh networking technology Z-Wave.[10]
On October 14, 2009, Sigma purchased Israeli home-networking chip maker CopperGate for $160 million in cash and stock.[11] CopperGate technologies included HomePNA and HomePlug AV networking technologies. Sigma has since updated HomePlug AV to include ClearPath, an award-winning technology which significantly increases throughput.[12]
On March 21, 2012, Sigma announced that it has signed an asset purchase agreement to serve as the "stalking horse bidder" to acquire certain assets of Trident Microsystems, Inc.’s Digital Television (DTV) Business, which includes certain products, licensed intellectual property, software and leased facilities, for $21 million in cash plus assumption of specified liabilities.[13]
Product divisions[edit]
Sigma Designs provides system-on-a-chip (SoC) products to deliver entertainment and control to consumers:
Media and Video Processing[edit]
On July 9, 2010, Sigma Designs announced its media processors were used by French company, Free Inc., to deliver the first 3D broadcasts of the World Cup, as well as Europe’s first ongoing 3D content.[14]
Sigma Designs offers media and video processing technology, with the SMP8910 and SMP8670 processors, introduced at the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show.[15] The 2011 technology offered VXP video processing to clean up artifacts and picture quality on High Definition and 3D content. Although the 8910 chipset was announced at CES (January) 2011, no implementations of this chipset seemed imminent until September 2012. In September 2012, Syabas demonstrated their new Popcorn Hour A-400 media player using the 8911 non-macromedia version of the 8910 chipset at IFA 2012 and Cedia 2012. It is expected to start shipping November 2012. http://www.anandtech.com/show/6235/syabas-launches-popcorn-hour-a400 http://www.missingremote.com/syabas
Home AV Networking[edit]
Sigma Designs' AV Network products include:

HomePNA and HomePlug AV products use existing wires in homes (coaxial cable, phone lines, or AC power lines) and deliver as much as 200 Mbit/s of throughput. These are marketed with what the company calls ClearPath technology which avoids noise on typical power lines.[16] As of November 2010, Sigma Designs shipped more than 20 million HomePNA chipsets.[17]
Sigma announced G.hn products in October 2010 claimed to be capable of delivering up to 3 Gbit/s.[18] These were marketed under the name ClearPath Extreme.[19]

In June 2011, Sigma announced an “Ultra-Thin Set-Top Box” reference platform named Skini that provides over-the-top content along with over-the-air and cable functionality.[20][21]
Home Control[edit]
Sigma Designs develops and markets the Z-Wave protocol for home control. Z-Wave is a wireless radio frequency communications technology designed for control and status reading applications in residential and light commercial environments. Z-Wave has an alliance and more than 1,500[22] interoperable products in a certification program. On May 23, 2011, Sigma announced Japanese manufacturer Mitsumi as a licensed second source for Z-Wave technology.[1] The company secured Verizon as a partner, with the telecom giant expected to roll out home control and security services through Z-Wave in the fall of 2011.[23]
Xvid controversy[edit]
In July 2002, Sigma Designs released an MPEG-4 video codec called the REALmagic MPEG-4 Video Codec. Before long, people testing this new codec found that it contained considerable portions of Xvid code. Sigma Designs was contacted and confirmed that a programmer had based REALmagic on Xvid, but assured that all GPL code would be replaced to avoid copyright infringement. When Sigma Designs released the supposedly rewritten REALmagic codec, the Xvid developers immediately disassembled it and concluded that it still contained Xvid code, only rearranged in an attempt to disguise its presence. The Xvid developers decided to stop work and go public to force Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. After articles were published in Slashdot[24] and The Inquirer,[25] in August 2002 Sigma Designs agreed to publish their source code.[26]

These are marketed with what the company calls ClearPath technology which avoids noise on typical power lines.[16] As of November 2010, Sigma Designs shipped more than 20 million HomePNA chipsets.[17]
Sigma announced G.hn products in October 2010 claimed to be capable of delivering up to 3 Gbit/s.[18] These were marketed under the name ClearPath Extreme.[19]

In June 2011, Sigma announced an “Ultra-Thin Set-Top Box” reference platform named Skini that provides over-the-top content along with over-the-air and cable functionality.[20][21]
Home Control[edit]
Sigma Designs develops and markets the Z-Wave protocol for home control. Z-Wave is a wireless radio frequency communications technology designed for control and status reading applications in residential and light commercial environments. Z-Wave has an alliance and more than 1,500[22] interoperable products in a certification program. On May 23, 2011, Sigma announced Japanese manufacturer Mitsumi as a licensed second source for Z-Wave technology.[1] The company secured Verizon as a partner, with the telecom giant expected to roll out home control and security services through Z-Wave in the fall of 2011.[23]
Xvid controversy[edit]
In July 2002, Sigma Designs released an MPEG-4 video codec called the REALmagic MPEG-4 Video Codec. Before long, people testing this new codec found that it contained considerable portions of Xvid code. Sigma Designs was contacted and confirmed that a programmer had based REALmagic on Xvid, but assured that all GPL code would be replaced to avoid copyright infringement. When Sigma Designs released the supposedly rewritten REALmagic codec, the Xvid developers immediately disassembled it and concluded that it still contained Xvid code, only rearranged in an attempt to disguise its presence. The Xvid developers decided to stop work and go public to force Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. After articles were published in Slashdot[24] and The Inquirer,[25] in August 2002 Sigma Designs agreed to publish their source code.[26]

History[edit]
Sigma Designs was founded in 1982 and is based in Fremont, California, with locations in Canada, Denmark, France, Israel, Japan, Netherlands and Singapore. In September 2002, Sigma Designs and Thirdspace, the broadband TV enablement company, announced that they were combining technologies to improve the quality of streaming video solutions over broadband Internet Protocol (IP) networks.[5]
Sigma Designs began making boards for computers, such as the ReelMagic MPEG decoder.[6] Its products were used in many of the first Blu-ray players since 2005.[7] Sigma media processors also have more than ten-year history in the IPTV market.
In late 2007 Sigma Designs released the first 1080p capable media player chipset, the SMP863x. It spawned a series of stand-alone media players from early 2008 onwards.[3][4]
Sigma Designs' products are sold worldwide through a direct sales force and distributors. Sigma's Common Stock, publicly traded since 1986, is listed on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol SIGM.
Acquisitions[edit]
On February 8, 2008, Sigma Designs completed its acquisition of Canadian manufacturer Gennum’s VXP image processing business.[8] This technology was used in video projectors. In January 2011, Sigma announced it was adding the VXP technology to its SMP8910 system-on-a-chip.[9]
On December 18, 2008, Sigma Designs announced the acquisition of California-based Zensys, a company that provides the wireless mesh networking technology Z-Wave.[10]
On October 14, 2009, Sigma purchased Israeli home-networking chip maker CopperGate for $160 million in cash and stock.[11] CopperGate technologies included HomePNA and HomePlug AV networking technologies. Sigma has since updated HomePlug AV to include ClearPath, an award-winning technology which significantly increases throughput.[12]
On March 21, 2012, Sigma announced that it has signed an asset purchase agreement to serve as the "stalking horse bidder" to acquire certain assets of Trident Microsystems, Inc.’s Digital Television (DTV) Business, which includes certain products, licensed intellectual property, software and leased facilities, for $21 million in cash plus assumption of specified liabilities.[13]
Product divisions[edit]
Sigma Designs provides system-on-a-chip (SoC) products to deliver entertainment and control to consumers:
Media and Video Processing[edit]
On July 9, 2010, Sigma Designs announced its media processors were used by French company, Free Inc., to deliver the first 3D broadcasts of the World Cup, as well as Europe’s first ongoing 3D content.[14]
Sigma Designs offers media and video processing technology, with the SMP8910 and SMP8670 processors, introduced at the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show.[15] The 2011 technology offered VXP video processing to clean up artifacts and picture quality on High Definition and 3D content. Although the 8910 chipset was announced at CES (January) 2011, no implementations of this chipset seemed imminent until September 2012. In September 2012, Syabas demonstrated their new Popcorn Hour A-400 media player using the 8911 non-macromedia version of the 8910 chipset at IFA 2012 and Cedia 2012. It is expected to start shipping November 2012. http://www.anandtech.com/show/6235/syabas-launches-popcorn-hour-a400 http://www.missingremote.com/syabas

In June 2011, Sigma announced an “Ultra-Thin Set-Top Box” reference platform named Skini that provides over-the-top content along with over-the-air and cable functionality.[20][21]
Home Control[edit]
Sigma Designs develops and markets the Z-Wave protocol for home control. Z-Wave is a wireless radio frequency communications technology designed for control and status reading applications in residential and light commercial environments. Z-Wave has an alliance and more than 1,500[22] interoperable products in a certification program. On May 23, 2011, Sigma announced Japanese manufacturer Mitsumi as a licensed second source for Z-Wave technology.[1] The company secured Verizon as a partner, with the telecom giant expected to roll out home control and security services through Z-Wave in the fall of 2011.[23]

When Sigma Designs released the supposedly rewritten REALmagic codec, the Xvid developers immediately disassembled it and concluded that it still contained Xvid code, only rearranged in an attempt to disguise its presence. The Xvid developers decided to stop work and go public to force Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. After articles were published in Slashdot[24] and The Inquirer,[25] in August 2002 Sigma Designs agreed to publish their source code.[26]

        FREMONT, Calif., July 26, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) - Sigma Designs ® (NASDAQ:SIGM), a leading provider of Smart TV platforms and IoT devices, today announced that its Board of Directors has engaged Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as a financial advisor to assist in its exploration of strategic alternatives that may enhance stockholder value.  As previously disclosed, Sigma has been carefully reviewing all of its product lines to determine which offer the best synergistic fit with its long-term growth plans.  This review may result in Sigma continuing to implement value-enhancing initiatives as a standalone company, such as the continued implementation of its previously announced restructuring plans, a sale of the company or certain product lines, or other possible transactions.
      

        No decision has been made to enter into any transaction at this time, and there is no assurance that the Board's exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction being entered into or consummated.  In addition, there is no set timetable for the exploration of strategic alternatives.
      

        Sigma Designs does not intend to disclose developments or provide updates on the progress or status of this process unless it approves a specific transaction requiring disclosure or otherwise completes its review.
