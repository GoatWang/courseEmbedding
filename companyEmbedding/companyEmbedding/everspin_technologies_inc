 RAID









 
Case Study:  RAID Controller Cards
Everspin MRAM was the memory selected for the journal memory on LSI Corporation's (Now Avago Technologies) RAID controller cards featuring 6Gb/s and 12Gb/s SAS storage connectivity.  Everspin MRAM performs the write journal or data log function in their RAID disk arrays.  
The MRAM captures transaction information in real-time so that data can be recovered should a system failure occur. Data logs written to MRAM also capture system conditions and status for remote diagnostics and repair.  MRAM chips were also included on LSI Corporation's reference designs for third party RAID cards and RAID-on-Motherboard (ROMB) solutions.
MRAM in RAID Controller Applications
Everspin MRAM is fast write, able to store data in real-time and is non-volatile with 20 years retention over the operating temperature range.  External batteries or capacitors are not required.
 
 Case Study:  RAID-on-Chip Journal Memory

As well as for its fast-write without requiring load leveling or ECC overhead, Dell selected MRAM because MRAM non-volatility supports enhanced data center fault recovery, reduced system downtime and lower total cost of ownership. In addition, the fast write times of MRAM without load leveling or ECC overhead simplifies system design.
MRAM in RAID Servers
MRAM’s performance, high endurance and non-volatility allows Dell to provide industry leading RAID servers with enhanced data center fault recovery, reduced system downtime and lower total cost of ownership.

MRAM Replaces nvSRAM
 MRAM Replaces nvSRAM









 
Why Replace a Non-volatile SRAM with MRAM?
Every write with an MRAM is instantly non-volatile for at least 20 years. There is no transfer of data from a volatile to a non-volatile memory cell, no external capacitors or back up batteries. The elimination of external components, highly reliable data retention, and 35ns SRAM compatible READ/WRITE access times make the Everspin MRAM a viable candidate for increasing system memory density without major PCB changes while reducing system cost without compromising system performance.
nvSRAM
Non-volatile SRAM (nvSRAM) is an SRAM memory that is made up of two functional components paired in the same physical cell. One component is a standard SRAM memory cell and the other component is a non-volatile cell that acts as a backup to the SRAM cell. Data are transferred to and from the non-volatile cell by Store and Recall commands. Data are protected during power loss by using either an external capacitor or an external battery to power a Store command.
Magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM)
Magnetoresistive RAM is inherently non-volatile, with unlimited endurance for stored data, even when power is lost.

Immediate (<1ns) Power-off with no loss of data.
Always non-volatile. No unreliable capacitor-dependent backup cycles.
No VCAP or VBATT required.
No complex software STORE/RECALL routines.
20-Year data retention with no cycling dependence.
Fewer components mean a smaller design footprint and lower total BOM cost.
No wear-out concerns.
In many cases directly replaces the Cypress nvSRAM.
