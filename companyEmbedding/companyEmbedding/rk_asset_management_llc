RK Asset Management is an independent advisory firm of one of the nation’s fastest growing independent broker/dealer firms, Kovack Securities Inc. Based in Tampa, Florida, RK Asset Management includes an array of financial planning, employee benefits and insurance services. As a representative of KSI, RK Asset Management clients have their financial accounts held and cleared through National Financial Services (NFS) a Fidelity Investment Company. NFS provides financial and investment services to a global correspondent firm network. As member of the New York Stock Exchange, NFS provides a broad range of investment-related products and services to the financial services community, which includes clearance, execution, settlement and management information services.
RK Asset Managements’s founder, Rodger Kamuf, is a well-known financial planner in the Tampa Bay area. In recent years, Rodger has not only advised people on their wealth, he has developed a specialty in advising individuals who also need to insure their employees or families health. Rodger has counseled hundreds of individuals and business owners on how to avoid the important pitfalls when buying health insurance and other benefits. In response to the overwhelming demand he created www.FloridianQuote.com, an online insurance portal where individuals and business owners can get real time health information and quotes. Rodger is a graduate of University of South Florida where he majored in finance and earned his BS degree. He began his career at Morgan Stanley, gaining his comprehensive knowledge of personal financial planning issues. After several years with Morgan Stanley, he left to continue the brokerage business at Josephthal and Co. In 2001, Rodger founded RK Asset Management to better address all investor’s needs. “The main reason for starting my own business was to provide a complete financial planning package for my clients and future clients. Although the large brokerage houses are a great place to gain experience  they lack in the ability to help advisors plan beyond an investment portfolio, like adding quality health insurance and employee benefits packages. Over the years I have implemented my brokerage background with the knowledge of insurance services. The key to a good financial planner today is to understand the clients needs and implement investment and insurance products in their overall plan.”

Consensus Ratings for Dorman Products (NASDAQ:DORM) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: $78.00 (0.27% downside)

Consensus Ratings for Dorman Products (NASDAQ:DORM) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: $78.00 (0.27% downside)
