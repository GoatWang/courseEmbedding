What are analysts saying about Amphastar Pharmaceuticals stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Amphastar Pharmaceuticals stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company. It focuses primarily on developing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling generic and proprietary injectable and inhalation products. The company products include Enoxaparin Sodium Injection; Amphadase; Cortrosyn for Injection; and prefilled disposable emergency syringes for crash cart use. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is headquartered in Rancho Cucamonga, California.   " (5/16/2017)
2. Piper Jaffray Companies analysts commented, "Amphastar reported 4Q16 diluted EPS of $0.01 on revenues of $63.5M, compared to Street estimates of ($0.01) and $55.9M, respectively. Though the base business is facing some challenges as we move further into 2017 (i.e., uncertainty over the trajectory of generic enoxaparin; the potential removal of AMPH's injectable epinephrine given that it is an unapproved product), we nonetheless remain bullish on AMPH shares, given that the pipeline continues to advance and given our view that it very much has the potential to drive transformative longer-term cash generation (AMPH also being one of the few generics companies solely focused on more complex dosage forms also doesn't hurt). We reiterate our Overweight rating and are lowering our PT to $20 from $22 (see below for more details)." (3/14/2017)
3. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, " AMPH reported 4Q16 revenue of $63.5mm vs. BMO/consensus $56.5mm/ $55.9mm and adj. EPS of $0.01 vs. BMO/consensus $0.02/($0.01). Revenue upside was offset by lower gross margin and higher R&D. Without 2017 revenue/EPS guidance, there is some uncertainty with the numbers given a number of moving parts, including Enoxaparin sales, potential withdrawal of Epinephrine vials, overall pricing pressure, contribution from new approvals, and higher spending levels to invest in the pipeline. We are lowering estimates and our target goes to $16 from $18. The pipeline has value, but we await near-term execution." (3/14/2017)
4. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "While AMPH reported 4Q16 results that bested the Street's expectations on both top and bottom lines, the company has taken its lumps from the FDA over the last three months. Two recent CRLs (Primatene Mist and intranasal naloxone) have delayed two branded product opportunities by at least 12 months. FDA recently requested that AMPH discontinue the distribution of its epinephrine vial product, which generated $18.6MM in 2016 revenues. The last shot on goal in terms of potential near-term approvals is an ANDA product (undisclosed injectable), which AMPH mgmt expects will make meaningful sales contributions in 2017. The ANDA product pipeline is expected to make additional contributions in 2018. We maintain our Buy rating and adjust our PT to $18 (from $20) to account for a reduction in base business revenues."

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AMPH) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.83)Consensus Price Target: $20.17 (14.84% upside)
