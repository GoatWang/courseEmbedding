The new owners are actively fixing up their property.   They seem to care about it.  It was neglected, dangerous before Lynd came along.  The managers? We haven't needed their help so can't comment on whether they're responsive or helpful. I would hope that they spell out what are the policies here and enforce them cause some of these folks are despicable.   Unsupervised kids are one of the biggest problems. Kids between 7 and 11 years old, wild and will challenge you if you dare say something about them throwing rocks or running in the parking lots.  They're constantly messing around other people's cars.   We have cracked windows from them throwing rocks at windows and cars and each other.  Wish they'd get rid of the landscape rocks!  I think we'd be in a much better place if the parents were compelled to get out of bed and watch their children.  Unless one of them comes up dead or hurt nothing will change.  Besides the dope heads, kids left to their own devises will bring a place down quicker than anything.  All of this can be placed at the lap of  absentee 'parents'  who need to stop pawning their kids off on the community and take responsibility.  I recommend renting here to others with the current owners.  They have much to do to bring this long neglected place around but they're trying and doing a great job.   Hill Country Villasalwaysexpectquality ratedThis complex is average.  If y...This complex is average.  If you are looking for security, upgraded fixtures, and quality amenities, than you have the wrong place.  There have been 5 break ins reported.  They have to report all crime in the complex to the residents but they do nothing to make the complex more secure.  There seems to be a large amount of dog owners so there is always feces on the sidewalks.   Don't let the "gated community"  fool you.  They have one gate code and once you give it out that person can enter anytime they choose to.  Before you sign a lease, physically go check your apartment.  I was issued the wrong floor plan and told I had to wait a month and a half before the one I originally requested became available.  The leasing agent tried arguing with me and told me that I never asked for a specific floor plan when we had a 15 minute conversation about it over the phone.   Due to time and $$ constraints I had to take what was available.  The parking is also horrible especially after 6PM.  Most of the parking slots have been converted to carports which you have to pay $20.00 a month for.    For the amount they charge in rent, they need to upgrade their amenities and provide better security.  Westgate ApartmentsJj J. ratedSomewhat noisy--apartment walls are very thin so you can hear the neighbors fight in the early morning (next property over) and listen to their barking dog at 3am any given night. The property owner/manager is nice but the work they do in the apartments is left half-done and the workmanship is shoddy. In addition, there have been few hot showers since moving in and the heat wasn't turned on in time for the cold snap (that everyone in San Antonio talked about for a week PRIOR to it turning cold). That left us without heat in 30 degree weather. Not pleasant, especially since you couldn't take a hot shower to warm up.This place has good qualities--it's cute, the grounds are in nice condition and in an up and coming neighborhood only a half mile from The Pearl, but it needs professional management help. There's no one manning the office and keeping track of issues--absolutely no follow-up or tenant contact from management even when it's promised. I don't think this is intentional; the manager/owner in charge can't do it all and they absolutely need to hire help. For the price, we're not terribly impressed--and won't be signing another lease when ours is up.Polo Club ApartmentsKimberly T. ratedI don't know what apartment MYOWNHERO is referring to but that does not describe the Polo Club. I am a mother with two young children. I live in the 3/2 and I have not had roaches nor cracks in the wall. My apartment was immaculate when I moved in and it stays that way because I clean my home. If you had roaches, you were filthy because these apartments have pest control come twice a month. And as far as work orders, my microwave went out on a Friday, they told me that they might not make it in til Saturday, but were able to replace my microwave that same Friday anyways. Yes, the gate is sometimes opened, but dont single out Polo Club just because you saw someone jump a fence. That sounds like a lie anyways, if you see the gates, you cant jump them! The apartment is not falling a part, they are pretty new! Sounds like your on a mission to slander a complex for your own benefit...where do you work? Westpond? I moved from there and THAT is bad management! You might be confused with another Polo Club Apartment Complex, but not San Antonio's. Brandon Oaks ApartmentsJay C. ratedThe worst mistake I have ever made was signing a second year contract with these apartment complexes, in the 22 months that I have lived here there have been three different managers and countless different Realtors, that alone should be a warning sign; their staff never seems to know what they're doing because they're mainly always changing the people, they can be nice when they want to but they have also been extremely rude as well, and I don’t know about you but I prefer to not have bipolar staff members to deal with, communication is one of their worst suits. I would never recommend these apartments to anybody, pay the extra rent for the apartments across the street, it's worth it, because in this case you definitely get what you pay for. The only reason I didn't put 1 star is because I know there are worse apartments out there. The Park At Presa ApartmentsElida G. ratedHalf&Half I live @Pressa Apartment from 10/2013-10/2014 my only problem for me to move out it was because to far from my work. Never had a problem with the management or staff when I needed something fix it was done immediately, the pool was always clean and the entire complex and afordable rent the worst of my stay : # 1-No notice when turn off water because of construction I understand fixing up the complex few times went late to work .#2-Laundry Room few times put money did not work to long or to slow the remodeling .#3-To many cars over night especialy on weekends difficult to park at night the office need to provide stickers and enforce a $$$ penalty .I did like all of the events for the residents.Thanks Cindy and staff,# 1216City Base Vista ApartmentsJulie S. ratedI have one child and picking a safe place is crucial.  I've lived here for four years and love it. They have beautiful grounds they make sure to keep up with by planting beautiful flowers and palm trees. They have two separate playgrounds for my child. They have an overnight security guard who is well known and visible.  The apartment staff is professional and sweet. They always greet you with a smile and are never negative.  The apartment manager is very professional and fair. She really listening and gives you options in any situation.  I'm only moving because I found a house. Great place to live with a family: )Saddlewood ApartmentsJared V. ratedThis place could be better and this place could be worse. Parking is a big crock, I have seen more dog  feces here than anywhere in my life and you are paying for it just look at the dog park. They over charge on the water bill and can't give any explanation why its so high yet I see them waste water on stupid plants and grass up front not to mention the broken water pipes where it looks like a spring in the complex. The TLC energy company doesn't exist that you are suppose to pay your water bill to. I could go on and on. It gets 3 stars because I haven't heard any gun shots yet and there are worse places.Broadway Heights ApartmentsQuate G. ratedGreat apartments!  The place is super quiet and the units are renovated with tile, new appliances and cabinets.  Price for the area is a steal ($550).  Staff is very friendly and maintenance is super fast (usually same day).  They also have pest control services free of charge (outside pest control company) if you need it.   Good location and neighbors.  Do not bother if you previously have been evicted  or  have any felonies.  Smoking is also not allowed on the property and/or the apartments, which is great.Cons: small pool area, no pets allowed.  Overall, I am very happy here.

They were under construction/moving at the time it seems so I let it slide. But the iPad that we had to sign and read our rental contract on was cracked horribly-with some glass pierces raised. Very unprofessional. Still, I let it go because the property was nice and the contract itself was reasonable. Service: We have been  trying to get certain maintenance requests addressed since we moved in. Maintenance personnel came several times and couldn't fix one of the issues and then never came back months ago. Turner Properties said they didn't "contract him." They just "submitted a work order." The owner of the house did "contract him." So in other words it's not their fault the issue was not handle in a timely manner. When we signed paperwork. I had no idea I would go through all this just to get a problem fixed. I even ask about this type of stuff. Read the contract. No where in it did it say that maintenance problems could go unfixed due to the home owner's preference to contract his own ppl or do it himself. Now they want to fix the issue using their ppl (which is good) immediately, but now my schedule is not open like it was when we first moved to the place (then I was a stay at home mom, now I have a new job-no leave of absence yet they only fix stuff during business hours m-f). And they're curt with me because I have a schedule! They are getting mad because I won't let the maintenance guy into the property the same day we discuss this over the phone. Like I cannot schedule him to come a certain day?!?! Not the same day? WTF. Then I ask the representative if I can have a copy of the maintenance log which is typically done after the problem is fixed. The first personnel to come to my house had me sign one. Instead of her simply telling me that they don't do that with their personal maintenance professionals, she gave me the run around. It was like pulling teeth to get information out of her. Good customer service is knowing how to handle bad situations with efficiency and empathy. I felt neither from these ppl.Warning: ask about the owner's preference concerning maintenance issues. Don't expect to be talked to with respect when things aren't all roses with them. Columbia Property ManagementBrandi S. ratedOverall, a very unprofessional company.  I am giving it two stars because everyone I talked to at the company was nice, but if you ever need anything from them you will have to stay on top of them to get it done.  If you have a simple request, there is usually only one person in the entire office who can help you, and they will usually not be there when you call the first time.  Very disorganized, and there does not seem to be much communication between staff.They are pretty slow on maintenance; there were things we noted as broken when we moved in, and they never sent anyone to fix them. (They did call several months into our lease to ask if anything was still broken, and still never sent anyone).  My air conditioner went out a couple weeks after I moved in, and they sent someone out twice just to tell me that it was broken and needed to be replaced, and then it took several days to actually replace it.  I understand that it might take a day or so to get the unit, but I was unable to stay in my house for a week and my rent was not prorated (I did contact the owner to ask about this; instead of answering me she told me that I had a balance due on my account and referred me to someone else.  I did not, in fact, have a balance due-- so obviously I got the run around there).  The other problem is the security deposit.  You will have to put down a security deposit equal to a month's rent, and if you leave your house in good condition you will be lucky to get half of it back.  They charge ridiculous amounts for small things.  For example, we were charged $15 to replace the air filter.  I chose to rent from this company despite reading bad reviews because I loved the house and was running out of time.  However, I will definitely not be renting from them in the future.  Turner PropertiesCardette F. ratedI relocated from form North Carolina to South Carolina and was My experience with Turner properties is that I found homes that I wanted to rent due to relocating for a Job. I went I initially called I was told that the house would not be ready until two week later so I decide to drive down and see the location of the house, all the blinds were up and I was able to look in the house and  like what I saw. So I submitted the application and was accepted about 3 days later.What I didn’t understand is that I was charge an addition $75.00 on the security deposit with a 770 credit score. Then after signing the lease without seeing the house I called and asked if I could just view the house, and was told “No”, because the code to the lock box had been changed. Then I asked if someone could just take a 1 hour out to show me the house that I already put a $2179.00 deposit on and was told that they lack the staff for that. Which I thought was very unprofessional. The finial issue I had was that a $20.00 fee was added to my account for the return of the lock box that I didn’t put on the house. Also I was told that any damages to the house that I fine I could upload the pictures to my document and that turn out not to be true.  As far as the house I’m very happy with it so far, but I only been in it from 12/09/2016.  And only had minor issue stains on carpet, scratches on flooring, we had to replace the float in the toilet so it would stop running. Broken faucet sprayer and a really bad patch job with spackle throughout the house. Now I see why they say the house are rented “as is” after they get your deposit.    Almost forgot I was offer a $5.00 Starbucks gift card for a good review.Salters Property Management GroupKelli C. ratedMonth after month I have to inquire where my rent money is. It gets worse each month. I call and call and always get an excuse or we will call you back with no call back. Last month I emailed them twice and never got a response. We eventually got the money, but no aknowledgement of my emails. I give them 2 stars only because I do feel that the tenants may get better response than we do as the homeowner. We have been contacted about repair requests over the years and are updated on mid year inpections. This company might be okay to rent from, but I would not recommend to home owners. Lately, I always get the rent money around the 3rd week of the month (after my mortgage late fees hit). Rent money is supposed to be paid out by the 10th, per Salters. Today is the 21st, and they have not paid us on 2 homes. Sandstone ApartmentsG M. ratedI can't believe what the previous rater notated about these apartments. The manager is a very decent person and the human beings that live there aren't clueless.  In fact, they are very decent people. They probably have more heart than the people in the neighborhood where I own my home! The person that wrote that review probably lived there and was kicked out for any number of good reasons.  In any apartment complex there are rules and they must be followed in order to maintain a nice, safe place to live. Lake Shore Village AptsKurt F. ratedI have lived here since March of 2012. Do not believe everything you read. It has a swimming pool, next to a lake, playground, dog park, laundry facility, security guard, rent is cheap and electric is cheap if you use it wisely. I enjoy living here. It took some time to weed out the bad apples that used to live here. It located close to Walmart, Aldi, Biglots, VA hospital and more and not far from downtown. I lived in the Summit previously, there was bad apples there also. Wellspring Apartmentsstacytaylor ratedIts a great apartment complex. Office staff is very nice and hlep you out. The community has changed alot since the new property manager. The whole community looks better. You get greeted when you walk in the door at the office. The apartment was super clean and had new carpet. I would chose living here. Im still currently living here and lived her for 10 years.Lake Shore Village Aptsang1863 ratedLove living here. It went unde...Love living here. It went under new management a while back and they've changed everything. All of these old reviews are not right. The place is clean and well kept, and they;ve kicked all the bad people out. I love my apartment and the view of thelake, would recommend it for anyoneAspyre At Assembly Stationlbs41710 ratedAspyre is great for me, I woul...Aspyre is great for me, I would say check it out yourself before you trust all of these reviews. I like the location, the staff handles any issues I have. Some of these people sound like they just woke up on the wrong side of the bed... I'd rather live here than on shop rd!Landmark Resources LLCZach D. ratedI highly recommend Landmark Resources because their managers are so nice and hard working. They always keep me informed and updated on everything that is going on. I appreciate all that they do.
