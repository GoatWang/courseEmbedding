The information on this site is directed at residents of the United Kingdom.

This website is intended for persons who are resident for tax and investment purposes in the United Kingdom. Shares and warrants in the Company may not be available in all jurisdictions. Accordingly, this site is not directed at any person in any jurisdiction where the publication or availability of the information on this site is prohibited or restricted (whether by reason of a person's nationality, residence or otherwise) and this site may not be used for the purpose of, and does not constitute, an offer or solicitation by anyone in any jurisdiction or in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation is not permitted.

Consequently, persons in respect of whom any such prohibitions or restrictions apply must not proceed any further onto this site. In particular, the shares and warrants cannot be offered or sold directly or indirectly: (i) in the US, its territories, possessions or protectorates under its jurisdiction, nor to nationals, citizens or residents in any of those areas since the shares and the warrants are not registered under the US Securities Act 1933 and the Company is not registered under the US Investment Company Act of 1940; (ii) in Japan, its territories, possessions or protectorates under its jurisdiction, nor to nationals, citizens or residents in any of those areas since the shares and the warrants are not registered under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (“FIEL”) of Japan; (iii) to the public in the Republic of France; (iv) in the Netherlands other than persons who trade or invest in securities in a professional or commercial capacity; (v) in Canada other than persons eligible to purchase such securities without the benefit of a Prospectus qualified under Canadian securities law.

General Risk Factors
Investment involves risks. The value of investments and any income generated may go down as well as up and is not guaranteed.  Past performance is not a guide to future performance
•    The initial charges (such as broker’s charges and stamp duty) will have an impact on the value of an investor's holding, particularly in the short term.
•    Investors should regard their holdings as a long term investment.
•    Shares in the Company have been admitted to the Official List and are traded on the London Stock Exchange's market for listed securities. Accordingly, shares are purchased by investors through the stock market and therefore investors will not be able to cancel their purchase. However, in respect of investments made within an Individual Savings Account (ISA) investors will have a 7 day period in which they can change their mind.
•    Due to their fixed capital structure, investment trusts are able to borrow to raise further funds which can be used to buy additional securities for their portfolio, when the manager of the investment trust and its board of directors consider that it may be commercially advantageous for the investment trust to do so. This is generally described as 'gearing'. An investment trust which has purchased additional assets as a result of gearing may have a more volatile share price than one which does not, since gearing can increase shareholder returns in rising markets but conversely can increase the extent to which the value of the funds attributable to shareholders decreases in falling markets.
•    Changes in rates of exchange may have an adverse effect on the value, price or income of an investment.
•    Investors should be aware of the additional risks arising from companies trading on or investing in stock markets of emerging or developing countries where price volatility may be greater, and the ability of the investment trust to buy and sell its portfolio easily and without influencing its price (commonly known as the 'liquidity' of the market) may be lower, than those experienced in more developed economies and stock markets. There is also a risk associated with different settlement and custody practices.
•    Where the income earned by an investment trust is insufficient to cover charges and expenses, the balances will be charged to capital, which may constrain capital growth.
•    Investors should be aware that the Company has warrants in issue. A warrant is a time–limited right to subscribe for shares, debentures, loan stock or government securities and is exercisable against the original issuer of the underlying securities. A relatively small movement in the price of the underlying security results in a disproportionately large movement, unfavourable or favourable, in the price of the warrant. The prices of warrants can therefore be volatile. It is essential that investors wishing to purchase warrants understand that the right to subscribe which a warrant confers is invariably limited in time with the consequence that if the investor fails to exercise this right within the predetermined time–scale then the investment becomes worthless. You should not buy a warrant unless you are prepared to sustain a total loss of the money you have invested plus any commission or other transaction charges.
The information on this site does not constitute investment, tax, legal or other advice or recommendation or, an offer to sell or an invitation to buy shares or warrants in the Company. The information contained herein is reasonably believed to be accurate as at the date of publication but no warranty or guarantee (express or implied) is given as to accuracy. The information and any opinions expressed herein may change at any time. Information contained on this web-site must not be used, or relied on, for the purposes of any investment decisions. Potential investors should seek independent financial advice and read all relevant documents relating to the Company, such as its Report and Accounts and Prospectus, which describe the particular risks associated with an investment together with any specific restrictions which may be applicable and the basis of dealing.

Investment in a Fund is not intended to be a complete investment program for any investor. An investment should be viewed as a medium to long-term investment. As part of your long term investment planning you should consider diversifying your portfolio by investing in a range of investments and asset classes.

Services[edit]
Baring Asset Management provides investment management services to investors worldwide, with a particular focus on emerging and inefficient markets; asset allocation and specialist fixed income.[9]
History[edit]
Main articles: Barings Bank and Baring family
Barings, originally established as a firm of merchants and merchant bankers, was formed in London in 1762.[1]
In the 1950s, Barings realised the potential of asset management and set up its own investment department in 1955.[10][11] Clients were corporate clients, sovereign connections, pension funds and charitable institutions. In the 1970s, Barings expanded this business internationally with offices in the Far East, North America and Europe.[12] In 1989, Barings combined all of its asset management activities within Baring Asset Management Limited, headquartered in London.[13] In 1995, Barings Bank, the oldest investment bank in Britain, collapsed as a result of unauthorised trading by its head derivatives trader in Singapore, Nick Leeson, who was imprisoned for six and a half years in Singapore.[14] It was then bought by ING Group, a Dutch bank for £1.[15]
In March 2005, Baring Asset Management was split and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual) acquired Baring Asset Management’s investment management activities and the rights to use the Baring Asset Management name.[16][17] Northern Trust acquired Baring Asset Management’s Financial Services Group.[18]
Recent notable events[edit]
2010 – Baring Asset Management wins the Queen’s Award for Enterprise 2010 in the International Trade Category[19]
2012 – 250th Anniversary[20]
2013 – Baring Asset Management completes acquisition of SEI Asset Korea Co., Ltd (SEIAK)[21]

Baring Asset Management provides investment management services to investors worldwide, with a particular focus on emerging and inefficient markets; asset allocation and specialist fixed income.[9]
History[edit]
Main articles: Barings Bank and Baring family
Barings, originally established as a firm of merchants and merchant bankers, was formed in London in 1762.[1]
In the 1950s, Barings realised the potential of asset management and set up its own investment department in 1955.[10][11] Clients were corporate clients, sovereign connections, pension funds and charitable institutions. In the 1970s, Barings expanded this business internationally with offices in the Far East, North America and Europe.[12] In 1989, Barings combined all of its asset management activities within Baring Asset Management Limited, headquartered in London.[13] In 1995, Barings Bank, the oldest investment bank in Britain, collapsed as a result of unauthorised trading by its head derivatives trader in Singapore, Nick Leeson, who was imprisoned for six and a half years in Singapore.[14] It was then bought by ING Group, a Dutch bank for £1.[15]
In March 2005, Baring Asset Management was split and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual) acquired Baring Asset Management’s investment management activities and the rights to use the Baring Asset Management name.[16][17] Northern Trust acquired Baring Asset Management’s Financial Services Group.[18]
Recent notable events[edit]
2010 – Baring Asset Management wins the Queen’s Award for Enterprise 2010 in the International Trade Category[19]
2012 – 250th Anniversary[20]
2013 – Baring Asset Management completes acquisition of SEI Asset Korea Co., Ltd (SEIAK)[21]

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services.

Our Latest Thinking











Identifying the main drivers of long-term change is key to investment success in the 21st century. We believe we are at the beginning of a secular growth phase for the U.S. economy driven largely by the rebalancing of global growth from the developed to the developing world. We focus on the long-term drivers, the macro forces and investment themes at play across industries that are taking us into the next growth cycle.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Services[edit]
Baring Asset Management provides investment management services to investors worldwide, with a particular focus on emerging and inefficient markets; asset allocation and specialist fixed income.[9]
History[edit]
Main articles: Barings Bank and Baring family
Barings, originally established as a firm of merchants and merchant bankers, was formed in London in 1762.[1]
In the 1950s, Barings realised the potential of asset management and set up its own investment department in 1955.[10][11] Clients were corporate clients, sovereign connections, pension funds and charitable institutions. In the 1970s, Barings expanded this business internationally with offices in the Far East, North America and Europe.[12] In 1989, Barings combined all of its asset management activities within Baring Asset Management Limited, headquartered in London.[13] In 1995, Barings Bank, the oldest investment bank in Britain, collapsed as a result of unauthorised trading by its head derivatives trader in Singapore, Nick Leeson, who was imprisoned for six and a half years in Singapore.[14] It was then bought by ING Group, a Dutch bank for £1.[15]
In March 2005, Baring Asset Management was split and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual) acquired Baring Asset Management’s investment management activities and the rights to use the Baring Asset Management name.[16][17] Northern Trust acquired Baring Asset Management’s Financial Services Group.[18]
Recent notable events[edit]
2010 – Baring Asset Management wins the Queen’s Award for Enterprise 2010 in the International Trade Category[19]
2012 – 250th Anniversary[20]
2013 – Baring Asset Management completes acquisition of SEI Asset Korea Co., Ltd (SEIAK)[21]

Services[edit]
Baring Asset Management provides investment management services to investors worldwide, with a particular focus on emerging and inefficient markets; asset allocation and specialist fixed income.[9]
History[edit]
Main articles: Barings Bank and Baring family
Barings, originally established as a firm of merchants and merchant bankers, was formed in London in 1762.[1]
In the 1950s, Barings realised the potential of asset management and set up its own investment department in 1955.[10][11] Clients were corporate clients, sovereign connections, pension funds and charitable institutions. In the 1970s, Barings expanded this business internationally with offices in the Far East, North America and Europe.[12] In 1989, Barings combined all of its asset management activities within Baring Asset Management Limited, headquartered in London.[13] In 1995, Barings Bank, the oldest investment bank in Britain, collapsed as a result of unauthorised trading by its head derivatives trader in Singapore, Nick Leeson, who was imprisoned for six and a half years in Singapore.[14] It was then bought by ING Group, a Dutch bank for £1.[15]
In March 2005, Baring Asset Management was split and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual) acquired Baring Asset Management’s investment management activities and the rights to use the Baring Asset Management name.[16][17] Northern Trust acquired Baring Asset Management’s Financial Services Group.[18]
Recent notable events[edit]
2010 – Baring Asset Management wins the Queen’s Award for Enterprise 2010 in the International Trade Category[19]
2012 – 250th Anniversary[20]
2013 – Baring Asset Management completes acquisition of SEI Asset Korea Co., Ltd (SEIAK)[21]
