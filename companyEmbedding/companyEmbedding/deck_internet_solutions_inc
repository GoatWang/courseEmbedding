About Us | Deck Commerce


Contact UsAbout Deck CommerceWe are passionate about leveraging technology and innovation to help our customers scale their operations and improve their eCommerce results.We exist to deliver innovative solutions focused on improving eCommerce processes and results.Our StoryThe company was founded in 1998 by Christopher Deck, a thought-leader for eCommerce operations. Originally known as Deck Internet Solutions, the company provided high-quality and high-touch professional services focused on overcoming pain-points related to the back-end processes of eCommerce businesses. As technology continued to evolve and disrupt the retail industry, Deck realized that one of the biggest barriers to growth was the lack of commercially available software that intelligently integrated expanding front-end channels with existing back-end technology stacks.To address this market need, the Deck engineering team developed an enterprise-class eCommerce Operations Platform (EOP) designed specifically to support the full lifecycle of an eCommerce transaction on the back-end. In 2015 the company launched its flagship platform and re-branded itself as Deck Commerce. It was the culmination of applying our domain expertise gained as a service provider and engineering excellence into a cloud-based, Software-as-a-Service solution that would help eCommerce businesses scale operations, deliver better consumer experiences, and grow revenues.Today, Deck Commerce is the market-leading platform that powers the back-end operations for leading brands around the world. We leverage advanced technology to deliver a flexible solution that is both scalable and cost-effective. We believe that it takes a combination of services to deliver and maintain a competitive advantage in today’s digital landscape, which is why we partner with leaders across all segments of the industry. We are passionate about leveraging technology and innovation to help our customers scale their operations and improve their eCommerce results.Our PeopleWe deliver world-class technology, but our team is the true strength of the company. We believe in hiring passionate people with a desire to grow. We work hard to understand their needs and goals, and then cultivate opportunities for them to work on initiatives that move us forward as a company, while supporting their individual development as professionals. Oriented through teamwork, we are confident that investing in our employees provides the most rewarding and effective way to achieve our mission as a company.

Our company culture is critically important. Rooted in our core values that require honesty, integrity and respect, our overall environment is fun, supportive, and professional. We are business casual with a flair of “techie.” We occasionally rally outside the office at Cardinal games, mud runs, and other feats of strength.What We StudiedAdditionally, 56% of us went to a State University.What We Drink in the MorningsMost of us try and wait until at least noon to enjoy an adult beverage.What We Do on the WeekendsWe're currently obsessed with binge watching Iron Fist and re-watching Seinfeld episodes.Join the Team!Connect With UsGet up-to-date information on the latest news and announcements for Deck CommerceView Our OpeningsCheck Out our Latest NewsCopyright © 2017 Deck CommerceCompanyAbout UsContact UsJoin the TeamBlogResourcesPress RoomProductOrder ManagementProduct InformationInventory ManagementLegalPrivacy PolicyTerms of Use
