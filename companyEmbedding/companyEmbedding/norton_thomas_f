Tips and Information on Buying an Antivirus
With a seemingly endless amount of pc protection solutions to
            choose from, it can be hard to make sure you get the right product for you. Here are
            some top tips and valuable information which will help you make your decision..











                            Free antivirus software; is it any good?                           

Antivirus software is widely available on the internet today with countless antivirus software provides to choose from. A good free antivirus software provider however isn’t as easy to find, so we ask the question how useful is free antivirus software? Most reputable companies now offer a free version of their antivirus software for a trial period, most typically 30 days but is the user really seeing a true representation of the fully paid versions? Surprisingly the answer is yes, in most cases you can scan your computer with the software, it will display the issues and give you the option to destroy the unwanted virus. In a lot of cases the only difference between the free and paid versions are the added extras, VPN, parental control etc, however if it is just antivirus software you are in the market for then the free version is a good option. There are however some experts that will try and tell you that the free antivirus software providers offer a significantly poorer virus detection rate, claims that a free version will only detect around 25% of viruses whereas a paid version will offer you up to a 90% detection rate. However in reality the chances are if an antivirus software provider is offering you a free or trial version of their software it will be the same software that they are offering for a fee. So when choosing a provider make sure that the paid version of the software is robust enough for your needs and the likelihood is that your free version will be just as robust. So in summation, how useful is free antivirus software? Very useful, the key things to remember are that you must do your research before you commit to downloading the antivirus software as 9 times out of 10 you will be downloading the same version of the software as the one you pay for so look for customer reviews, if people have paid for the antivirus software and are happy to recommend it then you are on to a winner. 












                            Does a free virus scan speed up my computer?                           

Computers are supposed to make people's lives easier, yet sometimes it feels like they exist around us only to give us endless amounts of frustration. The most popular advice for all the slow computers includes using a free virus scan to speed up your computer, but this make a lot of assumptions about what's going all wrong with your computer . Everyday when you start up your computer it takes an extra time to “read” each breadcrumb, slowing things down. Like any machine that’s exposed to the elements, things start to bog down and the question is will a free virus scan help the situation?
The claim that to “clean up” and “speed up” your PC — for a fee , you will find these kinds of offers everywhere on the internet, but does a free virus scan help the speed of your computer? 
Your PC or Mac hold temporary files and “cookies” from places you’ve visited on the Web. Cookies can make it faster to load a website that you visit often, but these files stay on you pc all the time if you don,t clean them all the time . Many antivirus company claim that they will improve your PC performance by removing these and in many circumstances  this is true, however only few company proved this to their users. 
Some really good antivirus company offer special features to the antivirus programs or apps that clean your PC junk files, remove spyware sheets from your computer and allow you to add or remove files, some products also include defragment option on your free scan to speed up your PC performance. So the answer to the question is yes, a free virus scan can detect all of the factors that combine to make your computer slow and help you eliminate them.

How We Rank Avs

Antivirus is important software and making sure you get the right one to
        fit your needs is even more important. Using key indicators like feature
        set, ease of use and quality of support we have have been able to compile
        a strong shortlist from all of the top antivirus products. Also, we
        recognise the need to tailor the antivirus choice process to different
        needs, so we built some tools allowing you to break down the rankings
        and filter by requirements like price.



Antivirus Selector Tool

Use our antivirus selector tool to find the perfect antivirus for you.
        By simply answering a few questions related to what you want your antivirus
        to achieve, we can calculate which product suits your needs best.

Remembering An American Hero
Posted on 12/10/13 - by Curt Carter ccarter02@earthlink.net 
								

								 
								 Dear PFC Thomas Francis Norton, sirAs an American, I would like to thank you for your service and for your sacrifice made on behalf of our wonderful country. The youth of today could gain much by learning of heroes such as yourself, men and women whose courage and heart can never be questioned.May God allow you to read this, and may He allow me to someday shake your hand when I get to Heaven to personally thank you. May he also allow my father to find you and shake your hand now to say thank you; for America, and for those who love you.With respect, and the best salute a civilian can muster for you, SirCurt Carter

								 FOREVER REMEMBERED"If you are able, save for them a place inside of you....and save one backward glance when you are leaving for the places they can no longer go.....Be not ashamed to say you loved them....Take what they have left and what they have taught you with their dying and keep it with your own....And in that time when men decide and feel safe to call the war insane, take one moment to embrace those gentle heroes you left behind...."Quote from a letter home by Maj. Michael Davis O'DonnellKIA 24 March 1970. Distinguished Flying Cross: Shot down and Killed while attempting to rescue 8 fellow soldiers surrounded by attacking enemy forces.We Nam Brothers pause to give a backward glance, and post this remembrance to you, one of the gentle heroes lost to the War in Vietnam:Slip off that pack. Set it down by the crooked trail. Drop your steel pot alongside. Shed those magazine-ladened bandoliers away from your sweat-soaked shirt. Lay that silent weapon down and step out of the heat. Feel the soothing cool breeze right down to your soul ... and rest forever in the shade of our love, brother. From your Nam-Band-Of-Brothers

About VVMF
        Based in Arlington, Virginia, VVMF (the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund) is the nonprofit organization authorized by the U.S. Congress in 1980 to build a national memorial dedicated to all who served with the U.S. armed forces in the Vietnam War. Incorporated on April 27, 1979 by a group of veterans led by Jan C. Scruggs, the organization sought a tangible symbol of recognition from the American people for those who served in the war.

Thomas F. Norton



















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Massachusetts:













Does Thomas F. Norton carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that involves a building's structural elements in addition to other construction, must be performed by a licensed construction supervisor, issued by the Department of Public Safety. A home improvement contractor must be registered by the Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation, to perform any nonstructural residential home improvement work.
Thomas F. Norton currently holds license 23231 , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Massachusetts?



Contractors in Massachusetts must prove continous work experience in their trade or a construction related degree from an accredited college, before they can take an exam to become a licensed contractor. Construction supervisor licenses must be renewed every 2 years, after taking the requisite continuing education requirements. 











Your liability risk when hiring Thomas F. Norton



Contractors in Massachusetts must carry general liability insurance and an active workers' compensation policy. Proof of a current workers compensation policy is required to file a building permit as a contractor in Massachusetts. Be sure to request a copy of certificates for each policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Thomas F. Norton



If a remodeling project has gone badly a homeowner can recoup up to $10,000 of actual losses through the Home Improvement Contractor Guaranty Fund. The property must be the owner's primary residence, and a claim must be filed within 6 months of the initial court judgement or the arbitration award date.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Massachusetts, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner,choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with.BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).Just click here to get started.

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Maine:













Does Thomas F. Norton carry a valid contracting license?



Maine requires contractors to be licensed to perform work on manufactured or modular homes. A contractors license is not needed to do remodeling or new construction work on typical residential homes
Thomas F. Norton currently holds license MS60020894 (Master Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











Your liability risk when hiring Thomas F. Norton



Maine does not require contractors to carry general liability or workers' compensation insurance. Regardless, it is advisable to hire contractors with active policies for both forms of insurance. Request a copy of the insurance certificates for your records.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work.You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Maine, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk.These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, so choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Click here to get started.

Tips and Information on Buying an Antivirus
With a seemingly endless amount of pc protection solutions to
            choose from, it can be hard to make sure you get the right product for you. Here are
            some top tips and valuable information which will help you make your decision..











                            Free antivirus software; is it any good?                           

Antivirus software is widely available on the internet today with countless antivirus software provides to choose from. A good free antivirus software provider however isn’t as easy to find, so we ask the question how useful is free antivirus software? Most reputable companies now offer a free version of their antivirus software for a trial period, most typically 30 days but is the user really seeing a true representation of the fully paid versions? Surprisingly the answer is yes, in most cases you can scan your computer with the software, it will display the issues and give you the option to destroy the unwanted virus. In a lot of cases the only difference between the free and paid versions are the added extras, VPN, parental control etc, however if it is just antivirus software you are in the market for then the free version is a good option. There are however some experts that will try and tell you that the free antivirus software providers offer a significantly poorer virus detection rate, claims that a free version will only detect around 25% of viruses whereas a paid version will offer you up to a 90% detection rate. However in reality the chances are if an antivirus software provider is offering you a free or trial version of their software it will be the same software that they are offering for a fee. So when choosing a provider make sure that the paid version of the software is robust enough for your needs and the likelihood is that your free version will be just as robust. So in summation, how useful is free antivirus software? Very useful, the key things to remember are that you must do your research before you commit to downloading the antivirus software as 9 times out of 10 you will be downloading the same version of the software as the one you pay for so look for customer reviews, if people have paid for the antivirus software and are happy to recommend it then you are on to a winner. 












                            Does a free virus scan speed up my computer?                           

Computers are supposed to make people's lives easier, yet sometimes it feels like they exist around us only to give us endless amounts of frustration. The most popular advice for all the slow computers includes using a free virus scan to speed up your computer, but this make a lot of assumptions about what's going all wrong with your computer . Everyday when you start up your computer it takes an extra time to “read” each breadcrumb, slowing things down. Like any machine that’s exposed to the elements, things start to bog down and the question is will a free virus scan help the situation?
The claim that to “clean up” and “speed up” your PC — for a fee , you will find these kinds of offers everywhere on the internet, but does a free virus scan help the speed of your computer? 
Your PC or Mac hold temporary files and “cookies” from places you’ve visited on the Web. Cookies can make it faster to load a website that you visit often, but these files stay on you pc all the time if you don,t clean them all the time . Many antivirus company claim that they will improve your PC performance by removing these and in many circumstances  this is true, however only few company proved this to their users. 
Some really good antivirus company offer special features to the antivirus programs or apps that clean your PC junk files, remove spyware sheets from your computer and allow you to add or remove files, some products also include defragment option on your free scan to speed up your PC performance. So the answer to the question is yes, a free virus scan can detect all of the factors that combine to make your computer slow and help you eliminate them.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
