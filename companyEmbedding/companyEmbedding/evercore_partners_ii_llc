Evercore is a global independent investment banking advisory firm founded in 1996 by Roger Altman, David Offensend, and Austin Beutner.[2]
Evercore’s Investment Banking business advises its clients on mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, financings, public offerings, private placements and other strategic transactions and also provides institutional investors with macro and fundamental equity research, sales and trading execution. Evercore’s Investment Management business comprises wealth management, institutional asset management and private equity investing. Evercore serves clients from 28 offices in North America, Europe, South America and Asia.
Recent activities[edit]
In August 2014, Evercore announced the acquisition of International Strategy & Investment ("ISI") Group for approximately $400 million.[3] The deal was closed the following October to create Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, offering Macro and Fundamental Research, Sales, and Trading execution. In 2014, the firm secured the second highest number of Institutional Investor #1 positions, after J.P. Morgan, and also ranked #5 in total II positions. [4]
In April 2014, former Evercore banker Perkins Hixon pleaded guilty to insider trading in the securities of Evercore, Westway Group Inc. and Titanium Metals Corporation[5] from 2010-2013. He resigned from the company earlier in 2014.[6]
In November 2011, the firm announced that it had agreed to purchase a 45% non-controlling interest in ABS Investment Management, an institutionally focused equity long/short hedge fund of funds manager.[7]
In October 2011, Evercore and Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Limited ("Kotak Investment Banking") (a subsidiary of Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited), announced that the two firms had entered into an exclusive strategic alliance for cross-border M&A advisory services between India and the United States, the United Kingdom, and Mexico.[7]
In August 2011, the firm completed its acquisition of Lexicon Partners, an independent UK-based investment banking advisory firm.[7]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Evercore is a global independent investment banking advisory firm founded in 1996 by Roger Altman, David Offensend, and Austin Beutner.[2]
Evercore’s Investment Banking business advises its clients on mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, financings, public offerings, private placements and other strategic transactions and also provides institutional investors with macro and fundamental equity research, sales and trading execution. Evercore’s Investment Management business comprises wealth management, institutional asset management and private equity investing. Evercore serves clients from 28 offices in North America, Europe, South America and Asia.
Recent activities[edit]
In August 2014, Evercore announced the acquisition of International Strategy & Investment ("ISI") Group for approximately $400 million.[3] The deal was closed the following October to create Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, offering Macro and Fundamental Research, Sales, and Trading execution. In 2014, the firm secured the second highest number of Institutional Investor #1 positions, after J.P. Morgan, and also ranked #5 in total II positions. [4]
In April 2014, former Evercore banker Perkins Hixon pleaded guilty to insider trading in the securities of Evercore, Westway Group Inc. and Titanium Metals Corporation[5] from 2010-2013. He resigned from the company earlier in 2014.[6]
In November 2011, the firm announced that it had agreed to purchase a 45% non-controlling interest in ABS Investment Management, an institutionally focused equity long/short hedge fund of funds manager.[7]
In October 2011, Evercore and Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Limited ("Kotak Investment Banking") (a subsidiary of Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited), announced that the two firms had entered into an exclusive strategic alliance for cross-border M&A advisory services between India and the United States, the United Kingdom, and Mexico.[7]
In August 2011, the firm completed its acquisition of Lexicon Partners, an independent UK-based investment banking advisory firm.[7]

Evercore is planning on transferring ownership and control of its Mexican private equity business to a newly formed company Glisco Partners Inc. Launched by the principals of Evercore Mexico Capital Partners, Glisco will manage all existing EMCP funds, which currently manages $266 million in investments.
PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK, July 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Evercore (NYSE: EVR) and the principals of its Mexican private equity business, Evercore Mexico Capital Partners (“EMCP”), today announced their plan to transfer control of the business to a new entity formed by the principals. Under the plan:
The EMCP team, led by Mr. Alfredo Castellanos, has formed a new entity, Glisco Partners Inc. (“Glisco”), which will assume all responsibility for management of the existing EMCP funds, which currently manage $266 million of invested capital. Dr. Pedro Aspe, the Chairman of Evercore Partners Mexico, will continue to serve on the Investment Committee for the EMCP funds.
As consideration for the transfer of ownership, Evercore will receive a fixed percentage of the management fees earned by Glisco for a period of up to ten years, as well as a portion of the carried interest in the next two successor funds. Evercore will commit to invest capital in those successor funds consistent with the level of carried interest it owns and will retain its carried interest and its capital interests in the existing EMCP funds, which have an aggregate carrying value of $12.4 million as of March 31, 2016. 





A transition services agreement providing operational support to Glisco will be in place for up to 18 months.
Completion of the transaction, which is subject to consent by the Limited Partner Advisory Committee of the EMCP funds and regulatory approval in Mexico, is expected to occur before the end of 2016.
Ralph Schlosstein, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evercore, said, “This transaction represents another step forward in our strategy of continuing to invest in our independent, unconflicted Investment Banking businesses while positioning our Investment Management affiliates to continue to grow and develop, sustaining exceptional unconflicted service to their investor clients. We are committed to supporting Alfredo and his colleagues as they launch Glisco as an independent company and will remain as significant investors in their funds for many years to come.”
Alfredo Castellanos, Managing Partner of Glisco Partners, added, “We have worked hard for the past 13 years to provide investors with unique high growth investment opportunities in Mexico, working closely with our colleagues at Evercore. We are excited to take the business to the next level, having received the highly valued support of our limited partner investors and Evercore. In our future funds we expect to maintain the same strategy as our previous funds. We will continue to work diligently to maintain our investors’ trust in creating value and strong returns in the exciting chapter ahead.” 





Dr. Pedro Aspe, Chairman of Evercore Mexico, said, “I am very pleased with the growth attained by the private equity business. I am committed to supporting EMCP’s transition to an independent company and continuing to serve the funds’ limited partner investors as a member of the Investment Committee.”
