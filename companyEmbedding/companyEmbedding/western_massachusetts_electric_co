Massachusetts Utility Customers Face Sharp Rate Hike
One of the largest utilities in Massachusetts that serves more than 3.2 million customers across the Northeast, National Grid, recently announced that it is seeking a rate hike similar to last year. This year, National Grid residential electric customers will see their Massachusetts electricity prices will increase 21 percent. Although the rate increase isn’t as high as last year’s rate hike, the company reported that a residential customer with a current monthly bill of $90.82 will see an increase to $110.18. 
The  National Grid Rate Hike  in Massachusetts should take effect on November 1, 2015 and last through May 1, 2016. These rate hikes reflect the volatile market, seasonality and continued gas pipeline constraints.
Consumers interested in protecting their rates from following the volatile market should explore fixed-rate options offered by many competitive electric companies including:

Ambit Energy
Constellation Energy
Direct Energy
Hudson Energy
Just Energy
Liberty Power
Suez Energy
Verde Energy


	Massachusetts is one of the many states in the country where energy consumers have a choice of both their electricity and natural gas suppliers. Unlike some markets where choices are more limited to one commodity or narrowed by location, most of Massachusetts plays by the same rules when it comes to energy deregulation.

	You can still purchase your natural gas or electricity supply from your utility if you want to, but choosing a regulated rate plan isn't for everyone. For one thing, you'll have less control over your costs by going with the utility rate in comparison to your options when you choose your own supplier. Still, it's important to know your options so that you can make an informed decision.

	Deregulated service areas in Massachusetts

	Before you can make the most of the Massachusetts laws that bring energy choice to so many people, you have to ensure you live in a deregulated area. Consumers in the service territories of these utilities have the option of choosing a competitive plan:

Electricity:


		Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company

National Grid

		NSTAR Electric

		Western Massachusetts Electric Company


Natural Gas: 


		Bay State Gas Company (Columbia Gas of Massachusetts)

		Berkshire Gas Company

		Blackstone Gas Company

		Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company

		National Grid

		New England Gas Company

		NSTAR Gas


	Choosing a plan from a competitive supplier is as simple as entering your ZIP code here at SaveOnEnergy.com®. If any of our partners offer competitive plans in your area, we make it easy to compare the options available to you.

	Learn More About Massachusetts Electricity Deregulation

	Massachusetts deregulated its energy market in 1998, essentially creating a separation between the supply and delivery portions of electricity service. Retail electricity suppliers were allowed to enter the state to offer competitive energy supply options for consumers.

	Regardless of whether you choose a competitive supplier or your utility for electricity supply, you will see both charges on your energy bill. Your utility will always charge you delivery fees because it retains the responsibility of transporting electricity to your home, as it owns the infrastructure capable of distribution.

	Retail suppliers are licensed by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, but the prices these companies charge are relative to wholesale prices in the electricity market. Sometimes, these wholesale supply prices translate into savings for Massachusetts customers who shop around.

	Do you find yourself asking: Who is the best electricity provider in MA? By comparing rates, plans and customer service options, you can easily discover which alternative electric supplier will work best for you.

	Deciding what qualities are important to you is the first step to shopping for a retail energy supplier. For example, if you are an environmental enthusiast or just want to combat climate change, you may want to purchase a plan from a retail supplier that offers green energy. If you need to cut the costs of your energy bill, you should look for the supplier that offers the lowest electricity rate in Massachusetts. Another factor you might want to compare is customer service. Do you want to make online payments? Do you want 24-hour assistance? Is a rewards program important to you? By considering these options, you are sure to find the best electricity provider in MA.

	Massachusetts Allows for Natural Gas Options Too

	In the late 1990s Massachusetts unbundled the supply and delivery portions of natural gas service, creating an environment of increased competition for customer benefit. Residential, business and industrial customers were given the opportunity to choose among competitive natural gas suppliers.

	The idea behind the unbundling, or deregulation, of the natural gas industry was to give consumers an alternative to the local utility's rates. Before this legislation went into effect, residents had to purchase natural gas from their utility.

	After the law passed, everything changed. Consumers were given the freedom of natural gas choice in most areas of Massachusetts. You no longer have to settle for utility supply rates or plans. You can shop around to find the natural gas supplier that best fits your needs!

	The difference between competitive suppliers and your utility is simple. Competitive natural gas providers sell unique packages for your natural gas supply directly to consumers. They purchase gas in bulk allowing them to offer different pricing and a number of plan options to cater to different types of consumers.

	If you'd rather not shop for a new plan, Massachusetts law allows you to receive default service from your utility. Regardless of whether you opt to go with a competitive supplier or not, your utility will continue to deliver your gas to your home because it still owns and maintains the infrastructure in its service area.

Many states have set Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) goals to grow renewable energy production, and Massachusetts is one of them. In 2010, the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources adjusted the state's RPS Class 1 Renewable Energy category to include distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) energy facilities. This change helped encourage more programs supporting other types of renewable energy production, such as wind, as well as solar power in Massachusetts. 
Massachusetts' solar energy programs include incentives for new residential and commercial PV systems. Rebates and loan programs may be available to energy consumers who install small residential or commercial systems. The state is also directing grant funding to several pilot communities to streamline complicated regulatory processes associated with distributed solar power projects.
