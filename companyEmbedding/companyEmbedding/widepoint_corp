Our Heritage




WidePoint’s history demonstrates the foundation we are building on for success.
We have grown through the merger of highly specialized regional IT consulting companies. Each of these companies has achieved a unique position within their markets due to strategic contract awards and technological leadership.



Feb-2016
WidePoint announces the renaming of its subsidiaries iSYS LLC and Operational Research Consultants Inc. (ORC) to, respectively, WidePoint Integrated Solutions Corp. and WidePoint Cybersecurity Solutions Corporation. The entities go to market as “WidePoint,” reflecting the unity and integration of their unique expertise and solutions.


May-2014
WidePoint acquired Soft-ex, a leading software provider of Telecom Data Intelligence (TDI) solutions throughout European and Middle Eastern markets, with headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The acquisition expands WidePoint’s global presence and provides access to additional service providers and channels, while adding a broader portfolio of services supporting the global Managed Mobility Services (MMS) market.


Jan-2012
The company acquired Avalon Global Solutions, Inc. (AGS), a leading provider of communications lifecycle management services, technology, and solutions predominantly to the commercial sector, to accelerate our efforts to push our automated system based communications lifecycle management solutions broadly into the commercial sector both in the U.S. marketplace and abroad.


Jan-2012
ORC authorized to issue Personal Identity Verification-Interoperable (PIV-I) as a certified Non-Federal Issuer (NFI). ORC adds this certification to its long list of accredited credentialing offerings.


Feb-2010
The company acquired the assets and relationships of VUANCE Inc.’s Government Solutions Division (subsequently operating as Advanced Response Concepts Corporation), which focuses on security solutions for viewing, tracking, locating, credentialing, and managing essential assets and personnel.


Aug-2008
The company acquired Protexx, Inc., strengthening its position in credentialing and identity management. Protexx represented a significant step in WidePoint’s goal of bringing to market an all-encompassing “Trusted Identity Network” strategy that cost-effectively meet the needs of clients across multiple markets and sectors.


Feb-2008
ORC designated as the first Federation for Identity and Cross-Credentialing Systems® (FiXs) Certified Credential Issuer. FiXs identity credentialing network is the only network certified to interoperate with the Defense Cross-Credentialing Identification System (DCCIS) infrastructure, the DOD credentialing network.


Jan-2008
iSYS awarded a contract with the GSA Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) to support wireless telecommunications expense management (TEM) services for multiple federal agencies. The indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract is valued up to $93 million over a five-year period.


Jan-2008
WidePoint acquired privately owned iSYS, LLC, to further enhance its already strong identity management capabilities while adding new high-value services and contract vehicles in Telecom Expense Management Solutions.


Nov-2007
ORC selected to support Lockheed Martin’s TSA transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program to further secure the nation’s transportation system. The TWIC credential will enhance port security by requiring all workers with unescorted access to secure areas of vessels and maritime facilities to complete a security threat assessment successfully and carry a biometric credential.


Sep-2006
WidePoint Corporation announced that its stock had been approved for trading on the NYSE Alternext U.S. Stock Exchange (formerly called the American Stock Exchange) under the new symbol WYY, replacing the symbol WDPT used on the OTC Bulletin Board.


Oct-2004
WidePoint’s acquisition of ORC capitalized on the significant increase in government spending on security solutions. ORC, a systems engineering firm, provides mission-critical sensitive and strategic information security solutions to the United States Government.


May-2004
DoD designates ORC as the first External Certificate Authority (ECA) in support of the Department of Defense Public Key Infrastructure (DoD PKI).


Mar-1999
iSYS, headquartered in McLean, VA, was founded to provide critical IT services to a broad range of customers including the Federal and State & Local governments and leading systems integrators.


Oct-1998
ORC became the first designated Interim External Certificate Authority and was awarded the GSA Access Certificate for Electronic Services (ACES) contract. These milestones positioned ORC as one of a select group of providers for Government-compliant identity management and information assurance solutions.


Mar-1991
ORC founded and assembled an organization of experienced and dedicated professionals who established a reputation for taking the hypothetical to the operational. ORC was engaged by the DoD to meet requirements for secure electronic transactions.

Acquisition history[edit]
In November 2004, WidePoint acquired ORC, followed by iSYS in January 2008.[2] The Company also operates WidePoint IL, Inc. and Protexx Acquisition Corp, which was acquired in July 2008.
Subsidiaries[edit]
iSYS[edit]
iSYS, LLC, provides IT services for federal and private organizations. It was founded in 1999 and purchased by WidePoint in January 2008. iSYS divides its services into three distinct categories:

Wireless Telecommunications Expense Management Services (TEMS): iSYS’s Telecom Management Services partners with the client’s wireless carrier to manage the expense of the telecom services. iSYS acts as a single source through which a client can manage all of its wireless assets (cell phones, BlackBerrys, PDAs, air cards and pagers). iSYS manages all of its devices in accordance with the GSA Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative [3] and claims that their TEMS can save the client 30-50% [4] on wireless costs. iSYS explains that this savings is based on a combination of increased accountability, automated processes, consolidation of services, and proper device management.[5] iSYS provides a web portal through which clients can manage all of their telecommunications needs in one place. The company manages more wireless devices than any other TEM service provider.[5]
Forensic Informatics: iSYS provides system engineering available to federal, state, and local law enforcement in the United States. iSYS’s Forensic Informatics can help law enforcement agencies implement newer information systems that meet modern requirements.
Cybersecurity: iSYS creates and performs vulnerability tests on Microsoft and Unix environments. These tests often involve the use of penetration tools such as Nessus, neWT, and eRetina, as well as other security testing tools.[6] Clients include the Department of Defense, FBI and National Institute of Health.
iSYS also provides customized consulting services.

ORC[edit]
ORC provides IT integration and secure authentication services to the U.S. Government. It is an authorized certificate authority for the United States Department of Defense,[7][8] GSA,[9] and many other certificate-based authorities.[8] ORC also provides application specific hardware and software to maintain high levels of information assurance.
Protexx[edit]
Protexx provides Remote Authentication over wired and wireless networks. The company develops software using its patent-pending competitively differentiated encryption, which uses asymmetric authentication employed as PKI to provide user and sender verification with up to 2048-bit encryption. This improves upon standard multi-factor authentication by eliminating the additional hardware, licensing and support usually required to provide a comparable level security. With this encryption, all incoming and outgoing traffic (email, HTTP, FTP, IM, VoIP, etc.) is automatically encrypted and authenticated.
Advance Response Concepts Corporation[edit]
ARCC provides identity verification and emergency coordination between emergency services and infrastructure agencies as well as evidence tracking software for the Department of Justice. The emergency coordination package is based around the trademarked RaptorID system, which issues physical identification devices (barcodes, smart cards) to first responders so that field operations can immediately identify each responder and establish their credentials. RaptorID smart cards store baseline attributes as mandated by national standards organizations like the National Fire Protection Association and often contain additional information about the user, including skills, training, certifications and medical records. The RaptorID system is designed to meet Federal Emergency Management Agency and ANSI specifications for first responder credentialing.
ARCC's crime scene management and evidence tracking software, CONDOR, gives crime scene officials the ability to digitally record and track evidence throughout the chain of custody, as well as monitor the activities of all personnel involved. ARCC achieves this by embedding RFID trackers into each piece of evidence and biometrically scanning each official that attempts to accesses the evidence, all in accordance with the U.S. National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) compliance system.[10]
Government contracts[edit]
Most of WidePoint’s government client base is located in the Mid-Atlantic region. WidePoint currently holds contracts with the Transportation Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, Washington Headquarters Services, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Centers for Disease Control, as well as many government contractors and private corporations.
Competition[edit]
Due to its diverse market capabilities, WidePoint has competitors in many different fields. WidePoint’s main opposition in Mobility Management includes Avalon Technologies, Profitline and Tangoe. In Cyber Security as well as Consulting, WidePoint’s key competitors are Lockheed Martin Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation. WidePoint also has several small and mid-size competitors in each of segment of services.

Acquisition history[edit]
In November 2004, WidePoint acquired ORC, followed by iSYS in January 2008.[2] The Company also operates WidePoint IL, Inc. and Protexx Acquisition Corp, which was acquired in July 2008.
Subsidiaries[edit]
iSYS[edit]
iSYS, LLC, provides IT services for federal and private organizations. It was founded in 1999 and purchased by WidePoint in January 2008. iSYS divides its services into three distinct categories:

Wireless Telecommunications Expense Management Services (TEMS): iSYS’s Telecom Management Services partners with the client’s wireless carrier to manage the expense of the telecom services. iSYS acts as a single source through which a client can manage all of its wireless assets (cell phones, BlackBerrys, PDAs, air cards and pagers). iSYS manages all of its devices in accordance with the GSA Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative [3] and claims that their TEMS can save the client 30-50% [4] on wireless costs. iSYS explains that this savings is based on a combination of increased accountability, automated processes, consolidation of services, and proper device management.[5] iSYS provides a web portal through which clients can manage all of their telecommunications needs in one place. The company manages more wireless devices than any other TEM service provider.[5]
Forensic Informatics: iSYS provides system engineering available to federal, state, and local law enforcement in the United States. iSYS’s Forensic Informatics can help law enforcement agencies implement newer information systems that meet modern requirements.
Cybersecurity: iSYS creates and performs vulnerability tests on Microsoft and Unix environments. These tests often involve the use of penetration tools such as Nessus, neWT, and eRetina, as well as other security testing tools.[6] Clients include the Department of Defense, FBI and National Institute of Health.
iSYS also provides customized consulting services.

ORC[edit]
ORC provides IT integration and secure authentication services to the U.S. Government. It is an authorized certificate authority for the United States Department of Defense,[7][8] GSA,[9] and many other certificate-based authorities.[8] ORC also provides application specific hardware and software to maintain high levels of information assurance.
Protexx[edit]
Protexx provides Remote Authentication over wired and wireless networks. The company develops software using its patent-pending competitively differentiated encryption, which uses asymmetric authentication employed as PKI to provide user and sender verification with up to 2048-bit encryption. This improves upon standard multi-factor authentication by eliminating the additional hardware, licensing and support usually required to provide a comparable level security. With this encryption, all incoming and outgoing traffic (email, HTTP, FTP, IM, VoIP, etc.) is automatically encrypted and authenticated.
Advance Response Concepts Corporation[edit]
ARCC provides identity verification and emergency coordination between emergency services and infrastructure agencies as well as evidence tracking software for the Department of Justice. The emergency coordination package is based around the trademarked RaptorID system, which issues physical identification devices (barcodes, smart cards) to first responders so that field operations can immediately identify each responder and establish their credentials. RaptorID smart cards store baseline attributes as mandated by national standards organizations like the National Fire Protection Association and often contain additional information about the user, including skills, training, certifications and medical records. The RaptorID system is designed to meet Federal Emergency Management Agency and ANSI specifications for first responder credentialing.
ARCC's crime scene management and evidence tracking software, CONDOR, gives crime scene officials the ability to digitally record and track evidence throughout the chain of custody, as well as monitor the activities of all personnel involved. ARCC achieves this by embedding RFID trackers into each piece of evidence and biometrically scanning each official that attempts to accesses the evidence, all in accordance with the U.S. National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) compliance system.[10]
Government contracts[edit]
Most of WidePoint’s government client base is located in the Mid-Atlantic region. WidePoint currently holds contracts with the Transportation Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, Washington Headquarters Services, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Centers for Disease Control, as well as many government contractors and private corporations.
Competition[edit]
Due to its diverse market capabilities, WidePoint has competitors in many different fields. WidePoint’s main opposition in Mobility Management includes Avalon Technologies, Profitline and Tangoe. In Cyber Security as well as Consulting, WidePoint’s key competitors are Lockheed Martin Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation. WidePoint also has several small and mid-size competitors in each of segment of services.
