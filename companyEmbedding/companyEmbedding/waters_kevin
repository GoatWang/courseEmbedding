Kevin Watters Named CEO of Mortgage Banking at Chase (Photo: Business Wire)
 





December 18, 2012 12:50 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) announced today that Kevin Watters would be 
      named CEO of Mortgage Banking. Watters previously ran Mortgage 
      Origination and led the Customer Experience across Mortgage Banking. 
      He’s been with Chase and its predecessor firms for 13 years.
    


      As previously announced, Mortgage Banking will fully integrate into 
      Consumer & Community Banking as one line of business serving 50 million 
      customers. Watters will report to Gordon Smith, co-CEO of Consumer & 
      Community Banking.
    

      “We’re so pleased to expand Kevin’s responsibilities as CEO of Mortgage 
      Banking,” said Gordon Smith, co-CEO of Consumer & Community Banking. 
      “Under his leadership, we have achieved record revenue and net 
      income in Mortgage Originations, improved our market share, and perhaps 
      most important, greatly improved our customers’ experience at Chase. 
      He’s a great leader, colleague and culture carrier.”
    

      “Kevin has been one of the key architects of Mortgage Banking’s return 
      to profitability,” said Frank Bisignano, co-Chief Operating Officer of 
      JPMorgan Chase. “This role is a natural expansion of his successful 
      leadership of Mortgage Originations. I know he’ll continue the strong 
      momentum we’ve had in restoring Mortgage Banking to profitability.”
    

      Mortgage Banking has experienced a significant improvement in its 
      business performance over the past two years. Mortgage Banking recorded 
      net income of $2.9 billion as of the third quarter of 2012, compared to 
      a net loss of $1.9 billion as of the third quarter of 2011. Year-to-date 
      in 2012, mortgage banking production income was a record high. Customer 
      service has also greatly improved. Chase jumped to #4 in the 2012 
      J.D. Power Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Survey up from #12 a 
      year ago.


      Since 2010, Kevin Watters ran Mortgage Originations and the Customer 
      Experience, including Chase’s four mortgage production channels: Retail, 
      Consumer Direct, Correspondent Lending and Rural Housing. He was also 
      responsible for marketing, product management and the Executive Office. 
      Prior to Mortgage Banking, he served as CEO of Business Banking since 
      2005. Earlier in his career at the firm, he worked in the Corporate 
      Internet Group, Strategy, and Marketing.

Smart membrane products: Kevin Costner, Water Planet team up to advance sustainable water reuse








































LOS ANGELES, CA, March 30, 2017 -- In 2009, famed actor and environmentalist Kevin Costner and Eric Hoek, then a professor of engineering at UCLA, joined forces to develop a system aimed at cleaning up oil & gas produced water. In 2010, this system was put to a different kind of test when it was used to clean up the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Throughout this process, Costner and Hoek forged a strong alliance that continues to this day with Water Planet Inc., a Los Angeles-based company that sells the world's first smart membrane products.
 








Eric Hoek, CEO of Water Planet, and famed actor Kevin Costner are committed to advancing water sustainability through reuse.
 
Just a year after the BP spill, Hoek and his colleague Subir Bhattarcharjee, now Water Planet's Chief Technology Officer, co-founded the company, with Costner and his long-time business partner Rod Lake as the company's founding investors. In just over five years, Water Planet has achieved remarkable and rapid success in commercializing two leading-edge water treatment technologies.[Native Advertisement]
To put Water Planet's accomplishment into perspective, the process of taking a water treatment technology from R&D to the marketplace typically takes a decade or more. Moreover, most technology advancements in the conservative water treatment industry are evolutionary, not disruptive, in nature.
But Water Planet already has orders for scores of systems that incorporate its revolutionary IntelliFlux(r) artificial intelligence based control software in projects from North America to the Middle East. In addition, its PolyCera(r) membranes have broken new ground by merging the robustness of rugged but costly ceramic membranes -- able to treat the most challenging waters -- at the much lower cost of polymeric membranes.
Today, Water Planet is pioneering the use of true artificial intelligence, or machine learning, in the water treatment industry.
"Artificial intelligence brings features that society has grown accustomed to in other areas of their lives to the water industry. The complex mathematics that goes into optimizing a water filtration process can't be calculated offline by humans fast enough to be helpful," said Hoek.
"Computers excel at rapid computations, including compiling waves of information and performing integration, derivatives, or logarithmic fits. Our experience already shows significant cost savings by using artificial intelligence to optimize membrane systems, which helps deliver more water at less cost," he added.
In keeping with "Why Wastewater," the theme of this year's World Water Day, both Costner and Hoek remain deeply committed to advancing water sustainability through reuse.
"It took an environmental disaster to make the connection with Eric and now Water Planet, but I am proud to be involved with a team that is poised to make a fundamental difference for a world seeking solutions to ensure our water future," Costner said.
About Water Planet
Based in Los Angeles, California, Water Planet (www.waterplanet.com) sells the world's first smart membrane products, which enable the most reliable and cost-effective approach to industrial water reuse. PolyCera(r) robust & easy-to-clean ultrafiltration membranes and IntelliFlux(r) self-adaptive flux optimization for ultrafiltration membranes mean more water and less cost.
