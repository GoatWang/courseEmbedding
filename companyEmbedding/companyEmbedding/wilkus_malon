An unlikely financier
Malon Wilkus says his best business lessons came from a commune





May 26, 2008 @ 12:01 am
By 
	Janet Morrissey


















+ Zoom



				You won't find diplomas from Harvard or Wharton on his office walls. 
In fact, the unlikely founder of American Capital Strategies Ltd., the largest private-equity firm in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, is a college dropout who has lived on a commune and dabbled in hammock making and shrimp farming. 
But since its initial public offering in 1997, Malon Wilkus' Bethesda, Md.-based firm has acquired or helped finance 470 middle-market companies. It manages $21 billion in assets, up from $155 million at the time of its IPO, and has delivered average compounded annual returns of 18% to shareholders, including an average dividend yield of almost 10%.

Malon Wilkus: The deteriorating economy and the credit crunch are avenues of opportunity, he says. (Martin H. Simon)

And despite a negative return of 22% in 2007 � a result of a decline "with the rest of the financial stocks" � Mr. Wilkus is predicting a rebound in 2008. Mr. Wilkus believes the deteriorating economy and credit crunch are providing opportunity for his company's business. His prediction appears to be playing out. While not yet in positive territory, American Capital has posted returns of -0.5%, better than the S&P 500's -5.3% return. How did he do it? Largely by blazing his own path. Born Edward Frank Wilkus 56 years ago in Coffeyville, Kan., population 10,000, he changed his name to Malon (pronounced like the Italian city of Milan) when he was 18, because he "liked the sound of it."  After two years at the University of Illinois, where he studied computer science and sociology, Mr. Wilkus dropped out in 1972.  Then, with $125 in his pocket "and a very nice camera," he set off for Latin America, selling the camera to get across the border from Mexico to Belize. After running out of money in Costa Rica, he took on a series of odd jobs, including selling the Encyclopaedia Britannica door-to-door, in Spanish. "Since I didn't know Spanish, it was a tough job � a very tough job," Mr. Wilkus laughed. Later, working as a busboy at a French restaurant, he came up with a unique way to fish for shrimp, and convinced the restaurant owner to invest in his idea. The shrimp business flopped, but Mr. Wilkus discovered he enjoyed raising money to fund his ideas.  Returning to the United States and college in 1974, he joined the East Wind commune in Missouri.  "I think my parents were distressed by that," Mr. Wilkus said ruefully. He spent the next nine years at the commune, where he made hammocks, sandals and nut butters that were sold to food co-ops and Pier 1 Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas. "I learned most of what I know about business today from that experience," Mr. Wilkus said, explaining that he grew to understand the motivation of customers and investors.  In 1983, he left the commune for a job in marketing at the Calvert Group, an asset management firm in Bethesda, where he learned how to gather assets. Three years later, Mr. Wilkus launched American Capital from the living room of his two-bedroom condo, which he shared with his wife, Susan, and their three children. He got a $75,000 loan from people he had known from his commune days and maxed out his credit cards for an additional $75,000. "It was a very, very difficult business to start," Mr. Wilkus said.  Initially, American Capital focused on helping workers at small- and medium-sized companies acquire their employers by using employee stock ownership plans. In 1997, he took American Capital public as a business development company, offering debt financing or taking equity stakes in buyout situations. Today the company boasts 700 employees with offices in 13 cities around the world. "We built a private-equity firm that the average American can invest in," Mr. Wilkus said. "We've democratized private equity." American Capital investors can take part in buyout deals simply by purchasing shares, which recently traded at $31.87 a pop. As a business development company, American Capital avoids paying federal taxes if it distributes at least 90% of its income as dividends. For this reason, the company's dividend has always been high, which attracts shareholders.  For years, Wall Street naysayers accused the company of not earning enough to cover the lofty dividend and suggested it needed the capital markets to fund the distribution. "For the last 10 years, in every single year, we have covered 100% of our dividend with ordinary taxable income and even paid out excess amounts in bonus dividends," Mr. Wilkus countered. To offer "one-stop buyouts" that don't require extra time or additional financing to close, the company raises cash several times a year through secondary offerings. It has completed 31 such offerings since its IPO, six of them in 2007. Since last June, it has raised $4 billion, even in a down market. "The fact that they can still go out and raise equity is a sign" of the market's confidence in the company, said Troy Ward, a senior analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co. of St. Louis.  Over the years, American Capital has invested in a broad range of companies, including Gibson Guitar Corp., Bumble Bee Foods LLC, AAMCO Transmissions Inc., Riddell Sports Group Inc., and Piper Aircraft Inc. It offers an array of financing, including senior and mezzanine debt, and equity investments. This diversification helps to insulate American Capital, Mr. Wilkus contends.  The biggest risk facing the company is the health of the economy, which could affect the operations of companies that American Capital has acquired or helped with debt financing, Mr. Troy said.  In the first quarter, American Capital posted a loss of $813 million, most of which the company attributed to an accounting change related to Fair Value Financial Accounting Standard 157. Because Mr. Wilkus believes "the economy will get worse before it gets better," his company is scrutinizing potential deals more closely. Currently, he is avoiding restaurants, automakers and cyclical companies, but sees opportunities in energy, medical products, selected financial institutions and some distressed companies. He also is warming up to housing-related companies, believing that housing will bottom next year.  There are even more opportunities abroad. "There's a very robust M&A market in Europe, and we think there are great opportunities there," Mr. Wilkus said. E-mail Janet Morrissey at jmorrissey@investmentnews.com.

4 Things American Capital Ltd. Investors Should Know
American Capital Ltd. is by no means a simple business to understand, but recent comments from CEO Malon Wilkus should help put its businesses in perspective. 











                Jordan Wathen
            

                (TMFValueMagnet)



            
            Dec 13, 2013 at 6:55PM
            
            





Finance CEOs are usually tight-lipped on conference calls, but put them in a room of their peers -- bankers and analysts -- and they'll really open up.
Malon Wilkus, CEO of American Capital Ltd. (NASDAQ:ACAS), recently appeared at the J.P. Morgan SMid Cap Conference to deliver some very interesting tidbits of information to close observers.
Here's the "meat" of the presentation in fewer than 600 words:
1. The asset management business is gravyAmerican Capital's asset management business is its bread and butter, providing dividends in the range of $25 million quarter after quarter. The biggest slice comes from its management fees from its prized mREITs, American Capital Agency (NASDAQ:AGNC) and American Capital Mortgage (NASDAQ:MTGE).
American Capital Agency is the bigger mREIT of the two, holding $10 billion in fee-earning assets, on which American Capital Ltd. earns 1.25% ($125 million in annual fees). American Capital earns annual fees of 1.5% from American Capital Mortgage.





Asset management is a fantastic business because it requires little to no new investment to grow income. If there is any one business under the American Capital umbrella that "moves the needle," it's the asset management business.
2. Structured products are a cash machineSecond to the asset management business is the structured product business, in which American Capital invests in collateralized loan obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Malon Wilkus commented that the CLO book earned a 17% internal rate of return over its history. The mortgage-backed securities business performed poorly, producing negative 18% internal rates of return. 
The structured product business is a very small slice of American Capital's asset value, but like the asset management arm, it produces an outsized amount of net operating income. In the third quarter of 2013, structured products were valued at roughly 5% of NAV, but produced 21% of revenue.
3. Wilkus doesn't think BDCs are American Capital's peersAmerican Capital Ltd. is a business development company, much like Prospect Capital or Ares Capital. However, it is very different than most BDCs on the public market. For one, it doesn't pay a dividend. Secondly, it invests primarily in equity, not debt. Wilkus called other BDCs "finance companies," whereas American Capital Ltd. is more of an operating company because it invests heavily in companies it controls.





Wilkus believes American Capital is best compared to a diversified growth company like Roper Industries  or Danaher, both of which own numerous subsidiaries that drive total corporate-level income. Alas, in the eyes of the regulators and IRS, American Capital is every bit of a BDC.
Comparing American Capital to Roper and Danaher is interesting. It's largely expected that American Capital Ltd. will eventually become a diversified growth company by splitting its debt and equity investment portfolios into two publicly traded entities. Such a move could help it realize a higher valuation. 
4. Controlled companies are earning moneyOne of the problems with American Capital Ltd. is that it is an investment company. Thus, it doesn't report income earned by portfolio companies unless that income is paid to American Capital Ltd. as a dividend. The only insight into its portfolio company earnings comes from how American Capital values its investments in its operating companies in quarterly SEC filings.
Wilkus noted that its controlled companies were producing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of about $720 million per year. In its presentations, we find American Capital's companies are also spending about $115 million annually on capital expenditures.





Though these numbers are not perfect -- the footnotes reveal they include estimates, and may be forward- or backward-looking numbers -- if they are even remotely correct, American Capital's control companies should be capable of paying big dividends back to their corporate parent.
American Capital has a plan to make its portfolio company earnings more transparent to investors. It will finance new buyouts in a way that will allow the parent company to collect routine dividends, which will flow directly to net operating income. Thus, dividend income going forward will be a proxy for how profitable its portfolio companies really are.
The Foolish bottom lineAmerican Capital is between a rock and a hard place. It's a BDC unlike any other, which complicates investors' understanding of how it makes money, and how it should be valued. Recent efforts to make its portfolio more transparent should be applauded, but it still has a long way to go.
