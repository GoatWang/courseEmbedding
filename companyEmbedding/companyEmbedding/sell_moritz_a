Frequently Asked Questions





            General questions
          



Is there a setup fee?
No. There are no setup fees on any of our plans.

 
Do I need to enter my credit card details to sign up?
No. You can sign up and use Shopify for 14 days without entering your credit card details. At the end of your trial, or when you decide to launch your store, you will need to pick a plan and enter your credit card details.

 
Can I cancel my account at any time?
Yes. If you ever decide that Shopify isn’t the best ecommerce platform for your business, simply cancel your account.

 
How long are your contracts?
All Shopify plans are month to month unless you sign up for an annual or biennial plan.

 
Do you offer any discounted plans?
Yes, we offer a 10% discount on annual plans and a 20% discount on biennial plans, when they are paid upfront.

 
Can I change my plan later on?
Absolutely! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time.

 
Is Shopify PCI Compliant or PCI Certified?
Yes. Shopify is certified Level 1 PCI DSS compliant. This means all your data and customer information is ultra secure.

 
Do I have to sell the same products in-store as I do online?
No, you can choose exactly what products to sell online, in-store, or both.

 
What is the rate if I type in a credit card?
If you chose to type in a credit card number instead of using the Shopify credit card reader, you will be charged the same rate as your online rate.



Are there any transaction fees?
Use Shopify Payments and pay no transaction fee. If you choose an
external payment gateway, there will be additional fees of 2%, 1% or
0.5% for our Basic Shopify, Shopify, and Advanced Shopify plans,
respectively.

 






            Online questions
          



Can I use my own domain name?
Yes. You can purchase a domain name within Shopify, or use an existing one that you own. We also provide a free myshopify.com domain name to all stores on sign up.



What are your bandwidth fees?
There are none. All Shopify plans include unlimited bandwidth for free.



Do I need a web host?
Shopify includes secure, unlimited ecommerce hosting on all plans except Shopify Lite. You can also use the Buy Button to add ecommerce to any existing website.

 




              POS questions
            



What does Shopify POS do?
Shopify POS is an application for iOS and Android devices that you can
use for transactions in a physical store or pop-up setting. Find
products, process orders, take payment, swipe credit cards, produce
receipts, and control it all from your iPad or mobile device. All the
background management of your store is done from your Shopify admin,
which you can access using any browser.



Can I merge my Shopify online store with Shopify POS?
Yes. Your Shopify online store automatically synchronizes with Shopify
POS, and you manage your entire business from one dashboard. Product or
inventory updates that you make in your Shopify admin will instantly
take effect in Shopify POS.



Can I use Shopify POS if I have multiple cash registers in use at the same time?
Yes. You can install Shopify POS on multiple devices, and you won’t be
charged any extra. Store activity on all devices is synchronized with
your Shopify admin.



Can I use Shopify POS if I’m outside the United States/Canada?
The Shopify POS app is available worldwide. There are just two
important considerations:

You'll have to buy the supported hardware through an external
retailer.
You'll have to use an external credit card terminal to
accept credit cards.




Where can I buy a cash register, receipt printer, and other hardware?
You can buy hardware kits and individual items of supported hardware from the Shopify
Hardware Store in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the continental United States. Outside of
these countries, supported hardware is available from authorized
resellers.

Moritz Trailers



Moritz Trailers Dealers



Moritz International is an American company based out of Mansfield, Ohio. It started in the early 1970s when F. Thomas Moritz purchased a trailer for his farm but didn’t perform the way he needed it to. He thought he could produce a better one himself, so he did.  Fast forward over 40 years and Moritz International is still going strong, producing a wide variety of trailers for different applications. They include equipment trailers, truck beds, dumps, livestock, flatbeds and utility trailers.
The livestock trailers come in two different designs, the C-Series and S-Series.
Both are standard 7ft tall with 1-inch slats made of yellow pine. Additional features include divider gates, escape door latch and aluminum wheels. The C-Series is their standard-duty livestock trailer and the S-Series is Moritz’s standard-duty horse trailer.
Below you will find a list of farm equipment dealers in your area that sell Moritz products:

Title: Senior Advisor
               Company: Markston International LLC
Job Details
               Markston International LLC is an independent investment manager with a 30+ year history. The original Markston Investment Management was founded in 1981. The firm's strategy is to search for stocks that are attractively priced but where the presence of a catalyst has the potential to drive excess returns. Because this strategy is market cap agnostic, the firm's All Cap product spawned a Large Cap and SMID Cap product. These products have been consistently managed under the same investment philosophy since their founding. In 2012, Markston introduced a more concentrated Large Cap Value product.

By Abbyfrom Muskegon, MichiganAbout Me Brand BuyerProsCreates Even TanDries QuicklyEasy To ApplyNatural TanNot GreasyConsFades QuicklyUneven FadeBest UsesBodyFaceComments about St. Moriz Instant Self-Tanning Mousse:Was very easy to apply especially for beginners. You simply need a self tanning mitt and the product. The one downside to this product is that you have to work quickly and sometimes it is hard to get even lines. I also found that it faded patchy. But overall was an awesome product if you're on a budget or are just looking for a really great self tanner that is not expensive, the product was very high quality for its price tag.Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friendWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review7/8/2017 5.0ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT!

It has a nice smell, is super easy to apply the foam which works wayyyy better than a tanning lotion or wipe, and provides a GORGEOUS tan overnight. The tan starts to fade after a couple days so if you want a consistent tan you probably would have apply at least twice a week, but this is definitely the cheapest self-tanning foam I have found that actually works this well so well worth it in the long run! If you have ever considered self-tanners, BUY THIS PRODUCT!Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friendWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review7/6/2017 5.0Love love love this product!

I've tried st.tropez and though the color was weak, so I went with St. Moriz. To start, the product smells great, almost like baby powder, it doesn't have that self tanner smell. The product applied quick, evenly, and even dried fast. I usually tan overnight, when I woke up in the morning I was ORANGE (maybe not pumpkin orange, but def more orange than I'm used to when I use minetan). When I went to go shower the product off, the tan was even and not streaky. After I dried off I noticed that my skin felt dry and itchy, I could literally feel my skin pulling with every movement. I put lotion on and went about my day. That night when I got home I noticed that the tan was already "cracking", it hadn't even been 24hours. $12.99 is not worth it when the tan ends up cracking and looking terrible after 24 hours. It dried my skin out to the point when I was itchy for the next two days. Don't buy this product. Spend a little extra $ to get something that actually works.Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend(0 of 1 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review7/5/2017 5.0Absolute BEST self-tanner I've ever used! By Haileyfrom Louisville, KYAbout Me Brand BuyerProsCreates Even TanDoesn't Clog PoresDries QuicklyEasy To ApplyNatural TanNot GreasyWorks QuicklyConsBest UsesBodyDaily UseFaceQuick-FixComments about St. Moriz Instant Self-Tanning Mousse:I am an avid self-tanner and this product in the dark shade is my new holy grail! The color is amazing and so even (two layers applied after showering/exfoliating a few hours before bed). I've tried products from both end of the $$$ spectrum (St. Tropez, Jergen's, etc.) and this is a great, affordable middle-of-the-line product. This is the first product I've found where there is almost no smell, which is huge for this pregnant lady (can't handle the bad self tanner smell). My biggest problem with every self tanner I have ever tried is that it does NOTHING on my chest. I can't even get color on my chest from actual sun tanning. It's weird. BUT my chest is so even and the color is so deep. I could have cried. My hands and feet look great and even too. You do have to work fast when applying because it sinks into the skin quickly so it was getting real dark real fast where I pumped it onto my skin. Problem solved once I pumped the product onto my mit and worked in smaller sections. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great tan on a budget!Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friendWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review7/2/2017(2 of 2 customers found this review helpful) 4.0LOVE THIS TANNER By Palegirlfrom VirginiaAbout Me Budget BuyerProsCreates Even TanDries QuicklyEasy To ApplyNatural TanConsBad OdorFades QuicklyBest UsesComments about St. Moriz Instant Self-Tanning Mousse:I'm a die-hard St Tropez Dark Mousse self tan lover...however, I usually buy a jumbo size bottle off of a TV network for the price of a regular bottle and needed a quick fix. St Moriz mousse in dark seemed like a great dupe (at least from the packagng) and super cheap so I decided to give it a try. I hate to say it, but I actually like this stuff BETTER than St Tropez!!! Dries faster, not as sticky, similar color pay off. The mousse itself is way less watery than St Tropez and therefore eliminates streaks as well. Only cons are a stronger smell and a 2-3 day wear period as opposed to St Tropez's 5-6 day. I will be buying this tanner from now on!(2 of 2 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this reviewDisplaying reviews 1-10Back to topPrevious | Next »

Ice Cubes - Candy Blog

Ice Cubes


As a kid I loved Ice Cubes. They’re little squares of hazelnut mockolate. Their unique selling proposition included the fact that they were individual pieces that sold for 10 cents a piece and had a wild, cool feeling on the tongue when they melted instantly. 
I remember buying them at the student union on the Kent State University campus when I was a kid waiting for my mother to be done with classes or my father to be done with work. (I usually panhandled to get the money to buy them, I was pretty shameless in the lengths I would go to get my fix.) Later when I was in college on my own I would use my meal points at the Jolly Giant Commons to buy these by the tub. 
The little candies have been around since the mid-thirties, made in Germany by a small company called Nappo and sold by Albert’s in the States. They’re similar to the Caffarel Gianduia, except for the fact that they’re made with partially hydrogenated coconut oil instead of nut paste and chocolate. 

I was really excited to find these looking so smart and crisp at The Candy Store in San Francisco on Friday. I see them every once in a while, but they always look sad and melted. The Candy Store had a whole jar of pristine looking Ice Cubes in both wrappers (they’re switching to a gold wrapper from the traditional blue and white so there’s a crossover right now). 
They don’t smell like much, a little sweet, a little nutty, but nothing like chocolate. They have a soft bite and an immediate hit of cool on the tongue. They melt quickly (as partially hydrogenated coconut oil has a melting point of 76 degrees F) and have a decent mix of nutty flavors, a little milkiness and a little hit of cocoa. A little grainy, they’re not quite as good as I remember. 
Now, for the sobering part. Read the ingredients: partially hydrogenated coconut oil, sugar, low fat cocoa, dried sweet whey, soy flour, hazelnut paste, soy lecithin, artificial vanilla flavor. 
There is no nutritional info included with these, but this page tells me that just one of them is 22% of my daily value of saturated fat (65 calories). 
So while I enjoyed this little trip back in time to taste those little cubes of obsession and trans fats, now that I’m all grown up and have found good sources of candy, I don’t think I’ll ever eat these again now that I’ve found Caffarel Gianduias. (The traditional ones are perfect, the novelty shaped ones are fun & make a cute stocking stuffer.) In fact, at The Candy Store the price for Caffarel and Ice Cubes was identical ... 75 cents each. I bought a handful of Fig and Chestnut ones ... something I’ll feel a little less guilty about eating.

I loved these as a kid!  There was something mysterious and oddly glamorous about them, and they did, in fact, feel “cooler” to the tongue than one expected them to, in keeping with the name.  That hazelnut flavor, too, was unlike anything else available at the candy store.  I’m not sure I’d be nostalgic enough to take the trans-fat hit, though.
  
I don’t like the new gold wrapper—it doesn’t cue that “ice” thing in the same way and makes them look more like other candies.

These are known as “Icy Squares” in Canada.  There are also “Icy Cups” which are the same thing, just round and sort of shaped like a Reese’s mini pb cup.  They’ve also introduced “Dark” Icy Squares this year.

I used to love these when I was little and up here there is one place where you can get them called Suckers..

Ah, the elite candy of my childhood only sold at the “expensive” candy store up the hill. I remember the upset it caused when Ice Cubes hit a dime a cube.

I too, remember these fondly as a kid. The only place to get them was in the local German butcher. They were 5 cents each. I’ve seen them occasionally lately at .75 to 1.00 each, and I admit, I’ve grabbed a couple from time to time. I have to agree with one of the other posters that they are grainier than I remember. I went in a local grocery store while travelling recently in Maryland. They had them in the bulk candy section for $2.49 per pound. That price didn’t really register, until I plopped 10 of them in a bag, put them on the scale, they weighed a little less than 1/4 pound, and the total price was 55 cents. 
That is 5 cents each. Who says you can’t go back in time? I even checked the item code, thinking I might have put in the wrong code, but there on the label it said “Albert’s Ice Cubes” and $2.49/lb. Ahhhh. Can’t wait to go back

The best candy ever!  These ice cubes rate much higher than just “pleasant”  they get a super superb from me.  I’ve got an idea, I’ll trade you diet food for the ice cubes.  I don’t care about how much saturated fat they have, they are totally worth it.

to those of you who think the blue-and-silver wrapper is the “traditional” one: sorry, folks, but you’re *way* wrong!
i don’t know from the 1930’s, but in the 60’s and 70’s, the gold wrappers were the way i discovered these little, irresistable, melt-in-your-mouth, delectibles, at the firelands country store, when my family and i would go on weekend fishing trips.
and they were 2?, not 5?!  it took a great deal of dedication to pass over all the penny candies, just to indulge in these sweet, luscious squares! 
happy reminiscences!

Blingadore….YOU ARE RIGHT, the gold ones were the original. I thought that too, when I first found this site, but they seem like such the authority (in a good way) on candy, I didn’t question it, I thought maybe I’d missed something. I always remember them in the gold and 5 cents. They never had them in my penny candy store, I found them much later. Thanks for adding that, now I know I’m not losing my mind!—Nancy

Loved these as a kid and really hard to find now.  I remember that sometimes they melted in your hand even before you could open the wrapper.  No one else I know even knows what I’m talking about when I tell them that I LOVE them!

I was happy to find these in a candy store yesterday, but when I bit into my first one in many years I found that the coolness had diminished a lot since my last last taste ago. In trying to find out what has changed I looked at the ingredients and saw hydrogenated coconut oil. I don’t know that hydrogenated coconut oil existed when I was a kid and suspect that it was pure, unadulterated coconut oil back then. I, too, noticed some graininess to yesterday’s experience and am a little disappointed. The gold wrapper was always the better than the silver wrapper type. I think the silver wrapper contained an actual nut, but why waste money on that when more of that coolness was in the gold style. I’d love to know if they have altered the ingredients since 1965. Anybody?

The Gold Foil wrappers are the one’s from the 60’s and 70’s that I remember. The thing that is different in the “Blue Foil” product is they don’t have any or near the amount of Hazelnut flavoring or additives. They taste more like frosting from a can than the old , rich, smooth, hazelnut flavored chocolate. If they made them like the “old days” they would be so great! With the “new” gold foil wrappers, did we get a return to the taste from before???

When you think about it back in the day (for me the 70’s) these ice cubes were half the size they are now and I could buy 2 for five cents.  I don’t think its a grainy thing, just more of a good thing.  I remember they were the perfect size with a slight Hazelnut flavor listed in the ingredients then.

my memory is from when i would buy these for 2cents each a our local five and dime in ravenna, ohio(right next door to kent state). i have passed this fondess on to my son and daughter-in-law. even though i now pay 25 cent each, they are well worth the guilty pleasure. enjoy!

I was sad when the price went up, but it didn’t stop me from buying them when (very occasionally) I’d com across them.  Now its been years since I’ve seen them.  I just found them on the web and was planning on stocking up - I think this is something that all of my family and friends need to experienc because none of them know what Ice Cubes are.  Although, now that I hear all of these things, the graininess, the loss of flavor, the change of ingredients… I’m not so sure.  Maybe I’ll just get one pound to see first.  If I am going to dose all of my chocolate-weak friends (and myself), I want the saturated fat and calories honestly, darn it!

for those having a hard time finding these. (I used to have to travel to a candy shop in Gettysburg called Fuzziwigs to get my fix) but now I see them in Giant grocery stores in their candy aisle with the plastic bins where you can make your own candy bags.

Yes, Giant, Shaws and Weis have them in the bulk candy aisle. I had seen them at Cracker Barrell about a year ago, I think 5 were packaged up for $1.99. I was dieting at the time (what a waste of time), so I didn’t buy them, but since get my fix at the bulk candy aisle. I think I also saw them at Wegman’s. It’s great we are keeping this thread going! —Nancy

I bought these in the 1950’s for 2 cents each at Minnie’s Candy store, “conveniently located” just across the street fom our elementary school. They came in the GOLD wrapper… the blue and silver came much later ... snd they were not as soft- they did not melt in your mouth.  I even had to quit the Brownies/scouts  because I spent all my dues on these things (without my parents knowledge ofcourse) I just rec’vd a bunch for my 55th birthday and can’t control myself… I’ll be glad when they are gone! Love ‘em.

How funny, I am 21 and I never knew the history these little guys had. I found Ice Cubes at a small corner store by my house when I was 7. They were 25 cents each. I used to save a dollar from my lunch money through the week and buy 4 every Friday after school. When we moved away a few years later I never saw them again.
But, just last week a new Candy Shop opened in my area of town and I was meandering by when something urged to go in.. How funny to see a small box of Ice Cubes (now 50 cents a piece) on the shelf. Needless to say, I bought the whole box and enjoyed 4 of them on Friday.
Oh, the simple things in life.

I just recently rediscovered Ice Cubes in the gold wrapper at my local convenience store for 25 cents.  I was really surprised because they were that price about 18 years ago when I first bought them. In this time of rising chocolate  (and everything else)prices, they are still a bargain.

I lived on a military base in West Germany in 1960-63.  A horse drawn wagon would come into the base and sell candy to the kids.  I remember buying a small plastic cup shaped like a champagne glass, with a plastic spoon attached to the side, filled with chocolate.  
Years later, back in the States, I bought an Ice Cube candy (about 1969) and the memories came flooding back!  This was that chocolate in the plastic champagne glass!
I love them to this day and wish I could find the plastic champagne glass again; it was fun and cool!

I found your blog, after I found the Ice Cubes online at several online places.  Just do a search for them and you’ll get several sites selling them.  I have yet to buy any online.  But locally I have not seen them for a while. Back in the mid-late 90’s I was a courier and would find them at odd country stores while out dropping things off. They were 25 cents mostly.  I love chocolate, the name intrigued me so I bought a few.  Gades, instant addiction.  I mostly remember them being hard to keep from melting in my hot car, and never getting enough of them.   
Coconut Oil has a lower melting point and is cheaper than Cocoa Butter when making chocolate, so that might be a reason they used it.  I buy cocoa butter online to help make my own chocolate.

I was just on a trip to Idaho and found these at a truck stop there.  The location was between Salt Lake City, UT and Idaho Falls, ID.  I paid 35 cents for just one.  I just ate it this morning.  It was good, but not 35 cents worth.  Back in the day I paid .02 cents apiece and just had to buy them all of the time.  I decided to look them up on the internet to find out where they are processed.  They are packaged in the gold, red & white foil wrappers.

I found something called “Icy Square” in a local Costco.  It is manufactured by a Canadian company - Moritz.  It looks almost the same as the posted photo.  It is very creamy, cool and taste is excellent, melt in the mouth and I love it. I paid C$7.99 for tub of 800 g.  I think the price is good.  I am going to get more as Christmas gifts.

When I was a kid, they were a penny each. The local hardware store alway had a box of gold-foil-wrapped Ice Cubes by the cash register. My dad and I would take them in lieu of change. Best. Candy. Ever.
I see them around now and then. I consider the bean-counters’ endless “race to the bottom” in pursuit of an extra tenth-of-a-penny-per-thousand margin, and I don’t even want to try one. Memories always get better; reality always gets worse.
Thanks for jogging the memory.

I love See’s Candies but even they have nothing on these little squares. I don’t care what’s in them, I don’t care how bad they supposedly are for me, I eat them occasionally only and in moderation—mostly because they are so damn hard to find!

I remember them in the 70’s in the Blue, silver and red package and they seemed to taste so much better back then.Has something changed???
is the gold packsge a bit different maybe??

I’ve been enjoying Ice Cubes for 50 years, and I too buy the Moritz ones now. I can’t tell any difference between those and the ones I remember from childhood. They need to be refrigerated for the best eating experience - it firms up that coconut oil. And hey, coconut oil is one fat that’s actually good for you, so don’t leave these completely out of your diet.

I tried these delicious melt in your mouth treats while on a road trip to Iowa to  get married. They were absolutely mind blowing!!! They came in a gold wrapper and were fairly cheap. This store was an old gas station right in between Missouri and Iowa. I have been on the hunt for them since!!!

You can buy these online from the Moritz candy company. I have a container in my fridge (best way to keep them, or freezer) from World Market that is labeled Moritz and is in German.

In the late 1970s, I had a paper route that also included a few small mom and pop stores and restaurants. One of those restaurants, Sauzer’s Waffle Shop in Schererville, Indiana, used to “tip” me a couple of “Ice Cubes” when I’d drop off their allotment of newspapers. Oh, how I made a beeline every week to get them their papers in order to obtain my delicious reward!
One thing that I know has changed in the ingredient description is what they now call, “hazelnut paste.” Years ago, those unforgettable gold labels referred to the hazelnut content as either crushed or powdered; I don’t recall which, but it was definitely one of those two terms. I am certain it was not “paste.” I don’t know if that change was economics, or if it was some kind of improvement that made production easier, or in some way better. As far as my taste buds can tell, the product today tastes as did back then: delicious!

I really enjoyed the cool sensation of these wonderful little candies as a kid. And last week I had some other chocolate that had that same cooling sensation that brought childhood memories flooding back. In the mid to late sixties we could get these from the penny candy store where almost all the candy was 1 cent each. But we had to lay down 2 cents apiece for these wonderful treats. I believe that the packaging back then was silver and gold and there was a small picture of a seal on it as well. Either way anyone looking to enjoy can find them online from several places. I believe I will place a order right now.

I used to run the snack bar at the Kansas school for the blind. I sold them for 2 cents each in seventy nine. I’m amazed at how they have gone up in price. great tips about looking in bulk candy aisles. I’ve only seen them on  Amazon for around $38 per hundred count and won’t pay that much.

Where I grew up in Brooklyn we had a stationery shop called Almars that also sold fresh chocolates by the pound. They were laid out on trays in a vitrine up by the cash register and they had these oblong bi-colored blocks they called “truffles” which were half dark chocolate and half, I guess, hazel-nut flavored chocolate, divided longitudinally. The chocolate was so fine it literally evaporated in your mouth like cotton candy. I can’t find this chocolate anywhere. Was this German chocolate like Ice Cubes?”

I remember Ice Cubes when I was young, just the gold foil wrapper. There was a popular 5 & 10¢ store called Switz’s. They were always located next to the register. I don’t remember how much they were but knew they were more pricey than regular candy. Even though they were a luxury, my Mother would always let me get one. I thought they were fine German chocolate. It always made me feel special to get one of these candies. Today they are sold in the bulk food section at Wegmans and Red Apple gas stations in Central New York. I still love them today. They bring back memories of a much simpler time.

I first tried one of these about 20 years ago, they were 4/$1.00 and have been ever since around here. I never realized they were such an old candy until my 60 year old mom saw one I had recently and recognized them from the 60s. I also didn’t realize they are kinda rare - the same gas station has sold them for at least 15 years and so do lots of other places, always 4/$1.00 in Northern Wisconsin.

Wow! I’ve seen these at 7-11 store years ago.  But I was 1st introduced to them in 1962 along with all the other penny candies.  But Ice Cubes were more, 2cents?? But I just recently came across these in a Winco store in the gold and brown wrapper.  Still same taste.

Moritz is the name brand I found at World Market, apparently the European version of Ice Cubes candy. Everything is identical - packaging, taste - except the name. And it’s weird but Nutella tastes exactly the same. Can you freeze Nutella and get an Ice Cube?

Loved these as a kid, some 25 years ago. Was my first choice in candy isle every trip to cvs or walgreens with grandma. I would love to find some silver wrapper ones, they seem to have the shape I remember over the look of the gold ones.

Frequently Asked Questions





            General questions
          



Is there a setup fee?
No. There are no setup fees on any of our plans.

 
Do I need to enter my credit card details to sign up?
No. You can sign up and use Shopify for 14 days without entering your credit card details. At the end of your trial, or when you decide to launch your store, you will need to pick a plan and enter your credit card details.

 
Can I cancel my account at any time?
Yes. If you ever decide that Shopify isn’t the best ecommerce platform for your business, simply cancel your account.

 
How long are your contracts?
All Shopify plans are month to month unless you sign up for an annual or biennial plan.

 
Do you offer any discounted plans?
Yes, we offer a 10% discount on annual plans and a 20% discount on biennial plans, when they are paid upfront.

 
Can I change my plan later on?
Absolutely! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time.

 
Is Shopify PCI Compliant or PCI Certified?
Yes. Shopify is certified Level 1 PCI DSS compliant. This means all your data and customer information is ultra secure.

 
Do I have to sell the same products in-store as I do online?
No, you can choose exactly what products to sell online, in-store, or both.

 
What is the rate if I type in a credit card?
If you chose to type in a credit card number instead of using the Shopify credit card reader, you will be charged the same rate as your online rate.



Are there any transaction fees?
Use Shopify Payments and pay no transaction fee. If you choose an
external payment gateway, there will be additional fees of 2%, 1% or
0.5% for our Basic Shopify, Shopify, and Advanced Shopify plans,
respectively.

 






            Online questions
          



Can I use my own domain name?
Yes. You can purchase a domain name within Shopify, or use an existing one that you own. We also provide a free myshopify.com domain name to all stores on sign up.



What are your bandwidth fees?
There are none. All Shopify plans include unlimited bandwidth for free.



Do I need a web host?
Shopify includes secure, unlimited ecommerce hosting on all plans except Shopify Lite. You can also use the Buy Button to add ecommerce to any existing website.

 




              POS questions
            



What does Shopify POS do?
Shopify POS is an application for iOS and Android devices that you can
use for transactions in a physical store or pop-up setting. Find
products, process orders, take payment, swipe credit cards, produce
receipts, and control it all from your iPad or mobile device. All the
background management of your store is done from your Shopify admin,
which you can access using any browser.



Can I merge my Shopify online store with Shopify POS?
Yes. Your Shopify online store automatically synchronizes with Shopify
POS, and you manage your entire business from one dashboard. Product or
inventory updates that you make in your Shopify admin will instantly
take effect in Shopify POS.



Can I use Shopify POS if I have multiple cash registers in use at the same time?
Yes. You can install Shopify POS on multiple devices, and you won’t be
charged any extra. Store activity on all devices is synchronized with
your Shopify admin.



Can I use Shopify POS if I’m outside the United States/Canada?
The Shopify POS app is available worldwide. There are just two
important considerations:

You'll have to buy the supported hardware through an external
retailer.
You'll have to use an external credit card terminal to
accept credit cards.




Where can I buy a cash register, receipt printer, and other hardware?
You can buy hardware kits and individual items of supported hardware from the Shopify
Hardware Store in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the continental United States. Outside of
these countries, supported hardware is available from authorized
resellers.
