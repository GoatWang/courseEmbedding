			Mr. Paull has served as a director of Farmers since January 2011 and is the Chair of the Compensation Committee and member of the Board Enterprise Risk Management Committee. Mr. Paull retired in February 2014 from serving as the Vice President, HR Operations and Labor Relations, for RTI International Metals, Inc., where he had previously been responsible for human resource activities for all domestic manufacturing locations in the United States. Mr. Paull has 36 years of experience working in and managing all aspects of the human resources and employee benefits functions, significant experience in corporate strategic and succession planning with both for profit and nonprofit enterprises, and has served as a member of the board of directors and executive committee of the Youngstown Warren Regional Chamber of Commerce and as a member of the board of directors of the Humility of Mary Center For Learning. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee believes that the attributes, skills and qualifications Mr. Paull has developed through his extensive business experience in the Mahoning Valley business market, as well as his knowledge and experience in the field of human resources and related areas of executive compensation and benefits, allow him to provide compensation related and local business expertise to the Board of Directors.
