Anil K. Jain (electrical engineer, born 1946)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from Anil K. Jain (1946 – 1988))

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Anil K. Jain (January 21, 1946 – November 14, 1988)[1] was an Indian-American electrical engineer and Professor of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Davis, known for his contributions on "two-dimensional stochastic models for images provided a firm theoretical foundation for a number of algorithms of spectral analysis, adaptive image estimation and image data compression",[1] including work on transform coding for image compression and block-based motion compensation for video compression in particular.

Biography[edit]
Born in India, Jain received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1967 at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, and a master's degree in 1969 and Ph.D. in 1970 from the University of Rochester.[1][2] He had conducted his doctoral research at the University of Southern California under guidance of Richard Bellman.
After graduation Jain continued as postdoctoral fellow and later assistant professor in the department of Electrical Engineering and in the Image Processing Institute of the University of Southern California. In 1974 he joined the faculty of the State University of New York at Buffalo, and in 1978 back in California he became Professor at the University of California.
In 1983 Jain received the IEEE Donald G. Fink Prize Paper Award.[3]
In 1988 Jain was recognized as a Fellow of the IEEE.[1]
Work[edit]
Jain's research interests ranged from "digital and image processing, computer vision, fast algorithms, real time digital systems architecture to stochastic processes and communication theory."[1][4]
Image processing textbook[edit]
Jain wrote an influential textbook, Fundamentals of Image Processing, published in 1988 by Prentice Hall (ISBN 978-0133361650).[1]
Video compression[edit]
Anil K. Jain was a contributor to the field of motion video compression. With his colleague Jaswant R. Jain, Anil published the original paper[2] combining block-based motion compensation and transform coding in December 1981.
Subsequently, most of the video compression standards for two-way communications and video broadcast applications were based upon motion compensation and transform coding, including those most widely used today such as MPEG-1, MPEG-2 (used on DVDs) and the most common Internet video H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.
Optivision and its transform coding products[edit]
While at University of California, Davis, Jain co-founded Optivision, Inc.[5] in the mid-1980s with Professor Joseph Goodman[6] from Stanford. Optivision pioneered both JPEG transform coding products for picture capture systems such as for the California Department of Motor Vehicles, and video compression systems such as videoconferencing that used the block-based motion-compensated transform coding techniques he developed.[citation needed] Jain's work also inspired other video industry entrepreneurs such as Brian Hinman, co-founder of PictureTel, Polycom, and 2Wire. Optivision later, after Jain's untimely death, had an initial public offering primarily thanks to the Optivision optical switching technology.

About this Textbook




Biometric recognition, or simply biometrics, is the science of establishing the identity of a person based on physical or behavioral attributes.  It is a rapidly evolving field with applications ranging from securely accessing one’s computer to gaining entry into a country. While the deployment of large-scale biometric systems in both commercial and government applications has increased the public awareness of this technology, "Introduction to Biometrics" is the first textbook to introduce the fundamentals of Biometrics to undergraduate/graduate students. The three commonly used modalities in the biometrics field, namely, fingerprint, face, and iris are covered in detail in this book. Few other modalities like hand geometry, ear, and gait are also discussed briefly along with advanced topics such as multibiometric systems and security of biometric systems. Exercises for each chapter will be available on the book website to help students gain a better understanding of the topics and obtain practical experience in designing computer programs for biometric applications. These can be found at: http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~ross/BiometricsTextBook/.Designed for undergraduate and graduate students in computer science and electrical engineering, "Introduction to Biometrics" is also suitable for researchers and biometric and computer security professionals.
