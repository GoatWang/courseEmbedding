January 26, 2011 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Janus Capital Group Inc. (NYSE: JNS) today announced the recent 
      appointment of Augustus Cheh as President of Janus Capital 
      International, the firm’s non-U.S. business arm, effective March 29, 
      2011. Janus also announced that effective April 1, 2011 Hiroshi Yoh will 
      join the firm as portfolio manager of Asian equity strategies and, 
      subject to regulatory approval, CEO of the firm’s Singapore subsidiary 
      Janus Capital Singapore Pte. Limited. The appointments of Cheh and Yoh 
      mark an important step in the firm’s plans to build out its global 
      investment capabilities and business for the benefit of its clients 
      worldwide.
    


Appointment of Augustus Cheh


      As President of Janus Capital International, Cheh will be based in Hong 
      Kong and will report directly to Janus Capital Group CEO Dick Weil. 
      Working with the regional management teams of Janus’ international 
      businesses, Cheh will oversee all of Janus’ businesses based outside of 
      the U.S., including key regions of Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle 
      East.
    

      Prior to joining Janus, Cheh was CEO of AllianceBernstein Hong Kong, 
      where he helped to significantly grow that firm’s presence in 
      Asia-ex-Japan. He also was global director of investments at 
      PricewaterhouseCoopers, building out that firm's global investment 
      consulting team. Prior to that, he served as a fixed-income portfolio 
      manager at J.P. Morgan Investment Management, as well as a management 
      and actuarial consultant at Towers Perrin. Cheh earned a bachelor of 
      science degree in electrical engineering and a master’s degree in 
      business administration from Columbia University.
    

Appointment of Hiroshi Yoh


      Yoh, who will be based in Singapore, will report directly to Janus 
      Co-CIO Jonathan Coleman. He will be responsible for managing Janus’ 
      Asian equity portfolios and helping to drive the investment team build 
      out in Asia. Based on Yoh’s successful track record managing Asian 
      equity products, Janus is pursuing multiple Asia equity product 
      launches, including U.S. and UCITS mutual funds and 
      institutional-focused products to support the firm’s global distribution 
      platform.
    

      “We are very excited to have someone of Hiroshi’s caliber join Janus’ 
      investment team,” said Coleman. “With Hiroshi’s arrival, we will have 
      on-the-ground investment management and research capabilities in Asia, 
      which will significantly enhance our local coverage of this important 
      and growing market. Hiroshi brings significant expertise that will 
      benefit all Janus portfolios.”
    

      “I am honoured to join the Janus investment team and believe that my 
      experience in Asian markets will help enhance Janus’ already strong 
      global research efforts,” said Yoh. “I firmly believe that Janus is well 
      positioned to be one of the future leaders in Asian and global emerging 
      markets, and I am excited for the opportunity to help Janus’ clients 
      gain further access to these markets.”
    

      Yoh comes to Janus from Tokio Marine Asset Management Int’l Pte. Ltd., a 
      Singapore-based asset management firm where he served as the CEO and 
      Chief Investment Officer, with responsibility for the Asia Pacific 
      ex-Japan business. He also was the lead manager for the firm’s Asia 
      Pacific ex-Japan equity and fixed income portfolios. Under Yoh’s 
      leadership, the firm received the AsianInvestor Investment Performance 
      Award in the Asia ex-Japan equity category in both 2009 and 2010 for 
      delivering consistent and sustained risk-adjusted performance over 
      various time periods. He has approximately 22 years of experience in 
      investment management in Asia, including serving as the President of 
      Templeton Investment Management Co. Ltd. Japan. Born in China and 
      educated in both China and Japan, Yoh received a graduate degree in 
      business administration and political sciences and a master of economics 
      degree from Tsukuba University in Japan. Yoh also completed the Advanced 
      Management Program at Harvard Business School.
    

      "Janus is committed to being a top partner to investors around the 
      globe,” said Janus Capital Group CEO Dick Weil. “These important 
      appointments are a reflection of that commitment, and I am confident 
      that Augie and Hiroshi have the experience and commitment to excellence 
      to help build Janus into a global, multi-asset partner for our clients 
      and position the firm for continued growth.”

      join the firm as portfolio manager of Asian equity strategies and, 
      subject to regulatory approval, CEO of the firm’s Singapore subsidiary

      mark an important step in the firm’s plans to build out its global 
      investment capabilities and business for the benefit of its clients 
      worldwide.
    


Appointment of Augustus Cheh


      As President of Janus Capital International, Cheh will be based in Hong 
      Kong and will report directly to Janus Capital Group CEO Dick Weil. 
      Working with the regional management teams of Janus’ international 
      businesses, Cheh will oversee all of Janus’ businesses based outside of 
      the U.S., including key regions of Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle 
      East.
    

      Prior to joining Janus, Cheh was CEO of AllianceBernstein Hong Kong, 
      where he helped to significantly grow that firm’s presence in 
      Asia-ex-Japan. He also was global director of investments at 
      PricewaterhouseCoopers, building out that firm's global investment 
      consulting team. Prior to that, he served as a fixed-income portfolio 
      manager at J.P. Morgan Investment Management, as well as a management 
      and actuarial consultant at Towers Perrin. Cheh earned a bachelor of 
      science degree in electrical engineering and a master’s degree in 
      business administration from Columbia University.
    

Appointment of Hiroshi Yoh


      Yoh, who will be based in Singapore, will report directly to Janus 
      Co-CIO Jonathan Coleman. He will be responsible for managing Janus’ 
      Asian equity portfolios and helping to drive the investment team build 
      out in Asia. Based on Yoh’s successful track record managing Asian 
      equity products, Janus is pursuing multiple Asia equity product 
      launches, including U.S. and UCITS mutual funds and 
      institutional-focused products to support the firm’s global distribution 
      platform.
    

      “We are very excited to have someone of Hiroshi’s caliber join Janus’ 
      investment team,” said Coleman. “With Hiroshi’s arrival, we will have 
      on-the-ground investment management and research capabilities in Asia, 
      which will significantly enhance our local coverage of this important 
      and growing market. Hiroshi brings significant expertise that will 
      benefit all Janus portfolios.”
    

      “I am honoured to join the Janus investment team and believe that my 
      experience in Asian markets will help enhance Janus’ already strong 
      global research efforts,” said Yoh. “I firmly believe that Janus is well 
      positioned to be one of the future leaders in Asian and global emerging 
      markets, and I am excited for the opportunity to help Janus’ clients 
      gain further access to these markets.”
    

      Yoh comes to Janus from Tokio Marine Asset Management Int’l Pte. Ltd., a 
      Singapore-based asset management firm where he served as the CEO and 
      Chief Investment Officer, with responsibility for the Asia Pacific 
      ex-Japan business. He also was the lead manager for the firm’s Asia 
      Pacific ex-Japan equity and fixed income portfolios. Under Yoh’s 
      leadership, the firm received the AsianInvestor Investment Performance 
      Award in the Asia ex-Japan equity category in both 2009 and 2010 for 
      delivering consistent and sustained risk-adjusted performance over 
      various time periods. He has approximately 22 years of experience in 
      investment management in Asia, including serving as the President of 
      Templeton Investment Management Co. Ltd. Japan. Born in China and 
      educated in both China and Japan, Yoh received a graduate degree in 
      business administration and political sciences and a master of economics 
      degree from Tsukuba University in Japan. Yoh also completed the Advanced 
      Management Program at Harvard Business School.
    

      "Janus is committed to being a top partner to investors around the 
      globe,” said Janus Capital Group CEO Dick Weil. “These important 
      appointments are a reflection of that commitment, and I am confident 
      that Augie and Hiroshi have the experience and commitment to excellence 
      to help build Janus into a global, multi-asset partner for our clients 
      and position the firm for continued growth.”
