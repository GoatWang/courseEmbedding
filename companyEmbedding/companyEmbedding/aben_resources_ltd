(TSX-V: ABN) is a publicly traded Canadian GOLD exploration company with significant projects in BRITISH COLUMBIA, SASKATCHEWAN and the YUKON.

The Company's 23,000 hectares FORREST KERR GOLD PROJECT is located in the heart of a region called the GOLDEN TRIANGLE in northwestern BC. This region has hosted significant mineral deposits including: Pretium (Brucejack), Eskay Creek, Snip, Galore Creek, Copper Canyon, Schaft Creek, KSM, Granduc, Red Chris and more. Aben is acquiring a 100% interest in the Forrest Kerr Project located along the Forrest Kerr Fault which consists of a 40 km long north-south belt overlying rocks of the Hazelton and Stuhini Groups, a complex assemblage of volcanic accumulations with intervening sedimentary sequences which are host to significant gold deposits in the Golden Triangle region.

Historical drilling on the Forrest Kerr Project encountered several high grade intercepts including 9.87 g/t Gold over 29 meters in the Carcass Zone and 33.4 g/t Gold over 11 meters in the Boundary Zone.

Aben also holds a 100% interest in the 18,314 acre JUSTIN GOLD PROJECT located in the southeast Yukon. The Justin property is located on the Tintina Gold Belt to the immediate southeast of Golden Predator's 3 Aces gold project. Previous drilling by Aben on the Justin Project intercepted 60 meters of 1.19 g/t gold including 21 meters of 2.47 g/t gold in the POW Zone. The geochemical signature of the mineralized zone is characterized by elevated Au, Bi, Cu, Mo and W supporting an Intrusion Related Gold System (IRGS).

Carcass  Creek zone is adjacent to a large outcrop of early Jurassic intrusive from the  Texas Creek Plutonic Suite, a lithology strongly associated with mineralization  throughout the Golden Triangle�

Gridded  soil data shows a Gold in soil anomaly that extends over 4km. The soil anomaly  remains open in all directions 
The  Boundary Zone has only been drill tested over a limited area, where high grade  Au in quartz veins were intercepted 
High  grade Ag, Pb and Zn mineralization has been drilled at the RTB zone, located  uphill and adjacent to the Boundary Zone

The  boundary zone is comprised of upper Triassic Stuhini Group rocks that are  overlain by lower Jurassic Hazelton volcanics and sedimentary rocks, with  numerous early Jurassic intrusions present 
This  lithologic package is host to the majority of mineral deposits in the Golden  Triangle

Note: Aben has not been able to  independently verify the methodology and results from historical work programs  within the property boundaries. However, management believes that the  historical work programs have been conducted in a professional manner and the  quality of data and information produced from them are relevant. 
Forrest Kerr Area History
Interest in the Golden Triangle region of British Columbia dates back to 1861 when placer gold was discovered at the confluence of the of the Stikine and Anuk rivers sparking the Stikine Gold Rush. Large-scale lode mining first took place at the Premier Mine located north of Stewart in 1918. In 1964, Cominco discovered the Snip deposit, which commenced operation in 1991; ultimately producing over 1.1 million ounces at an average grade of 27.5 g/t. Eskay Creek was discovered in 1988 and ultimately produced in excess of 3 million ounces of gold and 160 million ounces of silver, in addition to appreciable lead and zinc. Pretivm Resources in June, 2014 announced updated Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves at Valley of the Kings containing 6.9 million ounces of gold from 13.5 Mt grading 15.7 g/t gold, with commercial production scheduled for 2017. Management cautions that past results or discoveries on proximate land are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved on the subject properties.
Systematic exploration within regions of the Forrest Kerr project area commenced in the mid-1980s and saw continuous exploration programs from 1988 to 2005. Little work has been completed from 2005-2016. Early work in the project area was focussed on exploration for Eskay-type (VMS) deposits, though the more recent discovery of structurally-related high-grade gold mineralization at Valley of the Kings underscores the variety of exploration targets available to Aben.
Since the completion of significant exploration activity in the early 2000s, the area has seen major infrastructure improvements including roads associated with the construction of the Forrest Kerr and McLymont Creek hydro-electric facilities near the southern boundary of the property and the construction of the 287KV Northwest Transmission Line. Development of the Galore Creek Project has also provided road access to the northern reaches of the Forrest Kerr Project, which provide greatly improved access in addition to new exposures made by road-cuts.
Cornell McDowell, P.Geo., VP of Exploration and a Qualified Person for Aben Resources, as defined by National Instrument 43-101, has reviewed and approved the technical information in this project section.

Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company.
