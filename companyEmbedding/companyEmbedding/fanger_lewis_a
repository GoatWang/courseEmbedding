Business Wire




Feb 4, 2015 8:00 AM EST













 




























































  Full House Resorts, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLL), a developer, owner and manager of gaming facilities, today announced the appointment of Lewis Fanger as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.  "The Board and I are pleased to have Lewis, an accomplished executive with significant industry, financial and operational expertise, join Full House Resorts," said Daniel R. Lee, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. "Lewis has more than 14 years of financial and gaming industry experience, including many years in the markets where Full House operates. He is well-suited to help our continued progress toward enhancing long-term value for our shareholders."  Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Fanger served from June 2013 through February 2015 as a Vice President of Wynn Resorts, Limited, a leading owner and operator of resort casinos and a member of the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 indexes. At Wynn, Mr. Fanger oversaw the investor relations functions for both its NASDAQ- and Hong Kong Stock Exchange-listed stocks, and assisted with the company's development efforts, including in Asia. From August 2011 to June 2013, Mr. Fanger was Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Creative Casinos, LLC, the original developer of the recently-opened Golden Nugget resort casino in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Mr. Fanger also served from June 2003 to August 2011 at Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. in various capacities, including as Vice President of Finance, where he oversaw the treasury and investor relations functions of the company. Prior to that, Mr. Fanger worked as an equity research associate in the gaming group at Bear, Stearns & Co. in New York. Mr. Fanger earned a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering and a master's degree in business administration, both from Stanford University.  "I am extremely pleased to join Full House Resorts," said Mr. Fanger. "The Company has already taken several initial steps to improve the quality of its existing portfolio. I look forward to working with the entire team to find even more opportunities to build lasting value for our shareholders and further strengthen the Company."
