NovaQuest Raises US$459 Million for Pharma Opportunities Fund III






October 31, 2013 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NovaQuest 
      Capital Management, L.L.C. is pleased to announce the final closing 
      of NovaQuest Pharma Opportunities Fund III, L.P., a $459 million private 
      equity fund focused on providing structured finance solutions to 
      biopharmaceutical companies (“Fund III”). With Fund III, the 
      NovaQuest management team seeks to continue its strategy of earning 
      product-based returns from late-stage and commercial products, which are 
      strategic to the biopharmaceutical companies with whom it enters into 
      customized financing arrangements.
    


      “We are extremely pleased to have a mix of high-quality, limited 
      partners who have entrusted their capital to us, and who are supportive 
      of our unusual, alternative offering that seeks to earn returns 
      primarily from the important products of mid- and large-size 
      biopharmaceutical companies,” said Ron Wooten, Managing Partner and 
      Chief Investment Officer of NovaQuest. “The global biopharmaceutical 
      industry faces many challenges as it seeks to bring new and beneficial 
      medicines and therapies to patients. We believe these challenges and the 
      demand to improve healthcare globally should provide many opportunities 
      for NovaQuest to make investments that both help patients and give our 
      limited partners the chance to earn attractive returns on their 
      investments,” added Wooten. The limited partners of Fund III include the 
      strategic and corporate investors, who served as cornerstones to help 
      establish the fund. Upon that base of capital, additional capital 
      commitments were secured from a variety of institutional investors that 
      included pension funds, family offices and a major university endowment.
    

      The NovaQuest team began working together in the early 2000s at what is 
      now Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc., the world’s largest 
      pharmaceutical services firm. The team made its initial investments, 
      while they worked in a dedicated investment group inside Quintiles. In 
      late 2010, the team spun out of Quintiles to form an independent 
      management company, NovaQuest Capital Management, L.L.C., and, 
      concurrently, had the first close of Fund III. Fund III will, as a 
      fully-independent investment vehicle, continue to execute the strategy 
      followed by the team over the last decade.

Longitude Capital and NovaQuest Capital Management have acquired California Cryobank. Financial terms weren’t announced. Los Angeles-based California Cryobank provides resources for frozen donor sperm and specialized reproductive services, including private egg and embryo storage services.
PRESS RELEASE
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 20, 2014 /PRNewswire/ — California Cryobank (CCB), a global leader in reproductive tissue donor services and storage and stem cell banking, announced today that it has been acquired by equity investors Longitude Venture Partners II, L.P. (“Longitude”) and NovaQuest Pharma Opportunities Fund III, L.P. (“NovaQuest”).
Founded in 1977 by Dr. Charles Sims and Dr. Cappy Rothman, California Cryobank has built a strong, global presence in both fertility and cellular therapy, two of the most important and fastest-growing areas in healthcare.  CCB’s Reproductive Division has helped thousands of parents grow their families as the largest provider of anonymous donor sperm services and private reproductive tissue storage, and CCB’s Stem Cell Division is one of most active stem cell banking businesses in the world.  The acquisition of CCB was financed through a combination of equity contributed by Longitude and NovaQuest and debt provided by Golub Capital.  Additional terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
“CCB is a market-leading, high-growth and profitable company whose products represent the highest level of quality and customer service in major areas of medical need,” said Dr. Gregory Grunberg, Managing Director at Longitude, “We believe CCB’s senior management team has the vision and the operational strength to expand the Company’s business and meet the growing needs of customers in the fertility and cellular therapy markets.”
Dr. Sims, the CEO and Medical Director of CCB, commented, “California Cryobank is recognized worldwide for its leadership in reproductive tissue and stem cell banking.  Our partnership with Longitude and NovaQuest provides key additional resources and allows us to expand and grow within these areas.  Our commitment is always to ensure our products meet the highest scientific standard and continued innovation for the families that choose CCB.”
William Robb, Partner at NovaQuest, stated, “NovaQuest is extremely pleased to begin its ownership relationship with CCB. In the four decades since its founding, CCB has become the leading global reproductive tissue services company, with unparalleled customer service and operating practices. We are excited to join CCB’s outstanding management to build on this solid foundation and expand both the scale and scope of CCB’s business.

NovaQuest Capital Management has closed its NovaQuest Pharma Opportunities Fund III on $459 million. Fund III is focused on providing structured finance solutions to biopharmaceutical companies. The NovaQuest team spun out of Quintiles Transnational Holdings in 2010.
Press Release
NovaQuest Capital Management, L.L.C. is pleased to announce the final closing of NovaQuest Pharma Opportunities Fund III, L.P., a $459 million private equity fund focused on providing structured finance solutions to biopharmaceutical companies (“Fund III”). With Fund III, the NovaQuest management team seeks to continue its strategy of earning product-based returns from late-stage and commercial products, which are strategic to the biopharmaceutical companies with whom it enters into customized financing arrangements.
“We are extremely pleased to have a mix of high-quality, limited partners who have entrusted their capital to us, and who are supportive of our unusual, alternative offering that seeks to earn returns primarily from the important products of mid- and large-size biopharmaceutical companies,” said Ron Wooten, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of NovaQuest. “The global biopharmaceutical industry faces many challenges as it seeks to bring new and beneficial medicines and therapies to patients. We believe these challenges and the demand to improve healthcare globally should provide many opportunities for NovaQuest to make investments that both help patients and give our limited partners the chance to earn attractive returns on their investments,” added Wooten.
The limited partners of Fund III include the strategic and corporate investors, who served as cornerstones to help establish the fund. Upon that base of capital, additional capital commitments were secured from a variety of institutional investors that included pension funds, family offices and a major university endowment.
The NovaQuest team began working together in the early 2000s at what is now Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc., the world’s largest pharmaceutical services firm. The team made its initial investments, while they worked in a dedicated investment group inside Quintiles. In late 2010, the team spun out of Quintiles to form an independent management company, NovaQuest Capital Management, L.L.C., and, concurrently, had the first close of Fund III. Fund III will, as a fully-independent investment vehicle, continue to execute the strategy followed by the team over the last decade.

But don't take our word for it




























"PitchBook data shows who the investors, founders, and other key players are of start-ups and venture capital firms. As simple as this may seem, it's not information that's widely avaliable - espcially not all in one place!"
