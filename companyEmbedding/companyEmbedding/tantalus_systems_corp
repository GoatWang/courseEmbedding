About the Opportunity 
We have an exciting career opportunity for an Agile Project Manager to join our Product Development team in Burnaby, British Columbia. 
Working within the framework of Agile methodology, you will use your technical expertise to help deliver Smart Grid solutions that meet customer expectations, as well as project scope, schedule and budget. Specifically, you will manage critical product development projects involving integrated systems of enterprise applications, wireless communications networks and embedded device applications.  
Primary duties and responsibilities of this dynamic role include, but are not limited to: 

Work with Product Owners to define project scope and deliverables that support business goals; 
Define and communicate project expectations and success criteria to all team members and stakeholders; 
Plan and schedule project timelines and milestones using appropriate tools; 
Working with the team to estimate the resources required to achieve project goals; 
Identify and manage project dependencies and critical path; 
Create and disseminate progress reports, proposals and relevant documentation, as well as deliver presentations; 
Monitor and manage potential changes to project scope by identifying potential issues and developing appropriate contingency plans; 
Identify and resolve issues and conflicts within the project team; 
Mentor, motivate and supervise project team members; and 
Conduct thorough project review. 

Our ideal candidate will have over 5 years of experience in managing projects with Agile/Scrum methodology. From product conception to release, you will have demonstrated hands-on experience in the development of software/server & wireless systems, with a focus on delivery and deployment to end customers. 
As Project Manager, it is important that you seek continuous improvement and lead through ideas, not title. By utilizing your strong communication skills and adopting an authentic "hands on" approach, you will take the time to understand each person's individual strengths to ensure that all resources are being fully optimized.  You must also be open to new ideas and look to gain consensus from stakeholders when making critical decisions.    
You are self-motivated and results focused with demonstrated ability to multi-task, work fast and articulate the overall health and progress of projects. 
Ultimately, your success in this role will be determined by your ability to demonstrate the achievement of key project deliverables.  
Previous experience in software development is a significant asset, as is post secondary education in engineering or computer science and/or PMI certification. 
About the Benefits
In addition to a competitive salary, you will also receive: 

Comprehensive extended health and dental coverage, including a health spending account;
Life and disability insurance; 
Travel insurance;
MSP coverage;
Your choice of paid parking space or transit reimbursement;
3 weeks' annual vacation; and
Opportunities for paid professional development and training.   

Best of all, you will receive these benefits upon commencement of employment!  
About our culture
Tantalus culture is built on hard work, respect and cooperation. Throughout the development process, our team enjoys iterating, collaborating and learning. We are developers, engineers, testers, technicians, and inventors. We are a group of critical thinkers with a proven track record in delivering great products and applications.
Our modern office, centrally located in the heart of Burnaby, provides our team with a collaborative, social and engaging work environment. With a games room, fitness facility and various social activities, we encourage our team to interact, learn and grow with each other on a daily basis.
We are looking for people who share: our commitment to getting the job done, and our belief that perfection should never get in the way of progress.
Now is the perfect time to join the Tantalus team which is in an exciting period of significant growth. Apply Now!

Tantalus Systems is delivering advanced smart grid applications such as Smart Street Lighting and enhancing Conservation Voltage Reduction (CVR) and Voltage Optimization (VO) for Distribution Grid Optimization over its distributed intelligence platform – TUNet®. TUNet is anchored by a network of intelligent edge computing modules integrated into a broad range of smart grid end points such as meters and Distribution Automation (DA) devices. Each TUNet module uses a Linux-based computing platform to collect and analyze data, make intelligent decisions and report by exception to the utility’s central servers. TUNet’s efficient use of its Utility IoT architecture enables the utility to leverage its smart grid network more effectively while ensuring that operators receive precisely the right data at the right time and from the right location to make more informed decisions. Another smart grid solution now deployed throughout Tantalus’ customer base is Distribution Grid Optimization. Applications such as CVR and VO are enhanced by leveraging TUNet’s distributed intelligence and communications for improved performance. Tantalus delivers this by combining its Closed Loop Voltage Reduction (CLVR™) feature with its TUNet DA Bridge Modem, providing a near real-time meter voltage monitoring and alerting application with a modem that supports DNP3 data delivery across TUNet. This extends visibility and control from the SCADA system to end-of-line DA devices such as capacitor bank controllers and voltage regulators while capturing FCI data and alerts in near real-time. This combined functionality helps utilities maximize value from their TUNet AMI network investments.


Electric Cities of Georgia Names Tantalus Systems as Preferred Ami Solutions Provider
Apr 13 16
Electric Cities of Georgia and Tantalus Systems have jointly announced the formation of a partnership in support of expanding electric and multi-commodity AMI and smart grid application solutions throughout the state of Georgia. The partnership names Tantalus as the Preferred Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) solutions provider for ECG member utilities. Tantalus and ECG will collaborate to offer member utilities a variety of options to deploy AMI and smart grid solutions, including the ability to efficiently migrate existing Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) technology to a robust two-way AMI platform by remotely collecting readings from legacy electric, water and gas encoder receiver transmitter (ERT) devices. The offering will also provide members with an option to utilize a hosted service to offset the up-front capital investments in IT infrastructure typically required to support AMI deployments. Tantalus will enable ECG utilities to access a wide range of integrated applications such as prepay, remote disconnect/reconnect, outage management, water leak detection and metering data analytics on a single network.
