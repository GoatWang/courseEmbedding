Bison Midstream Announces Unaudited Earnings Results for the Second Quarter and Operating Results for the Second Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Aug 6 15
Bison Midstream announced unaudited earnings results for the second quarter and operating results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $4.7 million for the second quarter of 2015, down 1.4% from the second quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower margins associated with percent-of-proceeds contracts, partially offset by 13.3% higher volume throughput in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2015 also benefitted from the aforementioned decision to discontinue allocating certain corporate overhead expenses beginning in the first quarter of 2015. 

For the quarter, average daily throughput was 17 MMcf/d against 15 MMcf/d a year ago. 

For the six months, average daily throughput was 18 MMcf/d against 14 MMcf/d a year ago.

Suite 500
The Woodlands, Texas 77380
Re: Summit
Midstream Partners, LP Registration Statement on
Form S-3
Ladies and
Gentlemen:
        We
have acted as special counsel to Summit Midstream
Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the "
Partnership "), Summit Midstream Holdings, LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company (" Holdings "),
Summit Midstream Finance Corp., a Delaware corporation ("
Finance Corp. " and, together with the Partnership
and Holdings, the " Issuers "), and the entities
listed on Schedule I hereto (collectively, the "
Guarantors "), in connection with the filing on the
date hereof with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
Commission ") of a registration statement on
Form S-3 (as amended, the " Registration
Statement "), including a base prospectus (the " Base
Prospectus "), which provides that it will be supplemented
by one or more prospectus supplements (each such prospectus
supplement, together with the Base Prospectus, a "
Prospectus "), under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " Act "), relating to the registration
for issue and sale of up to $1.5 billion aggregate offering
price of (i) one or more series of the Issuers' debt
securities (the " Debt Securities ") to be issued
pursuant to an indenture, dated July 15, 2014, by and between
Holdings, Finance Corp. and U.S. Bank National Association, as
trustee (the " Indenture "), which is included as
Exhibit 4.5 to the Registration Statement, and one or more
board resolutions, supplements thereto or officer's certificates
thereunder (the Indenture, together with the applicable board
resolutions, supplements or officer's certificate pertaining to the
applicable series of Debt Securities, the " Applicable
Indenture "); (ii) guarantees of the Debt Securities
(the " Guarantees ") by the Guarantors; and
(iii) common units representing limited partner interests of
the Partnership (the " Primary Common Units "). The
Debt Securities, the Guarantees and the Primary Common Units are
collectively referred to as the " Securities ." The
Registration Statement also registers for sale by Goldman,
Sachs & Co., Summit Midstream Partners Holdings, LLC

Selling Unitholder Units registered for sale by the Selling
Unitholders are to be offered on a primary basis.
        This
opinion is being furnished in connection with the requirements of
Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Act, and no
opinion is expressed herein as to any matter pertaining to the
contents of the Registration Statement or the related applicable

        As
such counsel, we have examined such matters of fact and questions
of law as we have considered appropriate for purposes of this
letter. With your consent, we have relied upon certificates and

laws of any other jurisdiction or, in the case of Delaware, any
other laws, or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of
any local agencies within any state.

authorized by all necessary corporate, limited liability company or
limited partnership action, as applicable, of Issuers and the
Guarantors, and such Debt Securities and such Guarantees have been
duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered against payment
therefor in accordance with the terms of the Applicable Indenture,
and in the manner contemplated by the applicable Prospectus and by
such corporate, limited liability company or limited partnership
action, as applicable (i) such Debt Securities will be the
legally valid and binding obligation of each Issuer, enforceable
against such Issuer in accordance with its terms; and
