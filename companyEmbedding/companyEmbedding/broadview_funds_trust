	OVERVIEW

	Investment Objective

	The Broadview Opportunity Fund seeks capital appreciation.

	Investment Strategy

	The Broadview Opportunity Fund invests in stocks of companies of all sizes, but primarily invests in small- to medium-capitalization (namely, less than $5 billion market capitalization) United States companies, that have substantial capital appreciation potential. Many of these companies have little or no following by the major stock brokerage firms. The investment team seeks to purchase equity of businesses that are selling at what it believes are substantial discounts to prices that accurately reflect their future earnings prospects.

	Investment Process

	Pure bottom-up ideas are internally generated.  The investment team exploits industry experience and contacts with suppliers, customers and competitors to identify companies that might be candidates for the portfolio.  If a company meets most, but not all of our criteria, they are added to an extensive list of similar companies which are continuously monitored.

	Broadview uses Five Pillar Analysis to determine if a company will be added to the portfolio.  The five points are as follows:

	(1) STRONG BUSINESS TRAITS
	             Highly recurring revenue, return on investment capital, controllable destiny
	 
	(2) DEFENDABLE MARKET NICHE
	             Strategic value, barriers to entry, difficult to duplicate
	 
	(3) ATTRACTIVE GROWTH POTENTIAL
	             Focus on 2-3 year time horizon, we own companies don’t rent stocks, across all industries
	 
	(4) CAPABLE MANAGEMENT
	             History of successful strategic decisions, effective use of free cash flow, aligned with shareholders
	 
	(5) DISCOUNT TO PRIVATE MARKET VALUE (PMV)
	             Substantial discount at purchase, risk control, requires patience and discipline
	 
	Companies meeting all Five Pillars are added to the portfolio.  While not an automatic sell, any company in the portfolio can be removed for violation of any of the Five Pillars.

	Total return includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and investment returns and principal value of the Fund will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

	The Fund’s portfolio may differ significantly from the securities held in the index. You cannot invest directly in an index; therefore its performance does not reflect the expenses associated with the active management of an actual portfolio. For comparative purposes, benchmark “since inception” returns are as of December 16, 1996.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results

1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
3. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
4. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.

Author Information




Christopher Colecchi, BA, MPH∗ (ccolecchi{at}broadviewventures.org) and David Tancredi, MD, PhDBroadview Ventures, Boston, Massachusetts↵∗Reprint requests and correspondence: Mr. Christopher Colecchi, Broadview Ventures, Inc., 125 High Street, 9th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02110.SummaryTranslational investigators and companies face a challenging economic environment when seeking funds to move pre-clinical stage research into human testing and beyond. Specifically, funding for cardiovascular research and product development is difficult to secure, whether from the NIH, venture capitalists, or industry. But new funding models for advancing patient-oriented science to the commercial sector are emerging. Boston-based Broadview Ventures, created by the Leducq Family Trust, promotes the development of technology for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease and stroke through direct equity-based investments. It targets early stage companies seeking to fund proof-of-concept for technologies that hold promise as future breakthroughs for patient care. With 27 such investments over the last seven years, Broadview has considerable experience in the seed/early-stage space, and its investment model is demonstrating early signs of success. Broadview actively seeks collaborations with world-class translational investigators, inventors, and their companies, and welcomes scientific inquiries, discussion and proposals for funding.Key Wordscardiovascularphilanthropyventure capitalFor translational investigators in cardiovascular disease and stroke, securing funds to move pre-clinical stage research into human testing and beyond remains a challenge. This “translational funding gap” is widening, and although many claim to fund early stage work, the data and experience of entrepreneurs in academia and elsewhere prove differently (Figure 1) (1). Despite recent increases in funding for translational research, the National Institutes of Health primarily supports basic discovery research, and has experienced significant budget pressure over the past years. Indeed, cardiovascular and stroke research continue to be relatively underfunded with respect to their impact on global health—as compared with cancer, for example (2,3)—and foundations and charitable organizations such as the American Heart Association can only make up some of this difference (Figure 2). In industry over the last decade, spending on research and development has remained unchanged, whereas the cost to bring new drugs and devices to market is increasing, making access to industry funding by independent clinical investigators more difficult. And the percentage of venture capital funding directed toward start-up/seed investments is diminishing—with venture capital preferring to fund later-stage, lower-risk product development activities (Figure 3) (4).Download figure

Figure 4 Start-Ups Are Turning to New Sources of Funding to Fill the GapCRO = contract research organization; VC = venture capital.Boston-based Broadview Ventures is one such organization. Created by the Leducq Family Trust, Broadview Ventures was designed to promote the development of technology for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease and stroke through direct equity-based investments (cash in exchange for equity position). It targets early-stage companies seeking to fund proof of concept for technologies that hold promise as future breakthroughs for patient care. With 27 such investments over the last 7 years, Broadview has considerable experience in the seed/early-stage space, and its investment model is demonstrating early signs of success.History: Leducq Foundation and Broadview VenturesThe mission and structure of Broadview Ventures can be traced to the Leducq Foundation and its supporting trust, created in 1996 by French entrepreneur and industrialist Jean Leducq, together with his wife Sylviane. Motivated by a multigenerational family history of cardiovascular illness, and inspired to work at the international level through years of living and working abroad, the Leducqs used the proceeds of the sale of the family’s multinational linen and uniform services businesses to establish a foundation for cardiovascular research with a mission to improve human health through international efforts to combat cardiovascular and neurovascular disease. The foundation’s signature program, the Transatlantic Networks of Excellence in Cardiovascular and Neurovascular Disease, supports international networks of experts in cardiovascular disease and stroke that work collaboratively to advance scientific knowledge, bring new technology to patient care, and help to train early career investigators. Since making its first award in 1999, the foundation has committed over $350 million to cardiovascular and neurovascular research, supporting 47 research networks at 130 institutions in 19 countries.From the outset, the Leducq organization was interested in promoting the technology that was developed through the research it supported. The board of the Leducq Family Trust soon determined that the best way to accomplish this objective was to create an independent organization dedicated solely to promoting and investing in technology. In 2008, it decided to create Broadview Ventures, specifically addressing the translational gap by providing seed and early-stage funding for companies on the path to developing commercial products for patients with cardiovascular and neurovascular disease. Broadview shares a mission in cardiovascular and neurovascular disease with the Leducq Foundation, but proceeds through a direct investment model, whereas the foundation works through a more traditional grant program.Broadview is purposefully structured as a for-profit venture capital firm so that it can interact on equal ground with like-minded venture capitalists and corporate partners that have financial return on investment as a primary goal. That said, Broadview is mission-, not profit-driven, and defines success through social impact and improving patient care. Its mission orientation allows Broadview to invest in important areas that others may see as less interesting due to market size or risk issues (e.g., pediatrics). The sole shareholder of Broadview is the Leducq Family Trust, which can manage both the risk and long-term capital commitments associated with early-stage investing. Broadview is structured as an evergreen fund and all generated profits are used for additional early stage investments or to support activities of the Leducq Foundation.Broadview ActivityIn sourcing investments, Broadview defines cardiovascular disease broadly. In addition to investing in the core therapeutic areas within cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, and valvular disease, Broadview is also interested in underlying pathways such as inflammation and atherogenesis; predisposing factors such as hypertension; and comorbidities such as cardiorenal and cardiopulmonary conditions. Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia, as cardiovascular risk factors, are also considered to fall within the scope of the mission. Stroke is the primary indication within Broadview’s neurovascular focus.The investments made thus far by Broadview include microRNA, stem cell, and gene therapies; nonsurgical and minimally invasive delivery techniques for valves and devices; and mechanical and pharmacological treatments for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, and obesity (Figure 5). Broadview invests in all technology platforms related to its mission—diagnostics, therapeutics, and devices (Figure 6). Five of its investments have been made to support technology developed by grantees of the Leducq Foundation.Download figure

Figure 6 Broadview Investments by TechnologyBroadview receives approximately 300 proposals annually and invests $1 million in 4 to 5 of these opportunities each year. Broadview seeks high-impact science that has the potential to change the practice of cardiology. To be considered for investment, the technology must have adequate intellectual property protection and a clear ability to influence patient therapy and/or standard of care. The proposed use of funds must be well defined with quantifiable and achievable milestones. And there must be a clear understanding of future funding requirements to bring the technology through clinical development to market.Broadview is fortunate to be guided by a world-class strategic advisory board composed of thought leaders from academia, finance, and industry (Figure 7). It also has access to a network of cardiovascular and neurovascular medicine experts developed over the years via the Leducq Foundation. Broadview utilizes these relationships for deal sourcing, diligence, investment counsel, clinical development advice, and portfolio company guidance. Without a doubt, these thought leaders have played a critical role in the development and advancement of the Broadview Ventures investment model.Download figure

Figure 7 2016 Broadview Strategic Advisory BoardThe Boston-based Broadview investment team, led by Christopher Colecchi, consists of physicians, scientists, and business professionals who oversee deal sourcing, diligence, and the investment process. After investment, the Broadview team plays an active role via board participation, offering long-term support throughout the life of its portfolio companies.Case StudyAlthough improving patient care is its main goal, Broadview also hopes to share its learning and experiences with other family offices and venture philanthropic investors. Although still evolving as a fund, Broadview has seen some early signs of success, most notably the recent acquisition by Edwards Lifesciences of CardiAQ Valve Technologies, a company funded by Broadview that is focused on developing a percutaneous mitral valve technology.The CardiAQ story demonstrates the many steps, layers of funding and expertise, and persistence necessary for successful early stage investing. In 2008, Broadview was connected with a surgeon and business executive both working in their spare hours to develop a percutaneous mitral valve implantation device. Later that year, after a significant level of diligence and review by its strategic advisory board, Broadview made a $750,000 seed investment in CardiAQ to develop a device prototype and conduct early animal testing. This investment attracted additional corporate and board leadership from within the valve industry and led to a $5M Series A financing round in 2011 in which Broadview also participated. The company established state-of-the-art facilities in Irvine, California, and successfully completed the first-ever transcatheter mitral valve replacement in a porcine model. In 2012, the company conducted successful first-in-human implantation of the valve in Europe. This milestone attracted a large Series B financing round with participation by several large, well-known, venture capital investors (OrbiMed, InVus, Versant, and Advent). With this funding, a second-generation device was developed and successfully implanted in several more patients. In August of 2015, Edwards Lifesciences acquired CardiAQ Valve Technologies for $400 million (Figure 8).Download figure

Figure 8 CardiAQ Valve Technologies: From Idea to First-In-ManCEO = chief executive officer; CVT = CardiAQ Valve Technologies.Although the financial return on investment was positive for all involved, most important to Broadview is that the technology, through Edwards’ market leadership and extensive resources, will now move to large-scale clinical trials for regulatory approval—and hopefully become a commercial product that will improve the lives of patients with mitral valve disease. In addition, the investment story demonstrates that mission-related, philanthropic-based funds can be deployed at an early stage to help science cross the translational gap to move through the clinical development pathway.For every dollar invested by Broadview, its portfolio companies have raised seven additional dollars in co-investments, follow-on funding, and grants. This additional funding has enabled smaller “surrogate markers of success” that demonstrate day-to-day progress at Broadview’s portfolio companies—such as movement from pre-clinical work to first-in human trials, achievement of regulatory approval for products, and a successful European product launch. In addition, many of Broadview portfolio companies have developed relationships with strategic investors and industry partners to support movement toward commercial product approval.The FutureThe leadership, vision, and resources of the Leducq Family Trust have been critical to the ability of Broadview to look past the near term for high-risk–high-reward, longer-term solutions to today’s pressing problems in cardiovascular and neurovascular disease. With early-stage investing in the life sciences comes acceptance that the road for the fund and its portfolio companies will be challenging. There will be many failures to get to far fewer successes. Importantly, however, this work remains consistent with the vision and values of the founders, whose bequest will ensure that the foundation and Broadview remain true to their mission in cardiovascular and neurovascular science and will have the resources to continue the good work that started with the Leducq Foundation 20 years ago.Broadview actively seeks collaborations with world-class translational investigators, inventors, and their companies, and welcomes scientific inquiries, discussion and proposals for funding (Figure 9).

*Free commission offer applies to online purchases of Fidelity ETFs in a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. The sale of ETFs is subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). Fidelity ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity if held less than 30 days.


$4.95 commission applies to online U.S. equity trades in a Fidelity retail account only for Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC retail clients. Certain accounts may require a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Sell orders are subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Employee equity compensation transactions and accounts managed by advisors or intermediaries through Fidelity Clearing and Custody Solutions are subject to different commission schedules.


          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

ETF.com, March 2017. The 2016 Best New Smart Beta Award is given to the most important new ETF launched in 2016, regardless of asset class, that uses a quantitative, research-driven approach to attempt to deliver superior long-term risk-adjusted returns. In 2016, FDRR split the award with Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF (VYMI). ETF.com Award winners were selected in a three-part process designed to leverage the insights and opinions of leaders throughout the ETF industry. The ETF.com Awards Nominating Committee—made up of senior leaders at ETF.com, Inside ETFs and FactSet—voted to select up to five finalists in each category. Votes were tallied on a majority basis. Winners from these finalists were selected by a majority vote of the ETF.com Awards Selection Committee, a group of independent ETF experts. Committee members recused themselves from voting in any category in which they or their firms appeared as finalists. Ties were decided where possible with head-to-head runoff votes. Results were announced on March 30, 2017.


          Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. There is no guarantee that a factor-based investing strategy will enhance performance or reduce risk. Before investing, make sure you understand how the fund’s factor investment strategy may differ from more traditional index products. Depending on market conditions, fund performance may under perform compared to products that seek to track a more traditional index. The return of an index ETF is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses and tracking error. An ETF may trade at a premium or discount to its Net Asset Value (NAV).
	
    

          The Fidelity Factor Indicies were created by FMRCo., Inc. using a rules-based proprietary index methodology and the performance of the funds and their indices may vary somewhat due to various factors including fees and expenses. You cannot invest directly in an index.
	
    

Before investing in any mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, you should consider its investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus, offering circular or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

          2. Highly rated funds are defined as those funds that have a 4- or 5-Star Morningstar rating. For each fund, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM metric each month by subtracting the return on a 90-day U.S. Treasury Bill from the fund's load-adjusted return for the same period, and then adjusting this excess return for risk. The top 10% of funds in each broad asset class receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Although gathered from reliable sources, data completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed by Morningstar.
	
    

          3. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time. Fidelity's government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.

Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


          Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.
	
    

The securities of smaller, less well known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.



Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Amana Mutual Funds Trust
 





Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.

 What Makes Sukuk Halal? 
 We explain what differentiates Islamic investment certificates, often called sukuk, from conventional bonds, and identifies the distinctive features that form the core of what makes sukuk Islamic-compliant, or halal.
