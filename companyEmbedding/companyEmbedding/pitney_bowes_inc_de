What is a postage meter and an office shipping solution?







What is a postage meter?



A postage meter weighs and prints postage accurately on your outgoing business mail (essentially replacing a stamp). Postage is downloaded to your meter through your computer or digital telephone line, enabling you to pay for your postage without making trips to the post office or keeping piles of stamps in the office. You also gain access to USPS metered mail discounts.
 






What is an office shipping solution?



Pitney Bowes office shipping solutions are designed to help you simplify each phase of shipping through USPS®, FedEx® and UPS®. For example, SendPro™ is our scalable, all-in-one office solution that helps you streamline an increasingly complex shipping process. You can compare options, weigh packages, print shipping labels, track shipments and manage carrier expenses from your desktop or existing mailing system.

STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pitney Bowes Inc. (NYSE: PBI), a global technology company providing 
      innovative products and solutions to power commerce, today announced a 
      strategic relationship with leading global digital marketing agency 
      NMPi. The relationship will further strengthen Pitney Bowes’ 
      industry-leading global ecommerce offering with enhanced consumer 
      marketing solutions, including international paid-search campaigns, 
      display advertising, social media advertising and fully optimized Google 
      shopping experiences.
    


      “Driving demand and ultimately purchases is one of the most unique and 
      important things Pitney Bowes does for its clients,” said Jonathan 
      Kapplow, Senior Vice President, Consumer and Merchant Solutions at 
      Pitney Bowes. “We’ve worked with NMPi to develop successful marketing 
      campaigns for many leading retailers who have taken their business 
      cross-border. This formal relationship will allow us to innovate 
      together and bring new performance-based digital marketing solutions to 
      all of our clients.”
    

      Optimizing digital marketing campaigns for 220 different countries and 
      territories can be challenging for retailers looking to grow revenue 
      through cross-border ecommerce. Pitney Bowes and NMPi have worked with 
      clients around the globe and in a wide range of industries including 
      fashion, retail, finance, and travel to elevate their digital 
      advertising capabilities to better reach and engage with consumers.
    

      Consumer marketing and customer engagement are critical components of 
      Pitney Bowes’ Complete™ Cross-Border offering, the industry’s most 
      proven, capable and scalable end-to-end global ecommerce solution that 
      can handle all facets of enterprise retail cross-border expansion. With 
      the addition of NMPi’s capabilities, Pitney Bowes will be able to offer 
      its cross-border clients best-in-class digital marketing solutions, as 
      well.
    

      “In today’s competitive global environment, retailers need every measure 
      of help they can get in driving top-line growth and running their 
      day-to-day operations. Cross-border revenue streams driven by effective 
      digital marketing solutions can help alleviate some of that pressure, 
      but it is often difficult to put the right people and processes in place 
      to get that started. Our relationship with Pitney Bowes makes all of 
      that easier for retailers. With Pitney Bowes, we will offer retailers 
      scalable, global digital marketing solutions that meet consumers where 
      they are and guide them to a superior global ecommerce experience,” said 
      Luke Judge, CEO of NMPi.
    

      “We win when our clients and partners win, so we are truly invested in 
      the success of their businesses,” said Kapplow. “By helping drive 
      consumer demand and incremental revenue growth for our retailers, we 
      further strengthen the core growth engine of our own global ecommerce 
      business.”

			DECISION


		Pitney Bowes, Inc., of Stamford, Connecticut, protests the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) award of two contracts to Neopost USA, Inc., of Milford, Connecticut, under solicitation No. DJF-15-2100-PR-0020579 (No. 20579) and solicitation No. DJF-15-2100-PR-0022525 (No. 22525), for mail tracking systems.  Pitney Bowes asserts that the agency failed to properly evaluate Neopost’s quotations. 

		We deny the protest.


		BACKGROUND

		On September 10, 2015, the FBI posted two similar solicitations as commercial item acquisitions on the FedBid website.[1]  The solicitations restricted competition to vendors holding contracts under the General Service Administration’s (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS).  The solicitations sought to procure, on a brand name or equal basis, mail tracking systems, including items such as hand‑held portable scanners (or “tracking assistants”), computer workstations, software licenses, and servers.  The solicitations identified Pitney Bowes’ products from its FSS contract as the brand name items to be procured.

		More specifically, solicitation No. 20579 sought a mail tracking system for the FBI’s Quantico, Virginia, location.  The solicitation listed 18 contract line item numbers (CLIN) with Pitney Bowes’ model numbers and descriptions.  Solicitation No. 20579 at 12.  As examples, CLIN 010 specified “MODEL T56C; PORTABLE TRACKING ASSISTANT,” CLIN 015 identified “MODEL EMOU; SENDSUITE SERVER HARDWARE,” and CLIN 016 specified “ONSITE WARRANTY MAITENANCE FOR BASE YEAR.”  Id.  The solicitation contained no further description of the items, and indicated that the “Target Price” for all items was $80,000.  Id. at 9.

		Solicitation No. 22525 sought mail tracking systems for the FBI’s Washington, D.C., headquarters and Cheverly, Maryland, locations.  The solicitation consisted of 23 CLINs--the same items as solicitation No. 20579, along with additional items such as CLIN 002 “MODEL T5FF; IMAGING SOFTWARE” and CLIN 018 “ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FOR HEADQUARTERS BASE YEAR.”  Solicitation No. 22525 at 12.  The solicitation also contained no further description of the items, and provided a “Target Price” of $351,000.  Id. at 9.

		Of relevance here, the solicitations included the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) brand name or equal clause 52.211-6, which informs offerors that to be considered for award, proposals for equal products have to include sufficient information to show that the offered items meet the salient characteristics listed in the solicitation.  See Solicitation No. 20579 at 11; Solicitation No. 22525 at 11.  In addition, the solicitations stated:

Brand Name or Equal:  The Buyer is allowing Sellers to submit bids for alternate items, provided those items meet all of the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics specified by this solicitation.  Sellers MUST enter exactly what they are bidding (including make, model and description) into the blank description field in order for the bid to be considered.  The Buyer will evaluate ‘equal’ items on the basis of information furnished by the Seller or identified in the bid and reasonably available to the Buyer.  The Buyer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the Bid. 

		Solicitation No. 20579 at 10; Solicitation No. 22525 at 10.  Neither solicitation, however, contained or made reference to any salient characteristics of the identified Pitney Bowes brand name products.

		On September 14, 2015, both Pitney Bowes and Neopost submitted quotations for the solicitations, with Pitney Bowes offering the brand name products and Neopost offering equal products.[2]  After evaluating the quotations, the FBI awarded both contracts to Neopost.[3]  Pitney Bowes timely protested the awards, asserting that the awards were improper because Neopost did not have certain requirements relating to maintenance on its FSS contract, and because Neopost’s FSS contract did not include items that matched salient characteristics of several of Pitney Bowes’ products.  For example, Pitney Bowes alleged that its T56C portable tracking assistant had features that were not found on Neopost’s portable tracking assistant.  In response, the FBI stated that it would take corrective action by re‑evaluating the quotations and making a new award decision.  Thereafter, our Office dismissed Pitney Bowes’ protests.  Pitney Bowes, Inc., B-412185, B-412186, Oct. 26, 2015 (unpublished decision).

		In the course of implementing its corrective action, the agency conducted discussions with the two vendors.  Legal Memorandum at 2.  During discussions, Pitney Bowes was informed that its quotation contained no significant weaknesses or deficiencies, while Neopost was informed that its quotation contained one deficiency.  Specifically, Neopost was informed that the item it had proposed for a server lacked the capacity to store several years of package tracking data, and that “to be considered ‘equal’ to the Government’s requirement, proposed servers had to be capable of storing a minimum of two years’ worth of data.”  Contracting Officer’s (CO) Statement at 1; Agency Report (AR), Tab 8, Discussions Letter, at 1.  In response, Neopost revised its quotation to include (at no additional cost to the FBI) an additional hard drive capable of retaining the data.  CO Statement at 1‑2.  The FBI gave both vendors a new deadline of December 2 to submit final quotation revisions. 

		After receiving final quotations, the agency sought clarifications from Neopost regarding whether all items it had quoted were included on its GSA FSS contract.  CO Statement at 2.  Neopost responded by submitting pages from its FSS contract that identified Neopost’s proposed products’ model numbers and included product descriptions.  AR, Tab 11, Neopost Dec. 22, 2015 Reply, at 2-10.  On these excerpts from its FSS contract, Neopost included hand-written notes identifying the solicitations’ CLINs that corresponded to the items being offered in its quotation.  For example, with regard to solicitation No. 20579, Neopost wrote “010” next to the entry in its FSS contract for Model No. IDS55NCK-N, description “WTS-P MC55 Delivery Scanner:  Includes scanner requires IDSMBSLIC – Mobile Software License.”  Id. at 4.  Neopost also wrote “010” next to Model No. IDSMBSLIC-N, description “WTS-P Mobile Software License.”  Id. at 2.

		The agency concluded that both vendors had the required items on their GSA schedules, both vendors could meet the delivery requirements, and that Neopost’s quoted prices ($47,496 and $223,230) were less than Pitney Bowes’ quoted prices ($72,673 and $355,686).  AR, Tab 12, Quotation Evaluation Board Report, at 7.  On January 27, 2016, the agency awarded the contracts to Neopost.  These protests followed.

		DISCUSSION

		Pitney Bowes raises several challenges to the agency’s evaluation and award decision.  The protester primarily argues, in essence, that award was improper because Neopost’s proposed products differ significantly from Pitney Bowes’ brand name items, and that, in Pitney Bowes’ view, some of the products lack the salient characteristics of Pitney Bowes’ items.  The protester raises various examples of how the awardee’s items allegedly differ from its own items.  As one example, the protester complains that Neopost’s handheld tracking device does not have “all the features” of Pitney Bowes’ tracking device, including the ability to take pictures.[4]  Protest at 5. 

		The agency responds that its evaluation and award were reasonable because the awardee proposed items that met “the functional requirements of the RFQs, and were therefore ‘equal’ to those offered by Pitney Bowes.”  Legal Memorandum at 1.  In this regard, the agency explains that it was seeking to procure a mail tracking system with the ability to capture a signature (showing proof of delivery) and to retain a record of that signature in a database.  AR, Tab 3, Declaration of Technical Evaluation Chair, Mar. 14, 2016, at 1.  The agency assessed whether the items quoted in Neopost’s proposed system were able to meet these requirements, and found the items to be acceptable.  After considering all of Pitney Bowes’ arguments, we find no basis to sustain the protest.[5]

		In reviewing a protest challenging an agency’s evaluation, our Office will neither reevaluate proposals, nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency, as the evaluation of proposals is a matter within the agency’s discretion.  Superior Cleaning Equipment, Inc., B-411847, Oct. 29, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 328 at 2.  Rather, we will review the record only to determine whether the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria and with applicable procurement statutes and regulations.  Id. at 2-3.  Moreover, in a brand name or equal procurement such as here, a product offered as an equal need not meet unstated features of the brand name product, and where an agency does not include a list of salient characteristics in the solicitation, it may not reject an “equal” quotation for noncompliance with a specific performance or design feature unless the offered item is significantly different from the brand name product.  See J. E. Pope Co., Inc., B-238560, May 16, 1990, 90-1 CPD ¶ 478 at 4.

		Here, we find unobjectionable the agency’s determination that Neopost offered products from its FSS contract that were essentially equal to the Pitney Bowes’ products listed in the solicitations, thus satisfying the solicitation requirement that the items be brand name or equal.  In this regard, the record shows that Neopost’s quotations provided items that were part of a “functionally equivalent” mail tracking system.  See AR, Tab 4, Declaration of FBI Point of Contact for Shipping and Receiving, at 1.  As explained above, the FBI’s requirements were for mail tracking systems that had the capability to capture a signature--thus showing proof of delivery--and retain a record of that signature.  The record reflects that the agency evaluated the functionalities of the items each vendor quoted, and reasonably found that both vendors had quoted items that met the agency’s requirements.

		For example, Neopost’s quotations included a handheld portable scanner, which could read barcodes, handle multiple packages delivered to multiple locations by a single courier, capture the receiver’s signature upon delivery, and retain the signature for download later to a database. See AR, Tab 3, Declaration of Technical Evaluation Chair, Mar. 14, 2016, at 1.  While Pitney Bowes points out that Neopost’s portable scanner lacks certain other features (such as the ability to take pictures), the failure to have these additional features does not demonstrate a flawed evaluation.  In this respect, the agency maintains that a camera and other features cited by Pitney Bowes were not necessary or required characteristics of the scanner, as these features (such as GPS and cellular capability) would not be utilized by the agency.  Declaration of Technical Evaluation Chair, Mar. 28, 2016, at 1.  Indeed, the agency reports that the use of some features, such as GPS and cellular systems, would violate agency security requirements.  Id.  Given this, we see nothing unreasonable with the agency’s determination that Neopost’s scanner was equivalent to the one listed in the solicitations. 

		As another example, Pitney Bowes also challenges the agency’s determination that Neopost submitted equivalent items for CLIN 014, configuration project management, found under solicitation No. 22525.  Pitney Bowes interpreted the agency’s requirement here as the conversion of the existing database of tracking information to the new system.  Comments/Supp. Protest at 16.  The agency responds, however, that CLIN 014 was not for database conversion, but was instead for “installing, setting up, and maintaining of whatever software system the vendor proposed” to meet the mail system’s tracking requirements.  Declaration of Technical Evaluation Chair, Mar. 28, 2016, at 2.  While Pitney Bowes asserts that it submitted its quotation based on its understanding of CLIN 014 (such that the agency’s different understanding of CLIN 014 constitutes a “latent” defect), the protester’s interpretation of what the FBI required is not supported by the language of the solicitation, such that there is no ambiguity or defect.  Thus, we find nothing unreasonable about the agency’s determination that Neopost met the CLIN 014 requirement for configuration project management even though Neopost did not propose to convert the existing database, as Pitney Bowes did.[6]

		Given the agency’s broad discretion in evaluating quotations, and the lack of any defined salient characteristics for each item being procured, we have no basis to object to the agency’s determination that the awardee’s items met the requirements set forth in the solicitations.  See Superior Cleaning Equip., Inc., supra, at 3; see also Fortune Chem. Co., Inc., B‑247000, Apr. 2, 1992, 92-1 CPD ¶ 344 at 1 (protest that agency improperly made award to firm whose product was not “equal” is denied where agency reasonably found that awardee’s product was functionally equivalent for the intended application, despite the lack of salient characteristics).  Based on the record before us, we find that the agency reasonably determined that Neopost quoted items that were equivalent to the brand name items identified in the solicitations.[7]

		The protest is denied.

[1] FedBid, Inc., is a commercial online procurement services provider that runs a website at FedBid.com.



[2] The solicitations refer to both bids and offers being requested, and the agency report refers to quotations.  For purposes of this decision, we adopt the agency’s use of the term quotations.



[3] With regard to the evaluation criteria for award, the solicitations stated, among other things, that “[s]ellers understand that FedBid ranks all Bids by price,” and that “award will be made to the responsible Seller whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Buyer on the basis of price, technical capability, delivery, and past performance.”  Solicitation No. 20579 at 10; Solicitation No. 22525 at 10.



[4] The protester essentially asserts that Neopost quoted an older model of the scanner listed in the solicitations.  Comments/Supp. Protest, attach. 4, Declaration of Pitney Bowes’ Federal Systems Engineer, Mar. 21, 2016, at 2.  In this regard, Pitney Bowes asserts that Neopost’s scanner lacks “GPS and cellular capability,” and has a “completely different operating system” that is slower, less secure, and at the end of its operational life.  Comments/Supp. Protest at 15; attach. 4, Declaration of Pitney Bowes’ Federal Systems Engineer, Mar. 21, 2016, at 2. 



[5] As an initial matter, we disagree with the protester’s contention that certain features of its products were salient characteristics that were also required of Neopost’s products.  In this regard, the solicitations permitted the submission of quotations offering equal products, but contained no listing of the salient characteristics those products must meet.  Accordingly, to the extent that Pitney Bowes now asserts that certain features of its products should have been viewed as salient characteristics, and required, this protest ground is untimely.  In this respect, the protester was required to raise the solicitations’ lack of salient characteristics prior to the closing time for receipt of quotations.  4 C.F.R. § 21.2(a)(1).



[6] The protester and agency also disagree over whether the item Neopost proposed for server hardware met the solicitations’ requirements.  In this regard, the agency concedes that Neopost quoted hard drives for these requirements, whereas Pitney Bowes offered a server.  However, the agency argues that a hard drive was sufficient to meet the agency’s needs, which consisted of retaining large amounts of data for at least two years.  Legal Memorandum at 3-4.  We need not determine whether the agency’s acceptance of this was proper, because even if we were to find that the agency improperly waived the solicitation requirement for the awardee, the record does not establish that Pitney Bowes was prejudiced by the agency’s acceptance of the hard drives.  Specifically, the record shows that Pitney Bowes quoted $4,000 for the servers under solicitation No. 20579 and approximately $21,000 under solicitation No. 22525.  Even if Pitney Bowes instead were to have offered hard drives at no additional cost to the FBI (as Neopost did), Neopost would still have submitted the lower-priced quotation.  See LexisNexis Risk Solutions FL Inc., B‑410595, B-410595.2, Jan. 7, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 30 at 4-5 (where protester suffers no prejudice as a result of an alleged evaluation flaw, our Office will not sustain a protest).



[7] The protester also argues that the awards were improper because Neopost failed to provide make, model, and descriptive literature of the items in its quotations, as required by FAR clause 52.211-6(b), Brand Name or Equal.  We disagree.  The record shows that, for each CLIN in Neopost’s quotations, the vendor listed the CLIN number next to the make, model number, and description of the item in its FSS contract.  AR, Tab 11, Neopost Dec. 22, 2015 Reply, at 1-10.  Consequently, this argument fails to provide a basis to sustain the protest.

			DECISION


		Pitney Bowes, Inc., of Washington, DC, protests the terms of request for quotations (RFQ) No. TIRMS-16-R-00016, issued by the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for the procurement of mail inserter/folder machines.  Pitney argues that the technical specifications set out in the solicitation are unduly restrictive of competition.

		We sustain the protest.

		BACKGROUND

		The RFQ was issued via the General Services Administration’s (GSA) e-Buy system on November 3, 2016,[1]  and contemplated the award of a fixed-price contract on a lowest-priced, technically acceptable basis.[2]  The solicitation sought quotations for four PS200 folder/inserters with four 500 sheet capacity sheet feeders, and four PS200 high capacity feeders, or equivalent machines, to replace existing equipment used for document processing and mailing at the IRS’s National Distribution Center (NDC) in Bloomington, Illinois.  CO Statement at 1.  According to the solicitation, the NDC is one of the IRS facilities that processes and mails high volume turnaround letters including Affordable Care Act compliance and earned income tax credit letters.  RFQ at 3.

		The RFQ includes contract line item numbers (CLIN) that refer to the PS200 folder/inserter and certain PS200 components.  RFQ at B-1.  The statement of work (SOW), however, lists a number of specific requirements for the folder/inserters, which is consistent with the agency’s assertion that it intended the acquisition to be a procurement for the brand name PS200 equipment or an equivalent product that could meet the specifications in the SOW.  SOW at 2; CO Statement at 1.  The specifications include, as relevant here:  (1) “[a] high capacity sheet feeder with a capacity of up to 1,000 per feeder with the capability of loading on the fly”; (2) “[a] feeder swap capability for up to 10 sheet feeders per machine”; and (3) “[o]ne envelope feeder to handle all types of envelopes from letters to flats.”[3]  RFQ at 4.

		This protest was filed with our Office on November 7, prior to the closing of the solicitation.  The agency has indicated that the protester was among the vendors who submitted quotations. 

		DISCUSSION

		Pitney challenges specifications in the SOW requiring high capacity sheet feeders that are capable of being loaded on the fly, folders/inserters that have a feeder swap capability for up to 10 sheet feeders per machine, and folders/inserters that have an envelope feeder capable of handling all types of envelopes from letters to flats.  According to the protester, the requirements are unduly restrictive of competition and amount to a de facto sole source requirement.[4]  Based on the record, we are unable to conclude that the specifications included in the RFQ are necessary to meet the agency’s needs.

		The determination of the government’s needs and the best method of accommodating them is primarily the responsibility of the procuring agency, since its contracting officials are most familiar with the conditions under which supplies, equipment, and services have been employed in the past and will be utilized in the future.  Columbia Imaging, Inc., B-286772.2, B-287363, Apr. 13, 2001, 2001 CPD ¶ 78 at 2.  To the extent a protester challenges a specification as unduly restrictive, that is, challenges both the restrictive nature of the requirement as well as the agency’s need for the restriction, the procuring agency has the responsibility of establishing that the specification is reasonably necessary to meet its needs.  Smith and Nephew, Inc., B-410453, Jan. 2, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 90 at 5.  The adequacy of the agency’s justification is ascertained through examining whether the agency’s explanation is reasonable, that is, whether it can withstand logical scrutiny.  Id.

		Here, the protester challenges three specifications included in the SOW.  First, the protester challenges the requirement for a high capacity sheet feeder with a 1,000 sheet capacity, capable of being loaded on the fly.  According to the agency, load‑on‑the‑fly capability, which would allow the insertion of additional sheets while the system is in operation, is necessary to “minimize production time by allowing the equipment to be loaded while in operation.”  AR at 7.  According to the protester, this requirement is overly restrictive because, while the protester’s high capacity sheet feeders do not have load-on-the-fly capability, the same continuous operation can be achieved by using two high capacity sheet feeders, each holding 1,000 sheets.  Protest at 5.  The protester’s approach would provide for items to be pulled from one feeder while the other feeder is filled.  The machine would alternate between the feeders to provide continuous operation and avoid system interruption.  Protest at 5.  While the agency appears to concede that Pitney’s solution will provide for continuous operation, it argues that the use of the protester’s approach would require additional employee time, possibly resulting in more paper jams, and require additional storage space.  AR at 7.  The agency’s arguments, in this regard, fail to establish that the load‑on‑the‑fly capability is necessary.

		Regarding the use of employee time, the parties disagree as to whether it would be more efficient for employees to monitor and refill one tray on a machine with load‑on‑the‑fly capability or to monitor two trays on a machine like the protester’s, that alternates between trays to achieve continuous use.  While there are likely pros and cons to both continuous operation solutions, we fail to see, and the agency has not adequately shown, why the protester’s solution would be more time consuming for employees.  IRS Information Technology Specialist’s Declaration, January 18, 2017, at 2.  With either approach, employees would be monitoring a tray and inserting more sheets into a feeder as needed. 

		With regard to the agency’s bare assertion that the use of two feeders increases the possibility of paper jams, the agency has not provided anything to substantiate its claim.  CO Statement at 3.  Casting some doubt on the agency’s assertion, the protester argues that there is actually a benefit to the two feeder system in that, unlike a system that relies on a single feeder with load-on-the-fly capability, the use of two feeders would allow an operator to turn off the jammed feeder for repair, while allowing the other feeder to continue operating.  Comments at 3.  Given the agency’s goal of maintaining continuous operation, the protester’s argument is compelling.  Id.

		Additionally, the agency argues that the use of two sheet feeders to achieve continuous operation would result in the need for additional storage space.  AR at 7.  In response, Pitney argues--without rebuttal from the agency--that its equipment is designed to store the feeders, such that no additional space would be required.  Comments at 4. 

		In sum, the agency has failed to provide a reasonable justification as to why a requirement for load-on-the-fly capability is necessary, when a different approach may be able to achieve the same results.

		In its November 7 protest, Pitney also challenges the requirement for the equipment to have a feeder swap capability for up to ten sheet feeders per machine.  Protest at 6.  According to the protester, this requirement, which differed from the requirement in the original RFQ for machines capable of accommodating up to ten additional module feeders each, could only be met by one source.  Protest at 6.  In its report, the agency clarified that “module feeder” was synonymous with “sheet feeder.”  CO Statement at 5.  The protester responded that, based on that clarification, its equipment will be able to meet the requirement.[5]  Comments at 5.  Accordingly, because the protester has conceded that its equipment could satisfy the requirement for feeder swap capability for up to ten sheet feeders per machine, we do not address further the argument that the requirement is restrictive of competition. 

		Finally, the protester challenges the requirement that the folder/inserter have one envelope feeder to handle all types of envelopes from letters to flats.  Protest at 5. According to the protester, the standard envelope feeder for its proposed solution feeds a wide range of the most common types of envelope sizes and flats.  Federal Government Strategic Manager for Pitney Affidavit, December 19, 2016, at 2.  For more unusual sizes, the protester asserts that the process of removing a feed and inserting a new one would take less than 30 seconds.  Id.  While the agency simply maintains that it needs a feeder that will handle all types of envelopes, it provides no explanation as to why it needs a feeder that would handle envelope sizes and types that deviate from standard sized envelopes. 

		Additionally, while the agency complains about the time and effort that would be required to insert a new feeder, it has provided no information regarding whether and how often the insertion of a different feeder might actually be necessary.  IRS Information Technology Specialist’s Statement at 3.  Absent further support from the agency, it is not clear why the agency would need an envelope feeder that could handle all types of envelopes, given that there is no discussion of a need for types of envelopes that would fall outside of the range of standard types.[6]  Here, the agency has not provided a reasonable justification for its requirement that the folder/inserters come equipped with one envelope feeder that can handle all types of envelopes from letters to flats.

		CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

		In sum, we recognize that the IRS is entitled to great discretion in establishing its needs.  Here, however, we find that the agency has failed to provide reasonable justifications for the challenged specifications, such that we are unable to conclude that the challenged specifications are reasonably necessary for the agency to meet its needs.

		We recommend that the agency make a documented determination of its needs.  Once the agency identifies its needs, the agency should revise its RFQ to include specifications that are reasonably necessary to meet those needs.  We also recommend that Pitney be reimbursed the costs of filing and pursuing the protest, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.  4 C.F.R. § 21.8(d)(1).  Pitney should submit its certified claim for costs, detailing the time expended and costs incurred, directly to the contracting agency within 60 days after receipt of this decision.  Id. § 21.8(f)(1).

		The protest is sustained.

[1] The RFQ, which was designated GSA e-Buy no. 1153425, was initially issued on August 3, 2016, and closed on August 15.  In response to the initial RFQ, the agency received quotations from Pitney and another company, Neopost USA.  Contracting Officer (CO) Statement at 1.  According to the protester, Pitney was initially selected for award, but that award was successfully challenged at the agency level by Neopost.  Protest at 1.  Neopost was subsequently selected for award on September 23.  CO Statement at 1.  Pitney filed a protest of the award to Neopost with our Office on September 30, but withdrew its protest on October 21, after the agency decided to cancel the RFQ and recompete its requirements.  Id. at 2.



[2] We note that the solicitation provided to our Office did not advise vendors of the basis for award, and did not clearly indicate that the agency was seeking brand name (PS200) equipment or its technical equivalent.  Here, we rely on the information provided in the CO Statement, which is not at issue in this protest.



[3] Load-on-the-fly capability allows a user to load additional sheets into the feeder while the feeder is in operation.  Agency Report (AR) at 7.



[4] The protester initially challenged two additional requirements.  First, Pitney challenged a requirement that folder/inserters have an envelope feeder capacity of 800 envelopes with load‑on‑the‑fly capability.  Pitney also challenged a requirement for a touch screen that controls all functions from start to finish.  Protest at 5-6.  The protester withdrew its challenge to the first requirement after the agency confirmed that it would not find the protester’s equipment, which only has a 500 envelope capacity, to be technically unacceptable, consistent with the agency’s response in the questions and answers conducted during competition under the original solicitation.  AR at 8; Comments on the AR at 4.  The protester also withdrew its challenge to the requirement for the equipment to have a single touch screen that would control all functions after the agency, in its agency report, explained that it would accept a button-based control.  AR at 11. 



[5] In arguments attempting to justify this requirement, the agency indicated that this requirement relates to an anticipated future need in which NDC will be required to insert ten documents per envelope.  CO Statement at 5.  In this regard, the agency has argued that the protester’s machine will not be able to meet the requirement even though it has a feeder swap capability for up to ten sheet feeders.  The agency argues that, without load‑on‑the‑fly capability, the protester’s machine would need to assign two feeders to each document, swapping between feeders as described above, in order to achieve continuous operation.  AR at 9-10.  In other words, according to the agency, to meet its future need for the capability to insert ten documents per envelope while maintaining continuous operation, the protester’s machine would need to have twenty sheet feeders, which would exceed its capacity.  To the extent the agency’s requirement is for a machine with the capability to insert ten documents per envelope while maintaining continuous operation, this was not clearly communicated in the RFQ.  Given our recommendation that the agency revisit its requirements and revise its RFQ accordingly, the agency may want to consider whether a requirement stating the need to process jobs that include ten documents per envelope should be included in its solicitation. 



[6] We note that in a supplemental filing, the protester argued that while the RFQ required that the new machines not exceed the footprint of the existing machines, Neopost’s machines, when configured to meet the agency’s anticipated future need for the capability to insert ten documents per envelope discussed in footnote 5, exceed the size limitation.  Whether the size limitation in the current solicitation reasonably reflects the agency’s needs is another matter that the IRS may wish to consider as it reassesses its requirements and revises the RFQ.

History[edit]
In 1902, Arthur Pitney patented his first "double-locking" hand-cranked postage-stamping machine, and, with patent attorney Eugene A. Rummler, founded the Pitney Postal Machine Company. In 1908, English emigrant and founder of the Universal Stamping Machine Company Walter Bowes began providing stamp-canceling machines to the United States Postal Service. Bowes moved his operations to Stamford in 1917. A rapid increase in mail volume in 1919 made the Post Office more receptive to metered mail, and Pitney subsequently traveled to meet Bowes. On March 15, 1920, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill authorizing mechanical stamps on First-Class Mail, and on April 23, 1920, the two companies merged to form the Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company, with the goal of producing a machine that would combine Pitney's "double-locking" counter with Bowes' system for wrapping postage payment, postmarking and cancellation. The United States Post Office approved their postage meter on August 25, 1920.
Between 1922 and 1923, the government collected $4,359,070 in postage from the first commercial installations of 400 meters. Pitney Bowes also began to sell their products internationally.
In 1938, Walter H. Wheeler, Jr. was named President and Chairman of the Board and would lead the company over the next three decades. In the 1940s, Wheeler boycotted a hotel when it refused to register one black salesperson, championing a spirit of diversity that still exists today, writing: "Pitney Bowes' worksites will reflect the communities in which we operate."[3] During the 1950s, The National Urban League recognized Pitney Bowes for its leadership in providing job opportunities to African Americans.
During World War II, Pitney-Bowes received an Army-Navy ‘E’ Award denoting excellence in production of crucially needed instruments of war (February 1, 1943).[4]
The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1950. Subsequently, Pitney Bowes was named to the S&P 500 when this benchmark index was created in 1957 and joined the Fortune 500 in 1962.
In 1968 Pitney Bowes acquired the Monarch Marking System Company, which would produce the first barcode equipment for retail trade use. To better provide financing options for their existing and prospective customers, the Pitney Bowes Credit Corporation was formed in 1976. (Pitney Bowes would continue to grow this line of business, launching the Pitney Bowes Bank in 1996.)
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the firm expanded, offering copy machines and facsimile machines, a suite of management services and entering new markets, such as Japan. During this period, Pitney Bowes acquired Dictaphone and kept the dictation machine manufacturer as a wholly owned but independent subsidiary until the unit was sold in 1995.[5]
In the 1990s, Pitney Bowes continued to innovate in the field of digital technologies and software, introducing the AddressRight address & barcode printer (1991), the first in-line weighing and metering system (1992), the first secure digital postage meter (1995), the first ink jet postage meter (1996) and the Digital Document Deliver (D3) platform (1998) which provides message management via hard copy, web, email and fax.
Since 2000, Pitney Bowes invested $2.5 billion in 83 acquisitions, primarily in software and services businesses including MapInfo, Group 1 Software, PSI Group and Imagitas. The Software Portfolio has been largely grouped into an operating division called Pitney Bowes Software.
In August 2013, the firm announced that it sold its world headquarters building in Stamford, CT (One Elmcroft Road)[6] but it would remain in the same city and move to 3001 Stamford Square (Summer Street). The relocation is expected to be complete by the summer of 2014.[7][8]
On October 1, 2013, Pitney Bowes sold its Management Services division (PBMS) to private equity firm Apollo Global Management for $400 million in cash, the proceeds of which would be principally to pay down debt.[9] PBMS has since been renamed Novitex Enterprise Solutions.[10]
On January 14, 2015, Pitney Bowes unveiled a new brand strategy and logo that supposedly better reflects the company's self-proclaimed role as "a technology company that powers billions of physical and digital transactions across the connected and borderless world of commerce." [11]
Research and technology[edit]
Pitney Bowes’ intellectual property portfolio includes more than 3,500 patents worldwide[12] in areas such as ticketing, cellular phone payment, shipping, laser printing, encryption and mail production and processing. The Intellectual Property Owners (IPO) Association has consistently ranked Pitney Bowes in the top 200 companies receiving U.S. patents. Six of these patents are held by retired Executive Chairman Michael J. Critelli. Murray D. Martin, a former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, is named on two.

Credit ratings and Revenue[edit]
In February 2012, the credit rating for Pitney Bowes International Holdings was lowered by Fitch Ratings from BBB+ to BBB. The ratings agency said its main concern was "the downward trajectory" of Pitney Bowes' revenue, and added that they have a "negative outlook."[16]
In March 2014, Moody's assigned a long-term rating of Baa2 to the company's proposed $350 million senior unsecured notes (due 2024) and reiterated their stable outlook on PBI. Moody's cited "an improvement in the company's operating margin to around 19%, from about 15% historically, following the sale of its labor intensive management services business" and "an operational restructuring which could yield annual cost savings of up to $170 million by 2016." [17]
In February 2016, Pitney Bowes announced that its full year 2015 revenue was $3.6b, a decline of 3% over the previous year.[18]

History[edit]
In 1902, Arthur Pitney patented his first "double-locking" hand-cranked postage-stamping machine, and, with patent attorney Eugene A. Rummler, founded the Pitney Postal Machine Company. In 1908, English emigrant and founder of the Universal Stamping Machine Company Walter Bowes began providing stamp-canceling machines to the United States Postal Service. Bowes moved his operations to Stamford in 1917. A rapid increase in mail volume in 1919 made the Post Office more receptive to metered mail, and Pitney subsequently traveled to meet Bowes. On March 15, 1920, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill authorizing mechanical stamps on First-Class Mail, and on April 23, 1920, the two companies merged to form the Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company, with the goal of producing a machine that would combine Pitney's "double-locking" counter with Bowes' system for wrapping postage payment, postmarking and cancellation. The United States Post Office approved their postage meter on August 25, 1920.
Between 1922 and 1923, the government collected $4,359,070 in postage from the first commercial installations of 400 meters. Pitney Bowes also began to sell their products internationally.
In 1938, Walter H. Wheeler, Jr. was named President and Chairman of the Board and would lead the company over the next three decades. In the 1940s, Wheeler boycotted a hotel when it refused to register one black salesperson, championing a spirit of diversity that still exists today, writing: "Pitney Bowes' worksites will reflect the communities in which we operate."[3] During the 1950s, The National Urban League recognized Pitney Bowes for its leadership in providing job opportunities to African Americans.
During World War II, Pitney-Bowes received an Army-Navy ‘E’ Award denoting excellence in production of crucially needed instruments of war (February 1, 1943).[4]
The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1950. Subsequently, Pitney Bowes was named to the S&P 500 when this benchmark index was created in 1957 and joined the Fortune 500 in 1962.
In 1968 Pitney Bowes acquired the Monarch Marking System Company, which would produce the first barcode equipment for retail trade use. To better provide financing options for their existing and prospective customers, the Pitney Bowes Credit Corporation was formed in 1976. (Pitney Bowes would continue to grow this line of business, launching the Pitney Bowes Bank in 1996.)
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the firm expanded, offering copy machines and facsimile machines, a suite of management services and entering new markets, such as Japan. During this period, Pitney Bowes acquired Dictaphone and kept the dictation machine manufacturer as a wholly owned but independent subsidiary until the unit was sold in 1995.[5]
In the 1990s, Pitney Bowes continued to innovate in the field of digital technologies and software, introducing the AddressRight address & barcode printer (1991), the first in-line weighing and metering system (1992), the first secure digital postage meter (1995), the first ink jet postage meter (1996) and the Digital Document Deliver (D3) platform (1998) which provides message management via hard copy, web, email and fax.
Since 2000, Pitney Bowes invested $2.5 billion in 83 acquisitions, primarily in software and services businesses including MapInfo, Group 1 Software, PSI Group and Imagitas. The Software Portfolio has been largely grouped into an operating division called Pitney Bowes Software.
In August 2013, the firm announced that it sold its world headquarters building in Stamford, CT (One Elmcroft Road)[6] but it would remain in the same city and move to 3001 Stamford Square (Summer Street). The relocation is expected to be complete by the summer of 2014.[7][8]
On October 1, 2013, Pitney Bowes sold its Management Services division (PBMS) to private equity firm Apollo Global Management for $400 million in cash, the proceeds of which would be principally to pay down debt.[9] PBMS has since been renamed Novitex Enterprise Solutions.[10]
On January 14, 2015, Pitney Bowes unveiled a new brand strategy and logo that supposedly better reflects the company's self-proclaimed role as "a technology company that powers billions of physical and digital transactions across the connected and borderless world of commerce." [11]
Research and technology[edit]
Pitney Bowes’ intellectual property portfolio includes more than 3,500 patents worldwide[12] in areas such as ticketing, cellular phone payment, shipping, laser printing, encryption and mail production and processing. The Intellectual Property Owners (IPO) Association has consistently ranked Pitney Bowes in the top 200 companies receiving U.S. patents. Six of these patents are held by retired Executive Chairman Michael J. Critelli. Murray D. Martin, a former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, is named on two.

Credit ratings and Revenue[edit]
In February 2012, the credit rating for Pitney Bowes International Holdings was lowered by Fitch Ratings from BBB+ to BBB. The ratings agency said its main concern was "the downward trajectory" of Pitney Bowes' revenue, and added that they have a "negative outlook."[16]
In March 2014, Moody's assigned a long-term rating of Baa2 to the company's proposed $350 million senior unsecured notes (due 2024) and reiterated their stable outlook on PBI. Moody's cited "an improvement in the company's operating margin to around 19%, from about 15% historically, following the sale of its labor intensive management services business" and "an operational restructuring which could yield annual cost savings of up to $170 million by 2016." [17]
In February 2016, Pitney Bowes announced that its full year 2015 revenue was $3.6b, a decline of 3% over the previous year.[18]

History[edit]
In 1902, Arthur Pitney patented his first "double-locking" hand-cranked postage-stamping machine, and, with patent attorney Eugene A. Rummler, founded the Pitney Postal Machine Company. In 1908, English emigrant and founder of the Universal Stamping Machine Company Walter Bowes began providing stamp-canceling machines to the United States Postal Service. Bowes moved his operations to Stamford in 1917. A rapid increase in mail volume in 1919 made the Post Office more receptive to metered mail, and Pitney subsequently traveled to meet Bowes. On March 15, 1920, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill authorizing mechanical stamps on First-Class Mail, and on April 23, 1920, the two companies merged to form the Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company, with the goal of producing a machine that would combine Pitney's "double-locking" counter with Bowes' system for wrapping postage payment, postmarking and cancellation. The United States Post Office approved their postage meter on August 25, 1920.
Between 1922 and 1923, the government collected $4,359,070 in postage from the first commercial installations of 400 meters. Pitney Bowes also began to sell their products internationally.
In 1938, Walter H. Wheeler, Jr. was named President and Chairman of the Board and would lead the company over the next three decades. In the 1940s, Wheeler boycotted a hotel when it refused to register one black salesperson, championing a spirit of diversity that still exists today, writing: "Pitney Bowes' worksites will reflect the communities in which we operate."[3] During the 1950s, The National Urban League recognized Pitney Bowes for its leadership in providing job opportunities to African Americans.
During World War II, Pitney-Bowes received an Army-Navy ‘E’ Award denoting excellence in production of crucially needed instruments of war (February 1, 1943).[4]
The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1950. Subsequently, Pitney Bowes was named to the S&P 500 when this benchmark index was created in 1957 and joined the Fortune 500 in 1962.
In 1968 Pitney Bowes acquired the Monarch Marking System Company, which would produce the first barcode equipment for retail trade use. To better provide financing options for their existing and prospective customers, the Pitney Bowes Credit Corporation was formed in 1976. (Pitney Bowes would continue to grow this line of business, launching the Pitney Bowes Bank in 1996.)
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the firm expanded, offering copy machines and facsimile machines, a suite of management services and entering new markets, such as Japan. During this period, Pitney Bowes acquired Dictaphone and kept the dictation machine manufacturer as a wholly owned but independent subsidiary until the unit was sold in 1995.[5]
In the 1990s, Pitney Bowes continued to innovate in the field of digital technologies and software, introducing the AddressRight address & barcode printer (1991), the first in-line weighing and metering system (1992), the first secure digital postage meter (1995), the first ink jet postage meter (1996) and the Digital Document Deliver (D3) platform (1998) which provides message management via hard copy, web, email and fax.
Since 2000, Pitney Bowes invested $2.5 billion in 83 acquisitions, primarily in software and services businesses including MapInfo, Group 1 Software, PSI Group and Imagitas. The Software Portfolio has been largely grouped into an operating division called Pitney Bowes Software.
In August 2013, the firm announced that it sold its world headquarters building in Stamford, CT (One Elmcroft Road)[6] but it would remain in the same city and move to 3001 Stamford Square (Summer Street). The relocation is expected to be complete by the summer of 2014.[7][8]
On October 1, 2013, Pitney Bowes sold its Management Services division (PBMS) to private equity firm Apollo Global Management for $400 million in cash, the proceeds of which would be principally to pay down debt.[9] PBMS has since been renamed Novitex Enterprise Solutions.[10]
On January 14, 2015, Pitney Bowes unveiled a new brand strategy and logo that supposedly better reflects the company's self-proclaimed role as "a technology company that powers billions of physical and digital transactions across the connected and borderless world of commerce." [11]
Research and technology[edit]
Pitney Bowes’ intellectual property portfolio includes more than 3,500 patents worldwide[12] in areas such as ticketing, cellular phone payment, shipping, laser printing, encryption and mail production and processing. The Intellectual Property Owners (IPO) Association has consistently ranked Pitney Bowes in the top 200 companies receiving U.S. patents. Six of these patents are held by retired Executive Chairman Michael J. Critelli. Murray D. Martin, a former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, is named on two.

Credit ratings and Revenue[edit]
In February 2012, the credit rating for Pitney Bowes International Holdings was lowered by Fitch Ratings from BBB+ to BBB. The ratings agency said its main concern was "the downward trajectory" of Pitney Bowes' revenue, and added that they have a "negative outlook."[16]
In March 2014, Moody's assigned a long-term rating of Baa2 to the company's proposed $350 million senior unsecured notes (due 2024) and reiterated their stable outlook on PBI. Moody's cited "an improvement in the company's operating margin to around 19%, from about 15% historically, following the sale of its labor intensive management services business" and "an operational restructuring which could yield annual cost savings of up to $170 million by 2016." [17]
In February 2016, Pitney Bowes announced that its full year 2015 revenue was $3.6b, a decline of 3% over the previous year.[18]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
