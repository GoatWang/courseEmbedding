                                    very nice scope and meets all expectations, perfect for my 22 target shooting, with ranges from 35 yards to 100 yards. This is where the paralex adjustment is critical, and elevation is constantly used.

                                    Would trade for new grand slam.
Cons: Hard to get clear sight picture
