Tony joined Canada Post during a time of transition when there was little training but lots to do and learn.  
Tony became a key member of the inventory team making recommendations, providing focus and putting much needed organization in to place.  
Tony is a creative, detail-oriented, and highly organized.  One of his qualities I appreciated most was that he was always available to help.  
He’s great at working independently and can produce high-level work with little supervision.  Tony would be an asset to any team or Corporation.
See moreSee lessI had the pleasure to work with Anthony during his years at DALSA (now Teledyne DALSA) and he implemented the PCB layouts for the schematics I created.  The designs were typically complex and therefore required much care for the placement of the components and routing of the signals, yet I did not need to provide much instruction for Anthony to achieve a good design.  He is very competent with PCB layout design and it was a real loss when he left DALSA and we would gladly have him back if circumstances would permit it.

Anthony was also our Mentor Graphics expert and problem solver and he has a great mind to figure out why the tools weren't behaving.
