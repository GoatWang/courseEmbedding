At being, we believe in a holistic and integrative approach to therapy, which leads to physical and mental health. We understand that the discomfort or symptoms you’re experiencing aren’t just a product of your mind and emotions, but can arise from your body, spirit, and soul, a feeling of disconnection to yourself and to the greater world. Your health is dependent upon many parts that communicate or work together in an integrative fashion, and therefore it is important to address the whole you, to attend to your needs as a whole individual. 
 
 

Our approach to therapy, and ultimately mental health, is to help you find and address the root causes of your suffering, rather than to label and treat the symptoms alone; after all, you’re more than just a label. In a relaxed atmosphere, we will work with you to address the mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical imbalances that are causing you stress and discomfort. We support effective, natural approaches to healing that support the body’s own ability to bring about balance and health.

4 Steps To A More Confident You
by Jeffrey Raich  |  Apr 21, 2015  |  Anxiety, Blog (all), Depression, Mental HealthWhat are your core values?
 This week, as in every week, I notice a theme, something that all clients seem to speak about, in my office. I’m not sure if there’s a particular reason for this. Perhaps the winds of Minnesota bring ideas and thoughts to all who come to my office. More likely is that each week I hear something common among those whom I see. Whatever the reason, I find it useful to think about these things and have decided to share some commonalities that all seem to experience. 
The reason for this is that often times we feel isolated in our own thoughts. We assume that no one else feels this way. In a recent study researchers looked at how comparing ourselves to others contributes to feels of depression. Specifically, they looked at Facebook. But before we go further, I’m not saying Facebook causes depression only that it’s a place that can be studied as there are 1.7 billion users world wide. What they found is because people post mostly positive statements and photos about their life, others who view those posts often feel less than or down.
But why is this? Why should looking at other’s lives cause us to question our own life AND then feel like we’re lacking?
It’s a complicated answer, but one aspect of it is that we lack confidence and self-esteem, at least in some parts of our life. So let’s start at the beginning. In order to feel confident, you must have a solid core. I like to compare this to weight lifting. In order for us to lift weights, or even get up and out of a chair, we need a solid core. We need to strengthen our mid section, our stomachs, sides and backs. Without this strength we will struggle to lift even the lightest of weights, let alone our entire body. Once we have a solid core, we can then move to bigger weights and more exercises, and enjoy a full range of activities.
It’s the same in psychology. Without a solid core, that is a knowledge of our values and also living them, we will struggle with stress, feeling less-than, always questioning ourselves. Our core vales are our driving force. Just like in the physical sense, the core strength is what allows you to propel yourself forward and back. The same is true for our psychological core strength. It’s what allows us to make decisions and be confident in them. 
The question I get at this point often is just what are core values? It’s a good question and one that most people probably haven’t thought about. When was the last time you were asked that? It certainly didn’t happen in school. Here’s a great definition from, of all places, the government:
“Core values are not descriptions of the work we do or the strategies we employ to accomplish our mission. The values underlie our work, how interact with each other, and which strategies we employ to fulfill our mission. The core values are the basic elements of how we go about our work.”
I would add, as this is specifically about work, that we can substitute the words life or relationship or things for the word work. 
So now that we have a working definition of what core values are, let’s look at some words that might fit into that. Here’s a list of words, not in order of importance and certainly only a partial list, that might be helpful in figuring out your specific core values:
Accountability
Assertiveness
Balance
Boldness
Calmness
Community
Compassion
Control
Cooperation
Creativity
Curiosity
Decisiveness
Diligence
Dynamism
Economy
Effectiveness
Empathy
Exploration
Expressiveness
Fairness
Faith
Family-orientedness
Growth
Happiness
Honor
Humility
Intellectual Status
Intuition
Joy
Love
Loyalty
Openness
Order
Originality
Professionalism
Prudence
Rigor
Sensitivity
Serenity
Service
Stability
Strategic
Temperance
Thankfulness
Truth-seeking
Understanding
This is a long list, but not exhaustive by any means. You are welcome to come up with your own words, to be sure.
Okay, now we know both what core values are and have some examples of words that describe them. The next step is pick yours. Try to pick 5 to 8 core values, ones that really resonate with you. Try to be honest about what’s important, rather than what you would like to have. Once you have your words they will become the foundation of your life. 
The last step is start living them. Let me explain by giving an example. A core value for me might be connection. If that’s the case, than in order for me to live the most authentic life I can, the decisions I make have to, at least in some part, stem from that word. So, if connection is a value and I choose to work in a field that is solitary, I will most likely not feel fulfilled or joyful (not to be confused with happy). It will probably not give me much meaning or purpose. However, if I choose to follow a career that is about connection, such as working as a therapist, I will most likely find that meaning and authenticity. 
To sum up what has been said, there are essentially four steps to finding and living an authentic life. The first is to understand what a core value is, the second is to list some words that represent core values, the third is to choose the ones that are truly yours, and lastly to make decisions and choices that follow from those values. 
I hope this helps to start to live the list you want!
 

Top 5 Foods for Mental Health
by Jeffrey Raich  |  Apr 8, 2015  |  Blog (all), Depression, Nutrition
Just what role does nutrition play in mental health? Why is it important? And what can we do to feel better by eating?
Let’s start by defining nutrition and diet. Nutrition is “the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food (e.g. protein, carbs, fat, etc.) in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism.” While diet is what we eat. 
With that said, what we want is to change our diet to allow for more nutrition. The reason this is so important is that nutrition is what helps us cope and deal with stress, anxiety, depression, and all that life hurls at us. What I mean by this is that if we eat a serving of meat, for example chicken, it is the nutrients that help us build serotonin, immunity, and the such that will combat colds, flus, and mental health issues. 
To that end, here are the 5 best foods to help with mental health:
Fish
In study after study, research has shown that those who consume omega-3 fatty acids are less likely to experience depression, and more likely to have heart health, as well as cognitive and affect benefits. One reason this is important is that our brains are made of mostly fat. We need to nourish them with healthy, positive sources and omega-3s are just such a source (we can’t manufacture omega-3s, so we need to get them from our foods).
Omega-3s have also been shown to fight off depression. In a study out of Norway, in the Journal of Affect Disorders, researchers showed that “those who regularly took cod liver oil, which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, were about 30% less likely to have symptoms of depression than those who did not. The longer the participants took cod liver oil, the less likely they were to have high levels of depression.” 
What can you do: You can eat more fish. But if your vegan or vegetarian, you pick up some chia seeds or walnuts and throw them on your morning meal. You can also find omega-3 oil and capsules or ail available at most stores. The goal is to get 2 to 4 grams a day.
Vegetables
We’ve all been told that we need to eat our veggies. I’m sure it was the bane of most people’s existence as kids. But research has shown that there are really good reasons why they help. Depression is often linked to inflammation. No doubt you’ve heard how inflammation affects our bodies, but did you know it affects our brains? One way to deal with inflammation, other than exercise, is through foods such as dark leafy greens like spinach, kale, broccoli, and collard greens. The chart above is taken from Dr. Weil and is his anti-inflammatory food pyramid (http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART02995/Dr-Weil-Anti-Inflammatory-Food-Pyramid.html) which suggests that the base of our diet should be mostly veggies with some fruit.
Further, in the journal Nutrition Journal, where research about the use of diet (vegetables to be specific) to treat inflammation was published, findings were shown that dietary treatment for inflammation, in this case for IBD (irritable bowl disease) are effective as supplements to other treatments. The link here is that diet alone won’t stop depression, but combined with exercise, sleep, and therapy, it can be a powerful aid. 
What can you do: When it’s meal time, throw some greens in your meal. Try to add a salad to lunch and dinner. If you’re having pasta, try to add some spinach to the sauce. Whatever you do, and however much you add, it’s better than none at all. Aim for a cup at each meal.
Whole grains
Everywhere we look it seems some box or another is putting how many grams of whole grains are in their product. While whole grains are great, they are best found in their natural form: brown rice, oats, whole wheat flour, etc, rather than in processed foods which generally have much added sugar. 
What’s great about whole grains, of which all get turned to sugar in our body, is that they’re packed with fiber which slows the absorption of that sugar into out blood stream. That’s important so we don’t have a spike of energy followed by a crash of energy and mood. It’s also important in fighting off diabetes as a sudden shock of sugar causes a sudden release of insulin. Over time, our bodies become less able to handle these events which eventually may lead to type II diabetes and inflammation. 
What can you do: Make sure most of your grains come from sources that aren’t prepared, such as oats for oatmeal, brown rice instead of Uncle Ben’s, etc. For the foods you do eat that are prepared such as bread and cereals, try to find ones’ that have few ingredients, sugar not listed as the first or second ingredient, and have large amounts of fiber (a 4:1 ratio of carbs to fiber).
Lean meats
Is meat good? Is it bad? And the controversy rages on. Wherever the final decision comes out, one thing is true: tryptophan is good and is needed. Lean meats, such as turkey, are a source of this protein. Most of us know this protein as what puts us to sleep on Thanksgiving. However, that’s not entirely true. Most of what puts us to sleep is overeating. But that’s for another post. 
What we’re concerned about here is what tryptophan does. And specifically what it does is allow for the creation of serotonin, the feel good chemical. Research has shown that those who suffer from depression have a lack of serotonin. This is why SSRI (selectrive serotonin re-uptake inhibitors) drugs work. They essentially reuse the serotonin that is spent. But they don’t make it; only tryptophan makes it. 
What you can do: Simply eat more lean meats. A few times a week is all that’s needed. Don’t worry if you’re vegetarian, there are options for you, too. Sources such as seaweed, spinach, and mushrooms also have this chemical available. 
Low-fat dairy
Again, the argument rages about whether or not dairy should be part of one’s diet. Whether that gets decided or not, what diary can provide is a source of vitamin D. Vitamin D, amongst other things such as helping with building of bones, is necessary to our lives. And what researchers have shown is that those who suffer from major depression generally have a lower amount of this vitamin than those who don’t suffer from depression. 
According to research of the Loyola School of Nursing, “Effective detection and treatment of inadequate vitamin D levels in persons with depression and other mental disorders may be an easy and cost-effective therapy which could improve patients’ long-term health outcomes as well as their quality of life.” While sun is the major source of vitamin D, there are others and low-fat dairy is one such source. 
What you can do: Get outside more. Of course in the winter, here in Minnesota, that’s not going to happen. So you can also find vitamin D in fish such as tuna and salmon, some mushrooms, as well as dietary supplements.
 

Mental illness IS a physical illness
by Jeffrey Raich  |  Mar 29, 2015  |  Anxiety, Depression, Mental HealthThis week a german airline pilot, Andreas Lubitz, apparently intentionally crashed the jet he was flying, killing himself and all 149 passengers on board. The world wide response has been one of grief and sadness, appropriately. Questions have been asked about how and why this happened. And leaders from around the world have called this the saddest day. They have also accused the pilot of being crazy. But what’s the implication of that. It seems that they are linking his depression with crazy. And if this is the case, that’s a problem for many reasons, not the least of which is it perpetuates the stigma of depression.
What is depression?
Perhaps it’s important to start with what depression is and isn’t before the term crazy gets bandied about. Depression is a disease, the same as cancer or diabetes, that affects the brain of a person which than causes issues with weight, thinking, sleep, and and decision making ability. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 350 million people world-wide suffer from depression, it is the leading cause of disability world wide, and is a major contributor to the global burden of disease. 
But just what is depression? Depression, according the the DSM-V, has the following symptoms, to name a few: depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day, Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day, psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day, fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day, symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning, and diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day.
Is this starting to sound like a physical disease?
So why is there such stigma associated with depression? Why is it that those suffering from depression (not to mention anxiety, eating disorders, and others) feel they have to keep it such a secret? Why is it that we still say it’s different than all other physical diseases?
In an article in the British Medical Journal, author Lewis Wolport writes about his own depression and the stigma of it. He writes:
Mental illnesses are perceived as different as they express themselves through those very characteristics that make us human – cognitive and affective and behavioural – and thus differ from physical illnesses5. Mental illness is thus seen as embodying the core of the person and not just affecting some organ like the heart or lungs. (http://bmb.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/1/221.full)
His article is personal, informative and well written. There is one slight change that needs to be made, however. And it is this: that it is different than psychical illnesses. While it is true that’s the perception, it is not true that’s what actually happens. 
To see this, all one has to do is look at the brain scan of a person who suffers from depression as compared to one of a person who does not. It is clear that there is a difference between the two. While a brain scan cannot diagnosis depression, or any other mental health issue, it can start to show how and where in the brain, a physical entity, there is an effect. 
A look at how depression is a physical issue Let’s say a person meets the clinical definition of depression (to be separated from sadness, grief, etc), how will this manifest itself physically? First, a person suffering from depression is more likely to lose interest in eating and thereby lose weight. The converse is also true, often people will gain weight as they eat more. Clearly this is a physical issue, one that can have grave consequences. Not only does this potentially lead to further depression, but too much weight gain leads to all sorts of issues including metabolic disease and too much weight lose leads to other issues such as too much stress on organs. 
There’s the lack of sleep that often comes while at the same time the person feels unmotivated to get out of bed. Again, we all know what happens when we are sedentary: we gain weight. 
Than there’s the stress of being depressed. When we’re depressed we feel alone, isolated, and scared. All of which puts out bodies into a stress state and causes the release of cortisol. This can be a problem that leads to other diseases such as Cushing’s Syndrome. The symptoms of Cushing’s are weight gain, easy bruising, edema, hypertension, diabetes, and menstrual disturbances, to name some. 
We could go on and talk about how depression affects every part of our body, how it may ultimately leads to death, and how it affects quality of life (if there’re any questions about this, Andrew Solomon wrote The Noonday Demon and most beautifully talks about his journey through depression), but suffice it to say, it there is clear evidence that depression is a physical illness. Perhaps what needs to be done, instead of perpetuating the stigma, is to accept that depression is experienced by many (19 million in America alone, by some estimates) and that the effects on quality of life affects many, many others such as family and loved ones and coworkers. 
Was Mr. Lubitz depressed and did it affect his decision to crash the plane he was flying? Only time will tell. What we need to remember, however, is that depression (as separated from Mr. Lubitz) is a disease of the body and it’s organs. It stems from the brain and affects every aspect of a person’s life, physically, emotionally, and mentally. As a result, if we choose to perpetuate the stigma of it, we will continue to have people who feel ostracized, isolated, and alone. They will continue to not seek medical attention from those trained in depression and it’s treatment, and they will continue to suffer needlessly.
