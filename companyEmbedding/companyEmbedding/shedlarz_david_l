NYSE:PFEUS7170811035 






NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer said today that after a 31-year career Vice Chairman David L.        Shedlarz will retire from the company at the end of this year.             Mr. Shedlarz’s contributions to the company        include helping to shape the strategic direction that drove Pfizer’s        growth to pharmaceutical industry leadership; fifteen years of service        on Pfizer’s senior management committee and        ten as its Chief Financial Officer; and leading the integration of the        Pharmacia acquisition as well as the successful sale of Pfizer Consumer        Healthcare.             Most recently, he has had responsibility for strategic planning and        business development and, in that role, he has put in place a new        organization so that Pfizer has the capabilities, talent and resources        necessary to capitalize on external business opportunities that        complement its internal product development and technologies. Among his        additional areas of responsibility are Pfizer Animal Health, which is        reporting strong revenue and income growth, and Pfizer Global        Manufacturing, which has achieved substantial cost savings and        productivity gains.       “Throughout his Pfizer career, David Shedlarz        has demonstrated integrity and an enduring commitment to our company and        its mission,” said Jeffrey B. Kindler,        Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Since I        became Chief Executive Officer a little over a year ago, David has been        a valuable partner to me as our new team has worked together to drive        fundamental changes in how Pfizer does business. David has our highest        respect for his dedication to Pfizer and the company’s        values, and I know I join with all my Pfizer colleagues in wishing him        well in his future endeavors,” he added.       “While the company I joined 31 years ago has        changed and grown in ways I never could have imagined, what hasn’t        changed is the quality and dedication of Pfizer people, and I am        exceptionally proud of our mission and what we do to enrich so many        lives,” said Mr. Shedlarz. “I        will cherish all of the people I’ve worked        with, the relationships we’ve forged and the        successes we’ve achieved.       “Jeff is a strong leader who has taken a        series of actions -- including tough decisions in all areas of the        company -- to revitalize Pfizer over the past year,”        Mr. Shedlarz continued. “He is taking the        right steps to change the structure of the company in a strategic,        disciplined way in order to position Pfizer for success in our changing        marketplace. I am confident that Jeff and the team, which now includes        the addition of our new Chief Financial Officer, Frank D’Amelio        -- who has demonstrated that he will be a strong and effective leader of        our financial function -- are well-positioned to address the company’s        challenges and capitalize on its many opportunities in the years ahead.        Pfizer is one of the world’s great companies,        and I am sure it will continue to be at the forefront of breakthroughs        that benefit millions of patients.”         Mr. Shedlarz joined Pfizer in 1976. He held positions of increasing        responsibility including vice president, finance of the U.S.        Pharmaceuticals Group in 1989 and vice president, finance for Pfizer in        1992. He was elected chief financial officer in 1995 and assumed        additional responsibilities as senior vice president in 1997 with        worldwide responsibility for the company’s        former Medical Technology Group. He was named executive vice president        in 1999. He became vice chairman of Pfizer in 2005.
