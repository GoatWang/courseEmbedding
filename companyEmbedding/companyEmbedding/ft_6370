        Good saw but found same mfg. flaw on two
I needed something to cut sheet metal with and borrowed a used & abused one. I tried the saw out cutting some parts out of 12GA & 3/16 and loved it. Just what I needed, an economical, dependable, comfortable tool for cutting sheet metal cleanly, no more grinding :) I ordered my own the next day, the box it came in was in perfect condition but I found that Milwaukee has a manufacturing flaw where the shoe assembly bracket is riveted & tack welded onto the shoe plate, as my new one was broken loose upon opening it. The borrowed one was as well but I figured it was due to abuse & just lined it up & welded it back in place. A simple adjustment needs to be made on Milwaukees machine for better welds, plus shipping me a new shoe assembly (since it's brand new).

        Time saver
I have been using my Metal Cutting saw for several years and cut 10 gauge panels like it was plywood. Just finished hose supports by ripping 6" Sch 40 pipe x 20 ft. in half. The blade was never replaced but perfect finish.

        SAVES TIME AND LESS MESS
I USE THIS SAW IN MY FABRICATION SHOP. IT IS A REAL TIMESAVER OVER USING A TORCH. MAKES A CLEAN COOL CUT, NO WARPING ON THINNER METALS. ONLY COMPLAIN IS THE SHOE MOUNT NEEDS ATTNTION. I WELDED MINE BACK ON. IT IS STAINLESS SO ITS NOT A FIX FOR EVERYONE.

        Great time saver
Occasionally need to cut up to 10GA mild steel electrical equipment panels/switchgear in shop or field. This saw is a 1000% improvement over the reciprocating or grinding type tools we have used in the past. Borrowed it one day and then ordered one for next day delivery 2 hours after we started using it. Such a dramatic improvement that listing cons would be petty.

        Milwaukee Metal -Cutting Saw
I' am a multicraft worker at work ,and I was really impress with the easy of using this saw .Almost as easy as using a saw for lumber but at slower travel speed. We use this saw to cut various flat metal ,sheet metal, C-purlin, cable tray, square tubing and cutting angles. But keep safety in mind smaller metal need to be clamp down to cut highly recommend ear plugs ,glasses and gloves. Maintain a firm grip should saw to get in a bind toward  the end of a cut. Iit has a heck of a kickback , just back it out of the cut and come in from the other side. A great tool

Located in the North Kentwood area of Westchester, this property does not compare. Not only does this 3 bedroom and 2 bath home sit on a huge lot but it is also bathed in sunlight, it offers an open floor plan and it boasts upgrades throughout. Take advantage of the large eat-in kitchen or the formal living room with its own fireplace or the covered patio perfect for Summer evenings. Recently updated this home provides the opportunity to move right in while leaving the option to expand later or just enjoy the amazing size of the yard. Updates include a remodeled kitchen, two bathrooms, lighting, windows, refinished floors, painting inside and out, landscaping and heat and A/C. This one is a gem.

Description:


  The paper rolls are guaranteed to work efficiently with your machine printhead to provide crisp, clear, black images. The reliability and performance of a thermal printer is directly related to the quality of the supplies, including the paper, used by the customer. The IBMŽ Testing Process is an "Industry Standard" test for the thermal papers used in the marketplace. To be IBMŽ approved, the paper must pass a 100km of paper printhead test without abrasion or build-up, with no cutting failures. IBM testing only confirms that the use of approved papers will not negatively affect the operating life of an IBM thermal printer. Manufactured to OEM specifications. Size: 2 1/4" x 80 ft; Paper Color(s): White; Rolls Per Unit: 12; Machine Compatibility: Medical and Laboratory Thermal Printers.

            The description of two metal cutting saws appear to be identical.

        Time saver
I have been using my Metal Cutting saw for several years and cut 10 gauge panels like it was plywood. Just finished hose supports by ripping 6" Sch 40 pipe x 20 ft. in half. The blade was never replaced but perfect finish.

        Great time saver
Occasionally need to cut up to 10GA mild steel electrical equipment panels/switchgear in shop or field. This saw is a 1000% improvement over the reciprocating or grinding type tools we have used in the past. Borrowed it one day and then ordered one for next day delivery 2 hours after we started using it. Such a dramatic improvement that listing cons would be petty.

        SAVES TIME AND LESS MESS
I USE THIS SAW IN MY FABRICATION SHOP. IT IS A REAL TIMESAVER OVER USING A TORCH. MAKES A CLEAN COOL CUT, NO WARPING ON THINNER METALS. ONLY COMPLAIN IS THE SHOE MOUNT NEEDS ATTNTION. I WELDED MINE BACK ON. IT IS STAINLESS SO ITS NOT A FIX FOR EVERYONE.

        Good saw but found same mfg. flaw on two
I needed something to cut sheet metal with and borrowed a used & abused one. I tried the saw out cutting some parts out of 12GA & 3/16 and loved it. Just what I needed, an economical, dependable, comfortable tool for cutting sheet metal cleanly, no more grinding :) I ordered my own the next day, the box it came in was in perfect condition but I found that Milwaukee has a manufacturing flaw where the shoe assembly bracket is riveted & tack welded onto the shoe plate, as my new one was broken loose upon opening it. The borrowed one was as well but I figured it was due to abuse & just lined it up & welded it back in place. A simple adjustment needs to be made on Milwaukees machine for better welds, plus shipping me a new shoe assembly (since it's brand new).

        Milwaukee Has Done it Again
For metal cuting you can not beat this saw. From sheet metal to heavier stock it cuts threw it like butter. Very easy to use and set up.
