History[edit]
DeVry Education Group was a successor to two separate entities: DeVry Institutes and the Keller-Taylor Corporation (d/b/a Keller Graduate School of Management). DeVry Technical Institute was acquired by the Bell & Howell company in 1966, and became part of its Education Group division. The school was renamed to DeVry Institute of Technology in 1968.[4] In 1984, the education division was renamed DeVry, Inc. ("Old DeVry"), and became publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange.
The Keller-Taylor Corporation was formed in 1973 by Dennis Keller and Ronald Taylor. Keller-Taylor was the holding company of CBA Institute in Chicago, which later became Keller Graduate School of Management. In 1987 Keller-Taylor acquired the DeVry Institutes from Bell & Howell and merged with Keller Graduate School of Management. The holding company's name changed to DeVry, Inc.
In 1991, DeVry became the first publicly traded education provider with an initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Today, its stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ATGE (NYSE: ATGE).[4]
In 1996 DeVry acquired Becker CPA Review, now Becker Professional Education. In 2002 DeVry Institute of Technology and Keller Graduate School of Management became DeVry University. The company diversified into healthcare in 2003 with the acquisition of Ross University and added Chamberlain College of Nursing (then Deaconess College of Nursing) in 2005.[4]
In 2007, DeVry expanded its reach into online education with the addition of Advanced Academics, an online secondary education that partners with schools and school districts across the United States. Carrington College, formerly known as Apollo College and Western Career College, joined DeVry in 2008. In 2009, DeVry acquired a majority stake in Fanor, now known as DeVry Brasil, a provider of post-secondary education with campuses located in northeastern Brazil. In June 2009, Standard and Poor's added Devry Inc. to its index of stocks, replacing newly-bankrupt General Motors.[4]
In 2011, DeVry continued its international reach with the acquisition of ATC International (a subsidiary of Becker Professional Education), which provides professional finance and accounting training in Central and Eastern Europe as well as Central Asia; and American University of the Caribbean, a medical school located in St. Maarten.[5]
In November 2013, DeVry Inc. was renamed to DeVry Education Group.[6]
Daniel Hamburger resigned in 2016 as CEO of DeVry with a payout of 5.3 million dollars. Eight-year board member, Lisa Wardell was appointed president and CEO of DeVry Education Group.[7] Wardell is the only female African-American CEO in the Fortune 1000.[8]
DeVry Education Group subsidiaries[edit]
DeVry subsidiaries include Advanced Academics, American University of the Caribbean, Becker Professional Education, ATC International, the Carrington Colleges Group, Chamberlain College of Nursing, DeVry Brasil, DeVry University and its Keller Graduate School of Management, Ross University School of Medicine and Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine.[9]
DeVry Brazil's enrollment in 2016 was 79,280 students. [10]
Lawsuits and controversies[edit]
The for-profit education industry has been the subject of hearings by the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Specifically with regard to DeVry Inc., the Committee[11] found that over half of the students who enrolled at DeVry in 2008-2009 withdrew by mid-2010.[12] DeVry spends more on marketing than on student instruction.[12] Approximately 80% of DeVry's revenue is Federal education funds.[12]
As of 2013[update], DeVry Inc. is under investigation by the Attorneys General of the states of Illinois and Massachusetts.[13][14]
A lawsuit has been filed against DeVry alleging deceptive recruiting practices in violation of federal law.[15]
In January 2016, The Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against DeVry Education Group alleging false or misleading advertising.[16][17] A class action lawsuit was also filed against DeVry Group in US District Court, Northern District of California claiming breaches of contract, good faith and fair dealing, violations of the California Unfair Trade Practices Act, the California False Advertising Act and the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and negligent misrepresentations. A confidential settlement was reached. [18]
In May 2016, a shareholder class action lawsuit was filed against DeVry Group, in the US District Court, Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs claimed that defendants made false or misleading statements regarding DeVry University’s graduate employment rate and the earnings of DeVry University graduates relative to the graduates of other universities and colleges. [19]
In June 2016, T’Lani Robinson and Robby Brown filed an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association, seeking relief for breach of contract, negligence, violation of the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, conversion, and unjust enrichment. [20]

History[edit]
DeVry Education Group was a successor to two separate entities: DeVry Institutes and the Keller-Taylor Corporation (d/b/a Keller Graduate School of Management). DeVry Technical Institute was acquired by the Bell & Howell company in 1966, and became part of its Education Group division. The school was renamed to DeVry Institute of Technology in 1968.[4] In 1984, the education division was renamed DeVry, Inc. ("Old DeVry"), and became publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange.
The Keller-Taylor Corporation was formed in 1973 by Dennis Keller and Ronald Taylor. Keller-Taylor was the holding company of CBA Institute in Chicago, which later became Keller Graduate School of Management. In 1987 Keller-Taylor acquired the DeVry Institutes from Bell & Howell and merged with Keller Graduate School of Management. The holding company's name changed to DeVry, Inc.
In 1991, DeVry became the first publicly traded education provider with an initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Today, its stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ATGE (NYSE: ATGE).[4]
In 1996 DeVry acquired Becker CPA Review, now Becker Professional Education. In 2002 DeVry Institute of Technology and Keller Graduate School of Management became DeVry University. The company diversified into healthcare in 2003 with the acquisition of Ross University and added Chamberlain College of Nursing (then Deaconess College of Nursing) in 2005.[4]
In 2007, DeVry expanded its reach into online education with the addition of Advanced Academics, an online secondary education that partners with schools and school districts across the United States. Carrington College, formerly known as Apollo College and Western Career College, joined DeVry in 2008. In 2009, DeVry acquired a majority stake in Fanor, now known as DeVry Brasil, a provider of post-secondary education with campuses located in northeastern Brazil. In June 2009, Standard and Poor's added Devry Inc. to its index of stocks, replacing newly-bankrupt General Motors.[4]
In 2011, DeVry continued its international reach with the acquisition of ATC International (a subsidiary of Becker Professional Education), which provides professional finance and accounting training in Central and Eastern Europe as well as Central Asia; and American University of the Caribbean, a medical school located in St. Maarten.[5]
In November 2013, DeVry Inc. was renamed to DeVry Education Group.[6]
Daniel Hamburger resigned in 2016 as CEO of DeVry with a payout of 5.3 million dollars. Eight-year board member, Lisa Wardell was appointed president and CEO of DeVry Education Group.[7] Wardell is the only female African-American CEO in the Fortune 1000.[8]
DeVry Education Group subsidiaries[edit]
DeVry subsidiaries include Advanced Academics, American University of the Caribbean, Becker Professional Education, ATC International, the Carrington Colleges Group, Chamberlain College of Nursing, DeVry Brasil, DeVry University and its Keller Graduate School of Management, Ross University School of Medicine and Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine.[9]
DeVry Brazil's enrollment in 2016 was 79,280 students. [10]
Lawsuits and controversies[edit]
The for-profit education industry has been the subject of hearings by the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Specifically with regard to DeVry Inc., the Committee[11] found that over half of the students who enrolled at DeVry in 2008-2009 withdrew by mid-2010.[12] DeVry spends more on marketing than on student instruction.[12] Approximately 80% of DeVry's revenue is Federal education funds.[12]
As of 2013[update], DeVry Inc. is under investigation by the Attorneys General of the states of Illinois and Massachusetts.[13][14]
A lawsuit has been filed against DeVry alleging deceptive recruiting practices in violation of federal law.[15]
In January 2016, The Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against DeVry Education Group alleging false or misleading advertising.[16][17] A class action lawsuit was also filed against DeVry Group in US District Court, Northern District of California claiming breaches of contract, good faith and fair dealing, violations of the California Unfair Trade Practices Act, the California False Advertising Act and the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and negligent misrepresentations. A confidential settlement was reached. [18]
In May 2016, a shareholder class action lawsuit was filed against DeVry Group, in the US District Court, Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs claimed that defendants made false or misleading statements regarding DeVry University’s graduate employment rate and the earnings of DeVry University graduates relative to the graduates of other universities and colleges. [19]
In June 2016, T’Lani Robinson and Robby Brown filed an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association, seeking relief for breach of contract, negligence, violation of the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, conversion, and unjust enrichment. [20]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
