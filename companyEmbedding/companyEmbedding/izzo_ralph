MOUNT LAUREL, N.J., May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Ralph Izzo, president, chairman and chief executive officer of Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), today called for a set of statewide regulatory reforms that would create financial incentives for utilities to help their customers reduce at-home energy use, as well as expand access to renewable energy and new energy-saving technologies. 
He also encouraged New Jersey utility regulators to consider longer-term approval of energy infrastructure projects, which would lead to additional job creation.








Izzo delivered his remarks at a state energy forum sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce Southern New Jersey.  
"Customers' demands are changing," Izzo said. "They want more reliability, they want more resilient power, they want cleaner energy and they want access to smart technology to better understand their energy usage – all while keeping bills affordable."
In order to meet these competing demands, utilities and the regulatory framework that governs them must adapt from a system that encourages utilities to sell as much energy as possible to a new system that provides incentives for the utility to promote greater energy efficiency, Izzo said. 
"Energy efficiency is the critical component that will drive the utility of the future," Izzo said. "The cheapest kilowatt remains the one that is not needed." 
"While New Jersey has set aggressive goals for renewables, we have only taken baby steps in the area of energy efficiency," he said.  
The universal reach of utilities, touching every home and business in their service territory,  means that investment in energy efficiency at the utility level would ensure all customers, at every income level, would reap the benefits of those programs. 
Similarly, utilities can help promote universal access to renewable energy sources, such as solar energy. PSEG has already spent more than $1 billion on solar projects in New Jersey and 13 other states.
"While the sun is free, we need to remember that converting it to energy is not," Izzo said. "We need to invest in renewables in a way that helps match those who pay for the attributes of renewables (all ratepayers and taxpayers) with those who reap the benefits of those investments." 
Izzo also discussed the role utilities can play in helping increase the speed of adoption and depth of penetration of new technology. 
"The utility, with its network and strong customer relations, can be the ultimate sales channel for new energy products and services," he said.  
Izzo also called for a new look at how New Jersey regulates the long-term modernization of gas and electric infrastructure. He said the state can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the long-term project-approval process without reducing regulatory oversight.
New Jersey's Board of Public Utilities typically approves infrastructure projects – such as PSE&G's programs to flood-proof electric substations or replace aging cast-iron gas mains – in three-year increments. A longer-term approval would allow utilities to plan their purchasing and hiring more efficiently and lead to creation of more jobs, Izzo said. 
As New Jersey strives to meet changing customer demands, Izzo warned that if New Jersey nuclear plants are allowed to close, the state will move backward in the areas of reliability, clean air and affordable electric bills. 
"If done right, the future of energy in New Jersey is one where we use less energy, the energy we use is cleaner and more reliable, and bills are affordable," Izzo said.
Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE:    PEG) is a publicly traded diversified energy company with annual revenues of $9.1 billion. Its operating subsidiaries are: Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), PSEG Power, and PSEG Long Island.

Reducing your customer’s need for your main product is not widely seen as a successful business strategy, to put it mildly.
For many years, the electric utility industry would have agreed with that assessment. Sell more electricity, the line of thinking went, and earn more money.
But there are signs that is changing. As new technologies emerge, consumers seek to be more economical and policymakers look to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, utilities are asking themselves: Can we actually sell less and earn more?















Ralph Izzo, Chairman and CEO of Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), an electric and gas utility holding company with over $32 billion in assets and 2.2 million electric customers in its New Jersey service territory, thinks so.
“I would like to see the utilities regulated in such a way that they are indifferent at least and encouraged at best to invest in energy efficiency,” Izzo told Utility Dive in an interview last week.
'We can expand the role of the utility'
The utility regulatory model that was constructed in early 1900s to provide customers with universal access to reliable and affordable electricity, the industry seems to agree, is out-of-date.
The future of the utility business lies in optimizing the use of electricity for every customer, Izzo said.
“Even I don’t wake up in the morning saying, ‘I can’t wait to use electricity and natural gas!’” he added. “But I do wake up in the morning and say, ‘I can’t wait to see Game 5 of the NHL Stanley Cup.’”
Instead of growing electric sales, utilities should focus on providing the “least-expensive-as-possible” electricity to “people using the minimum amount of electricity they need to use in order to live the lifestyle they want to live,” Izzo said. 

PSEG CEO: The way to get to least-expensive electricity is to use less of it.

As opposed to focusing only on rates, the PSEG chief indicated, “the way to get to least-expensive electricity may be to use less of it.”
In the near term, PSEG will introduce an energy efficiency request to regulators similar to past programs “that should allow us to do meaningful work for about 6-12 months,” he said.
But Izzo said he intends to use that time frame “to engage in a more robust conversation to talk about how we can expand the role of the utility and have an even more profound and meaningful role.”
'You have to talk about lost revenue'
Utilities would be “a very effective vehicle” for investing in greater energy efficiency, he suggested, because the utility’s hurdle rate – the minimum acceptable rate of return on investment – is far lower than the customer’s.
The returns on energy efficiency investments by consumers are “far higher than the returns that we would accept in our business,” Izzo explained, but “the imperfections in the marketplace impede the ability to get wide-scale deployment of energy efficiency out there.”

PSEG CEO: Utilities are best vehicle for energy efficiency investments because of low hurdle rate.

“What you need to do is replace the consumer with an interested investor – in this case, the utility,” he said. “Then, when energy service company X brings a project to us, we are more likely to say yes than when they bring it to the consumer.”
The wins for the environment and consumer are obvious, Izzo said, but regulators and policymakers “need to focus on making this a win for the investor community.”
“What you have to talk about is lost revenue,” Izzo told Utility Dive. “You want to create a situation whereby the reduction in cost exceeds our reduction in revenue, so that we can make up for some of the lost revenue streams we would have realized through the use of our wires.”
“If the customer uses 10% less electricity, their bill has to go down by something less than 10%,” he said, and the financial savings seen by the customer should vary depending on the cost of the technologies deployed to achieve those savings.
'We're not going to be gone tomorrow'
Regulators should enable utilities to own behind-the-meter assets and reward them for doing so, Izzo explained.
Utilities should not only be “indifferent to investing in smart thermostats, more efficient lighting systems, higher-efficiency boilers and air conditioners,” he added, but be “as motivated to do that as I would to build a Class H substation.”

PSEG CEO: Energy efficiency is huge opportunity for utilities to partner with new market entrants.

auto image + link
Izzo sees energy efficiency as a “huge opportunity” for utilities to partner with market entrants, but suggested that new players will face a “tough uphill climb” in getting “disinterested” customers to invest on their own.
New entrants can go it alone, Izzo said, but they “will automatically be awarded a level of trust and credibility” if they lean on the utility’s brand.
If the utility – which already has the prized relationship with the customer -- can show the customer the energy savings they might see and offer them solutions to achieve those savings, Izzo said, that “gives the customer a greater degree of confidence than someone knocking on the door and saying, ‘Boy, do I have a deal for you!’”
The customers “know that we’re not going to be gone tomorrow,” Izzo said. “We’ve been here for over a century and we’ll make our assessments based on good technical work and we’ll offer them something we can stand by.”
