Bruce A. Provo - Founder and President:

Mr. Provo has been involved in the management of real estate and other asset portfolios since 1979. Since he founded The Provo Group, Inc. (“TPG”) in 1985, Mr. Provo has been its President.  From 1982 to 1986, Mr. Provo also served as President and Chief Operating Officer of the North Kansas City Development Company ("NKCDC"), North Kansas City, Missouri. NKCDC was founded in 1903 and the assets of the company were sold in December 1985 for $102,500,000. NKCDC owned commercial and industrial properties, including an office park and a retail district, as well as apartment complexes, motels, recreational facilities, fast food restaurants, and other properties. NKCDC's holdings consisted of over 100 separate properties and constituted approximately 20% of the privately held real property in North Kansas City, Missouri (a four square mile municipality). Following the sale of the company's real estate, Mr. Provo served as the President, Chief Executive Officer and Liquidating Trustee of NKCDC from 1986 to 1991.


Since the founding of TPG in 1985, Mr. Provo has also founded various entities engaged in unique businesses but grouped under an informal umbrella known as The Provo Group of Companies.  These entities can be summarized as follows and links to applicable individual websites are provided:

Mr. Provo graduated from Miami University, Oxford, Ohio in 1972 with a B.S. in Accounting. He became a Certified Public Accountant in 1974 and was a manager in the banking and financial services division of Arthur Andersen LLP prior to joining Rubloff Development Corporation in 1979. From 1979 through 1985, Mr. Provo served as Vice President - Finance and then as President of Rubloff Development Corporation.
 
 

Corporate Philosophy - "A Perceptive Approach"
The Provo Group, Inc ("TPG") was founded in 1985 to provide an alternative for the sophisticated investor -- an alternative to the syndication fervor of the late 70's and early 80's.  Unlike syndicators and brokers, TPG is paid for performance, not promotion.
     

     TPG emphasizes client service, not brokerage and sales. Its staff is dedicated solely to creating value in your properties -- without the conflicts of interest inherent in other real estate organizations. 

     

Strategic Objective: To grow a company sought after by public and private investors to bring integrity to the management of their assets.
 
Core Values and Beliefs:
Awareness

We Listen.
The organization communicates vertically and horizontally to provide our clients with a knowledgeable "team".
We are independent of thought and spirit but never arrogant.
We believe in accountability not entitlement.
We are in business -- and business is positive cash flow.

 
Integrity

Our openness reflects our commitment to integrity.
We are committed to the "right" results.
We are respected for being shrewd and honest.
We are tough when required but always fair.
We are taken into our clients' confidences because we keep their confidences.
We will never hide a conflict of interest --even the potential for only an "appearance" of conflict.

 
Quality

We are confident that core values will win over expediency.
Our clients always deserve great service.
We create value.
We safeguard assets.
Nobody does it better.
We are proactive managers, never caretakers.
We participate in value creation by being at risk side by side with our clients and investors.

 
Civility

Our civility is rooted in our consideration for others.
We are self confident enough to take life as it comes and combat daily anxiety with humor and persistence.
We expect all employees to be self starters, professional, creative and honest. Nothing less.
We have a responsibility to create an organization that allows each employee the opportunity to be the best they can be.
We believe in the power of good families and strong relationships.
We want to enhance the quality of everyone's life who becomes associated with TPG.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and  Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding:   our expectations regarding financial condition or results of operations in future periods;   our future sources of, and needs for, liquidity and capital resources;   our expectations regarding economic and business conditions;   our business strategies and our ability to grow our business;   our ability to collect rents on our leases;   our ability to maintain relationships with our tenants;   future capital expenditures;   our ability to hire and retain key personnel and consultants; and   other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  Forward-looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false. The Partnership cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management's view only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Partnership, or persons acting on the Partnership's behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Management undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q include, without limitation, changes in general economic conditions, changes in real estate conditions, including without limitation, decreases in valuations of real properties, increases in property taxes and lack of buyers should  Table of Contents  the Partnership want to dispose of a property, lease-up risks, ability of tenants to fulfill their obligations to the Partnership under existing leases, sales levels of tenants whose leases include a percentage rent component, adverse changes to the restaurant market, entrance of competitors to the Partnership's lessees in markets in which the Properties are located, inability to obtain new tenants upon the expiration of existing leases, the potential need to fund tenant improvements or other capital expenditures out of operating cash flows, our inability to realize value for limited partners upon disposition of the Partnership's assets, such other factors as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year end December 31, 2014, and other reports we file with the SEC.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates, including investment impairment. These estimates are based on management's historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  The Partnership believes that its most significant accounting policies deal with:  Depreciation methods and lives- Depreciation of the Properties is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the buildings and improvements. While the Partnership believes these are the appropriate lives and methods, use of different lives and methods could result in different impacts on net income. Additionally, the value of real estate is typically based on market conditions and property performance, so depreciated book value of real estate may not reflect the market value of real estate assets.  Revenue recognition- Rental revenue from investment properties is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective lease when collectability is assured. Percentage rents are accrued only when the tenant has reached the sales breakpoint stipulated in the lease.  Impairment- The Partnership periodically reviews its long-lived assets, primarily real estate, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Partnership's review involves comparing current and future operating performance of the assets, the most significant of which is undiscounted operating cash flows, to the carrying value of the assets. Based on this analysis, if deemed necessary, a provision for possible loss is recognized.  Investment Properties  As of June 30, 2015, the Partnership owned the Properties, which are leased to eleven fully constructed fast-food restaurants. In addition, one property is located on a parcel of land that is subject to a ground lease. The eleven tenants are comprised of the following: nine Wendy's restaurants, an Applebee's restaurant, and a KFC restaurant. The Properties are located in a total of four states.  Property taxes, general maintenance, insurance and ground rent on the Properties are the responsibility of the tenant. However, when a tenant fails to make the required tax payments or when a property becomes  Table of Contents  vacant, the Partnership makes the appropriate property tax payments to avoid possible foreclosure of the property (such as the Des Moines, Iowa property, which formerly operated as Daytona's All Sports Cafe). In a property vacancy, the Partnership pays for insurance and maintenance related to the vacant property.  Such taxes, insurance and ground rent are accrued in the period in which the liability is incurred. The Partnership leases property to one restaurant which is located on a parcel of land where the Partnership holds a long-term ground lease, as lessee, which is set to expire in 2018. The Partnership has the option to extend the ground lease for two additional ten year periods. The Partnership owns all improvements constructed on the land (including the building and improvements) until the termination of the ground lease, at which time all constructed improvements will become the land owner's property. The tenant, KFC, is responsible for the $3,400 per month ground lease payment per the terms of its lease with the Partnership.  There were no building improvements capitalized during the three month period ending June 30, 2015.  Net Income  Net income for the three month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $127,075 and $93,337, respectively. Net income per limited partnership interest for the three month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $2.72 and $2.00, respectively. Net income for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $133,696 and $86,787, respectively. Net income per limited partnership interest for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $2.86 and $1.86, respectively.  The increase from the 2014 periods to the 2015 periods is due primarily to lower operating expenses in 2015 than 2014. Operating costs were higher during the 2014 periods primarily because of the default of the tenant Daytona's, which occupied the property in Des Moines, Iowa through May 31, 2014.  Net income for the three and six months periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 included the results from both operations and discontinued operations. Assets disposed of or deemed to be classified as held for sale require the reclassification of current and previous years' operations to discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP applicable to "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets". As such, prior year operating results for those properties considered as held for sale or properties no longer considered for sale have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation without effecting total net income. When properties are considered held for sale, depreciation of the properties is discontinued, and the properties are valued at the lower of the depreciated cost or fair value, less costs to dispose.  Results of Operations  Income from continuing operations for the three month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $127,000 and $119,507, respectively. Income from continuing operations for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $133,763 and $100,440, respectively. See the paragraphs below for further information as to the 2015 and 2014 variances of individual operating income and expense items.  Three month period ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the three month period ended June 30, 2014:  Operating Rental Income: Rental income for the three month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $309,142 and $294,599, respectively. The rental income was comprised primarily of monthly lease obligations and included adjustments for straight-line rent.  Table of Contents  General and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses for the three month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $87,862 and $83,433, respectively. General and administrative expenses were comprised of management expense, state/city registration and annual report filing fees, XBRL outsourced fees, office supplies, printing costs, outside storage expenses, copy/fax costs, postage and shipping expenses, long-distance telephone expenses, website fees, bank fees and state income tax expenses. The increase in the 2015 period versus the 2014 period is due primarily to an increase in management fees, printing costs due to the consent solicitation mailing and quarterly state income tax estimates paid.  Professional services: Professional services expenses for the three month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $55,005 and $53,210, respectively. Professional services expenses were primarily comprised of investor relations data processing, investor mailings processing, website design, legal, auditing and tax preparation fees, and SEC report conversion and processing fees. The increase in the 2015 period versus the 2014 period is due to higher investor relations expenses, filing fees, audit and tax return preparation fees, offset by lower legal fees.  Six month period ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the six month period ended June 30, 2014:  Operating Rental Income: Rental income for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $551,847 and $536,597, respectively. The rental income was comprised primarily of monthly lease obligations and includes accruals for annual percentage rents earned year-to-date.  Management expects total base operating rental income to be $949,354 for the year 2015 based on operating leases currently in place. In addition, future operating rental income may decrease with tenant defaults and/or the reclassification of properties as properties held for sale. Future operating rental income may also increase with additional rents due from tenants, if those tenants experience increased sales levels, which require the payment of additional rent to the Partnership. Operating percentage rents included in rental income from operations in 2014 was $500,747, and management expects the 2015 percentage rents to be higher than 2014 due to the increasing sales trends for the Wendy's restaurants in the Partnership's portfolio.  Insurance Expense: Insurance expense for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $2,931 and $2,995, respectively. The insurance expense was related to the Partnership's general liability policy. This amount could increase if the general liability insurance premium for the 2015/2016 insurance year that is expected to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2015 also increases.  General and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $177,568 and $200,598, respectively. General and administrative expenses were comprised of management expense, state/city registration and annual report filing fees, office supplies, printing costs, outside storage expenses, copy/fax costs, postage and shipping expenses, long-distance telephone expenses, website fees, bank fees, state income tax expenses and bad debt allowance. Management expects the total 2015 operating general and administrative expenses to be lower than 2014 expenses, primarily due to the 2014 increased state and local income tax expenses as a result of the 2013 condemnation sale.  Professional services: Professional services expenses for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $162,830 and $158,951, respectively. Professional services expenses were primarily comprised of investor relations data processing, investor mailings processing, website design, legal, auditing and tax preparation fees, and SEC report conversion and processing fees. Management anticipates that the total 2015 operating professional services expenses will be higher than 2014 due  Table of Contents  primarily to higher investor relations fees and the increased cost of the SEC mandated XBRL financial statement footnotes conversion and filing requirements for the Partnership. The filing rate for XBRL had been discounted for the first two years of the new requirements, and beginning in 2015 the discount was removed.  Cash Flow Analysis  Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $649,304 and $624,861, respectively.  Cash flows provided from investing activities for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $17,591 and $6,865, respectively. The amounts were comprised of the receipt of note receivable principal payments from the promissory note in relation to the 2009 sale of the Panda Buffet property, offset by the decrease in deferred rent relating to the revised terms of the Wendy's - Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina lease.  For the six month period ended June 30, 2015, cash flows used in financing activities was $1,150,535 and consisted of aggregate limited partner distributions of $1,150,000, which included $500,747 in percentage rent billings from 2014 and $489,558 in net sale proceeds from the December 2014 sale of the vacant Des Moines, IA property, $28,565 in promissory note principal payments received in relation to the 2009 sale of the Panda Buffet property, and general partner distributions of $535. For the six month period ended June 30, 2014, cash flows used in financing activities was $625,335 and consisted of aggregate limited partner distributions of $625,000, which included $470,478 in percentage rent billings from 2013 and, $17,839 in promissory note principal payments received in relation to the 2009 sale of the Panda Buffet property, and general partner distributions of $335. Distributions have been and will continue to be made in accordance with the Amended Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Partnership's cash balance was $220,891 at June 30, 2015. Cash of $120,000, including $16,159 received from promissory note principal and interest payments, is anticipated to be used to fund the anticipated distribution to our limited partners for the 2015 second quarter, which is expected to be made on August 15, 2015, and cash of $18,319 is anticipated to be used for the payment of quarter-end accrued liabilities, net of property tax cash escrow, which are included in the balance sheets. The remainder of the cash balance represents amounts deemed necessary to allow the Partnership to operate normally.  The Partnership's principal demands for funds are expected to be for the payment of operating expenses and distributions. Management anticipates that cash generated through the operations of the Properties and from potential sales of Properties will primarily provide the sources for future Partnership liquidity and limited partner distributions. During the process of leasing the Properties, the Partnership may experience competition from owners and managers of other properties. As a result, in connection with negotiating tenant leases, along with recognizing market conditions, the Partnership may offer rental concessions, or other inducements, which may have an adverse impact on the results of the Partnership's operations. The Partnership is also in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for its Properties. The two primary liquidity risks in the absence of mortgage debt are the Partnership's inability to collect rent receivables and near or chronic property vacancies. The amount of cash to be distributed to our limited partners is determined by the general partner and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for payment of distributions, capital expenditures, and taxable income recognition matching, which is primarily attributable to percentage rents and property sales.  Table of Contents  As of June 30, 2015, the current eleven operating Properties were 100 percent leased. In addition, the Partnership collected 100% of its base rent from current operating tenants for the period ended June 30, 2015 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, which we believe is a good indication of overall tenant quality and stability. There are no leases expiring in 2015.  Nine of the Partnership's eleven Properties operate as Wendy's fast food restaurants which are franchises of the international Wendy's Company. Operating base rents from the nine Wendy's leases comprised approximately 79% of the total 2015 operating base rents to-date. At December 31, 2014, additional 2014 percentage rents totaled $500,747, all of which were unbilled and accrued in relation to the Wendy's Properties. Therefore, during the fiscal year 2014, the Partnership generated approximately 85% of its total operating revenues from these nine Properties. Additionally, as of June 30, 2015, these nine Properties exceeded 75% of the Partnership's total Properties, both by asset value and number. One of the Wendy's leases is set to expire in November 2016, another seven are set to expire in November 2021, with a ninth lease set to expire in November 2026.  Since more than 75% of the Properties, both by historical asset value and number, are leased to Wendy's franchises, the financial status of the three tenants may be considered relevant to investors. At the request of the Partnership, Wendgusta, Wendcharles I and Wendcharles II provided the Partnership with a copy of their reviewed financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013. Those reviewed financial statements prepared by Wendgusta's, Wendcharles I's and Wendcharles II's accountants are attached as Exhibits 99.0, 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, to the Partnership's December 31, 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 30, 2015. The Partnership has no rights to audit or review Wendgusta's, Wendcharles I's or Wendcharles II's financial statements and the Partnership's independent registered public accounting firm has not audited or reviewed the financial statements received from Wendgusta, Wendcharles I or Wencharles II.  Disposition Policies  Management intends to hold the Properties until such time as a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve the Partnership's investment objectives or until it appears that such objectives will either currently not be met or not be met in the future. In deciding whether to sell Properties, management considers factors such as potential capital appreciation or depreciation, cash flow and federal income tax considerations, including possible adverse federal income tax consequences to the limited partners. The general partner may exercise its discretion as to whether and when to sell a Property, and there is no obligation to sell any of the Properties at any particular time, except upon Partnership termination on November 30, 2020 or if limited partners holding a majority of the limited partnership units vote to liquidate and dissolve the Partnership in response to a formal consent solicitation to liquidate the Partnership, with the next such vote not expected to occur until 2017.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT  This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of  Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding:   our expectations regarding financial condition or results of operations in future periods;   our future sources of, and needs for, liquidity and capital resources;   our expectations regarding economic and business conditions;   our business strategies and our ability to grow our business;   our ability to collect rents on our leases;   our ability to maintain relationships with our tenants;   future capital expenditures;   our ability to hire and retain key employees; and   other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in our filings with the SEC.  Forward-looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false. The Partnership cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management's view only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Partnership, or persons acting on the Partnership's behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Management undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q include, without limitation, changes in general economic conditions, changes in real estate conditions, including without limitation, decreases in valuations of real properties, increases in property taxes and lack of buyers should the Partnership want to dispose of a property, lease-up risks, ability of tenants to fulfill their obligations to the Partnership under existing leases, sales levels of tenants whose leases include a percentage rent component, adverse changes to the restaurant market, entrance of competitors to the Partnership's lessees  Table of Contents  in markets in which the Properties are located, inability to obtain new tenants upon the expiration of existing leases, the potential need to fund tenant improvements or other capital expenditures out of operating cash flows and, our inability to realize value for Limited Partners upon disposition of the Partnership's assets and such other factors as discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year end December 31, 2013.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates, including investment impairment. These estimates are based on management's historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  The Partnership believes that its most significant accounting policies deal with:  Depreciation methods and lives- Depreciation of the Properties is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the buildings and improvements. While the Partnership believes these are the appropriate lives and methods, use of different lives and methods could result in different impacts on net income. Additionally, the value of real estate is typically based on market conditions and property performance, so depreciated book value of real estate may not reflect the market value of real estate assets.  Revenue recognition- Rental revenue from investment properties is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective lease when collectability is assured. Percentage rents are accrued only when the tenant has reached the sales breakpoint stipulated in the lease.  Impairment-The Partnership periodically reviews its long-lived assets, primarily real estate, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Partnership's review involves comparing current and future operating performance of the assets, the most significant of which is undiscounted operating cash flows, to the carrying value of the assets. Based on this analysis, if deemed necessary, a provision for possible loss is recognized.  Investment Properties  As of March 31, 2014, the Partnership owned property leased to twelve fully constructed fast-food restaurants. In addition, one property is located on a parcel of land that is subject to a ground lease. The twelve tenants are composed of the following: nine Wendy's restaurants, an Applebee's restaurant, a KFC restaurant, and a Daytona's All Sports Cafe. The twelve Properties are located in a total of five states.  Property taxes, general maintenance, insurance and ground rent on the Properties are the responsibility of the tenant. However, when a tenant fails to make the required tax payments or when a property becomes vacant, the Partnership makes the appropriate property tax payments to avoid possible foreclosure of the property. In a property vacancy the Partnership pays for insurance and maintenance related to the vacant property.  Table of Contents  Such taxes, insurance and ground rent are accrued in the period in which the liability is incurred. The Partnership leases property to one restaurant which is located on a parcel of land where the Partnership holds a long-term ground lease, as lessee, which is set to expire in 2018. The Partnership has the option to extend the ground lease for two additional ten year periods. The Partnership owns all improvements constructed on the land (including the building and improvements) until the termination of the ground lease, at which time all constructed improvements will become the land owner's property. The tenant, KFC, is responsible for the $3,400 per month ground lease payment per the terms of its lease with the Partnership.  There were no building improvements capitalized during the three month period ending March 31, 2014.  Net Income  Net (loss) income for the three month periods ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were ($6,550) and $26,843, respectively. Net (loss) income per Limited Partnership Interest for the three month periods ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were ($0.14) and $0.57, respectively.  The decrease is due to the increase in state income taxes owed for the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of the sale of condemned land in South Carolina in August 2013. The sale resulted in $21,350 of South Carolina taxes due in 2014.  Results of Operations  (Loss) income from continuing operations for the three month periods ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 was ($6,550) and $26,843, respectively.  Three month period ended March 31, 2014 as compared to the three month period ended March 31, 2013:  Operating Rental Income: Rental income for the three month periods ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 was $258,648 and $256,205, respectively. The rental income was comprised primarily of monthly lease obligations and included adjustments for straight-line rent.  General and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses for the three month periods ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were $49,491 and $22,661, respectively. General and administrative expenses were comprised of management expense, state/city registration and annual report filing fees, XBRL outsourced fees, office supplies, printing costs, outside storage expenses, copy/fax costs, postage and shipping expenses, long-distance telephone expenses, website fees, bank fees and state income tax expenses. The increase is due primarily to an increase in state income taxes owed for 2013, largely a result of the gain on the sale of condemned land in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina in August of 2013.  Professional services: Professional services expenses for the three month periods ended March 31, 014 and 2013 were $105,741 and $98,641, respectively. Professional services expenses were primarily comprised of investor relations data processing, investor mailings processing, website design, legal, auditing and tax preparation fees, and SEC report conversion and processing fees. The increase is due to higher audit and tax return preparation fees, as well as higher legal fees related to isolated investor and tenant matters.  Table of Contents  Cash Flow Analysis  Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the three month periods ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were $590,910 and $617,108, respectively. The variance in cash provided by operating activities from 2013 to 2014 is primarily due to lower net income as a result of higher state income taxes.  Cash flows provided from investing activities for the three month periods ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were $3,352 and $8,223, respectively. The 2014 and 2013 amounts were comprised of the receipt of note receivable principal payments from the Buyer's Note in relation to the 2009 sale of the Panda Buffet property, and the decrease in deferred rent relating to the revised terms of the Wendy's - Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina lease . The 2014 amount is lower because of the amortization of the deferred rent proceeds related to the Wendy's-Mt. Pleasant transaction.  For the three month period ended March 31, 2014, cash flows used in financing activities was $100,000 and consisted of aggregate Limited Partner distributions, which included $8,839 in Buyer's Note principal payments received in relation to the 2009 sale of the Panda Buffet property. For the three month period ended March 31, 2013, cash flows used in financing activities was $550,107 and consisted of aggregate Limited Partner distributions of $550,000, which included $292,747 in net sale proceeds from the October 2012 sale of the vacant Phoenix, AZ property and, $37,588 in Buyer's Note principal payments received in relation to the 2009 sale of the Panda Buffet property, and General Partner distributions of $107. Distributions have been and will continue to be made in accordance with the Partnership Agreement.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Partnership's cash balance was $738,581 at March 31, 2014. Cash of $525,000, including $11,749 in Buyer's Note principal and interest payments and $470,478 of 2013 percentage rents received, is anticipated to be used to fund the anticipated 2014 first quarter aggregate distribution to Limited Partners on May 15, 2014, and cash of approximately $138,718 is anticipated to be used for the payment of quarter-end accrued liabilities, net of property tax cash escrow, which are included in the balance sheets. The remainder represents amounts deemed necessary to allow the Partnership to operate normally.  The Partnership's principal demands for funds are expected to be for the payment of operating expenses and distributions. Management anticipates that cash generated through the operations of the Properties and sales of Properties will primarily provide the sources for future Partnership liquidity and Limited Partner distributions. During the process of leasing the Properties, the Partnership may experience competition from owners and managers of other properties. As a result, in connection with negotiating tenant leases, along with recognizing market conditions, the Partnership may offer rental concessions, or other inducements, which may have an adverse impact on the results of the Partnership's operations. The Partnership is also in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for its Properties. The two primary liquidity risks in the absence of mortgage debt are the Partnership's inability to collect rent receivables and near or chronic property vacancies. The amount of cash to be distributed to our Limited Partners is determined by the General Partner and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for payment of distributions, capital expenditures, and taxable income recognition matching, which is primarily attributable to percentage rents and property sales.  As of March 31, 2014, the current twelve operating Properties were leased 100 percent. In addition, the Partnership collected 95% and 100% of its base rent from current operating tenants for the period ended March 31, 2014 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, respectively, which we believe is a good indication of overall tenant quality and stability. There are two leases set to expire in 2014. Daytona's lease expires May 31, 2014 and management does not expect to renew their lease. Applebee's lease expires October 31, 2014, and management expects them to exercise their next two year option.  Table of Contents  Nine of the Partnership's twelve Properties operate as Wendy's fast food restaurants and are franchises of the international Wendy's Company. Operating base rents from the nine Wendy's leases comprised approximately 73% of the total 2014 operating base rents to-date. At December 31, 2013, additional 2013 percentage rents totaled $470,478, all of which were unbilled and accrued in relation to the Wendy's Properties. Therefore, during the fiscal year 2013, the Partnership generated approximately 83% of its total operating revenues from these nine Properties. Additionally, as of March 31, 2014, these nine Properties exceeded 75% of the Partnership's total Properties, both by asset value and number. One of the Wendy's leases is set to expire in November 2016, another seven are set to expire in November 2021, with a ninth lease set to expire in November 2026.  Since more than 75% of the Properties, both by historical asset value and number, are leased to Wendy's franchises, the financial status of the three tenants may be considered relevant to investors. At the request of the Partnership, Wendgusta, Wendcharles I and Wendcharles II provided the Partnership with a copy of their reviewed financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2013 and December 30, 2012. Those reviewed financial statements prepared by Wendgusta's, Wendcharles I's and Wendcharles II's accountants are attached as Exhibits 99.0, 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, to the Partnership's December 31, 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 28, 2014. The Partnership has no rights to audit or review Wendgusta's, Wendcharles I's or Wendcharles II's financial statements and the Partnership's independent registered public accounting firm has not audited or reviewed the financial statements received from Wendgusta, Wendcharles I or Wencharles II.  Disposition Policies  Management intends to hold the Properties until such time as a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve the Partnership's investment objectives or until it appears that such objectives will either currently not be met or not be met in the future. In deciding whether to sell Properties, management considers factors such as potential capital appreciation or depreciation, cash flow and federal income tax considerations, including possible adverse federal income tax consequences to the Limited Partners. The General Partner may exercise its discretion as to whether and when to sell a Property, and there is no obligation to sell any of the Properties at any particular time, except upon Partnership termination on November 30, 2020 or if Limited Partners holding a majority of the units vote to liquidate and dissolve the Partnership in response to a formal consent solicitation to liquidate the Partnership.

	DIVALL INSURED INCOME PROPERTIES 2 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP






	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	These unaudited interim condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with DiVall Insured Income Properties 2 Limited Partnerships (the
	Partnership) 2014 annual audited financial statements within its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on March 30, 2015.


	These unaudited interim condensed financial statements and notes have been prepared on the same basis as the Partnerships annual audited financial
	statements and include all normal and recurring adjustments, which are in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the Partnerships financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the interim
	periods presented. The results of operations for the six month period ended June 30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015, for any other interim period, or for any
	other future year.



	1.

	ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:




	The Partnership was formed on November 20, 1987, pursuant to the Uniform Limited Partnership Act of the State of Wisconsin. The initial
	capital, contributed during 1987, consisted of $300, representing aggregate capital contributions of $200 by the former general partners and $100 by the initial limited partner.


	The Partnership is currently engaged in the business of owning and operating its investment portfolio of commercial real estate properties (collectively, the
	Properties). The Properties are leased on a triple net basis primarily to, and operated by, franchisors or franchisees of national, regional, and local retail chains under primarily long-term leases. The lessees are operators of fast
	food, family style, and casual/theme restaurants. As of June 30, 2015, the Partnership owned eleven Properties, which are located in a total of four states.


	The Partnership will be dissolved on November 30, 2020, or earlier upon the prior occurrence of any of the following events: (a) the disposition of
	all its Properties; (b) the written determination by the Provo Group, Inc., the general partner of the Partnership (the General Partner), that the Partnerships assets may constitute plan assets for purposes of
	ERISA; (c) the agreement of limited partners owning a majority of the outstanding limited partnership interests to dissolve the Partnership; or (d) the dissolution, bankruptcy, death, withdrawal, or incapacity of the last remaining general
	partner, unless an additional general partner is elected by a majority of the limited partners. During the second and third quarters of the six odd numbered years 2001 to 2013, consent solicitations were circulated to the Partnerships limited
	partners (each being a Consent). If approved, any of the Consents would have authorized the sale of all of the Properties and the dissolution of the Partnership. Limited partners owning a majority of the limited partnership interests did
	not vote in favor of any of the Consents. Again, on or about June 16, 2015, a consent solicitation was circulated to the Partnerships limited partners (the 2015 Consent), which if approved would have authorized the sale of all
	of the Properties and the dissolution of the Partnership. Limited partners holding more than a majority of the outstanding limited partnership units did not vote in favor of the 2015 Consent, and therefore the Partnership will continue to operate as
	a going concern.

	Significant Accounting Policies




	Rental revenue from the Properties is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective lease. Percentage rents are only accrued when the
	tenant has reached the sales breakpoint stipulated in the lease.


	Rents and other receivables are comprised of billed but uncollected amounts due for
	monthly rents and other charges, and amounts due for scheduled rent increases for which rentals have been earned and will be collected in the future under the terms of the leases. Receivables are recorded at managements estimate of the amounts
	that will be collected.


	Based on an analysis of specific accounts and historical experience, as of June 30, 2015, and December 31, 2014, there
	were $25,483 of recorded values for allowance for doubtful accounts. The entire allowance is aged over 90 days old as of June 30, 2015.


	The
	Partnership considers its operations to be in only one segment, the operation of a portfolio of commercial real estate leased on a triple net basis, and therefore no segment disclosure is made.


	Depreciation of the Properties are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements.


	Deferred charges represent leasing commissions paid when the Properties are leased and upon the negotiated extension of a lease. Leasing commissions are
	capitalized and amortized over the term of the lease. As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, accumulated amortization amounted to $144,994 and $136,963, respectively.


	Deferred tenant award proceeds escrow represents the portion of the award proceeds from the sale of the portion of the Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina property
	that will be paid to the tenant ratably over 99 months beginning August 1, 2013.


	The Partnership generally maintains cash in federally insured
	accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Partnership has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk.


	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Partnership to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash investments and leases.
	Additionally, as of June 30, 2015, nine of the eleven Properties are leased to three significant tenants, Wendgusta, LLC (Wendgusta), Wendcharles I, LLC (Wendcharles I) and Wendcharles II, LLC (Wendcharles
	II), all three of whom are Wendys restaurant franchisees. The property leases for these three tenants comprised approximately 56%, 15% and 8%, respectively, of the Partnerships total operating base rents reflected as of
	June 30, 2015.


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	(GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities (and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities) at the date of the financial statements and the reported
	amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	Assets disposed of or deemed to be
	classified as held for sale require the reclassification of current and previous years operations to discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP applicable to Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. As
	such, prior year operating results


	 


	8






	Table of Contents



	for those properties considered as held for sale or properties no longer considered for sale have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation without affecting total income.
	When properties are considered held for sale, depreciation of the properties is discontinued, and the properties are valued at the lower of the depreciated cost or fair value, less costs to dispose. If circumstances arise that were previously
	considered unlikely, and, as a result, the property previously classified as held for sale is no longer to be sold, the property is reclassified as held and used. Such property is measured at the lower of its carrying amount (adjusted for any
	depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used) or fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.


	Assets are classified as held for sale, generally, when all criteria within GAAP applicable to Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived
	Assets have been met.


	The Partnership periodically reviews its long-lived assets, primarily real estate, for impairment whenever events or changes
	in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Partnerships review involves comparing current and future operating performance of the assets, the most significant of which is undiscounted
	operating cash flows, to the carrying value of the assets. Based on this analysis, a provision for possible loss is recognized, if any. There were no adjustments to carrying values for the three or six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and
	2014.


	The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance on Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure defines fair value,
	establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value.
	The adoption of the provisions of this FASB issuance, with respect to nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, including (but not limited to) the valuation of reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill
	impairment and the valuation of property and equipment when assessing long-lived asset impairment, did not have a material impact on how the Partnership estimated its fair value measurements but did result in increased disclosures about fair value
	measurements in the Partnerships financial statements as of and for the six month period ended June 30, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 12 for further disclosure.


	GAAP applicable to disclosure about fair value of financial instruments requires entities to disclose the fair value of all financial assets and liabilities
	for which it is practicable to estimate. Fair value is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The General Partner believes that
	the carrying value of the Partnerships assets (exclusive of the Properties) and liabilities approximate fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments.


	No provision for federal income taxes has been made, as any liability for such taxes would be that of the individual partners rather than of the Partnership.


	The Partnership is not subject to federal income tax because its income and losses are includable in the tax returns of its partners, but may be subject
	to certain state taxes. FASB has provided guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, disclosed and presented in the financial statements. This requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
	the course of preparing the entitys tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained when challenged or when examined by the applicable taxing authority. Management has determined that there were
	no material uncertain income tax positions. Tax returns filed by the Partnership generally are subject to examination by U.S. and state taxing authorities for the years ended after December 31, 2011.

	2.

	REGULATORY INVESTIGATION:




	A preliminary investigation during 1992 by the Office of Commissioner of Securities for the State of Wisconsin and the SEC (the
	Investigation) revealed that during at least the four years ended December 31, 1992, the former general partners of the Partnership, Gary J. DiVall (DiVall) and Paul E. Magnuson (Magnuson), had transferred
	substantial cash assets of the Partnership and two affiliated publicly registered limited partnerships, DiVall Insured Income Fund Limited Partnership (DiVall 1), which was dissolved December of 1998, and DiVall Income Properties 3
	Limited Partnership (DiVall 3), which was dissolved December of 2003, (collectively, the three original partnerships) to various other entities previously sponsored by or otherwise affiliated with DiVall and Magnuson. The
	unauthorized transfers were in violation of the respective partnership agreements and resulted, in part, from material weaknesses in the internal control systems of the three original partnerships.


	Subsequent to discovery, and in response to the regulatory inquiries, The Provo Group, Inc. (TPG or the General Partner) was appointed
	Permanent Manager (effective February 8, 1993) to assume responsibility for daily operations and assets of the three original partnerships as well as to develop and execute a plan of restoration for the three original partnerships. Effective
	May 26, 1993, the limited partners of the Partnership, by written consent of a majority of limited partnership interests, elected TPG as general partner of the Partnership. TPG terminated the former general partners by accepting their tendered
	resignations.


	In 1993, the General Partner estimated an aggregate recovery of $3,000,000 for the three original partnerships. At that time, an allowance
	was established against amounts due from former general partners and their affiliates reflecting the estimated $3,000,000 receivable. This net receivable was allocated among the three original partnerships based on their pro rata share of the total
	misappropriation, and restoration costs and recoveries have been allocated based on the same percentage. Through June 30, 2015, approximately $5,918,000 of recoveries have been received which exceeded the original estimate of $3,000,000. As a
	result, from January 1, 1996 through June 30, 2015, the Partnership has recognized a total of approximately $1,229,000 as recovery of amounts previously written off in the statements of income, which represents its share of the excess
	recovery. The General Partner continues to pursue recoveries of the misappropriated funds; however, no further significant recoveries are anticipated.



	3.

	INVESTMENT PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES HELD FOR SALE:




	The total cost of the Properties includes the original purchase price plus acquisition fees and other capitalized costs paid to an affiliate
	of the former general partners of the Partnership.


	As of June 30, 2015, the Properties were leased to the operators of eleven fully constructed
	fast-food restaurants. The tenants are comprised of the following: nine Wendys restaurants, an Applebees restaurant, and a KFC restaurant. The eleven properties are located in a total of four states.

	Daytonas lease expired May 31, 2014 and the tenant vacated the premises on or about the same date. On January 24, 2014, the Partnership sent
	Daytonas a 30-day Notice of Default for failure to pay its January rent. On February 3, 2014, the Partnership received payment for a portion of Daytonas January rent and real estate tax escrow payment. The 30-day Notice of Default
	expired on February 23, 2014. As of December 31, 2014 Daytonas has not made its monthly rent or real estate tax escrow payments for

	February, March, April or May 2014. On May 29, 2014, the Partnership filed a motion for default judgment, to which the tenant filed an answer denying all claims made against it. On
	July 10, 2014, the Partnership filed for summary judgment against the tenant for all amounts owing and as of June 30, 2015, is still pursuing collection against the tenant.


	On September 12, 2014, the Partnership signed a purchase agreement with Sundance, Inc., for the sale of the property at a sale price of $555,000. The
	Partnership completed the sale of the property on December 22, 2014 with net proceeds of approximately $490,000 paid to the Partnership.



	Discontinued Operations



	During the three month periods
	ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, the Partnership recognized income (loss) from discontinued operations of $75 and ($26,170), respectively. During the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, the Partnership recognized loss from
	discontinued operations of $67 and $13,653, respectively. The income and loss is made up of revenues earned from the tenant Daytonas during their occupancy through May 31, 2014, and the costs to maintain the vacant Des Moines, Iowa
	property while it is held for sale and since the tenant vacated. These costs include utilities, property insurance and real estate taxes.


	The components
	of discontinued operations included in the condensed statement of income (loss) for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 are outlined below:

	4. PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT:




	The Amended Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (as amended, supplemented or modified, the Partnership
	Agreement) extends the term of the Partnership to November 30, 2020, or until dissolution prior thereto pursuant to the consent of the majority of the outstanding limited partnership interests.


	 


	11






	Table of Contents



	On May 26, 1993, pursuant to the results of a solicitation of written consents from the limited partners,
	the Partnership Agreement was amended to replace the former general partners and amend various sections of the Partnership Agreement. The former general partners were replaced by TPG. Under the terms of the amendment, net profits or losses from
	operations are allocated 99% to the limited partners and 1% to the General Partner. Additionally, the total compensation paid to all persons for the sale of the investment properties is limited to commissions customarily charged by other brokers in
	arms-length sales transactions involving comparable properties in the same geographic area, not to exceed six percent of the contract price for the sale of the property. The General Partner may receive up to one-half of the competitive real
	estate commission, not to exceed three percent, provided that the General Partner provides a substantial amount of services, as defined by the General Partner, in the sales effort. It is further provided that a portion of the amount of such fees
	payable to the General Partner is subordinated to its success in recovering the funds misappropriated by the former general partners. See Note 6 for further information.


	The Partnership Agreement provides that (i) the Distribution Quarter is defined as the calendar quarter, and (ii) the distribution
	provisions are subordinate to the General Partners share of distributions from net cash receipts and net proceeds to the extent necessary for the General Partner to pay its federal and state income taxes on Partnership income allocated to the
	General Partner. Because these amendments do not adversely affect the rights of the limited partners, pursuant to section 10.2 of the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner can modify these provisions without a vote of the limited partners.



	5.

	LEASES:




	Original lease terms for the majority of the Properties are generally five to twenty years from their inception. The leases generally
	provide for minimum rents and additional rents based upon percentages of gross sales in excess of specified breakpoints. The lessee is responsible for occupancy costs such as maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, and utilities. Accordingly,
	these amounts are not reflected in the statements of income except in circumstances where, in managements opinion, the Partnership will be required to pay such costs to preserve its assets (i.e., payment of past-due real estate taxes).
	Management has determined that the leases are properly classified as operating leases, therefore, rental income is reported when earned on a straight-line basis and the cost of the property, excluding the cost of the land, is depreciated over its
	estimated useful life.


	As of June 30, 2015, the aggregate minimum operating lease payments (including the aggregate total of the first two quarters
	of 2015 collected revenues of $485,410) to be received under the current operating leases for the Properties are as follows:

	At June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, rents and other receivables included $66,437 and $500,746,
	respectively, of unbilled percentage rents. As of June 30, 2015, all of the 2014 percentage rents had been billed and collected.




	6. TRANSACTIONS WITH GENERAL PARTNER AND ITS AFFILIATES:




	Pursuant to the terms of the Permanent Manager Agreement (the PMA) executed in 1993 and as currently in effect as of
	January 1, 2015, the General Partner receives a base fee (the Base Fee) for managing the Partnership equal to four percent of gross receipts, subject to an initial annual minimum amount of $159,000. The PMA also provides that the
	Partnership is responsible for reimbursement of the General Partner for office rent and related office overhead (Expenses) up to an initial annual maximum of $13,250. Both the Base Fee and reimbursement of Expenses are subject to annual
	Consumer Price Index based adjustments. Effective March 1, 2015, the minimum annual Base Fee and the maximum reimbursement of Expenses increased by 1.62% from the prior year, which represents the allowable annual Consumer Price Index adjustment
	per the PMA. Therefore, as of March 1, 2015, the minimum annual Base Fee paid by the Partnership was raised to $266,976 and the maximum annual reimbursement of Expenses was increased to $21,540.


	For purposes of computing the four percent overall fee paid to the General Partner, gross receipts include amounts recovered in connection with the
	misappropriation of assets by the former general partners and their affiliates. To date, the General Partner has received fees from the Partnership totaling $59,729 on the amounts recovered. The fee received from the Partnership on the amounts
	recovered reduces the minimum monthly Base Fee by that same amount.


	Amounts paid and/or accrued to the General Partner and its affiliates for the three
	and six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:

	8. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES:




	According to the Partnership Agreement, the general partner of the Partnership may receive a disposition fee not to exceed three percent of
	the contract price on the sale of the three original partnerships properties (See Note 2 for further information as to the three original partnerships). In addition, fifty percent of all such disposition fees earned by the general partner
	were to be escrowed until the aggregate amount of recovery of the funds misappropriated from the three original partnerships by the former general partners was greater than $4,500,000. Upon reaching such recovery level, full disposition fees
	would thereafter be payable and fifty percent of the previously escrowed amounts would be paid to TPG. At such time as the recovery exceeded $6,000,000 in the aggregate, the remaining escrowed disposition fees were to be paid to TPG. If
	such levels of recovery were not achieved, TPG would contribute the amounts escrowed toward the recovery until the three original partnerships were made whole. In lieu of a disposition fee escrow, the fifty percent of all such disposition fees
	previously discussed were paid directly to a restoration account and then distributed among the three original partnerships; whereby the three original partnerships recorded the recoveries as income (Note 2). After the recovery level of
	$4,500,000 was exceeded, fifty percent of the total disposition fee amount paid to the three original partnerships recovery through the restoration account (in lieu of the disposition fee escrow) was refunded to TPG during March 1996. The
	remaining fifty percent amount allocated to the Partnership through the restoration account, and which was previously reflected as Partnership recovery income, may be owed to TPG if the $6,000,000 recovery level is met. As of June 30,
	2015, the Partnership may owe TPG $16,296 if the $6,000,000 recovery level is achieved. TPG does not expect any future payment, as it is uncertain that such a $6,000,000 recovery level will be achieved.

	9. PMA INDEMNIFICATION TRUST:




	The PMA provides that TPG will be indemnified from any claims or expenses arising out of or relating to TPG serving in such capacity or as
	substitute general partner, so long as such claims do not arise from fraudulent or criminal misconduct by TPG. The PMA provides that the Partnership will fund this indemnification obligation by establishing a reserve of up to $250,000 of Partnership
	assets which would not be subject to the claims of the Partnerships creditors. An Indemnification Trust (the Trust) serving such purposes has been established at United Missouri Bank, N.A. The corpus of the Trust has been fully
	funded with Partnership assets. Funds are invested in U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, $203,024 of earnings has been credited to the Trust as of June 30, 2015. The rights of TPG to the Trust shall be terminated upon the earliest to occur
	of the following events: (i) the written release by TPG of any and all interest in the Trust; (ii) the expiration of the longest statute of limitations relating to a potential claim which might be brought against TPG and which is subject
	to indemnification; or (iii) a determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that TPG shall have no liability to any person with respect to a claim which is subject to indemnification under the PMA. At such time as the indemnity provisions
	expire or the full indemnity is paid, any funds remaining in the Trust will revert back to the general funds of the Partnership.




	10. FORMER GENERAL PARTNERS CAPITAL ACCOUNTS:




	The capital account balance of the former general partners of the Partnership as of May 26, 1993, the date of their removal as general
	partners pursuant to the results of a solicitation of written consents from the limited partners, was a deficit of $840,229. At December 31, 1993, the former general partners deficit capital account balance in the amount of $840,229 was
	reallocated to the limited partners.




	11. NOTE RECEIVABLE:




	A sales contract was executed on September 30, 2009 for the installment sale of the Partnerships Panda Buffet property to the
	tenant for $520,000 (sales amount was to be reduced to $450,000 if closing occurred on or before November 15, 2009). The closing date on the sale of the property was November 12, 2009 at a sales price of $450,000. The buyer paid $150,000
	at closing with the remaining balance of $300,000 being delivered in the form of a promissory note (the Buyers Note) to the Partnership. The Buyers Note had a term of three years, an interest rate of 7.25%, and principal and interest
	payments paid monthly and principal amortized over a period of ten years beginning December 1, 2009 with a balloon payment due November 1, 2012. The Partnership amended the Buyers Note in the amount of $232,777, to $200,000 after a
	principal payment of $32,777 was received on October 19, 2012 under the following extended terms: The principal balance of $200,000 will be amortized over five years at an interest rate of 7.25% per annum with a full balloon payment of
	$133,396 due November 1, 2014. Pursuant to the Buyers Note, there is no penalty for early payment of principal. The Buyers Note also requires the buyer to escrow property taxes with the Partnership which, as of January 1, 2013, was $925
	per month.


	Effective November 1, 2014, the Partnership agreed to another two year extension of the Buyers Note as follows: Buyer will make a
	principal payment of $13,396 which reduces the principal balance to $120,000 as of November 1, 2014, and the balance will be amortized over two years with a monthly payment of approximately $5,386 per month. By its terms, the loan will be fully
	paid off by October 31, 2016.

	Table of Contents



	The property tax escrow cash balance held by the Partnership amounted to $7,155 at June 30, 2015, and is
	included in the property tax payable in the condensed balance sheets. Per the Buyers Note amortization schedule, the monthly payments are to total approximately $5,386 per month. The amortized principal payments yet to be received under the Buyers
	Note amounted to $86,773 as of June 30, 2015 and $115,339 as of December 31, 2014. During the six month period ended June 30, 2015, six note payments were received by the Partnership and totaled $28,565 in principal and $3,753 in
	interest.




	12. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES




	The Partnership has determined the fair value based on hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for
	identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Inputs are broadly defined as assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The three levels of the fair value
	hierarchy under the accounting principle are described below:


	 
















	Level 1

	.


	 


	Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.











	Level 2

	.


	 


	Quoted prices for similar investments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the investment.











	Level 3

	.


	 


	Unobservable inputs for which there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information in the circumstances and may require significant
	management judgment or estimation and the use of discounted cash flow models to value the investment.






	The fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. The
	Partnerships assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment.


	The Partnership assesses the levels of the investments at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event
	or change in circumstances that caused the transfer in accordance with the Partnerships accounting policy regarding the recognition of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy. For the three month periods ended June 30, 2015
	and 2014, there were no such transfers.




	13. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS





	Bi-Annual Consent Solicitation



	On or
	about June 16, 2015, consent solicitations were circulated (as defined above, the 2015 Consent), which if approved would have authorized the sale of all of the Partnerships Properties and the dissolution of the Partnership.
	The holders of a majority of the outstanding limited partnership units did not vote in favor of the 2015 Consent, and the General Partner declared the 2015 Consent solicitation process concluded on July 31, 2015. Additional information
	regarding the 2015 Consent can be found in Item 5 of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

	Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
	Results of Operations

	the Partnership want to dispose of a property, lease-up risks, ability of tenants to fulfill their obligations to the Partnership under existing leases, sales levels of tenants whose leases
	include a percentage rent component, adverse changes to the restaurant market, entrance of competitors to the Partnerships lessees in markets in which the Properties are located, inability to obtain new tenants upon the expiration of existing
	leases, the potential need to fund tenant improvements or other capital expenditures out of operating cash flows, our inability to realize value for limited partners upon disposition of the Partnerships assets, such other factors as discussed
	in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year end December 31, 2014, and other reports we file with the SEC.




	Critical Accounting Policies and
	Estimates




	Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
	statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and
	assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates, including investment
	impairment. These estimates are based on managements historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.


	The Partnership believes that its most significant accounting policies deal with:



	Depreciation methods and lives

	- Depreciation of the Properties is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the buildings and
	improvements. While the Partnership believes these are the appropriate lives and methods, use of different lives and methods could result in different impacts on net income. Additionally, the value of real estate is typically based on market
	conditions and property performance, so depreciated book value of real estate may not reflect the market value of real estate assets.



	Revenue
	recognition

	- Rental revenue from investment properties is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective lease when collectability is assured. Percentage rents are accrued only when the tenant has reached the sales
	breakpoint stipulated in the lease.



	Impairment

	- The Partnership periodically reviews its long-lived assets, primarily real estate, for impairment
	whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Partnerships review involves comparing current and future operating performance of the assets, the most significant of
	which is undiscounted operating cash flows, to the carrying value of the assets. Based on this analysis, if deemed necessary, a provision for possible loss is recognized.




	Investment Properties




	As of June 30, 2015,
	the Partnership owned the Properties, which are leased to eleven fully constructed fast-food restaurants. In addition, one property is located on a parcel of land that is subject to a ground lease. The eleven tenants are comprised of the following:
	nine Wendys restaurants, an Applebees restaurant, and a KFC restaurant. The Properties are located in a total of four states.


	Property taxes,
	general maintenance, insurance and ground rent on the Properties are the responsibility of the tenant. However, when a tenant fails to make the required tax payments or when a property becomes


	 


	19






	Table of Contents



	vacant, the Partnership makes the appropriate property tax payments to avoid possible foreclosure of the property (such as the Des Moines, Iowa property, which formerly operated as Daytonas
	All Sports Café). In a property vacancy, the Partnership pays for insurance and maintenance related to the vacant property.


	Such taxes, insurance
	and ground rent are accrued in the period in which the liability is incurred. The Partnership leases property to one restaurant which is located on a parcel of land where the Partnership holds a long-term ground lease, as lessee, which is set to
	expire in 2018. The Partnership has the option to extend the ground lease for two additional ten year periods. The Partnership owns all improvements constructed on the land (including the building and improvements) until the termination of the
	ground lease, at which time all constructed improvements will become the land owners property. The tenant, KFC, is responsible for the $3,400 per month ground lease payment per the terms of its lease with the Partnership.


	There were no building improvements capitalized during the three month period ending June 30, 2015.




	Net Income




	Net income for the three month periods
	ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $127,075 and $93,337, respectively. Net income per limited partnership interest for the three month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $2.72 and $2.00, respectively. Net income for the six month
	periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $133,696 and $86,787, respectively. Net income per limited partnership interest for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $2.86 and $1.86, respectively.


	The increase from the 2014 periods to the 2015 periods is due primarily to lower operating expenses in 2015 than 2014. Operating costs were higher during the
	2014 periods primarily because of the default of the tenant Daytonas, which occupied the property in Des Moines, Iowa through May 31, 2014.


	Net income for the three and six months periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 included the results from both operations and discontinued operations.
	Assets disposed of or deemed to be classified as held for sale require the reclassification of current and previous years operations to discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP applicable to Accounting for the Impairment or
	Disposal of Long Lived Assets. As such, prior year operating results for those properties considered as held for sale or properties no longer considered for sale have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation without
	effecting total net income. When properties are considered held for sale, depreciation of the properties is discontinued, and the properties are valued at the lower of the depreciated cost or fair value, less costs to dispose.




	Results of Operations




	Income from continuing
	operations for the three month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $127,000 and $119,507, respectively. Income from continuing operations for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $133,763 and $100,440,
	respectively. See the paragraphs below for further information as to the 2015 and 2014 variances of individual operating income and expense items.





	Three month period ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the three month period ended June 30, 2014:






	Operating Rental Income:

	Rental income for the three month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $309,142 and $294,599, respectively. The rental
	income was comprised primarily of monthly lease obligations and included adjustments for straight-line rent.

	General and Administrative Expense:

	General and administrative expenses for the three month periods ended
	June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $87,862 and $83,433, respectively. General and administrative expenses were comprised of management expense, state/city registration and annual report filing fees, XBRL outsourced fees, office supplies, printing
	costs, outside storage expenses, copy/fax costs, postage and shipping expenses, long-distance telephone expenses, website fees, bank fees and state income tax expenses. The increase in the 2015 period versus the 2014 period is due primarily to an
	increase in management fees, printing costs due to the consent solicitation mailing and quarterly state income tax estimates paid.



	Professional
	services:

	Professional services expenses for the three month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $55,005 and $53,210, respectively. Professional services expenses were primarily comprised of investor relations data processing,
	investor mailings processing, website design, legal, auditing and tax preparation fees, and SEC report conversion and processing fees. The increase in the 2015 period versus the 2014 period is due to higher investor relations expenses, filing fees,
	audit and tax return preparation fees, offset by lower legal fees.





	Six month period ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the six month period
	ended June 30, 2014:






	Operating Rental Income:

	Rental income for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was
	$551,847 and $536,597, respectively. The rental income was comprised primarily of monthly lease obligations and includes accruals for annual percentage rents earned year-to-date.


	Management expects total base operating rental income to be $949,354 for the year 2015 based on operating leases currently in place. In addition, future
	operating rental income may decrease with tenant defaults and/or the reclassification of properties as properties held for sale. Future operating rental income may also increase with additional rents due from tenants, if those tenants experience
	increased sales levels, which require the payment of additional rent to the Partnership. Operating percentage rents included in rental income from operations in 2014 was $500,747, and management expects the 2015 percentage rents to be higher than
	2014 due to the increasing sales trends for the Wendys restaurants in the Partnerships portfolio.



	Insurance Expense:

	Insurance expense
	for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $2,931 and $2,995, respectively. The insurance expense was related to the Partnerships general liability policy. This amount could increase if the general liability insurance
	premium for the 2015/2016 insurance year that is expected to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2015 also increases.



	General and Administrative Expense:

	General and administrative expenses for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $177,568 and $200,598, respectively. General and administrative expenses were comprised of management expense, state/city registration and
	annual report filing fees, office supplies, printing costs, outside storage expenses, copy/fax costs, postage and shipping expenses, long-distance telephone expenses, website fees, bank fees, state income tax expenses and bad debt allowance.
	Management expects the total 2015 operating general and administrative expenses to be lower than 2014 expenses, primarily due to the 2014 increased state and local income tax expenses as a result of the 2013 condemnation sale.



	Professional services:

	Professional services expenses for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $162,830 and $158,951,
	respectively. Professional services expenses were primarily comprised of investor relations data processing, investor mailings processing, website design, legal, auditing and tax preparation fees, and SEC report conversion and processing fees.
	Management anticipates that the total 2015 operating professional services expenses will be higher than 2014 due

	primarily to higher investor relations fees and the increased cost of the SEC mandated XBRL financial statement footnotes conversion and filing requirements for the Partnership. The filing rate
	for XBRL had been discounted for the first two years of the new requirements, and beginning in 2015 the discount was removed.




	Cash Flow Analysis




	Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $649,304 and $624,861,
	respectively.


	Cash flows provided from investing activities for the six month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $17,591 and $6,865,
	respectively. The amounts were comprised of the receipt of note receivable principal payments from the promissory note in relation to the 2009 sale of the Panda Buffet property, offset by the decrease in deferred rent relating to the revised terms
	of the Wendys  Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina lease.


	For the six month period ended June 30, 2015, cash flows used in financing activities
	was $1,150,535 and consisted of aggregate limited partner distributions of $1,150,000, which included $500,747 in percentage rent billings from 2014 and $489,558 in net sale proceeds from the December 2014 sale of the vacant Des Moines, IA property,
	$28,565 in promissory note principal payments received in relation to the 2009 sale of the Panda Buffet property, and general partner distributions of $535. For the six month period ended June 30, 2014, cash flows used in financing activities
	was $625,335 and consisted of aggregate limited partner distributions of $625,000, which included $470,478 in percentage rent billings from 2013 and, $17,839 in promissory note principal payments received in relation to the 2009 sale of the Panda
	Buffet property, and general partner distributions of $335. Distributions have been and will continue to be made in accordance with the Amended Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership.




	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	The
	Partnerships cash balance was $220,891 at June 30, 2015. Cash of $120,000, including $16,159 received from promissory note principal and interest payments, is anticipated to be used to fund the anticipated distribution to our limited
	partners for the 2015 second quarter, which is expected to be made on August 15, 2015, and cash of $18,319 is anticipated to be used for the payment of quarter-end accrued liabilities, net of property tax cash escrow, which are included in the
	balance sheets. The remainder of the cash balance represents amounts deemed necessary to allow the Partnership to operate normally.


	The
	Partnerships principal demands for funds are expected to be for the payment of operating expenses and distributions. Management anticipates that cash generated through the operations of the Properties and from potential sales of
	Properties will primarily provide the sources for future Partnership liquidity and limited partner distributions. During the process of leasing the Properties, the Partnership may experience competition from owners and managers of other properties.
	As a result, in connection with negotiating tenant leases, along with recognizing market conditions, the Partnership may offer rental concessions, or other inducements, which may have an adverse impact on the results of the Partnerships
	operations. The Partnership is also in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for its Properties. The two primary liquidity risks in the absence of mortgage debt are the Partnerships inability to collect
	rent receivables and near or chronic property vacancies. The amount of cash to be distributed to our limited partners is determined by the general partner and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for payment of
	distributions, capital expenditures, and taxable income recognition matching, which is primarily attributable to percentage rents and property sales.

	Table of Contents



	As of June 30, 2015, the current eleven operating Properties were 100 percent leased. In addition, the
	Partnership collected 100% of its base rent from current operating tenants for the period ended June 30, 2015 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, which we believe is a good indication of overall tenant quality and stability. There
	are no leases expiring in 2015.


	Nine of the Partnerships eleven Properties operate as Wendys fast food restaurants which are franchises of
	the international Wendys Company. Operating base rents from the nine Wendys leases comprised approximately 79% of the total 2015 operating base rents to-date. At December 31, 2014, additional 2014 percentage rents totaled $500,747,
	all of which were unbilled and accrued in relation to the Wendys Properties. Therefore, during the fiscal year 2014, the Partnership generated approximately 85% of its total operating revenues from these nine Properties. Additionally, as of
	June 30, 2015, these nine Properties exceeded 75% of the Partnerships total Properties, both by asset value and number. One of the Wendys leases is set to expire in November 2016, another seven are set to expire in November 2021,
	with a ninth lease set to expire in November 2026.


	Since more than 75% of the Properties, both by historical asset value and number, are leased to
	Wendys franchises, the financial status of the three tenants may be considered relevant to investors. At the request of the Partnership, Wendgusta, Wendcharles I and Wendcharles II provided the Partnership with a copy of their reviewed
	financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013. Those reviewed financial statements prepared by Wendgustas, Wendcharles Is and Wendcharles IIs accountants are attached as Exhibits
	99.0, 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, to the Partnerships December 31, 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 30, 2015. The Partnership has no rights to audit or review Wendgustas, Wendcharles Is or
	Wendcharles IIs financial statements and the Partnerships independent registered public accounting firm has not audited or reviewed the financial statements received from Wendgusta, Wendcharles I or Wencharles II.




	Disposition Policies




	Management intends to hold
	the Properties until such time as a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve the Partnerships investment objectives or until it appears that such objectives will either currently not be met or not be met in the
	future. In deciding whether to sell Properties, management considers factors such as potential capital appreciation or depreciation, cash flow and federal income tax considerations, including possible adverse federal income tax consequences to
	the limited partners. The general partner may exercise its discretion as to whether and when to sell a Property, and there is no obligation to sell any of the Properties at any particular time, except upon Partnership termination on
	November 30, 2020 or if limited partners holding a majority of the limited partnership units vote to liquidate and dissolve the Partnership in response to a formal consent solicitation to liquidate the Partnership, with the next such vote not
	expected to occur until 2017.

	On or about June 16, 2015 the Partnership commenced its 2015 consent solicitation process. The process
	concluded on July 31, 2015. As of the record date of May 31, 2015, there were 46,280.3 Limited Partnership Units (Units) outstanding and entitled to notice of, and to vote in, the Partnerships consent solicitation. The
	proposal for which consents were solicited was to approve the sale of the Partnerships properties and the subsequent dissolution of the Partnership (the Proposed Sale and Dissolution). The Proposed Sale and Dissolution did not pass
	because the holders of a majority of the outstanding Units did not vote in favor of the proposal. Results of the consent solicitation process are set forth below.

	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS




	Forward-looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or
	false. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect the Partnerships managements view only as of August 1, 2015, the date this newsletter was sent for printing and mail
	assembly The Partnership undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results. Factors that could cause actual
	results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made in this newsletter include changes in general economic conditions, changes in real estate conditions and markets, inability of current tenants to meet financial obligations,
	inability to obtain new tenants upon the expiration of existing leases, and the potential need to fund tenant improvements or other capital expenditures out of operating cash flow.

	QUESTIONS & ANSWERS




	 









	v













	When can I expect to receive my next distribution mailing?






	Your distribution
	correspondence for the Third Quarter of 2015 is scheduled to be mailed on November 15, 2015.


	 









	v





	When did the Partnership mail the 2014 K-1s?






	2014 K-1s were mailed
	to investors in the first week March of 2015.


	 









	v





	What was the estimated December 31, 2014 Net Unit Value (NUV)?






	Management has estimated the December 31, 2014 Net Unit Value of each interest of the Partnership to approximate $330. Please note that
	the estimated year-end NUV should be adjusted (reduced) for any subsequent property sale(s) or applicable impairment write-downs during the following year. As with any valuation methodology, the General Partners methodology is based upon a
	number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete. Different parties with different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated NUV. Accordingly, with respect to the estimated NUV, the Partnership can give no
	assurance that:


	 




	 


	


	 


	an investor would be able to resell his or her units at this estimated NUV;




	 




	 


	


	 


	an investor would ultimately realize distributions per unit equal to the Partnerships estimated NUV per unit upon the liquidation of all of the Partnerships assets and settlement of its liabilities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the Partnerships units would trade at the estimated NUV per unit in a secondary market; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	the methodology used to estimate the Partnerships NUV per unit would be acceptable to FINRA or under ERISA for compliance with their respective reporting requirements.




	 









	v





	How can I obtain hard copies of Quarterly and Annual Reports or other SEC filings?






	Please visit the Investor Relations page at the Partnership website at

	www.divallproperties.com

	or the SEC website at

	www.sec.gov

	to print a copy of the report(s) or contact Investor Relations.


	 









	v





	What is the meaning of the word Insured in the name of this investment?






	In the offering materials from the late 1980s, sponsored by the former general partners, there was a representation (but no
	guarantee) that the Partnership would seek to insure rents from vacant properties. Although, there was some initial availability of very restrictive and limited (one year) insurance, that availability vanished in the early 1990s.


	In other words, the former general partners were fast and loose with professing the concept of Insured and the
	next and final partnership they sold did not use the term in the investments name.


	 









	v





	How do I have a question answered in the next Newsletter?






	Please e-mail your
	specific question to Lynette DeRose at

Unique Advisory Board
 
The concept of the Advisory Board was first introduced by TPG during the solicitation of written consents seeking to elect TPG as the substitute general partner, and is the only type of oversight body known to exist for similar partnerships at this time. The first Advisory Board was appointed in October 1993, and held its first meeting in November 1993. Among other functions, the three person Advisory Board has the following rights: to review operational policies and practices; to review extraordinary transactions; to review internal financial controls and practices; and to review the performance of the independent auditors of the Partnership. The Advisory Board powers are advisory only and the Board does not have the authority to direct management decisions or policies of the Partnership or remove the General Partner. The Advisory Board has full and free access to the Partnership's books and records, and individual Advisory Board members have the right to communicate directly with the Limited Partners concerning Partnership business. Members of the Advisory Board are compensated $1,500 annually and $500 for each quarterly meeting attended.
 
 
The Advisory Board currently consists of a broker dealer representative, William Arnold; and Limited Partners from the Partnership: Jesse Small and Albert Kramer:

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
