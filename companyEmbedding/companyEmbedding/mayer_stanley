Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

                           A method is described for computing activation energies and rate constants of bimolecular combustion reactions of atomic oxygen
                              and molecular oxygen with hydrocarbon and inorganic fuels. The procedure is a modification of the transition-state bond-energy
                              method previously applied in this series of investigations of rate data prediction for propellant performance and reentry
                              nonequilibrium computer programs. Modification of the method was necessary in the investigation of combustion by O or O2 in
                              order to include the effect of the triplet ground states on quantum-mechanical repulsion. The modified procedure provided
                              much better agreement with experiment than did the method that neglects the triplet nature of ground-state O or O2. Computations
                              of activation energies and rate constants were also made for combustion reactions of fuels with excited electronic states
                              of oxygen that are likely to be more significant in high-temperature reactions. The excited states for which rate-constant
                              computations are made for combustion reactions of fuels with excited electronic states of oxygen that are likely to be more
                              significant in high-temperature reactions. The excited states for which rate-constant computations were made include O2(1)Delta-g),
                              O2((1)Sigma-g(+), O((1)D), and ((1)S). (Author)

                           Activation energies were computed for 324 gas phase hydrogen-atom transfers between atoms of atomic numbers 1 through 19 (excluding
                              the inert gases) as well as Br and I. Eighteen exchange reactions and 153 reverse reactions were included. A modification
                              of the Johnston-Parr method that considers the temperature region in which the activated complex can be expected to obey small-vibration
                              theory was used to calculate rate constants and rate-equation parameters from 298 to 2500 K. Comparison of computed E sub
                              O and k with experiment shows satisfactory agreement over this temperature range, except for the H2 + O = H + OH transfer.
                              The sub O and k values for forward and reverse reactions agree very well with theory. Contributions of the activated-complex
                              vibrations and tunneling are discussed briefly. (Author)

                           A procedure has been developed for predicting activation energies and high-temperature rate constants for the reactions of
                              combustion products formed from propellants that use oxidizers containing compounds of chlorine or fluorine. The procedure
                              has been applied also to computing the high temperature kinetics of bimolecular gas-phase reactions in which the following
                              atoms are transferred: O, N, B, Br, I, Be, and C. The computation procedure was based on modifications to the Johnston-Patt
                              Technique of predicting the rate constants of hydrogen-atom transfer reactions. Potential energies of repulsion were calculated
                              by using a reduced-variable treatment of the Sato interatomic repulsion function. The computed rate constants have been compared
                              with experimental kinetic data where available, and the agreement is generally satisfactory. (Author)

                           HCl chemical lasing has been obtained from chloro-compounds when HI was used as the source of H atoms. Lasing was produced
                              from several P1, P2 and P3 and HCl transitions by transverse pulsed discharges in HI, He mixtures containing such chloro-compounds
                              as CCl4, CHCl3, and several Freons. Both HCl and HF lasing were observed when (C2Cl2F4) was used. The measured wavelengths
                              for this HCl laser corresponded to excellent atmospheric windows for transmitting infrared radiation. No HCl lasing was obtained
                              when HBr, N2S, or H2 were substituted for HI. (Modified author abstract)

                           Cadmium migration damage of separators is a major cause of Ni-Cd battery failures or performance degradation. A series of
                              electrophoretic mobility measurements has been made for cadmium hydroxide suspensions in concentrated KOH battery electrolyte
                              at several concentrations of K2CO3 to investigate whether electrophoresis of cadmium hydroxide could be the mechanism for
                              migration to separators. It was found that the mobility of the cadmium hydroxide suspension in an applied electrical field
                              is adequate to account for the observed migration of cadmium hydroxide to separators. The view that high carbonate concentrations
                              in Ni-Cd battery electrolyte may increase cadmium migration damage of separators is consistent with these electrophoretic
                              measurements. Zeta potentials have been calculated from the data. Similar measurements have been made for nickel hydroxide
                              suspensions in Ni-Cd battery electrolyte at several K2CO3 concentrations. The results are consistent with ion probe analyses
                              for nickel in nylon separators exhibiting considerable cadmium migration. Silver oxide mobilty was also measured. (Modified

                           Experiments were performed to determine if the phase angle between alternating voltage and current could be used to predict,
                              within a probable error of 5%, the state of charge of seven individual sealed (General Electric) model 10AB08 NiCd) cells
                              and a battery consisting of the seven cells in series. The cells were charged for various lengths of time at 0.8 A to obtain
                              a range of state of charge; their phase angles were measured with a Hewlett-Packard HP3575A gain-phase meter at 35 Hz; and
                              they were discharged at 5 A 0.1 V to determine their state of charge in ampere-hours of capacity. The phase angle state-of-charge
                              data were subjected to second-order polynomial curve fitting by means of least-squares analysis. The probable errors obtained
                              from the least-squares analysis were used to judge the quality of the measured correlation between phase angle and state of
                              charge. In order to determine how the correlation might be affected through cell use, the four extensively cycled cells with
                              more than 3700 charge-discharge cycles and three cells with less than 40 such cycles were tested. The effect of temperature
                              on the correlation was also studied

                           A CW hydrogen fluoride laser has been used successfully to separate deuterium from hydrogen by specific photocatalysis of
                              the reaction of methanol with bromine. The strong absorption of H3COH was demonstrated for the HF laser lines P1(5), P1(6),
                              and P1(7). No absorption by deutero-methanol of the HF beam was observed. Excitation of H2COH by the absorbed beam increased
                              the rate of H3COH removal by reaction with bromine. Irradiation of a 1:1 H3COH:D3COD gas mixture in the presence of bromine
                              for a period of 1 min with the 90-W CW hydrogen fluoride laser beam produced isotope enrichment to greater than 95 percent

                           In order to prevent or reduce premature reignition of extinguishable solid prepellant motors, a laboratory investigation has
                              been made to search for methods that could eliminate or reduce the exothermicity of propellant grade ammonium perchlorate
                              exposed to temperatures of 350-390C. It was found that ammonium perchlorate (AP) in which this first exothermic peak was eliminated
                              could be prepared by heating the propellant grade AP to 365-390C for several minutes and allowing it to cool. Furthermore,
                              this exothermic peak was eliminated by the pre-heating technique even when fluorocarbon polymer binder was in contact with
                              the AP. This technique for preventing the first exotherm was successful in all samples of AP tested; the samples were from
                              several sources and in several particle sizes. It was found that the temperature at which the first exotherm occurred could
                              be raised as much as 45C by adding several percent of an ammonium salt (e.g., ammonium fluoborate) to the AP. The delayed
                              exotherm was stronger than that found in AP to which no ammonium salt was added. This technique also was effective when fluorocarbon
                              binder was in contact with the AP. Neither technique appeared to reduce the heat liberated by the deflagration of AP at 470-500C.
                              Co-crystallized ammonium salts were also tested as AP additives. (Author)

                           In order to improve the efficiency of zinc-silver oxide cells, it consequently is desirable to examine the kinetics of zinc
                              electrodeposition from the KOH electrolyte used in spacecraft cells. It was thought that chronopotentiometry would have the
                              greatest probability of successful application to the caustic 41% KOH electrolyte containing 1 M ZnO solute, which is used
                              in zinc-silver oxide cells. Chronopotentiometry was accordingly applied to compare the kinetics of zinc electrodeposition
                              on zinc and amalgamated zinc electrodes (which are used in zinc-silver oxide storage batteries) with the kinetics for electrodeposition
                              on nickel, lead, copper, tin, silver, gold, mercury-film, and platinum electrodes. The chronopotentiometric technique was
                              also applied to investigate the effect of lead ion additives on zinc electrodeposition and to examine wetting agent effects

                              Because of the importance of rate coefficients in determining the power output of HF and DF chemical lasers, the bond-energy
                                 bond-order (BEBO) method for predicting rate coefficients is applied herein to the excited-state reactions H2(y kcal) + F
                                 in equilibrium with H + HF(v = 0,1,2,3 ...) and D2(y kcal) + F in equilibrium with D + DF(v = 0,1,2,3 ...) where the value
                                 of y is 0,1,2,4,8 ..., kcal of excitation. Inversions for these chemical laser reactions are predicted with this method inasmuch
                                 as the computed rate coefficients for the production of vibrationally excited HF and DF are higher than for ground-state HF
                                 and DF. Good agreement is obtained between computed and measured rate coefficients for the reaction of H2 and D2 with F atoms.
                                 The calculations also indicate that excitation of the H2 and D2 reactants can enhance the HF and DF inversions. An analysis
                                 is made to determine the molecular properties responsible for the larger rate coefficient for the formation of excited HF,
                                 and the vibrational frequencies are shown to be significant factors. The computations represent the first application of the
                                 BEBO method for calculating rate coefficients for the production of excited states. (Author)

                                 has been made of the depth of cadmium penetration into a separator from the cell and related cells. Electron probe and ion

                                 a depth of more than 30% of separator penetration was observed. Since cell failure and battery performance losses can be caused
                                 by 100% penetration depths of cadmium, the results of the investigation indicate that cadmium migration and penetration into

                              Rates of H2 absorption and desorption were measured for LaNi5, LaCo5, LaNi2Co3, and FeTi in order to examine the limitations
                                 of these alloys for storing H2 in high-power Ni-H2 satellite batteries. If the H2 absorption and desorption rates are sufficient,
                                 H2 storage in the alloys could increase the energy density and decrease the volume of Ni-H2 spacecraft batteries. The rate
                                 measurements showed that the quantity of H2 absorbed or desorbed was linearly dependent on the square root of time for all
                                 four alloys. This rate law indicated that the rate-controlling step was hydrogen atom diffusion through an adherent hydride
                                 layer to the alloy surface. The activation energy for desorption from LaNi5 was 4.5 plus or minus 0.5 kcal. Even at 0.4 C,
                                 the H2 absorption and desorption rates were sufficient that batteries could be charged and dishcarged in less than 30 min.
                                 Rates for D2 were also determined and found to be lower than for H2. The use of LaCo5 and LaNi2Co5 permitted even lower pressures
                                 than those needed with LaNi5 for H2 storage in Ni-H2 satellite batteries. (Author)

                              A study of the removal of fission products from skin by solutions of complexing agents and other chemicals has been carried
                                 out in order to find skin decontaminants less irritating and more effective than those currently in use. Two types of satisfactory
                                 solutions have been developed: (1) isotonic neutral solutions of complexing agents plus a detergent and germicide, (2) isotonic

                              worldwide
                              A method is described for calculating the activation energies of bimolecular reactions of such multivalent gaseous compounds
                                 as O2, N2, NO, N2O, NO2, CO, and CO2. It is also applicable to the monatomic reactants O, N, and H and to the OH radical.
                                 The method uses relationships between dissociation energy, bond length, vibrational wavenumber, and bond order. It avoids
                                 the use of adjustable parameters. The agreement between calculated and experimental activation energies is very good when
                                 spin conservation in the transition state is considered in the computation procedure. A convenient rule has also been formulated
                                 that predicts the activation energy will be negligible in bimolecular reactions between radicals when the transition-state
                                 formula corresponds to that of a compound having stable bonds. No exceptions to this rule have been found. The method is applicable
                                 to computing rates needed for nonequilibrium calculations of propellant performance and of reentry behavior
