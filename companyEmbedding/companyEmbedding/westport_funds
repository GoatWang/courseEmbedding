The Funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company. Please read it carefully before investing. A hard copy of the prospectus can be requested by calling 1-800-966-4354.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Small and medium-capitalization companies may have more limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in foreign securities may involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risk and differences in accounting methods. A non-diversified fund, one that may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund, is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. A fund that concentrates its investments within one country, one sector, or a small group of industries, such as Japan, Technology, Financials or Natural Gas, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment by a fund in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk, which is the risk that the borrower will prepay some or all of the principal owed to the issuer. Funds that invest in pooled investment vehicles (including ETFs) may experience higher fees. The formula-based strategy employed by some Funds may cause those Funds to buy or sell securities at times when it may not be advantageous.

Opinions expressed are subject to change at any time, are not guaranteed and should not be considered investment advice.
Performance data quoted represents past performance; past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance of the fund may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. EPS Growth is not a measure of the Fund's future performance. Diversification does not assure a profit, nor does it protect against a loss in a declining market.

For Morningstar Ratings for the Small Cap Financial Fund and Large Cap Financial Fund, and Gas Utility Fund, click here. The
Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for
managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life
subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts)
with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual
funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is
calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts
for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more
emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.  The
top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5%
receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars,
and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.  The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a
managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures
associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar
Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of
total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year
rating for 120 or more months of total returns.  While the 10-year overall
star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the
most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is
included in all three rating periods.  For Morningstar Percentile Rankings for the Equity and Income Fund, click here. Morningstar Percentile Ranking compares a fund’s Morningstar risk and return scores with all the funds in the same Category, where 1% = Best and 100% = Worst. Each Morningstar category average represents a universe of funds with similar objectives.
  

IBD’s SmartSelect composite rating combines all five IBD ratings (Technical Rating, Fundamental Rating, Attractiveness Rating, Group's Technical Rating and Group's Fundamental Rating) into 1-99 rating scale. Those stocks that earn a 99 score are deemed to have the best overall strength for investment and thus the most potential for a fair return on investment in the immediate future.  IBD Best Mutual Funds Criteria: Funds considered have at least $100 million in assets and at least 10 years old, beaten its benchmark for the past one, three, five and ten years.

The Funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company. Please read it carefully before investing. A hard copy of the prospectus can be requested by calling 1-800-966-4354.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Small and medium-capitalization companies may have more limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in foreign securities may involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risk and differences in accounting methods. A non-diversified fund, one that may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund, is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. A fund that concentrates its investments within one country, one sector, or a small group of industries, such as Japan, Technology, Financials or Natural Gas, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment by a fund in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk, which is the risk that the borrower will prepay some or all of the principal owed to the issuer. Funds that invest in pooled investment vehicles (including ETFs) may experience higher fees. The formula-based strategy employed by some Funds may cause those Funds to buy or sell securities at times when it may not be advantageous.

NOVATO, Calif., May 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Hennessy Advisors, Inc. (NASDAQ:    HNNA) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement with Westport Advisers, LLC to purchase the assets related to the management of The Westport Funds, which are the Westport Fund and the Westport Select Cap Fund.  The Westport Funds currently have assets of approximately $640 million, which would bring total assets managed by Hennessy Advisors, Inc. to over $7 billion after the acquisition.  The transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016. 








Upon completion of the transaction, the assets related to the Westport Fund and the Westport Select Cap Fund will merge into the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund, with shareholders of the Westport Funds becoming shareholders of the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund.  Hennessy Advisors, Inc. is the investment manager of the Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund.  The transaction is subject to regulatory review and the approval of the Hennessy Funds' Board of Trustees, The Westport Funds' Board of Trustees and the Westport Funds' shareholders.  
"Hennessy Advisors is committed to the mutual fund business and has a solid reputation in the asset management industry," said Andrew J. Knuth, Co-Founder of Westport Advisers, LLC and Chairman of Westport Asset Management.  "We believe our shareholders will receive excellent portfolio management and service under the leadership of Neil Hennessy and the team at Hennessy Advisors," noted Edmund H. Nicklin, Co-Founder of Westport Advisers, LLC.
"We look forward to welcoming the Westport shareholders into the Hennessy family, and we are committed to a smooth transition.  At Hennessy, our shareholders come first. We strive to deliver strong investment management and performance, quality customer service and a high standard of business ethics to our shareholders, and we are very proud of our track record in each of these areas," said Neil Hennessy, Chairman, CEO and President of Hennessy Advisors, Inc.

This press release contains forward-looking statements, which do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  Forward-looking statements are beyond the ability of Hennessy Advisors, Inc. to control and, in many cases, Hennessy Advisors, Inc. cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements.  Among other risks and uncertainties is the ability of Hennessy Advisors, Inc. to successfully merge the assets of The Westport Funds into the Hennessy Funds.  As a result, no assurance can be given as to future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements, and Hennessy Advisors, Inc. assumes no responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any forward-looking statements.
This press release is not a solicitation of a proxy from any shareholder of The Westport Funds.  In soliciting shareholder approval of the transactions, Hennessy Funds Trust and The Westport Funds and their respective trustees, Hennessy Advisors, Inc. and Westport Advisers, LLC, may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation.  Information about the trustees of Hennessy Funds Trust may be found in the 2015 Annual Reports of the Hennessy Funds filed with the SEC on January 8, 2016, and Statement of Additional Information filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016.  Information about the trustees of The Westport Funds may be found in their 2015 Annual Report filed with the SEC on March 2, 2016, and Statement of Additional Information filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016.  Shareholders of The Westport Funds should read the definitive prospectus/proxy statement that will be filed in connection with the solicitation because it will contain important information, including a description of any direct or indirect interest of the participants in the solicitation.  The definitive prospectus/proxy statement and other relevant documents (when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or by calling 1-800-966-4354.

Harsh winter weather and a revision to the estimated impact from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (also known as "Obamacare") account for much of the weakness. Recent economic statistics, especially employment, indicate a strong rebound. The economically weak first quarter and emphatic support for continuing near zero short term interest rates by the new Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen saw the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond decline from 3.0% at year-end 2013 to 2.5% at June 30, 2014.Westport Asset Management Stock PicksWestport Asset Management Current PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsFaced with declining rates on fixed income securities, investors sought equities with relatively high dividend yields - utilities and REITs. These two industry sectors provided returns of 19.2% and 17.3%, respectively, in the first half, the two highest among the ten industry sectors that comprise the Russell Midcap� Index and contributed 233 basis points i of the Index's 867 basis point return. The Westport Fund Class R shares returned 486 basis points in the first half of 2014 with virtually no utilities or REITs among its portfolio holdings. The remaining shortfall of 148 basis points occurred in the final two weeks of the second quarter and was the result of investor concerns about the trajectory of future financial performance for some of the Westport Fund's larger portfolio holdings. For example, FMC Corp (FMC). produced a negative 38 basis point return when it made an earnings preannouncement that a combination of compressed North American planting schedules and a severe drought in Brazil would reduce its sales of agricultural chemicals in the second quarter. The cancellation of a large order for Airbus A-350 aircraft by the United Arab Emirates caused investors to question the bright outlook for commercial aircraft production. Precision Castparts Corp. (PCP), a major supplier of aerospace components, saw its shares decline, decreasing portfolio return by 32 basis points in this period. These events appear transitory and should not have a long term impact on valuation.Lipper, Inc. provides an additional reference point for assessing the Westport Fund's first half 2014 performance. The Lipper category average for Mid-Cap Growth funds ii, the category to which Morningstar assigns the Westport Fund, returned 3.73%, compared to 4.86% for the Fund's Class R shares. Comparing long term results, the Westport Fund Class R shares average annual return has outperformed that of the Russell Midcap� Index 11.23% to 9.53% over the 16 � years since the Fund's inception. Lipper places the Westport Fund in its multi-cap core category where the average annual return over the 16� year period is 6.53%. The Westport Fund's investment focus on the long term and on companies with a competitive advantage has been instrumental in producing these results.Of the 43 portfolio holdings at the end of the first half of 2014, 31 holdings provided positive returns and 12 holdings provided negative returns. The best performing industry sector for the Westport Fund in this period was Oil & Gas Producers, which included three exploration and production companies. This sector provided 261 basis points to the portfolio return compared to the 105 basis points from the Energy holdings in the Russell Midcap� Index. The domestic oriented company, EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG), returned 39% in the first half of 2014 and was the primary driver of the sector's performance, contributing 157 basis points. Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) contributed 84 basis points to the Fund's performance on a return of 38% after settling the Tronox litigation that arose from its purchase of Kerr McGee Corp. in 2006. Stone Energy Corp. (SGY) provided a return of slightly more than 35% for the first half and added 27 basis points to the Fund's performance. Continued growth in the world economy has been supporting oil prices and a very cold winter in the U.S. provided the impetus for higher natural gas prices. Health care holdings were the second largest industry sector contribution to the Fund's performance at 128 basis points, similar to the 138 basis points contribution of the health care sector to the Russell Midcap� Index. The best performer among the portfolio holdings in health care was Universal Health Services, Inc., Class B shares (UHS) which contributed 64 basis points to performance with an 18% return in the first half. The largest detractor among the Fund's holdings was MasterCard, Inc., Class A shares (MA), at minus 45 basis points from a 12% decline in its share price. After an excellent performance in 2013 where earnings growth outpaced expectations and the stock price responded accordingly, 2014 has seen continued earnings growth but a reduction in the price/earnings multiple iii attached to those earnings. The imposition of financial sanctions against Russia for its annexation of Crimea raised questions about MasterCard Inc.'s long term presence in Russia and its earnings growth. However, the outlook is positive as transactions in many countries will continue to move from paper based systems for commerce to electronic transactions.Read MoreTwo new positions were established in the portfolio during the first half of 2014. Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc. (BBBY) was added to the portfolio after it provided a disappointing outlook for the remainder of the fiscal 2014 year. The focus of investor concerns is on the company's ability to improve multi-channel sales by expanding its internet marketing capabilities. The company is a retail leader in domestic merchandise and household furnishings. A new position was also established in Zebra Technologies Corp., Class A shares ("Zebra") (ZBRA), a provider of industrial products used for data collection and automatic identification systems. When Zebra announced in mid-April that it would purchase the mobile-computing services unit of Motorola Solutions, Inc., its share price declined. Investors were concerned with the historical performance of this Motorola, Inc. unit, the fact that it was approximately the same size as Zebra and that the cash transaction would transform Zebra's balance sheet from debt-free to heavily leveraged. Both companies offer bar code and radio frequency identification used to control inventories but service different end markets. The Motorola Solutions, Inc. unit will enhance mobile and network capabilities. Sales in the first half included Brown & Brown, Inc. (BRO), Albemarle Corp. (ALB), Core Laboratories N.V (CLB), State Street Corp. (STT) and WSFS Financial Corp. (WSFS) as they met our expectations. Forest Oil Corp. (FST) was eliminated as the opportunity for a turnaround faded.Investors should consider the investment objectives, risk, and charges and expenses of The Westport Funds carefully before investing; this and other information about the Funds is in the prospectus, or summary prospectus, which can be obtained by calling 1-888-593-7878 or at our website www.westportfunds.com.

Mid-cap growth funds typically have above-average characteristics compared to the S&P MidCap 400 Index.iii Price Earnings multiple (P/E) is the price of a stock divided by its earnings per share.Portfolio composition is subject to change at any time and should not be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell a particular security.

Bridgewater Associates is an American investment management firm founded by Ray Dalio in 1975. The firm serves institutional clients including pension funds, endowments, foundations, foreign governments and central banks.
It utilizes a global macro investing style based on economic trends, such as inflation, currency exchange rates, and U.S. gross domestic product. Bridgewater Associates began as an institutional investment advisory service, graduated to institutional investing and pioneered the risk parity investment approach in 1996.
In 1981 the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Westport, Connecticut and currently engages 1,700 employees. It embraces a corporate culture that encourages transparency and the elimination of the decision making hierarchy, and in 2011 was the "world's largest macro hedge fund" company with US$150 billion in assets under management.[2][3]

History[edit]
The firm's history includes the pioneering of industry strategies such as: currency overlay, the separation of alpha and beta strategies,[4] the creation of absolute return products, and risk parity.[5] According to Financial News, the company was the fastest growing asset manager from 2000 until 2005, when it stopped accepting new accounts.[6] Its assets under management have increased by 25% each year during the last decade with employees at eleven times their year 2000 levels.[7] The company’s Daily Observations research is reportedly read by leaders of central banks and managers of pension funds around the world.[8]
1975-1990: Consulting, research, money management[edit]
Bridgewater Associates was founded by Ray Dalio in 1975 from an office in his Manhattan apartment. At that time the business consisted exclusively of advising corporate clients and the management of domestic and international currency and interest rate risks.[9][10] The firm later changed its emphasis and began selling economic advice to governments and corporations such as Nabisco and McDonald's.[11]
The company began publishing a paid subscription research report called the Daily Observations which inspired McDonald’s Corp. and its main supplier to become clients in the early 1980s.[12] Another client was Banks of Mid-America and its treasury department director, Bob Prince, later joined Bridgewater Associates as co-CIO.[1] In 1981, the company moved its offices from New York City to Connecticut.[13]

The company's first account was funded by a US$5 million fixed-income investment through Hilda Ochoa-Brillembourg of World Bank in 1987.[14] In the mid-1980s, the firm changed its business focus from currency and interest rate management to global bonds and currencies for institutional investors.[11] As a fixed income and currency adviser to institutional clients, the company gained a reputation as a currency trader and a developer of techniques for overlying currencies. In 1990, it launched a hedge fund portfolio using monies from Kodak and Loews Corporation[9] and began formally offering its currency overlay products to its clients.[15]
1991-present: Pure Alpha, All Weather, Pure Alpha Major Markets[edit]
Bridgewater Associates developed several "innovative investment strategies" during the 1990s such as inflation-indexed bonds, currency overlay, emerging market debt, global bonds and "super-long duration bonds". The firm also "pioneered the separation of alpha and beta" investments and developed a strategy called "alpha overlay" which involved a portfolio of "20 uncorrelated" investments, leveraged for risk or return and combined with cash or an investment market benchmark.[12]
The firm launched its Pure Alpha fund and began to market portable alpha investment strategies in 1991.[4] The Pure Alpha fund did well during the market's downturn of 2000 to 2003 and, as hedge funds became more popular, the company expanded its assets through its connections with various underfunded pension funds, some of which were already clients.[16] In 1992, the firm introduced its global bond overlay program.[7] In 1995, company executives participated in the discussions at the U.S. Treasury[17] and advised federal government on the development of inflation-indexed bonds.[18][19]
Bridgewater launched its All Weather hedge fund and pioneered the risk parity approach to portfolio management in 1996.[20][21] The firm's assets under management grew from US$5 billion in the mid-1990s to US$38 billion by the year 2003.[22] In June 2000, the firm was ranked as the best performing global bond manager for that year and the prior five years by Pensions & Investments magazine.[23] In 2002, the company was ranked by Nelson Information as the World's Best Money Manager in recognition of the 16.3% return on its International Fixed Income program.[24] The firm received the Global Investor Awards for Excellence-Global Bonds award in 2003.[22] The following year the company received the Global Pensions (magazine) Currency Overlay Manager of the Year award,[25] and 2 "best in class" awards from the PlanSponsor Operations Survey.[26]
In 2006, the company's flagship Pure Alpha fund began "returning money" to its clients in order to maintain its investment strategy and enforce its "capacity limit". The firm began moving all of its clients into alternative strategies (such as its Pure Alpha and All Weather funds), thereby eliminating the traditional investment approach from its portfolios.[27] That year it was honored by PlanSponsor Magazine with the Lifetime Achievement Award[28] and the Global Pensions magazine Currency Manager of the Year award[29] and the Money Management Letters, Public Pension Fund Award for Excellence and the Alternatives Manager of the Year award.[30]
By 2007, the firm's total assets under management grew to US$50 billion (from US$33 billion in the year 2000).[12] According to a 2007 article in Barron's magazine, "nobody was better prepared for the global market crash" than its clients and subscribers to its Daily Observations. The company "began sounding alarms..in the spring of 2007 about the dangers of excessive financial leverage".[31] The company's researchers reviewed the public accounts of most of the major financial institutions around the globe and found that estimated future losses due to bad debts totaled US$839 billion. In December, these conclusions were reported to the U.S. Treasury Department when company founder Ray Dalio met with U.S. Treasury Secretary staff and other White House economic advisers.[32] Bridgewater's Pure Alpha fund "spared its investors" from most of the stock market's "meltdown" in 2008.[33] However, this strategy was not successful in 2009 when economic growth responded faster than anticipated and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 19% while the company’s Pure Alpha fund reportedly gained a mere 2% to 4%.[33] Senator John McCain visited the firm and addressed company employees during his 2008 presidential campaign.[34] The Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS) invested in $250 million in a stake in Bridgewater Associates Intermediate Holdings, LP.[35]
Ray Dalio, the company's founder, began using the term "d-process" in February 2009, to describe the deleveraging and deflationary process of the subprime mortgage industry as distinct from a recession.[31] That year, the company was termed the largest hedge fund in the U.S. and it received the Alternative Investment News 7th Annual Hedge Fund Industry's Lifetime Achievement award and PlanSponsor's Hedge Fund Manager of the year award.[36][37] When the U.S. gross domestic product faltered in 2010, the firm had significant gains on their investments in Treasury bonds and other securities, and in November founded the US$10 billion, Pure Alpha Major Markets fund which brought the company's total assets under management to more than US$100 billion.[32][33] In 2011 the firm received several honors. It was ranked number one on Institutional Investor's "world's top 100 hedge funds" list.[38] It received the Macro-Focused Hedge Fund Firm of the Year award[39] and the aiCIO Hedge Fund Industry Innovation Award.[40] Absolute Return + Alpha (AR) ranked the company number one in its Hedge Fund Report Card[41] and Billion Dollar Club categories.[42]
Connecticut is expected to approve a plan at the end of May, 2016, which will give Bridgewater Associates $22 million in grants and loans in exchange for job training, job creation, and building renovations. The company also must agree to retain 1,402 jobs they already support in Connecticut. The company could also become eligible for as much as $30 million in urban tax credits.[43]
Investment philosophy[edit]
According to Ray Dalio, Bridgewater Associates is a "global macro firm".[44] It uses "quantitative" investment methods to identify new investments while avoiding unrealistic historical models.[15] Its goal is to structure portfolios with uncorrelated investment returns based on risk allocations, rather than asset allocations. Additionally, the company is reported to only accept funds from institutional clients such as pension funds, foundations, endowments, and central banks rather than private investors.[10][14]
Separation of alpha and beta[edit]
The company divides its investments into two basic categories: (1) Beta investments, whose returns are generated through passive management and standard market risk, and (2) Alpha investments, whose goal is to generate higher returns that are uncorrelated to the general market and are actively managed. The principle of separating alpha and beta investments was introduced by Dalio in 1990 and gained the recognition of other equity managers beginning in the year 2000. The firm is reported to be the first hedge fund manager to separate alpha and beta investment strategies and offer dedicated investment funds for each.[12][45]
Systematic diversification[edit]
According to Bloomberg Bridgewater uses an investing system that combines traditional diversification with "wager[s] on or against markets around the world" and attempts to invest in instruments and markets that do not "move in lock step" with each other.[10] To guide its investment strategies, the company's top executives have compiled hundreds of "decision rules", which are the financial corollary to the firm's employee handbook, Principles, and these investment guidelines have been incorporated into the firm's computer's analysis.[32]
Products[edit]
The firm offers three hedge funds to its clients: the Pure Alpha fund, the All Weather fund and the Pure Alpha Major Markets fund. It also publishes a white paper, called the Daily Observations, which is read by investors worldwide on a subscription basis.[46]
Pure Alpha[edit]
Bridgewater Associates launched its flagship fund, Pure Alpha, in 1989. The fund is described as a "diversified alpha source" that invests across a group of asset classes.[4] It was designed to balance risk among a variety of non-correlated assets through active management.[47] It includes 30 or 40 simultaneous trading positions in bonds, currencies, stock indexes and commodities to avoid affecting prices by concentrating funds in a single area.[48] After placing some of the company's excess cash into the Pure Alpha hedge fund to increase its "investing discretion".[7] The fund was closed to new investors in 2006 when it reached its pre-determined, maximum funds level.[49] As of 2011, the fund is reported to have lost money in only three of its 20 years of existence and had an average annualized return of 18%.[8] The success of Pure Alpha is reportedly due to a portable alpha management style that trades among many asset classes.[7]
All Weather[edit]
A second fund, called All Weather, was launched in 1996 and highlighted low fees, global inflation-linked bonds and global fixed-income investments. The fund began as the founder's personal trust fund and was subsequently opened to clients.[32] The goal of the fund was to create "high, risk adjusted returns" that exceeded the return of the general market.[32][50] The All Weather fund contains more than US$46 billion and is one of the largest funds in the U.S. as of 2011.[51] In April 2009, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the fund moved into "safe portfolio" mode which included nominal and inflation-linked bonds and gold instead of equities, emerging market debt, and commodities. [52]
Pure Alpha Major Markets[edit]
Under the guidance of co-CEO, Jensen, the firm created the Pure Alpha Major Markets in 2011 with US$2.4 billion from existing clients.[53] In the summer of 2011 the fund was opened to a group of outside investors who had made a total advance commitment of US$7.5 billion. At that time, it was reported to be the largest hedge fund launch. The fund was established to provide an investment vehicle similar to the company's Pure Alpha fund but with enhanced liquidity by focusing on the major markets such as European bonds.[12] The launch of this fund in 2011 brought the company’s total assets under management to more than US$100 billion.[54]
Daily Observations[edit]
The company's "Daily Observations" is a subscription white paper and was the flagship product and service offered by the company. In 2006, subscribers paid $10,000 per year.[55] It has been characterized as comprehensive, with some editions being up to 43 pages in length and is reported to be "one of the most widely forwarded pieces of market analysis" in the industry.[7] It has been read by leaders of central banks, managers of global pension funds as well as former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geitner and President Barack Obama.[56]

In 1981, the company moved its headquarters 50 miles north of New York City to Wilton, Connecticut, and in the late 1990s it moved to a larger office space on a corporate campus in Westport, Connecticut.[13] As the company continued to expand, it became the sole tenant at the 22-acre campus. The firm's headquarters is described as retreat-like and is surrounded by the trees of a former nature reserve.[15] The campus contains three buildings made of "midcentury modern fieldstone and glass". Since 2000 its staff has grown from 100 to 1200 employees and the firm has taken office space in three additional buildings in the area.[7] In an effort to consolidate its offices, the company made plans to build a 750,000 square foot headquarters in Stamford, CT about 15 miles from its present location in Westport, but cancelled the project in 2014.[57]
Employees[edit]
Bridgewater Associates grew from 100 employees in 2003 to 1,200 employees in 2011.[58][59] The company is reported to be one of the few hedge fund managers that hires its analysts and employees right out of college and from the annual pool of graduates from Ivy League schools.[60] Employees are transported daily in a "fancy" bus that ferries them from Manhattan to the company's Westport offices. According to an article in Bloomberg, "about a quarter of all new hires" leave within the first two years.[10] Those that remain are reported to receive "generous" compensation and form bonds with fellow employees that are "like family"[8] and the company's founder helps to pay for any employees that wish to learn the Transcendental Meditation technique.[61]
Dalio, the founder, relinquished his chief executive officer (CEO) title in July 2011 to take on the role of "mentor". The company's administration consists of three co-CEO's; Greg Jensen, Eileen Murray and David McCormick; the former undersecretary of the Treasury Department.[62] The company also has three co-CIO's (chief investment officers); Dalio, Bob Prince and Jensen (who is also co-CEO).[7] Jensen, the 37-year-old co-CEO, oversees the research programs at the firm and came to the company as a Dartmouth College intern about 15 years earlier.[53][63] Britt Harris, formerly of Verizon Investment Management, joined Bridgewater as co-CEO in November 2004 but left six months later. According to Dalio, the cultural fit was a problem but Harris "is a superstar, with an absolutely fabulous character".[64] From 2010 until early 2013, Bridgewater's general counsel was James Comey, former United States Deputy Attorney General and former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[65]
Corporate culture[edit]
In 2005, Dalio saw the firm taking on hundreds of new employees and decided to create a handbook called Principles, which was distributed to all employees. The publication is said to be part self-help book, part management manual, and part treatise on the mechanics of natural selection as they function in a business setting.[32] According to one trade journal, six years after the publication of Principles, the firm's rapid expansion led to the institution of a "bizarre culture of criticism".[66] The company acknowledges that employees "often encounter culture shock" when they begin working there and Dalio admits: "it's not for everyone".[32] According to the company's web site, employees are encouraged to be assertive and discussions about disagreements and mistakes are considered an intentional part of the company's culture because they are felt to stimulate both learning and progress.[67]
A 2011 article in New York Magazine described the company as the "largest and indisputably weirdest hedge fund" because of its unwavering commitment to "total honesty and accountability" and minute detail in its corporate culture.[8] For example, Dalio encourages employees to do "whatever it takes to make the company great" and emphasizes transparency and openness in its decision making processes.[4][68] All meetings are recorded and can be viewed by any employee, as long as the meeting topic is not proprietary.[66] In addition, Dalio says that he fosters "an extreme meritocracy of ideas", and asserts that decisions are made about investments without considerations of hierarchy. He says that any employee can respectfully say anything to anyone in the firm but they must be prepared to be challenged in return.[64][69] The company's flat corporate structure aims to remove the barriers associated with traditional asset management firms, and qualities like stodginess and risk-aversion are discouraged.[28][70]
The company has been likened to a cult,[32] but Dalio denies that and insists that the firm is a dedicated "community".[7] An article in the New Yorker by John Cassidy says that "the word cult clearly has connotations that don't apply to an enterprise staffed by highly paid employees who can quit at any moment". Cassidy says the company is located away from other financial institutions and headed by a "strong-willed leader" and that employees use a "unique vocabulary".[32] One client, Bob Jacksha, chief executive officer of the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board, said of the firm: "Every investment manager has its own culture [and] some are more unique than others".[33]
Schism atop giant hedge fund[edit]
In 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported that Dalio and Greg Jensen called for votes on each other's conduct. Dalio asked the firm's management and stakeholders committees if they believe Jensen has "integrity."[71]

Bridgewater Associates is an American investment management firm founded by Ray Dalio in 1975. The firm serves institutional clients including pension funds, endowments, foundations, foreign governments and central banks.
It utilizes a global macro investing style based on economic trends, such as inflation, currency exchange rates, and U.S. gross domestic product. Bridgewater Associates began as an institutional investment advisory service, graduated to institutional investing and pioneered the risk parity investment approach in 1996.
In 1981 the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Westport, Connecticut and currently engages 1,700 employees. It embraces a corporate culture that encourages transparency and the elimination of the decision making hierarchy, and in 2011 was the "world's largest macro hedge fund" company with US$150 billion in assets under management.[2][3]

History[edit]
The firm's history includes the pioneering of industry strategies such as: currency overlay, the separation of alpha and beta strategies,[4] the creation of absolute return products, and risk parity.[5] According to Financial News, the company was the fastest growing asset manager from 2000 until 2005, when it stopped accepting new accounts.[6] Its assets under management have increased by 25% each year during the last decade with employees at eleven times their year 2000 levels.[7] The company’s Daily Observations research is reportedly read by leaders of central banks and managers of pension funds around the world.[8]
1975-1990: Consulting, research, money management[edit]
Bridgewater Associates was founded by Ray Dalio in 1975 from an office in his Manhattan apartment. At that time the business consisted exclusively of advising corporate clients and the management of domestic and international currency and interest rate risks.[9][10] The firm later changed its emphasis and began selling economic advice to governments and corporations such as Nabisco and McDonald's.[11]
The company began publishing a paid subscription research report called the Daily Observations which inspired McDonald’s Corp. and its main supplier to become clients in the early 1980s.[12] Another client was Banks of Mid-America and its treasury department director, Bob Prince, later joined Bridgewater Associates as co-CIO.[1] In 1981, the company moved its offices from New York City to Connecticut.[13]

The company's first account was funded by a US$5 million fixed-income investment through Hilda Ochoa-Brillembourg of World Bank in 1987.[14] In the mid-1980s, the firm changed its business focus from currency and interest rate management to global bonds and currencies for institutional investors.[11] As a fixed income and currency adviser to institutional clients, the company gained a reputation as a currency trader and a developer of techniques for overlying currencies. In 1990, it launched a hedge fund portfolio using monies from Kodak and Loews Corporation[9] and began formally offering its currency overlay products to its clients.[15]
1991-present: Pure Alpha, All Weather, Pure Alpha Major Markets[edit]
Bridgewater Associates developed several "innovative investment strategies" during the 1990s such as inflation-indexed bonds, currency overlay, emerging market debt, global bonds and "super-long duration bonds". The firm also "pioneered the separation of alpha and beta" investments and developed a strategy called "alpha overlay" which involved a portfolio of "20 uncorrelated" investments, leveraged for risk or return and combined with cash or an investment market benchmark.[12]
The firm launched its Pure Alpha fund and began to market portable alpha investment strategies in 1991.[4] The Pure Alpha fund did well during the market's downturn of 2000 to 2003 and, as hedge funds became more popular, the company expanded its assets through its connections with various underfunded pension funds, some of which were already clients.[16] In 1992, the firm introduced its global bond overlay program.[7] In 1995, company executives participated in the discussions at the U.S. Treasury[17] and advised federal government on the development of inflation-indexed bonds.[18][19]
Bridgewater launched its All Weather hedge fund and pioneered the risk parity approach to portfolio management in 1996.[20][21] The firm's assets under management grew from US$5 billion in the mid-1990s to US$38 billion by the year 2003.[22] In June 2000, the firm was ranked as the best performing global bond manager for that year and the prior five years by Pensions & Investments magazine.[23] In 2002, the company was ranked by Nelson Information as the World's Best Money Manager in recognition of the 16.3% return on its International Fixed Income program.[24] The firm received the Global Investor Awards for Excellence-Global Bonds award in 2003.[22] The following year the company received the Global Pensions (magazine) Currency Overlay Manager of the Year award,[25] and 2 "best in class" awards from the PlanSponsor Operations Survey.[26]
In 2006, the company's flagship Pure Alpha fund began "returning money" to its clients in order to maintain its investment strategy and enforce its "capacity limit". The firm began moving all of its clients into alternative strategies (such as its Pure Alpha and All Weather funds), thereby eliminating the traditional investment approach from its portfolios.[27] That year it was honored by PlanSponsor Magazine with the Lifetime Achievement Award[28] and the Global Pensions magazine Currency Manager of the Year award[29] and the Money Management Letters, Public Pension Fund Award for Excellence and the Alternatives Manager of the Year award.[30]
By 2007, the firm's total assets under management grew to US$50 billion (from US$33 billion in the year 2000).[12] According to a 2007 article in Barron's magazine, "nobody was better prepared for the global market crash" than its clients and subscribers to its Daily Observations. The company "began sounding alarms..in the spring of 2007 about the dangers of excessive financial leverage".[31] The company's researchers reviewed the public accounts of most of the major financial institutions around the globe and found that estimated future losses due to bad debts totaled US$839 billion. In December, these conclusions were reported to the U.S. Treasury Department when company founder Ray Dalio met with U.S. Treasury Secretary staff and other White House economic advisers.[32] Bridgewater's Pure Alpha fund "spared its investors" from most of the stock market's "meltdown" in 2008.[33] However, this strategy was not successful in 2009 when economic growth responded faster than anticipated and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 19% while the company’s Pure Alpha fund reportedly gained a mere 2% to 4%.[33] Senator John McCain visited the firm and addressed company employees during his 2008 presidential campaign.[34] The Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS) invested in $250 million in a stake in Bridgewater Associates Intermediate Holdings, LP.[35]
Ray Dalio, the company's founder, began using the term "d-process" in February 2009, to describe the deleveraging and deflationary process of the subprime mortgage industry as distinct from a recession.[31] That year, the company was termed the largest hedge fund in the U.S. and it received the Alternative Investment News 7th Annual Hedge Fund Industry's Lifetime Achievement award and PlanSponsor's Hedge Fund Manager of the year award.[36][37] When the U.S. gross domestic product faltered in 2010, the firm had significant gains on their investments in Treasury bonds and other securities, and in November founded the US$10 billion, Pure Alpha Major Markets fund which brought the company's total assets under management to more than US$100 billion.[32][33] In 2011 the firm received several honors. It was ranked number one on Institutional Investor's "world's top 100 hedge funds" list.[38] It received the Macro-Focused Hedge Fund Firm of the Year award[39] and the aiCIO Hedge Fund Industry Innovation Award.[40] Absolute Return + Alpha (AR) ranked the company number one in its Hedge Fund Report Card[41] and Billion Dollar Club categories.[42]
Connecticut is expected to approve a plan at the end of May, 2016, which will give Bridgewater Associates $22 million in grants and loans in exchange for job training, job creation, and building renovations. The company also must agree to retain 1,402 jobs they already support in Connecticut. The company could also become eligible for as much as $30 million in urban tax credits.[43]
Investment philosophy[edit]
According to Ray Dalio, Bridgewater Associates is a "global macro firm".[44] It uses "quantitative" investment methods to identify new investments while avoiding unrealistic historical models.[15] Its goal is to structure portfolios with uncorrelated investment returns based on risk allocations, rather than asset allocations. Additionally, the company is reported to only accept funds from institutional clients such as pension funds, foundations, endowments, and central banks rather than private investors.[10][14]
Separation of alpha and beta[edit]
The company divides its investments into two basic categories: (1) Beta investments, whose returns are generated through passive management and standard market risk, and (2) Alpha investments, whose goal is to generate higher returns that are uncorrelated to the general market and are actively managed. The principle of separating alpha and beta investments was introduced by Dalio in 1990 and gained the recognition of other equity managers beginning in the year 2000. The firm is reported to be the first hedge fund manager to separate alpha and beta investment strategies and offer dedicated investment funds for each.[12][45]
Systematic diversification[edit]
According to Bloomberg Bridgewater uses an investing system that combines traditional diversification with "wager[s] on or against markets around the world" and attempts to invest in instruments and markets that do not "move in lock step" with each other.[10] To guide its investment strategies, the company's top executives have compiled hundreds of "decision rules", which are the financial corollary to the firm's employee handbook, Principles, and these investment guidelines have been incorporated into the firm's computer's analysis.[32]
Products[edit]
The firm offers three hedge funds to its clients: the Pure Alpha fund, the All Weather fund and the Pure Alpha Major Markets fund. It also publishes a white paper, called the Daily Observations, which is read by investors worldwide on a subscription basis.[46]
Pure Alpha[edit]
Bridgewater Associates launched its flagship fund, Pure Alpha, in 1989. The fund is described as a "diversified alpha source" that invests across a group of asset classes.[4] It was designed to balance risk among a variety of non-correlated assets through active management.[47] It includes 30 or 40 simultaneous trading positions in bonds, currencies, stock indexes and commodities to avoid affecting prices by concentrating funds in a single area.[48] After placing some of the company's excess cash into the Pure Alpha hedge fund to increase its "investing discretion".[7] The fund was closed to new investors in 2006 when it reached its pre-determined, maximum funds level.[49] As of 2011, the fund is reported to have lost money in only three of its 20 years of existence and had an average annualized return of 18%.[8] The success of Pure Alpha is reportedly due to a portable alpha management style that trades among many asset classes.[7]
All Weather[edit]
A second fund, called All Weather, was launched in 1996 and highlighted low fees, global inflation-linked bonds and global fixed-income investments. The fund began as the founder's personal trust fund and was subsequently opened to clients.[32] The goal of the fund was to create "high, risk adjusted returns" that exceeded the return of the general market.[32][50] The All Weather fund contains more than US$46 billion and is one of the largest funds in the U.S. as of 2011.[51] In April 2009, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the fund moved into "safe portfolio" mode which included nominal and inflation-linked bonds and gold instead of equities, emerging market debt, and commodities. [52]
Pure Alpha Major Markets[edit]
Under the guidance of co-CEO, Jensen, the firm created the Pure Alpha Major Markets in 2011 with US$2.4 billion from existing clients.[53] In the summer of 2011 the fund was opened to a group of outside investors who had made a total advance commitment of US$7.5 billion. At that time, it was reported to be the largest hedge fund launch. The fund was established to provide an investment vehicle similar to the company's Pure Alpha fund but with enhanced liquidity by focusing on the major markets such as European bonds.[12] The launch of this fund in 2011 brought the company’s total assets under management to more than US$100 billion.[54]
Daily Observations[edit]
The company's "Daily Observations" is a subscription white paper and was the flagship product and service offered by the company. In 2006, subscribers paid $10,000 per year.[55] It has been characterized as comprehensive, with some editions being up to 43 pages in length and is reported to be "one of the most widely forwarded pieces of market analysis" in the industry.[7] It has been read by leaders of central banks, managers of global pension funds as well as former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geitner and President Barack Obama.[56]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Headquarters[edit]

In 1981, the company moved its headquarters 50 miles north of New York City to Wilton, Connecticut, and in the late 1990s it moved to a larger office space on a corporate campus in Westport, Connecticut.[13] As the company continued to expand, it became the sole tenant at the 22-acre campus. The firm's headquarters is described as retreat-like and is surrounded by the trees of a former nature reserve.[15] The campus contains three buildings made of "midcentury modern fieldstone and glass". Since 2000 its staff has grown from 100 to 1200 employees and the firm has taken office space in three additional buildings in the area.[7] In an effort to consolidate its offices, the company made plans to build a 750,000 square foot headquarters in Stamford, CT about 15 miles from its present location in Westport, but cancelled the project in 2014.[57]
Employees[edit]
Bridgewater Associates grew from 100 employees in 2003 to 1,200 employees in 2011.[58][59] The company is reported to be one of the few hedge fund managers that hires its analysts and employees right out of college and from the annual pool of graduates from Ivy League schools.[60] Employees are transported daily in a "fancy" bus that ferries them from Manhattan to the company's Westport offices. According to an article in Bloomberg, "about a quarter of all new hires" leave within the first two years.[10] Those that remain are reported to receive "generous" compensation and form bonds with fellow employees that are "like family"[8] and the company's founder helps to pay for any employees that wish to learn the Transcendental Meditation technique.[61]
Dalio, the founder, relinquished his chief executive officer (CEO) title in July 2011 to take on the role of "mentor". The company's administration consists of three co-CEO's; Greg Jensen, Eileen Murray and David McCormick; the former undersecretary of the Treasury Department.[62] The company also has three co-CIO's (chief investment officers); Dalio, Bob Prince and Jensen (who is also co-CEO).[7] Jensen, the 37-year-old co-CEO, oversees the research programs at the firm and came to the company as a Dartmouth College intern about 15 years earlier.[53][63] Britt Harris, formerly of Verizon Investment Management, joined Bridgewater as co-CEO in November 2004 but left six months later. According to Dalio, the cultural fit was a problem but Harris "is a superstar, with an absolutely fabulous character".[64] From 2010 until early 2013, Bridgewater's general counsel was James Comey, former United States Deputy Attorney General and former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[65]
Corporate culture[edit]
In 2005, Dalio saw the firm taking on hundreds of new employees and decided to create a handbook called Principles, which was distributed to all employees. The publication is said to be part self-help book, part management manual, and part treatise on the mechanics of natural selection as they function in a business setting.[32] According to one trade journal, six years after the publication of Principles, the firm's rapid expansion led to the institution of a "bizarre culture of criticism".[66] The company acknowledges that employees "often encounter culture shock" when they begin working there and Dalio admits: "it's not for everyone".[32] According to the company's web site, employees are encouraged to be assertive and discussions about disagreements and mistakes are considered an intentional part of the company's culture because they are felt to stimulate both learning and progress.[67]
A 2011 article in New York Magazine described the company as the "largest and indisputably weirdest hedge fund" because of its unwavering commitment to "total honesty and accountability" and minute detail in its corporate culture.[8] For example, Dalio encourages employees to do "whatever it takes to make the company great" and emphasizes transparency and openness in its decision making processes.[4][68] All meetings are recorded and can be viewed by any employee, as long as the meeting topic is not proprietary.[66] In addition, Dalio says that he fosters "an extreme meritocracy of ideas", and asserts that decisions are made about investments without considerations of hierarchy. He says that any employee can respectfully say anything to anyone in the firm but they must be prepared to be challenged in return.[64][69] The company's flat corporate structure aims to remove the barriers associated with traditional asset management firms, and qualities like stodginess and risk-aversion are discouraged.[28][70]
The company has been likened to a cult,[32] but Dalio denies that and insists that the firm is a dedicated "community".[7] An article in the New Yorker by John Cassidy says that "the word cult clearly has connotations that don't apply to an enterprise staffed by highly paid employees who can quit at any moment". Cassidy says the company is located away from other financial institutions and headed by a "strong-willed leader" and that employees use a "unique vocabulary".[32] One client, Bob Jacksha, chief executive officer of the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board, said of the firm: "Every investment manager has its own culture [and] some are more unique than others".[33]
Schism atop giant hedge fund[edit]
In 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported that Dalio and Greg Jensen called for votes on each other's conduct. Dalio asked the firm's management and stakeholders committees if they believe Jensen has "integrity."[71]

Bridgewater Associates is an American investment management firm founded by Ray Dalio in 1975. The firm serves institutional clients including pension funds, endowments, foundations, foreign governments and central banks.
It utilizes a global macro investing style based on economic trends, such as inflation, currency exchange rates, and U.S. gross domestic product. Bridgewater Associates began as an institutional investment advisory service, graduated to institutional investing and pioneered the risk parity investment approach in 1996.
In 1981 the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Westport, Connecticut and currently engages 1,700 employees. It embraces a corporate culture that encourages transparency and the elimination of the decision making hierarchy, and in 2011 was the "world's largest macro hedge fund" company with US$150 billion in assets under management.[2][3]

History[edit]
The firm's history includes the pioneering of industry strategies such as: currency overlay, the separation of alpha and beta strategies,[4] the creation of absolute return products, and risk parity.[5] According to Financial News, the company was the fastest growing asset manager from 2000 until 2005, when it stopped accepting new accounts.[6] Its assets under management have increased by 25% each year during the last decade with employees at eleven times their year 2000 levels.[7] The company’s Daily Observations research is reportedly read by leaders of central banks and managers of pension funds around the world.[8]
1975-1990: Consulting, research, money management[edit]
Bridgewater Associates was founded by Ray Dalio in 1975 from an office in his Manhattan apartment. At that time the business consisted exclusively of advising corporate clients and the management of domestic and international currency and interest rate risks.[9][10] The firm later changed its emphasis and began selling economic advice to governments and corporations such as Nabisco and McDonald's.[11]
The company began publishing a paid subscription research report called the Daily Observations which inspired McDonald’s Corp. and its main supplier to become clients in the early 1980s.[12] Another client was Banks of Mid-America and its treasury department director, Bob Prince, later joined Bridgewater Associates as co-CIO.[1] In 1981, the company moved its offices from New York City to Connecticut.[13]

The company's first account was funded by a US$5 million fixed-income investment through Hilda Ochoa-Brillembourg of World Bank in 1987.[14] In the mid-1980s, the firm changed its business focus from currency and interest rate management to global bonds and currencies for institutional investors.[11] As a fixed income and currency adviser to institutional clients, the company gained a reputation as a currency trader and a developer of techniques for overlying currencies. In 1990, it launched a hedge fund portfolio using monies from Kodak and Loews Corporation[9] and began formally offering its currency overlay products to its clients.[15]
1991-present: Pure Alpha, All Weather, Pure Alpha Major Markets[edit]
Bridgewater Associates developed several "innovative investment strategies" during the 1990s such as inflation-indexed bonds, currency overlay, emerging market debt, global bonds and "super-long duration bonds". The firm also "pioneered the separation of alpha and beta" investments and developed a strategy called "alpha overlay" which involved a portfolio of "20 uncorrelated" investments, leveraged for risk or return and combined with cash or an investment market benchmark.[12]
The firm launched its Pure Alpha fund and began to market portable alpha investment strategies in 1991.[4] The Pure Alpha fund did well during the market's downturn of 2000 to 2003 and, as hedge funds became more popular, the company expanded its assets through its connections with various underfunded pension funds, some of which were already clients.[16] In 1992, the firm introduced its global bond overlay program.[7] In 1995, company executives participated in the discussions at the U.S. Treasury[17] and advised federal government on the development of inflation-indexed bonds.[18][19]
Bridgewater launched its All Weather hedge fund and pioneered the risk parity approach to portfolio management in 1996.[20][21] The firm's assets under management grew from US$5 billion in the mid-1990s to US$38 billion by the year 2003.[22] In June 2000, the firm was ranked as the best performing global bond manager for that year and the prior five years by Pensions & Investments magazine.[23] In 2002, the company was ranked by Nelson Information as the World's Best Money Manager in recognition of the 16.3% return on its International Fixed Income program.[24] The firm received the Global Investor Awards for Excellence-Global Bonds award in 2003.[22] The following year the company received the Global Pensions (magazine) Currency Overlay Manager of the Year award,[25] and 2 "best in class" awards from the PlanSponsor Operations Survey.[26]
In 2006, the company's flagship Pure Alpha fund began "returning money" to its clients in order to maintain its investment strategy and enforce its "capacity limit". The firm began moving all of its clients into alternative strategies (such as its Pure Alpha and All Weather funds), thereby eliminating the traditional investment approach from its portfolios.[27] That year it was honored by PlanSponsor Magazine with the Lifetime Achievement Award[28] and the Global Pensions magazine Currency Manager of the Year award[29] and the Money Management Letters, Public Pension Fund Award for Excellence and the Alternatives Manager of the Year award.[30]
By 2007, the firm's total assets under management grew to US$50 billion (from US$33 billion in the year 2000).[12] According to a 2007 article in Barron's magazine, "nobody was better prepared for the global market crash" than its clients and subscribers to its Daily Observations. The company "began sounding alarms..in the spring of 2007 about the dangers of excessive financial leverage".[31] The company's researchers reviewed the public accounts of most of the major financial institutions around the globe and found that estimated future losses due to bad debts totaled US$839 billion. In December, these conclusions were reported to the U.S. Treasury Department when company founder Ray Dalio met with U.S. Treasury Secretary staff and other White House economic advisers.[32] Bridgewater's Pure Alpha fund "spared its investors" from most of the stock market's "meltdown" in 2008.[33] However, this strategy was not successful in 2009 when economic growth responded faster than anticipated and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 19% while the company’s Pure Alpha fund reportedly gained a mere 2% to 4%.[33] Senator John McCain visited the firm and addressed company employees during his 2008 presidential campaign.[34] The Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS) invested in $250 million in a stake in Bridgewater Associates Intermediate Holdings, LP.[35]
Ray Dalio, the company's founder, began using the term "d-process" in February 2009, to describe the deleveraging and deflationary process of the subprime mortgage industry as distinct from a recession.[31] That year, the company was termed the largest hedge fund in the U.S. and it received the Alternative Investment News 7th Annual Hedge Fund Industry's Lifetime Achievement award and PlanSponsor's Hedge Fund Manager of the year award.[36][37] When the U.S. gross domestic product faltered in 2010, the firm had significant gains on their investments in Treasury bonds and other securities, and in November founded the US$10 billion, Pure Alpha Major Markets fund which brought the company's total assets under management to more than US$100 billion.[32][33] In 2011 the firm received several honors. It was ranked number one on Institutional Investor's "world's top 100 hedge funds" list.[38] It received the Macro-Focused Hedge Fund Firm of the Year award[39] and the aiCIO Hedge Fund Industry Innovation Award.[40] Absolute Return + Alpha (AR) ranked the company number one in its Hedge Fund Report Card[41] and Billion Dollar Club categories.[42]
Connecticut is expected to approve a plan at the end of May, 2016, which will give Bridgewater Associates $22 million in grants and loans in exchange for job training, job creation, and building renovations. The company also must agree to retain 1,402 jobs they already support in Connecticut. The company could also become eligible for as much as $30 million in urban tax credits.[43]
Investment philosophy[edit]
According to Ray Dalio, Bridgewater Associates is a "global macro firm".[44] It uses "quantitative" investment methods to identify new investments while avoiding unrealistic historical models.[15] Its goal is to structure portfolios with uncorrelated investment returns based on risk allocations, rather than asset allocations. Additionally, the company is reported to only accept funds from institutional clients such as pension funds, foundations, endowments, and central banks rather than private investors.[10][14]
Separation of alpha and beta[edit]
The company divides its investments into two basic categories: (1) Beta investments, whose returns are generated through passive management and standard market risk, and (2) Alpha investments, whose goal is to generate higher returns that are uncorrelated to the general market and are actively managed. The principle of separating alpha and beta investments was introduced by Dalio in 1990 and gained the recognition of other equity managers beginning in the year 2000. The firm is reported to be the first hedge fund manager to separate alpha and beta investment strategies and offer dedicated investment funds for each.[12][45]
Systematic diversification[edit]
According to Bloomberg Bridgewater uses an investing system that combines traditional diversification with "wager[s] on or against markets around the world" and attempts to invest in instruments and markets that do not "move in lock step" with each other.[10] To guide its investment strategies, the company's top executives have compiled hundreds of "decision rules", which are the financial corollary to the firm's employee handbook, Principles, and these investment guidelines have been incorporated into the firm's computer's analysis.[32]
Products[edit]
The firm offers three hedge funds to its clients: the Pure Alpha fund, the All Weather fund and the Pure Alpha Major Markets fund. It also publishes a white paper, called the Daily Observations, which is read by investors worldwide on a subscription basis.[46]
Pure Alpha[edit]
Bridgewater Associates launched its flagship fund, Pure Alpha, in 1989. The fund is described as a "diversified alpha source" that invests across a group of asset classes.[4] It was designed to balance risk among a variety of non-correlated assets through active management.[47] It includes 30 or 40 simultaneous trading positions in bonds, currencies, stock indexes and commodities to avoid affecting prices by concentrating funds in a single area.[48] After placing some of the company's excess cash into the Pure Alpha hedge fund to increase its "investing discretion".[7] The fund was closed to new investors in 2006 when it reached its pre-determined, maximum funds level.[49] As of 2011, the fund is reported to have lost money in only three of its 20 years of existence and had an average annualized return of 18%.[8] The success of Pure Alpha is reportedly due to a portable alpha management style that trades among many asset classes.[7]
All Weather[edit]
A second fund, called All Weather, was launched in 1996 and highlighted low fees, global inflation-linked bonds and global fixed-income investments. The fund began as the founder's personal trust fund and was subsequently opened to clients.[32] The goal of the fund was to create "high, risk adjusted returns" that exceeded the return of the general market.[32][50] The All Weather fund contains more than US$46 billion and is one of the largest funds in the U.S. as of 2011.[51] In April 2009, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the fund moved into "safe portfolio" mode which included nominal and inflation-linked bonds and gold instead of equities, emerging market debt, and commodities. [52]
Pure Alpha Major Markets[edit]
Under the guidance of co-CEO, Jensen, the firm created the Pure Alpha Major Markets in 2011 with US$2.4 billion from existing clients.[53] In the summer of 2011 the fund was opened to a group of outside investors who had made a total advance commitment of US$7.5 billion. At that time, it was reported to be the largest hedge fund launch. The fund was established to provide an investment vehicle similar to the company's Pure Alpha fund but with enhanced liquidity by focusing on the major markets such as European bonds.[12] The launch of this fund in 2011 brought the company’s total assets under management to more than US$100 billion.[54]
Daily Observations[edit]
The company's "Daily Observations" is a subscription white paper and was the flagship product and service offered by the company. In 2006, subscribers paid $10,000 per year.[55] It has been characterized as comprehensive, with some editions being up to 43 pages in length and is reported to be "one of the most widely forwarded pieces of market analysis" in the industry.[7] It has been read by leaders of central banks, managers of global pension funds as well as former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geitner and President Barack Obama.[56]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Headquarters[edit]

In 1981, the company moved its headquarters 50 miles north of New York City to Wilton, Connecticut, and in the late 1990s it moved to a larger office space on a corporate campus in Westport, Connecticut.[13] As the company continued to expand, it became the sole tenant at the 22-acre campus. The firm's headquarters is described as retreat-like and is surrounded by the trees of a former nature reserve.[15] The campus contains three buildings made of "midcentury modern fieldstone and glass". Since 2000 its staff has grown from 100 to 1200 employees and the firm has taken office space in three additional buildings in the area.[7] In an effort to consolidate its offices, the company made plans to build a 750,000 square foot headquarters in Stamford, CT about 15 miles from its present location in Westport, but cancelled the project in 2014.[57]
Employees[edit]
Bridgewater Associates grew from 100 employees in 2003 to 1,200 employees in 2011.[58][59] The company is reported to be one of the few hedge fund managers that hires its analysts and employees right out of college and from the annual pool of graduates from Ivy League schools.[60] Employees are transported daily in a "fancy" bus that ferries them from Manhattan to the company's Westport offices. According to an article in Bloomberg, "about a quarter of all new hires" leave within the first two years.[10] Those that remain are reported to receive "generous" compensation and form bonds with fellow employees that are "like family"[8] and the company's founder helps to pay for any employees that wish to learn the Transcendental Meditation technique.[61]
Dalio, the founder, relinquished his chief executive officer (CEO) title in July 2011 to take on the role of "mentor". The company's administration consists of three co-CEO's; Greg Jensen, Eileen Murray and David McCormick; the former undersecretary of the Treasury Department.[62] The company also has three co-CIO's (chief investment officers); Dalio, Bob Prince and Jensen (who is also co-CEO).[7] Jensen, the 37-year-old co-CEO, oversees the research programs at the firm and came to the company as a Dartmouth College intern about 15 years earlier.[53][63] Britt Harris, formerly of Verizon Investment Management, joined Bridgewater as co-CEO in November 2004 but left six months later. According to Dalio, the cultural fit was a problem but Harris "is a superstar, with an absolutely fabulous character".[64] From 2010 until early 2013, Bridgewater's general counsel was James Comey, former United States Deputy Attorney General and former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[65]
Corporate culture[edit]
In 2005, Dalio saw the firm taking on hundreds of new employees and decided to create a handbook called Principles, which was distributed to all employees. The publication is said to be part self-help book, part management manual, and part treatise on the mechanics of natural selection as they function in a business setting.[32] According to one trade journal, six years after the publication of Principles, the firm's rapid expansion led to the institution of a "bizarre culture of criticism".[66] The company acknowledges that employees "often encounter culture shock" when they begin working there and Dalio admits: "it's not for everyone".[32] According to the company's web site, employees are encouraged to be assertive and discussions about disagreements and mistakes are considered an intentional part of the company's culture because they are felt to stimulate both learning and progress.[67]
A 2011 article in New York Magazine described the company as the "largest and indisputably weirdest hedge fund" because of its unwavering commitment to "total honesty and accountability" and minute detail in its corporate culture.[8] For example, Dalio encourages employees to do "whatever it takes to make the company great" and emphasizes transparency and openness in its decision making processes.[4][68] All meetings are recorded and can be viewed by any employee, as long as the meeting topic is not proprietary.[66] In addition, Dalio says that he fosters "an extreme meritocracy of ideas", and asserts that decisions are made about investments without considerations of hierarchy. He says that any employee can respectfully say anything to anyone in the firm but they must be prepared to be challenged in return.[64][69] The company's flat corporate structure aims to remove the barriers associated with traditional asset management firms, and qualities like stodginess and risk-aversion are discouraged.[28][70]
The company has been likened to a cult,[32] but Dalio denies that and insists that the firm is a dedicated "community".[7] An article in the New Yorker by John Cassidy says that "the word cult clearly has connotations that don't apply to an enterprise staffed by highly paid employees who can quit at any moment". Cassidy says the company is located away from other financial institutions and headed by a "strong-willed leader" and that employees use a "unique vocabulary".[32] One client, Bob Jacksha, chief executive officer of the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board, said of the firm: "Every investment manager has its own culture [and] some are more unique than others".[33]
Schism atop giant hedge fund[edit]
In 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported that Dalio and Greg Jensen called for votes on each other's conduct. Dalio asked the firm's management and stakeholders committees if they believe Jensen has "integrity."[71]

Bridgewater Associates is an American investment management firm founded by Ray Dalio in 1975. The firm serves institutional clients including pension funds, endowments, foundations, foreign governments and central banks.
It utilizes a global macro investing style based on economic trends, such as inflation, currency exchange rates, and U.S. gross domestic product. Bridgewater Associates began as an institutional investment advisory service, graduated to institutional investing and pioneered the risk parity investment approach in 1996.
In 1981 the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Westport, Connecticut and currently engages 1,700 employees. It embraces a corporate culture that encourages transparency and the elimination of the decision making hierarchy, and in 2011 was the "world's largest macro hedge fund" company with US$150 billion in assets under management.[2][3]

History[edit]
The firm's history includes the pioneering of industry strategies such as: currency overlay, the separation of alpha and beta strategies,[4] the creation of absolute return products, and risk parity.[5] According to Financial News, the company was the fastest growing asset manager from 2000 until 2005, when it stopped accepting new accounts.[6] Its assets under management have increased by 25% each year during the last decade with employees at eleven times their year 2000 levels.[7] The company’s Daily Observations research is reportedly read by leaders of central banks and managers of pension funds around the world.[8]
1975-1990: Consulting, research, money management[edit]
Bridgewater Associates was founded by Ray Dalio in 1975 from an office in his Manhattan apartment. At that time the business consisted exclusively of advising corporate clients and the management of domestic and international currency and interest rate risks.[9][10] The firm later changed its emphasis and began selling economic advice to governments and corporations such as Nabisco and McDonald's.[11]
The company began publishing a paid subscription research report called the Daily Observations which inspired McDonald’s Corp. and its main supplier to become clients in the early 1980s.[12] Another client was Banks of Mid-America and its treasury department director, Bob Prince, later joined Bridgewater Associates as co-CIO.[1] In 1981, the company moved its offices from New York City to Connecticut.[13]

The company's first account was funded by a US$5 million fixed-income investment through Hilda Ochoa-Brillembourg of World Bank in 1987.[14] In the mid-1980s, the firm changed its business focus from currency and interest rate management to global bonds and currencies for institutional investors.[11] As a fixed income and currency adviser to institutional clients, the company gained a reputation as a currency trader and a developer of techniques for overlying currencies. In 1990, it launched a hedge fund portfolio using monies from Kodak and Loews Corporation[9] and began formally offering its currency overlay products to its clients.[15]
1991-present: Pure Alpha, All Weather, Pure Alpha Major Markets[edit]
Bridgewater Associates developed several "innovative investment strategies" during the 1990s such as inflation-indexed bonds, currency overlay, emerging market debt, global bonds and "super-long duration bonds". The firm also "pioneered the separation of alpha and beta" investments and developed a strategy called "alpha overlay" which involved a portfolio of "20 uncorrelated" investments, leveraged for risk or return and combined with cash or an investment market benchmark.[12]
The firm launched its Pure Alpha fund and began to market portable alpha investment strategies in 1991.[4] The Pure Alpha fund did well during the market's downturn of 2000 to 2003 and, as hedge funds became more popular, the company expanded its assets through its connections with various underfunded pension funds, some of which were already clients.[16] In 1992, the firm introduced its global bond overlay program.[7] In 1995, company executives participated in the discussions at the U.S. Treasury[17] and advised federal government on the development of inflation-indexed bonds.[18][19]
Bridgewater launched its All Weather hedge fund and pioneered the risk parity approach to portfolio management in 1996.[20][21] The firm's assets under management grew from US$5 billion in the mid-1990s to US$38 billion by the year 2003.[22] In June 2000, the firm was ranked as the best performing global bond manager for that year and the prior five years by Pensions & Investments magazine.[23] In 2002, the company was ranked by Nelson Information as the World's Best Money Manager in recognition of the 16.3% return on its International Fixed Income program.[24] The firm received the Global Investor Awards for Excellence-Global Bonds award in 2003.[22] The following year the company received the Global Pensions (magazine) Currency Overlay Manager of the Year award,[25] and 2 "best in class" awards from the PlanSponsor Operations Survey.[26]
In 2006, the company's flagship Pure Alpha fund began "returning money" to its clients in order to maintain its investment strategy and enforce its "capacity limit". The firm began moving all of its clients into alternative strategies (such as its Pure Alpha and All Weather funds), thereby eliminating the traditional investment approach from its portfolios.[27] That year it was honored by PlanSponsor Magazine with the Lifetime Achievement Award[28] and the Global Pensions magazine Currency Manager of the Year award[29] and the Money Management Letters, Public Pension Fund Award for Excellence and the Alternatives Manager of the Year award.[30]
By 2007, the firm's total assets under management grew to US$50 billion (from US$33 billion in the year 2000).[12] According to a 2007 article in Barron's magazine, "nobody was better prepared for the global market crash" than its clients and subscribers to its Daily Observations. The company "began sounding alarms..in the spring of 2007 about the dangers of excessive financial leverage".[31] The company's researchers reviewed the public accounts of most of the major financial institutions around the globe and found that estimated future losses due to bad debts totaled US$839 billion. In December, these conclusions were reported to the U.S. Treasury Department when company founder Ray Dalio met with U.S. Treasury Secretary staff and other White House economic advisers.[32] Bridgewater's Pure Alpha fund "spared its investors" from most of the stock market's "meltdown" in 2008.[33] However, this strategy was not successful in 2009 when economic growth responded faster than anticipated and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 19% while the company’s Pure Alpha fund reportedly gained a mere 2% to 4%.[33] Senator John McCain visited the firm and addressed company employees during his 2008 presidential campaign.[34] The Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS) invested in $250 million in a stake in Bridgewater Associates Intermediate Holdings, LP.[35]
Ray Dalio, the company's founder, began using the term "d-process" in February 2009, to describe the deleveraging and deflationary process of the subprime mortgage industry as distinct from a recession.[31] That year, the company was termed the largest hedge fund in the U.S. and it received the Alternative Investment News 7th Annual Hedge Fund Industry's Lifetime Achievement award and PlanSponsor's Hedge Fund Manager of the year award.[36][37] When the U.S. gross domestic product faltered in 2010, the firm had significant gains on their investments in Treasury bonds and other securities, and in November founded the US$10 billion, Pure Alpha Major Markets fund which brought the company's total assets under management to more than US$100 billion.[32][33] In 2011 the firm received several honors. It was ranked number one on Institutional Investor's "world's top 100 hedge funds" list.[38] It received the Macro-Focused Hedge Fund Firm of the Year award[39] and the aiCIO Hedge Fund Industry Innovation Award.[40] Absolute Return + Alpha (AR) ranked the company number one in its Hedge Fund Report Card[41] and Billion Dollar Club categories.[42]
Connecticut is expected to approve a plan at the end of May, 2016, which will give Bridgewater Associates $22 million in grants and loans in exchange for job training, job creation, and building renovations. The company also must agree to retain 1,402 jobs they already support in Connecticut. The company could also become eligible for as much as $30 million in urban tax credits.[43]
Investment philosophy[edit]
According to Ray Dalio, Bridgewater Associates is a "global macro firm".[44] It uses "quantitative" investment methods to identify new investments while avoiding unrealistic historical models.[15] Its goal is to structure portfolios with uncorrelated investment returns based on risk allocations, rather than asset allocations. Additionally, the company is reported to only accept funds from institutional clients such as pension funds, foundations, endowments, and central banks rather than private investors.[10][14]
Separation of alpha and beta[edit]
The company divides its investments into two basic categories: (1) Beta investments, whose returns are generated through passive management and standard market risk, and (2) Alpha investments, whose goal is to generate higher returns that are uncorrelated to the general market and are actively managed. The principle of separating alpha and beta investments was introduced by Dalio in 1990 and gained the recognition of other equity managers beginning in the year 2000. The firm is reported to be the first hedge fund manager to separate alpha and beta investment strategies and offer dedicated investment funds for each.[12][45]
Systematic diversification[edit]
According to Bloomberg Bridgewater uses an investing system that combines traditional diversification with "wager[s] on or against markets around the world" and attempts to invest in instruments and markets that do not "move in lock step" with each other.[10] To guide its investment strategies, the company's top executives have compiled hundreds of "decision rules", which are the financial corollary to the firm's employee handbook, Principles, and these investment guidelines have been incorporated into the firm's computer's analysis.[32]
Products[edit]
The firm offers three hedge funds to its clients: the Pure Alpha fund, the All Weather fund and the Pure Alpha Major Markets fund. It also publishes a white paper, called the Daily Observations, which is read by investors worldwide on a subscription basis.[46]
Pure Alpha[edit]
Bridgewater Associates launched its flagship fund, Pure Alpha, in 1989. The fund is described as a "diversified alpha source" that invests across a group of asset classes.[4] It was designed to balance risk among a variety of non-correlated assets through active management.[47] It includes 30 or 40 simultaneous trading positions in bonds, currencies, stock indexes and commodities to avoid affecting prices by concentrating funds in a single area.[48] After placing some of the company's excess cash into the Pure Alpha hedge fund to increase its "investing discretion".[7] The fund was closed to new investors in 2006 when it reached its pre-determined, maximum funds level.[49] As of 2011, the fund is reported to have lost money in only three of its 20 years of existence and had an average annualized return of 18%.[8] The success of Pure Alpha is reportedly due to a portable alpha management style that trades among many asset classes.[7]
All Weather[edit]
A second fund, called All Weather, was launched in 1996 and highlighted low fees, global inflation-linked bonds and global fixed-income investments. The fund began as the founder's personal trust fund and was subsequently opened to clients.[32] The goal of the fund was to create "high, risk adjusted returns" that exceeded the return of the general market.[32][50] The All Weather fund contains more than US$46 billion and is one of the largest funds in the U.S. as of 2011.[51] In April 2009, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the fund moved into "safe portfolio" mode which included nominal and inflation-linked bonds and gold instead of equities, emerging market debt, and commodities. [52]
Pure Alpha Major Markets[edit]
Under the guidance of co-CEO, Jensen, the firm created the Pure Alpha Major Markets in 2011 with US$2.4 billion from existing clients.[53] In the summer of 2011 the fund was opened to a group of outside investors who had made a total advance commitment of US$7.5 billion. At that time, it was reported to be the largest hedge fund launch. The fund was established to provide an investment vehicle similar to the company's Pure Alpha fund but with enhanced liquidity by focusing on the major markets such as European bonds.[12] The launch of this fund in 2011 brought the company’s total assets under management to more than US$100 billion.[54]
Daily Observations[edit]
The company's "Daily Observations" is a subscription white paper and was the flagship product and service offered by the company. In 2006, subscribers paid $10,000 per year.[55] It has been characterized as comprehensive, with some editions being up to 43 pages in length and is reported to be "one of the most widely forwarded pieces of market analysis" in the industry.[7] It has been read by leaders of central banks, managers of global pension funds as well as former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geitner and President Barack Obama.[56]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Headquarters[edit]

In 1981, the company moved its headquarters 50 miles north of New York City to Wilton, Connecticut, and in the late 1990s it moved to a larger office space on a corporate campus in Westport, Connecticut.[13] As the company continued to expand, it became the sole tenant at the 22-acre campus. The firm's headquarters is described as retreat-like and is surrounded by the trees of a former nature reserve.[15] The campus contains three buildings made of "midcentury modern fieldstone and glass". Since 2000 its staff has grown from 100 to 1200 employees and the firm has taken office space in three additional buildings in the area.[7] In an effort to consolidate its offices, the company made plans to build a 750,000 square foot headquarters in Stamford, CT about 15 miles from its present location in Westport, but cancelled the project in 2014.[57]
Employees[edit]
Bridgewater Associates grew from 100 employees in 2003 to 1,200 employees in 2011.[58][59] The company is reported to be one of the few hedge fund managers that hires its analysts and employees right out of college and from the annual pool of graduates from Ivy League schools.[60] Employees are transported daily in a "fancy" bus that ferries them from Manhattan to the company's Westport offices. According to an article in Bloomberg, "about a quarter of all new hires" leave within the first two years.[10] Those that remain are reported to receive "generous" compensation and form bonds with fellow employees that are "like family"[8] and the company's founder helps to pay for any employees that wish to learn the Transcendental Meditation technique.[61]
Dalio, the founder, relinquished his chief executive officer (CEO) title in July 2011 to take on the role of "mentor". The company's administration consists of three co-CEO's; Greg Jensen, Eileen Murray and David McCormick; the former undersecretary of the Treasury Department.[62] The company also has three co-CIO's (chief investment officers); Dalio, Bob Prince and Jensen (who is also co-CEO).[7] Jensen, the 37-year-old co-CEO, oversees the research programs at the firm and came to the company as a Dartmouth College intern about 15 years earlier.[53][63] Britt Harris, formerly of Verizon Investment Management, joined Bridgewater as co-CEO in November 2004 but left six months later. According to Dalio, the cultural fit was a problem but Harris "is a superstar, with an absolutely fabulous character".[64] From 2010 until early 2013, Bridgewater's general counsel was James Comey, former United States Deputy Attorney General and former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[65]
Corporate culture[edit]
In 2005, Dalio saw the firm taking on hundreds of new employees and decided to create a handbook called Principles, which was distributed to all employees. The publication is said to be part self-help book, part management manual, and part treatise on the mechanics of natural selection as they function in a business setting.[32] According to one trade journal, six years after the publication of Principles, the firm's rapid expansion led to the institution of a "bizarre culture of criticism".[66] The company acknowledges that employees "often encounter culture shock" when they begin working there and Dalio admits: "it's not for everyone".[32] According to the company's web site, employees are encouraged to be assertive and discussions about disagreements and mistakes are considered an intentional part of the company's culture because they are felt to stimulate both learning and progress.[67]
A 2011 article in New York Magazine described the company as the "largest and indisputably weirdest hedge fund" because of its unwavering commitment to "total honesty and accountability" and minute detail in its corporate culture.[8] For example, Dalio encourages employees to do "whatever it takes to make the company great" and emphasizes transparency and openness in its decision making processes.[4][68] All meetings are recorded and can be viewed by any employee, as long as the meeting topic is not proprietary.[66] In addition, Dalio says that he fosters "an extreme meritocracy of ideas", and asserts that decisions are made about investments without considerations of hierarchy. He says that any employee can respectfully say anything to anyone in the firm but they must be prepared to be challenged in return.[64][69] The company's flat corporate structure aims to remove the barriers associated with traditional asset management firms, and qualities like stodginess and risk-aversion are discouraged.[28][70]
The company has been likened to a cult,[32] but Dalio denies that and insists that the firm is a dedicated "community".[7] An article in the New Yorker by John Cassidy says that "the word cult clearly has connotations that don't apply to an enterprise staffed by highly paid employees who can quit at any moment". Cassidy says the company is located away from other financial institutions and headed by a "strong-willed leader" and that employees use a "unique vocabulary".[32] One client, Bob Jacksha, chief executive officer of the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board, said of the firm: "Every investment manager has its own culture [and] some are more unique than others".[33]
Schism atop giant hedge fund[edit]
In 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported that Dalio and Greg Jensen called for votes on each other's conduct. Dalio asked the firm's management and stakeholders committees if they believe Jensen has "integrity."[71]

Bridgewater Associates is an American investment management firm founded by Ray Dalio in 1975. The firm serves institutional clients including pension funds, endowments, foundations, foreign governments and central banks.
It utilizes a global macro investing style based on economic trends, such as inflation, currency exchange rates, and U.S. gross domestic product. Bridgewater Associates began as an institutional investment advisory service, graduated to institutional investing and pioneered the risk parity investment approach in 1996.
In 1981 the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Westport, Connecticut and currently engages 1,700 employees. It embraces a corporate culture that encourages transparency and the elimination of the decision making hierarchy, and in 2011 was the "world's largest macro hedge fund" company with US$150 billion in assets under management.[2][3]

History[edit]
The firm's history includes the pioneering of industry strategies such as: currency overlay, the separation of alpha and beta strategies,[4] the creation of absolute return products, and risk parity.[5] According to Financial News, the company was the fastest growing asset manager from 2000 until 2005, when it stopped accepting new accounts.[6] Its assets under management have increased by 25% each year during the last decade with employees at eleven times their year 2000 levels.[7] The company’s Daily Observations research is reportedly read by leaders of central banks and managers of pension funds around the world.[8]
1975-1990: Consulting, research, money management[edit]
Bridgewater Associates was founded by Ray Dalio in 1975 from an office in his Manhattan apartment. At that time the business consisted exclusively of advising corporate clients and the management of domestic and international currency and interest rate risks.[9][10] The firm later changed its emphasis and began selling economic advice to governments and corporations such as Nabisco and McDonald's.[11]
The company began publishing a paid subscription research report called the Daily Observations which inspired McDonald’s Corp. and its main supplier to become clients in the early 1980s.[12] Another client was Banks of Mid-America and its treasury department director, Bob Prince, later joined Bridgewater Associates as co-CIO.[1] In 1981, the company moved its offices from New York City to Connecticut.[13]

The company's first account was funded by a US$5 million fixed-income investment through Hilda Ochoa-Brillembourg of World Bank in 1987.[14] In the mid-1980s, the firm changed its business focus from currency and interest rate management to global bonds and currencies for institutional investors.[11] As a fixed income and currency adviser to institutional clients, the company gained a reputation as a currency trader and a developer of techniques for overlying currencies. In 1990, it launched a hedge fund portfolio using monies from Kodak and Loews Corporation[9] and began formally offering its currency overlay products to its clients.[15]
1991-present: Pure Alpha, All Weather, Pure Alpha Major Markets[edit]
Bridgewater Associates developed several "innovative investment strategies" during the 1990s such as inflation-indexed bonds, currency overlay, emerging market debt, global bonds and "super-long duration bonds". The firm also "pioneered the separation of alpha and beta" investments and developed a strategy called "alpha overlay" which involved a portfolio of "20 uncorrelated" investments, leveraged for risk or return and combined with cash or an investment market benchmark.[12]
The firm launched its Pure Alpha fund and began to market portable alpha investment strategies in 1991.[4] The Pure Alpha fund did well during the market's downturn of 2000 to 2003 and, as hedge funds became more popular, the company expanded its assets through its connections with various underfunded pension funds, some of which were already clients.[16] In 1992, the firm introduced its global bond overlay program.[7] In 1995, company executives participated in the discussions at the U.S. Treasury[17] and advised federal government on the development of inflation-indexed bonds.[18][19]
Bridgewater launched its All Weather hedge fund and pioneered the risk parity approach to portfolio management in 1996.[20][21] The firm's assets under management grew from US$5 billion in the mid-1990s to US$38 billion by the year 2003.[22] In June 2000, the firm was ranked as the best performing global bond manager for that year and the prior five years by Pensions & Investments magazine.[23] In 2002, the company was ranked by Nelson Information as the World's Best Money Manager in recognition of the 16.3% return on its International Fixed Income program.[24] The firm received the Global Investor Awards for Excellence-Global Bonds award in 2003.[22] The following year the company received the Global Pensions (magazine) Currency Overlay Manager of the Year award,[25] and 2 "best in class" awards from the PlanSponsor Operations Survey.[26]
In 2006, the company's flagship Pure Alpha fund began "returning money" to its clients in order to maintain its investment strategy and enforce its "capacity limit". The firm began moving all of its clients into alternative strategies (such as its Pure Alpha and All Weather funds), thereby eliminating the traditional investment approach from its portfolios.[27] That year it was honored by PlanSponsor Magazine with the Lifetime Achievement Award[28] and the Global Pensions magazine Currency Manager of the Year award[29] and the Money Management Letters, Public Pension Fund Award for Excellence and the Alternatives Manager of the Year award.[30]
By 2007, the firm's total assets under management grew to US$50 billion (from US$33 billion in the year 2000).[12] According to a 2007 article in Barron's magazine, "nobody was better prepared for the global market crash" than its clients and subscribers to its Daily Observations. The company "began sounding alarms..in the spring of 2007 about the dangers of excessive financial leverage".[31] The company's researchers reviewed the public accounts of most of the major financial institutions around the globe and found that estimated future losses due to bad debts totaled US$839 billion. In December, these conclusions were reported to the U.S. Treasury Department when company founder Ray Dalio met with U.S. Treasury Secretary staff and other White House economic advisers.[32] Bridgewater's Pure Alpha fund "spared its investors" from most of the stock market's "meltdown" in 2008.[33] However, this strategy was not successful in 2009 when economic growth responded faster than anticipated and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 19% while the company’s Pure Alpha fund reportedly gained a mere 2% to 4%.[33] Senator John McCain visited the firm and addressed company employees during his 2008 presidential campaign.[34] The Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS) invested in $250 million in a stake in Bridgewater Associates Intermediate Holdings, LP.[35]
Ray Dalio, the company's founder, began using the term "d-process" in February 2009, to describe the deleveraging and deflationary process of the subprime mortgage industry as distinct from a recession.[31] That year, the company was termed the largest hedge fund in the U.S. and it received the Alternative Investment News 7th Annual Hedge Fund Industry's Lifetime Achievement award and PlanSponsor's Hedge Fund Manager of the year award.[36][37] When the U.S. gross domestic product faltered in 2010, the firm had significant gains on their investments in Treasury bonds and other securities, and in November founded the US$10 billion, Pure Alpha Major Markets fund which brought the company's total assets under management to more than US$100 billion.[32][33] In 2011 the firm received several honors. It was ranked number one on Institutional Investor's "world's top 100 hedge funds" list.[38] It received the Macro-Focused Hedge Fund Firm of the Year award[39] and the aiCIO Hedge Fund Industry Innovation Award.[40] Absolute Return + Alpha (AR) ranked the company number one in its Hedge Fund Report Card[41] and Billion Dollar Club categories.[42]
Connecticut is expected to approve a plan at the end of May, 2016, which will give Bridgewater Associates $22 million in grants and loans in exchange for job training, job creation, and building renovations. The company also must agree to retain 1,402 jobs they already support in Connecticut. The company could also become eligible for as much as $30 million in urban tax credits.[43]
Investment philosophy[edit]
According to Ray Dalio, Bridgewater Associates is a "global macro firm".[44] It uses "quantitative" investment methods to identify new investments while avoiding unrealistic historical models.[15] Its goal is to structure portfolios with uncorrelated investment returns based on risk allocations, rather than asset allocations. Additionally, the company is reported to only accept funds from institutional clients such as pension funds, foundations, endowments, and central banks rather than private investors.[10][14]
Separation of alpha and beta[edit]
The company divides its investments into two basic categories: (1) Beta investments, whose returns are generated through passive management and standard market risk, and (2) Alpha investments, whose goal is to generate higher returns that are uncorrelated to the general market and are actively managed. The principle of separating alpha and beta investments was introduced by Dalio in 1990 and gained the recognition of other equity managers beginning in the year 2000. The firm is reported to be the first hedge fund manager to separate alpha and beta investment strategies and offer dedicated investment funds for each.[12][45]
Systematic diversification[edit]
According to Bloomberg Bridgewater uses an investing system that combines traditional diversification with "wager[s] on or against markets around the world" and attempts to invest in instruments and markets that do not "move in lock step" with each other.[10] To guide its investment strategies, the company's top executives have compiled hundreds of "decision rules", which are the financial corollary to the firm's employee handbook, Principles, and these investment guidelines have been incorporated into the firm's computer's analysis.[32]
Products[edit]
The firm offers three hedge funds to its clients: the Pure Alpha fund, the All Weather fund and the Pure Alpha Major Markets fund. It also publishes a white paper, called the Daily Observations, which is read by investors worldwide on a subscription basis.[46]
Pure Alpha[edit]
Bridgewater Associates launched its flagship fund, Pure Alpha, in 1989. The fund is described as a "diversified alpha source" that invests across a group of asset classes.[4] It was designed to balance risk among a variety of non-correlated assets through active management.[47] It includes 30 or 40 simultaneous trading positions in bonds, currencies, stock indexes and commodities to avoid affecting prices by concentrating funds in a single area.[48] After placing some of the company's excess cash into the Pure Alpha hedge fund to increase its "investing discretion".[7] The fund was closed to new investors in 2006 when it reached its pre-determined, maximum funds level.[49] As of 2011, the fund is reported to have lost money in only three of its 20 years of existence and had an average annualized return of 18%.[8] The success of Pure Alpha is reportedly due to a portable alpha management style that trades among many asset classes.[7]
All Weather[edit]
A second fund, called All Weather, was launched in 1996 and highlighted low fees, global inflation-linked bonds and global fixed-income investments. The fund began as the founder's personal trust fund and was subsequently opened to clients.[32] The goal of the fund was to create "high, risk adjusted returns" that exceeded the return of the general market.[32][50] The All Weather fund contains more than US$46 billion and is one of the largest funds in the U.S. as of 2011.[51] In April 2009, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the fund moved into "safe portfolio" mode which included nominal and inflation-linked bonds and gold instead of equities, emerging market debt, and commodities. [52]
Pure Alpha Major Markets[edit]
Under the guidance of co-CEO, Jensen, the firm created the Pure Alpha Major Markets in 2011 with US$2.4 billion from existing clients.[53] In the summer of 2011 the fund was opened to a group of outside investors who had made a total advance commitment of US$7.5 billion. At that time, it was reported to be the largest hedge fund launch. The fund was established to provide an investment vehicle similar to the company's Pure Alpha fund but with enhanced liquidity by focusing on the major markets such as European bonds.[12] The launch of this fund in 2011 brought the company’s total assets under management to more than US$100 billion.[54]
Daily Observations[edit]
The company's "Daily Observations" is a subscription white paper and was the flagship product and service offered by the company. In 2006, subscribers paid $10,000 per year.[55] It has been characterized as comprehensive, with some editions being up to 43 pages in length and is reported to be "one of the most widely forwarded pieces of market analysis" in the industry.[7] It has been read by leaders of central banks, managers of global pension funds as well as former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geitner and President Barack Obama.[56]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Headquarters[edit]

In 1981, the company moved its headquarters 50 miles north of New York City to Wilton, Connecticut, and in the late 1990s it moved to a larger office space on a corporate campus in Westport, Connecticut.[13] As the company continued to expand, it became the sole tenant at the 22-acre campus. The firm's headquarters is described as retreat-like and is surrounded by the trees of a former nature reserve.[15] The campus contains three buildings made of "midcentury modern fieldstone and glass". Since 2000 its staff has grown from 100 to 1200 employees and the firm has taken office space in three additional buildings in the area.[7] In an effort to consolidate its offices, the company made plans to build a 750,000 square foot headquarters in Stamford, CT about 15 miles from its present location in Westport, but cancelled the project in 2014.[57]
Employees[edit]
Bridgewater Associates grew from 100 employees in 2003 to 1,200 employees in 2011.[58][59] The company is reported to be one of the few hedge fund managers that hires its analysts and employees right out of college and from the annual pool of graduates from Ivy League schools.[60] Employees are transported daily in a "fancy" bus that ferries them from Manhattan to the company's Westport offices. According to an article in Bloomberg, "about a quarter of all new hires" leave within the first two years.[10] Those that remain are reported to receive "generous" compensation and form bonds with fellow employees that are "like family"[8] and the company's founder helps to pay for any employees that wish to learn the Transcendental Meditation technique.[61]
Dalio, the founder, relinquished his chief executive officer (CEO) title in July 2011 to take on the role of "mentor". The company's administration consists of three co-CEO's; Greg Jensen, Eileen Murray and David McCormick; the former undersecretary of the Treasury Department.[62] The company also has three co-CIO's (chief investment officers); Dalio, Bob Prince and Jensen (who is also co-CEO).[7] Jensen, the 37-year-old co-CEO, oversees the research programs at the firm and came to the company as a Dartmouth College intern about 15 years earlier.[53][63] Britt Harris, formerly of Verizon Investment Management, joined Bridgewater as co-CEO in November 2004 but left six months later. According to Dalio, the cultural fit was a problem but Harris "is a superstar, with an absolutely fabulous character".[64] From 2010 until early 2013, Bridgewater's general counsel was James Comey, former United States Deputy Attorney General and former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[65]
Corporate culture[edit]
In 2005, Dalio saw the firm taking on hundreds of new employees and decided to create a handbook called Principles, which was distributed to all employees. The publication is said to be part self-help book, part management manual, and part treatise on the mechanics of natural selection as they function in a business setting.[32] According to one trade journal, six years after the publication of Principles, the firm's rapid expansion led to the institution of a "bizarre culture of criticism".[66] The company acknowledges that employees "often encounter culture shock" when they begin working there and Dalio admits: "it's not for everyone".[32] According to the company's web site, employees are encouraged to be assertive and discussions about disagreements and mistakes are considered an intentional part of the company's culture because they are felt to stimulate both learning and progress.[67]
A 2011 article in New York Magazine described the company as the "largest and indisputably weirdest hedge fund" because of its unwavering commitment to "total honesty and accountability" and minute detail in its corporate culture.[8] For example, Dalio encourages employees to do "whatever it takes to make the company great" and emphasizes transparency and openness in its decision making processes.[4][68] All meetings are recorded and can be viewed by any employee, as long as the meeting topic is not proprietary.[66] In addition, Dalio says that he fosters "an extreme meritocracy of ideas", and asserts that decisions are made about investments without considerations of hierarchy. He says that any employee can respectfully say anything to anyone in the firm but they must be prepared to be challenged in return.[64][69] The company's flat corporate structure aims to remove the barriers associated with traditional asset management firms, and qualities like stodginess and risk-aversion are discouraged.[28][70]
The company has been likened to a cult,[32] but Dalio denies that and insists that the firm is a dedicated "community".[7] An article in the New Yorker by John Cassidy says that "the word cult clearly has connotations that don't apply to an enterprise staffed by highly paid employees who can quit at any moment". Cassidy says the company is located away from other financial institutions and headed by a "strong-willed leader" and that employees use a "unique vocabulary".[32] One client, Bob Jacksha, chief executive officer of the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board, said of the firm: "Every investment manager has its own culture [and] some are more unique than others".[33]
Schism atop giant hedge fund[edit]
In 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported that Dalio and Greg Jensen called for votes on each other's conduct. Dalio asked the firm's management and stakeholders committees if they believe Jensen has "integrity."[71]

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!"

Entreprenuer





Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again. 

Faith D

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.

                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
