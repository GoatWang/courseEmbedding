We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$10,000 after deducting the estimated expenses of registration.

We anticipate that the net proceeds of the Offering will be used primarily to
execute our business plan, pay other general and administrative expenses, and
being used as working capital. The precise amounts that the Company will devote
to its programs will vary depending on numerous factors, including but not
limited to, the progress and results of its research and assessments as to the
marker potential of its proposal to develop the business. In the event that we
sell less than the maximum shares offered in the Primary Offering, our first
priority is the payment of expenses related to this Offering. The following
table summarizes how we anticipate using the gross proceeds of the Primary
Offering, depending upon whether we sell 100%, 75%, 50%, or 25% of the shares
being offered in the Primary Offering:
 
                            100% of       75% of        50% of        25% of

   Net Offering Proceeds   $9,992.26    ($2,507.74)  ($15,007,74)  ($27,507.74) 

The Company anticipates that the estimated $50,000 gross proceeds from the
Maximum Offering will enable it to expand its operations and fund its other
capital needs for the next six months. In the event that the Maximum Offering is
not completed, the Company's officers and directors will advance loans to the
Company until they are able to raise additional capital or until the Company
becomes profitable. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be
available when needed, and, if available, that it will be on terms acceptable to
the Company.


Business and IT consulting service is a popular business in Hong Kong and is in
highly competitive. Reward and micropayment business with designated mobile
mapping, localization and near field communication (NFC) technologies is a new
concept and opportunity to the market; to our knowledge there is no specific
established company in Hong Kong dedicated to the business. However, from the
time being, the steady mature of business model may interest the following
companies to enter this new market:

transport operators in Hong Kong. People in Hong Kong use Octopus Card to pay
the public transport, restaurant or merchant without the usage of coins. The

	Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which are estimated for the Fund’s current fiscal year, are the indirect costs of investing in other investment companies.  The operating expenses in this fee table will not correlate to the expense ratio in the Fund’s financial highlights because the financial statements include only the direct operating expenses incurred by the Fund.

	  This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.




	 




	The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods.  The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same.  Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based upon these assumptions your costs would be:
