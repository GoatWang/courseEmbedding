Support

      We’ve designed Shuttersong to be easy and fun to use. Occasionally, things don’t go the way they are supposed to and we’ll do our best to help you resolve them. You can request support by sending an email to
      
        support@shuttersong.com
      
      with the reason for your request in the subject line. Please describe your problem or request in a much detail as you can. Also make certain to tell us which model phone you are using and what version of the operating system is installed. Whenever possible send us screenshots of the problem.
    

      Before you submit a support request, please read through these FAQ. Many questions that were raised during the beta testing are listed here. We will continue to update these whenever we resolve a support issue that others have encountered as well.
    
Getting Started

      What iPhones does Shuttersong work on?
    

      Shuttersong will work on iPhone 4/4S and all models of the iPhone 5. It does not work on the 3 or 3GS. This version of the app was not specifically designed for iPad, however many people have successfully used them, particularly for adding sound to existing photos.
    

      Does Shuttersong work on iOS7?
    

      The 1.0 version of the app has been used under iOS7 and we have not found any significant issues. A iOS7 compatible version is in final testing and will be provided as an update shortly. The minimum OS required is iOS6 version 6.1.4.
    

      How do I sign up for Shuttersong?
    

      Right now you can only create a Shuttersong account on your iOS device. When you launch Shuttersong for the first time, you'll get the signup screen. If you want to use your email address for your account, enter it and your password and then tap the yellow arrow. If you prefer to use your Facebook or Twitter settings tap the respective icon. If you already have these settings stored they will be applied. Otherwise, enter them and touch the yellow arrow to continue.
    

      I’ve already registered. How do I log in again?
    

      If you've been logged out of Shuttersong, launch the app, tap LOGIN and it will take you to the login screen. Enter your details and tap the yellow arrow to complete your login.
    

      How do I reset my password?
    

      If you've set up your account using an email address and you forget the password, tap the lock icon and a new password will be sent to you.
    
Using Shuttersong

      Why am I limited to 15 seconds of sound?
    

      Shuttersongs are meant to capture moments of your life, and our research showed that 10-15 seconds of sound, voice or music was the right amount to deliver a great user experience.
    

      I prefer to use another app to take my pictures and add filters. Can I still use Shuttersong?
    

      Yes. Tap the lower right of the camera screen and it will open your normal photo albums. Choose on and add voice or sound and share as a Shuttersong. Your original image will not be changed.
    
Privacy

      Where can I find the privacy policy or terms of service?
    

      From the camera screen tap the lower left corner, which will bring you to the archive. Tap the compass icon at the top right of the screen and you’ll find these documents on the next page.
    

      How do I keep my Shuttersongs private?
    

      Unless you share your Shuttersongs, they are only available to you to view. If you share them, they will go to the social network you’ve shared them to and they will be available based on the settings of that network. You can also share them by email or text, however the person receiving them can forward them without your knowledge.
    

      How do I stop others from seeing a Shuttersong I sent?
    

      Go to your archive, tap the Shuttersong you want others to stop viewing and when it has been displayed tap the trashcan icon. This will delete the Shuttersong from your phone and from our storage. Further attempts to view it will receive an error message. However, if the person who received the Shuttersong has downloaded the file, or if the file has been copied to another social network, there is no way to prevent further viewing. For more information please refer to our
      Privacy Policy
      and our
      Terms of Service.


      Do you submit Shuttersongs to the search engines?
    

      No. If you share a Shuttersong to a social network, they may submit them to a search engine depending on your privacy settings.
    

      Why don’t you have a community where I can share my Shuttersongs?
    

      There are many well-established places to share Shuttersongs, including Facebook and Twitter. We decided to provide the ability to share anywhere and leave the choice of where and when to share up to you. Further, by not having a community of our own we do not have to collect any kind of personal data other than an email address to open and maintain your account.
    
Something isn't Working

      Do I need to have a data connection available to use Shuttersong?
    

      Shuttersong requires either a cellular connection or WiFi to upload or share Shuttersongs. The app will attempt to upload your Shuttersong (you will see the mermaid go back and forth) until the app determines that there is no connection. The completed Shuttersong is saved to your archive so that you can share it at a later time.
    

      I don't want to share a Shuttersong. Do I have to?
    

      No. After you have accepted the Shuttersong and you see the sharing page just touch the live camera area in the lower left and your Shuttersong will be saved to the archive and you will be returned to the camera. This is very useful if you want to take several images and share them later.
    

      I can’t remember my password. How do I get a new one?
    

      If you've set up your account using an email address and you forget the password, tap the lock icon and a new password will be sent to you.
    

      I can’t login, it says email address invalid or in use?
    

      Looking at the screen, if you see the LOGIN word, tap it to bring you to the log in page. If you see the word SIGNUP, then you are on the right page but have either mis-typed your email address or are not using the right one.
    

      I can’t log in using Facebook or Twitter
    

      Exit the app by pressing the home button. Go to the main phone settings and look for the Facebook or Twitter headings. Tap the one you want to use and make certain that the switch to allow Shuttersong access to your account is set to ON. Go back to Shuttersong and try again. If this problem persists it is likely that you have your social network settings set to block outside apps from accessing your account.
    

      I selected a song and all I see is the mermaid going back and forth. What’s happening?
    

      There are two possibilities. First, if you selected a song that is over 10 minutes long, the audio processing will take a very long time. Second, if the song you are trying to use has copy protection on it (.m4p files for example), it will not be able to process that file. We have blocks in the app to prevent these, but if they slip through, stop the app and start over.

Shuttersong for Marketing

















Shuttersong for Marketing

    Shuttersongs can be used effectively to deliver visual and audio messages to consumers in both social media and traditional marketing environments. They provide a rich media experience at a fraction of the bandwidth needed to stream a 15 second video. Production costs are much lower than video and time to market can be hours instead of days or weeks.
  

    Brands will be using Shuttersongs for:
  


      High volume Twitter marketing where low production costs make it easy to deliver multiple creative executions
    

      “Radio style” individual or series ads where a still image and rich audio tells a powerful story
    

      Replacement of low performing ad units
    

      Rich high impact emails
    

      Cross-platform ad delivery to multiple social networks on a global basis
    


    Shuttersong is also ideally suited to have consumers generate content and feed it back to the brand. For example, if a brand distributes the app to its followers it can ask the consumers to prepare their own 15 seconds of brand-specific content – a song, a poem, a vocal impression, a piece of music – and use them to populate contests, communities, and viral advertising campaigns. No other application is as easy to use to create rich, engaging content as Shuttersong is.
  

    Shuttersong for commercial uses is priced based on performance with no auction to set value. We offer both pay-per-campaign and subscription based programs. To learn more about how major brands are using Shuttersong, and to see how it fits in your brand advertising plans email us at
    
      adunit@shuttersong.com

About



















      About
    

      It all started with a small plastic frame.
    

      While cleaning out his office last summer, Shuttersong’s founder William Agush discovered a photo of his son taken in 1995 in a frame with a button marked play. Upon pressing it, there was the voice of his son from 18 years ago, clear as day. The idea behind Shuttersong was born.
    

      Simpler than video, richer than photos, Shuttersong® lets you effortlessly combine digital images with sound and share them everywhere. Use Shuttersong to photograph a moment in time and add its soundtrack by selecting a song clip from your music library or recording live voice or sound through your phone. Then, share your “Shuttersong“ with family, friends and colleagues through social networks, email, or text. Shuttersong also works with existing photos in your library and images from the web, so you can create infinite image + sound combinations.
    

      As Shuttersongs are based on standard JPEG files, they are incredibly easy to share and view – in the app or on the web – and can even be embedded into web pages and blog posts. The patent-pending technology joins the image and audio into a single photo file that can be viewed or printed just like a normal high-quality JPEG.
    

      Here just a few of Shuttersong’s many features:
    


        App design is so intuitive there are no words.
      

        One tap to shoot photos and capture sounds.
      

        Easy to grab music or sound effects from your music library and select up to a 15 second clip.
      

        Shoot new photos or add sound to your existing photos (including ones created with other photo apps) or images from the web.
      

        With one tap, share with Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, VK and Reddit or via email and text. Many more global social networks will be added soon.
      

        View Shuttersongs either in-the-app or on the web (even if you or a friend doesn’t have the app).
      

        Shuttersongs sent to you are immediately saved to your phone.
      

        Embed Shuttersongs into web pages or blog posts.

FAQ















The Top Five Questions
1. How much does Shuttersong cost?
Shuttersong is free. Brands, artists, journalists, political figures and other influencers can apply for “verified” status by emailing vip@shuttersong.com. Having verified status provides access to reserved user names, extra features, added protections, and benefits for non-consumer use.
2. How do I find people to follow?
Everyone automatically receives 5 friends during sign-up that can be changed afterwards. You can follow or search for people in the Shuttersong community by tapping the “people” icon from the Home screen. You can view your Followers in your Profile screen and tap to follow. 
3. How do I invite a friend to join?
Tap the “Invite a Friend” icon on the top right side of your Home screen. This will create an email that you can send to the friend you’d like to have join Shuttersong. In the future you’ll be able to search for friends on other networks as well.
4. How do I report offensive or inappropriate behavior or content?
If you find a Shuttersong you believe violates our terms of service or community guidelines, tap the Shuttersong you wish to report, click on the “…” icon then tap Report/Flag. We will review the image and remove it if we determine it is does not comply with our policies. For more information, refer to the Shuttersong Community Guidelines located under Settings.
5. Why doesn’t the Android version have social features?
We decided to implement the iPhone version first but plan to have an Android version later in the summer. Unlike the iPhone, there are hundreds of different Android phones and we need to make sure the app works with all of them.
Here are some additional questions that users ask regularly. If you need further assistance email us at support@shuttersong.com.
General
Why do I need to give you my birth date?
Shuttersong users must be 13 years or older to use the app. We must verify your age to comply with local laws and regulations. If you sign in with Facebook your date of birth will be given to us automatically.
Why do you want to send me push notifications?
We use push notifications to improve your experience. For example, we will send notifications when someone likes or comments on one of your images or if your Shuttersong is selected as an Editor’s favorite.
How do I add or change my screen name?
From the Home screen click on the “Profile” icon (the person icon on the lower right of the screen) then tap the “Settings” icon (the gear in the upper right corner) and select “Edit Profile.”
How do I remove my account?
Email us at security@shuttersong.com with the username or email address you used to register and we will delete your account, including all Shuttersong images you created. Please note that we cannot delete images you shared to other social networks.
Our Social Network
How do I get people to follow me?
Invite your friends to join. Follow other people in the community stream. Like and comment on Shuttersongs in our community. As our community grows we’ll offer more ways to find friends and get people to follow.
Can I place a clickable link in a caption?
Yes you can place a link to any URL, including iTunes songs, YouTube videos or products in your caption. If you choose to add a link you should review that sites privacy policy, as it likely will be different than ours. 
Can I share Shuttersongs via other apps?
Yes. You can share your Shuttersongs on other social apps including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. You can also share a link by email or SMS. These choices are available on the Sharing screen. Shuttersongs that are shared cannot be deleted from third-party social networks.
How will I know if someone “Favorites” my Shuttersong?
If you allowed push notifications when you registered we will let you know when someone likes or comments on your Shuttersongs. If you did not allow push notifications, you can turn them on in the Privacy Settings from your Profile screen.
Privacy/Safety
What steps does Shuttersong take to keep children safe?
Shuttersong takes the privacy of children seriously. We comply with the United States Child Online Protection and Privacy Act (COPPA) by requiring users to enter their date of birth when they register for an account. You can use the parental settings in the phone to restrict use of the app or in-app store by your children regardless of their age.
How can I block someone from following me?
The ability to block users will be implemented in a future update. However, you can un-follow any user from the list of followers on your Profile page. Contact security@shuttersong.com if a user is harassing you or exhibiting other inappropriate behavior.
Who can see my Shuttersongs?
If your account is public, anyone who follows you can see your Shuttersongs. Public images may also appear in the Community feed as well. If you choose to make your account private, only people who you approve to follow you can see your Shuttersongs. Private Shuttersongs cannot be seen in the Community feed. If you switch your account to private, anyone who followed you before the change will now have to request to follow you.
Using Shuttersong
Can I create a Shuttersong with multiple images?
You can create a Shuttersong that includes multiple images you combined in a third-party app, like Pic Collage. However, at this time you cannot use apps like Flipagram or combine Shuttersong images within our app.
Is there a limit to how many Shuttersongs I can create?
No. You can create as many Shuttersongs as you like. Enjoy!
Why do I get this error message: “The song you selected is copy-protected. Please choose another song”?
Not all music you purchase and download can be shared. Some artists lock the music files, that is “copy protect,” to keep people from using their songs.
How do I add a particular part of a song to my Shuttersong?
There are two ways to do this after you have selected a song from your music library. If you know the start time of the song part, slide the circle along the line at the top of your screen until you see the exact time you want shown on the left. Or, at the bottom of the screen under the play arrow, you can move the small arrows left and right to select the start and end of the song. Pressing down on the blue area and dragging it allows you to move the entire 15 seconds of the song back or forth.
How do I get credits for the Shuttersong store?
Tap the “Store” icon from the home screen, select an image pack, and tap the “Buy” button. Follow the screen instructions to buy credits. One credit is US $0.99 or your local equivalent.
How do I delete a Shuttersong I no longer want?
Go to your profile from the Home screen to view your images. Select the Shuttersong you want to delete then tap the trash can icon.
Where are my Shuttersongs stored?
Shuttersongs are stored inside the app and on our server. We keep them in two places so friends who do not have the app can play images you send to them, and to restore your Shuttersongs after a software update or in the even you lose or damage your phone. We also store your original photos (without the audio) in an album called “Shuttersong Pictures,” which is accessible on your device.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.
