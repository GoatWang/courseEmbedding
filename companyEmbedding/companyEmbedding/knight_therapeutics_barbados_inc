ImpavidoSeptember 2009
Global (except US)
Treatment of visceral and cutaneous Leishmaniasis
Impavido® (miltefosine) is an alkyllysophospholipid analogue drug with in vitro activity against the promastigote and amastigote stages of Leishmania species. As an oral agent, it is registered in Germany, several countries in South America and the Indian subcontinent for the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Miltefosine was included in the WHO essential medicines list as an anti-leishmaniasis medicine in March 2011.

Treatment of visceral, cutaneous, and mucosal Leishmaniasis
U.S. FDA approval received on March 19, 2014. Commercialization plan currently under development.

ATryn®
Canada
Knight will be seeking an initial indication for ATryn in Canada for the prevention of peri-operative and peri-partum thromboembolic events in hereditary antithrombin deficient patients.
ATryn (recombinant antithrombin) is administered in a hospital setting to patients with a known hereditary antithrombin deficiency to help patients avoid peri-operative and peri-partum thromboembolic events. It is not indicated for treatment of thromboembolic events in hereditary antithrombin deficient patients. ATryn received approval in the United States from the FDA in 2009 and marketing authorization by the European Commission prior to that in 2006. Additional clinical trials with ATryn are being conducted in pregnant women who suffer from severe preeclampsia to determine the possible benefits of ATryn to both the mother and her unborn child. 

PHOTOFRIN®
Canada
In Canada, PHOTOFRIN® is indicated for the treatment of esophageal cancer, endobronchial cancer, high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus and papillary bladder cancer.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with PHOTOFRIN (porfimer sodium) is a two-stage process requiring administration of both drug and a light source. PHOTOFRIN belongs to a group of cancer-fighting medications known as antineoplastics. It kills cancer cells by making them more sensitive to the destructive effects of a laser light, which is aimed at them after injecting the medication. This is why the procedure is called photodynamic therapy. Additional clinical trials with PHOTOFRIN are being conducted in patients with cholangiocarcinoma who are not candidates for surgery.

EMPA will also have non-exclusive distribution rights in the other Gulf Cooperation Council ("GCC") countries. Knight may extend exclusivity on a country-by-country basis should certain minimum sales targets be met in each GCC country. Knight sold the rights to Neuragen® in the U.S. in June 2015 and retains the rights for all other territories.Under the terms of the agreement, EMPA will register, import, distribute and market the product in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and GCC countries while Knight will maintain responsibility for product supply.Michel Loustric, President of Knight Therapeutics (Barbados) Inc., stated, "I am delighted that EMPA Healthcare will be representing Knight in the promotion and distribution of Neuragen® in the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.

"We appreciate the trust that the Knight team have placed in us to make this important product available to patients experiencing peripheral nerve pain in the Middle East."About Neuragen®Neuragen® is formulated to relieve the symptoms of peripheral neuropathic pain. Unlike oral medications, it is a topical product that acts directly at the site of pain and is believed to work by reducing the spontaneous firing of damaged peripheral nerves. In a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study, Neuragen® was clinically shown to significantly reduce neuropathic pain quickly, and with fewer side effects than oral medications. Neuragen® is available as an over-the-counter product in most leading pharmacies across Canada and the United States. As such, Neuragen® represents an easy-to-access treatment option for the millions of consumers seeking symptomatic relief from this difficult to treat condition.
