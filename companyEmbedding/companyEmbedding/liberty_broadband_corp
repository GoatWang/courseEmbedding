This service uses AT&T infrastructure and is installed by an AT&T technician, you are required to use an AT&T supplied modem. This will be provided during your installation. See equipment rental pricing specific to your service at checkout. 


You will also receive an Analog Telephone Adaptor (ATA) for your phone service. The ATA equipment will be shipped to you from Sonic. If you need a phone, any landline telephone will do — here are a few of our recommendations.

 
Contract Terms

All Sonic services require a 12-month contract. Cancellations after 30 days of service will be subject to an early termination fee.

 
For locations within range, add an extra data line to go twice as fast with Fusion X2 for an additional $20 per month. You'll get the same, great features at twice the speed. We recommend a technician installation for X2 connections.






Additional Internet features


Dynamic IP address



Symmetric upload and download speeds


 
Phone Technology

VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) phone service 
Gigabit Fiber service comes with a Voice-Over-IP phone connection. Since it's not a traditional landline, we'll provide an Analog Telephone Adaptor (ATA) for your phone service to work. Your ATA is a small box placed on the outside of your home that allows you to convert your Internet connection to a telephone connection. Phone service will not work during a power outage, so you can also purchase a battery backup from Sonic for $99 after you’ve ordered service online, or you can order one through another vendor, such as Amazon. See specific battery requirements here.

 
Installation

Standard Gigabit Fiber installation is free of charge for new customers. A Sonic Technician will install service at your home - there is no self-install option.


In addition to our standard installation, customers may also choose a whole-home ethernet installation. 

 
Equipment

We want you to love your Sonic service, so our team has selected the best equipment for your connection with secure firewall protection and high-performing WiFi router. The equipment is fully supported by our award-winning customer care team, which includes necessary technician visits, some inside wiring and jack repair. We'll always replace it for free should you have any issues. See equipment rental pricing specific to your service at checkout.

General
Fusion FTTN
Billing
Help + Support










What's Fusion?





Sonic's fast and flexible residential or small business Internet + phone service. Depending on your location, we offer various Fusion products.Qualify your address to see what services are available to you.







Does Sonic offer any service without home phone?





We think it's important for everyone to have a home phone connection. So, we do not offer any services without home phone at this time.







Does Sonic offer a phone only option?





Yes, this service is called Voice-Only Fusion, and it is only available where Fusion service is available. To learn more, visit the Voice-Only Fusion page.







How fast is Fusion?





Sonic never caps or buffers your connection. Speeds vary depending on what technology is available at your location. Please use our availability tool to check the technologies and speeds available at your address. Bonded Fusion and Fusion X2 can expect up to twice the speed of Fusion.







What is Gigabit Fiber Internet (Fusion FTTH)?





Gigabit Fiber Internet is delivered through fiber optic cables, composed of strands of glass as thin as a human hair. These cables can transmit data at 1000 Megabits per second, which is approximately 100 times faster than the average Internet connection speed in the US.







What's the difference between Fusion FTTN and Fusion FTTH?





Fiber-to-the-Node (FTTN): Fiber service lines are fed to your neighborhood node, then copper service lines are connected to your home.
Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH or Gigabit Fiber): Fiber-optic cables are connected from your neighborhood LCP (Local Convergence Point) directly to an ONT (Optical Network Terminal) device in or just outside your home. What does this mean for you? Crazy-fast, consistent speeds with no limiting copper connectivity. FTTH is only available in certain locations.







What features are included with my Internet + Phone service?





Sonic offers these included features with all Internet + Phone connections.







Is my home security/alarm system service compatible with Sonic VoIP phone service?





Most home security systems are compatible with Sonic's Voice-over-Internet-Protocol phone service. Please contact your home security provider to confirm.











Why can't I use my own modem for Fusion FTTN?





Fusion FTTN is connected using AT&T's network and equipment. So the modem they supply is dependent upon what they require and deploy. Your modem is supplied during your installation.







Is IPv6 supported with Fusion FTTN?





Yes, the FTTN platform supports IPv6.







Can I use my existing phones?





You sure can! Any phone you would normally plug into a phone jack will work with Sonic's phone services. Just plug your phone into the analog telephone adaptor (ATA) we provide, which will be delivered to you via UPS.











How is billing for Fusion service managed?           





Fusion service is billed monthly to a credit or debit card. Recurring monthly service is billed in advance, and any applicable usage charges are billed in arrears. A credit or debit card is required.







Is there a contract?





All Sonic services require a 12-month contract. Cancellations after 30 days of service will be subject to an early termination fee. Fusion FTTN requires a 30 day notice of cancellation.







Where can I learn more about your billing policy?





Click here to read our full billing policy.











I'm having trouble signing up for my desired service. Who should I contact?





Please contact our Sonic sales team at 1-855-757-6111 or email sales@sonic.com – we're happy to help.







Who do I contact when I'm having issues with my service?





Sonic Support is available 8AM-10PM, 7 days a week. Please don't hesitate to contact our friendly Support team with any questions!

A corporation is a type of entity that is formed and regulated on a state level. The corporation is formed by filing Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State within the state of incorporation. Ownership in a corporation is expressed through the issuance of shares while the management of the corporation is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the shareholders.The board of directors select officers who manage the day to day activities of the corporation. The board of directors also will draft bylaws for the corporation Bylaws are basically written protocols that define the way that the corporation will be governed. Corporations are required to hold annual meetings for both the shareholders and the board of directors. The annual meetings are held to discuss and decide on important decisions that are faced by the corporation.

Commonly Asked Questions for starting a C Corporation




 Are Non-U.S. Residents Allowed to Own a Corporation or LLC?

There are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC. The S-Corporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders (owner), but any US citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder (owner). You would, of course, require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process, known as the registered agent address, but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC.



 In What State Should I Form my LLC or Corporation?

Unless you plan on having a large, multi-state operation, it is generally best to form your company in the state in which it is located.Generally speaking, most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business and/or a physical presence in that state. If you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located, you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign (out of state) company with your home state, which will subject you to all of the fees, taxes, and regulations of that state.



 What are the Differences Between Officers, Directors and Shareholders?

A corporation consists of all three: officers, directors and shareholders. Shareholders are the owners of the corporation and elect the directors. Directors guide and are involved in the fundamental decisions of the corporation on behalf of the shareholders. Officers are selected by the directors and run the day-to-day operations of the corporation. These do not need to be separate people. Any person can fill all three positions. In small businesses, one person can be the only shareholder, the only director, and the only officer.





 What is a C Corporation?


A C Corporation is a completely separate tax and legal entity from its owners, and owners who work in the business are treated and taxed as employees of the corporation (Note: The "C" in C Corporation refers to a sub chapter of the tax code; C Corporations are one of the most common forms of corporations, and they are frequently referred to generically as corporations).
C Corporations are subject to corporate income taxes separate from the owners, where most other forms of business entity allow for the company profits to "pass-through" to the personal income tax statements of the owners. As such, C Corporations are the most formal business entity and they have greater tax reporting responsibilities than other business entities. C Corporations allow for profits to be retained in the business, if desired, and frequently these profits can be taxed at a lower rate than personal income. C Corporations can also pay out after tax profits to its owners in the form of dividends, but this can also lead to double taxation.



 What is Stock Par Value?

Par value is a nominal dollar amount given to corporate shares. It doesn't necessarily reflect their real value, and is typically set at a low value (i.e. one dollar or one cent). The par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders, and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class. The shares can be sold to the initial shareholders, at par value or more, but the price must be the same for each share. Not all states require a par value. Unless you specify otherwise, IncFile will authorize 1500 shares (this is due to the fact that 1500 is easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) with a par value of one cent, or at no par value if not required by your state.



 What are Bylaws?

The bylaws of a corporation are an internal document that contains rules for holding corporate meetings and carrying out other formalities according to state corporate laws. Bylaws are not filed with the state.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy

                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our business, product and marketing strategies; new service offerings; the return on our investment in, and performance of, Charter Communications, Inc. ("Charter"); the ongoing integration of Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House's operations; the recoverability of our goodwill and other long-lived assets; our projected sources and uses of cash; and the anticipated non-material impact of certain contingent liabilities related to legal and tax proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. The following include some but not all of the factors (as they relate to our consolidated subsidiary and equity affiliate) that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated:  � the ability of Charter (as defined below) to sustain and grow revenue and cash flow from operations by offering video, Internet, voice, advertising and other services to residential and commercial customers, to adequately meet the customer experience demands in its markets and to maintain and grow its customer base, particularly in the face of increasingly aggressive competition, the need for innovation and the related capital expenditures;  � the impact of competition from other market participants, including but not limited to incumbent telephone companies, direct broadcast satellite operators, wireless broadband and telephone providers, digital subscriber line providers, fiber to the home providers, video provided over the Internet by (i) market participants that have not historically competed in the multichannel video business, (ii) traditional multichannel video distributors, and (iii) content providers that have historically licensed cable networks to multichannel video distributors, and providers of advertising over the Internet;  � general business conditions, economic uncertainty or downturn, high unemployment levels and the level of activity in the housing sector;  � Charter's ability to obtain programming at reasonable prices or to raise prices to offset, in whole or in part, the effects of higher programming costs (including retransmission consents);  � the development and deployment of new products and technologies, including cloud-based user interface, Spectrum Guide(R), and downloadable security for set top boxes and any other cloud-based consumer services and service platforms;  � failure to protect the security of personal information about the customers of our operating subsidiary and equity affiliate, subjecting us to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and reputational damage;  � changes in, or failure or inability to comply with, government regulations, including, without limitation, regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, and adverse outcomes from regulatory proceedings;  � the effects of governmental regulation on our business or potential business combination transactions;  � any events that disrupt Charter's networks, information systems or properties and impair its operating activities and negatively impact its reputation;  � the ability of suppliers and vendors to deliver products, equipment, software and services;  � the outcome of any pending or threatened litigation;  � availability of qualified personnel;  � changes in the nature of key strategic relationships with partners, vendors and joint venturers;  I-21  Table of Contents  � the availability and access, in general, of funds to meet debt obligations prior to or when they become due and to fund operations and necessary capital expenditures, either through (i) cash on hand, (ii) free cash flow, or (iii) access to the capital or credit markets;  � the ability of Charter and our company to comply with all covenants in our respective debt instruments, any violation of which, if not cured in a timely manner, could trigger a default of other obligations under cross-default provisions;  � our ability to successfully monetize certain of our assets;  � the ability of Charter to achieve the synergies and value creation contemplated by the Time Warner Cable Merger and the Bright House Transaction (each as defined below and collectively, the "Transactions");  � Charter's ability to promptly, efficiently and effectively integrate acquired operations;  � the ability of Charter to manage a significantly larger company than before the completion of the Transactions;  � diversion of management time on issues related to the integration of Time Warner Cable and Bright House's operations;  � changes in Charter's, Time Warner Cable's or Bright House's (as they each existed before the Transactions were completed) operations, businesses, future cash requirements, capital requirements, results of operations, revenues, financial condition and/or cash flows;  � disruption in the existing business relationships of Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House as a result of the Transactions;  � the increase in indebtedness as a result of the Transactions, which will increase interest expense and may decrease Charter's operating flexibility;  � operating costs and business disruption that may be greater than expected;  � the ability to retain and hire key personnel; and  � costs, disruptions and possible limitations on operating flexibility related to regulatory conditions applicable to Charter as a result of the Transactions.  For additional risk factors, please see Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. These forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.  The following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Additionally, see note 1 in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for an overview of new accounting standards that we have adopted or that we plan to adopt that have had or may have an impact on our financial statements.  Overview  During May 2014, the board of directors of Liberty Media Corporation and its subsidiaries ("Liberty") authorized management to pursue a plan to spin-off to its stockholders common stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary, Liberty Broadband Corporation ("Liberty Broadband"), and to distribute subscription rights to acquire shares of Liberty Broadband's common stock (the "Broadband Spin-Off"). At the time of the Broadband Spin-Off, Liberty Broadband was comprised of (i) Liberty's former interest in Charter Communications, Inc. ("Legacy Charter"),  I-22  Table of Contents  Warner Cable", "TWC", "Legacy Time Warner" or "Legacy TWC"), (iv) certain deferred tax liabilities, as well as liabilities related to the Time Warner Cable written call options and (v) initial indebtedness, pursuant to margin loans entered into prior to the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off. The Broadband Spin-Off was accounted for at historical cost due to the pro rata nature of the distribution to holders of Liberty common stock.  On May 18, 2016, Time Warner Cable merged with Legacy Charter (the "Time Warner Cable Merger"). In connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger, Legacy Charter underwent a corporate reorganization, resulting in CCH I, LLC, a former subsidiary of Legacy Charter ("Charter"), becoming the new publicly traded parent company. Also on May 18, 2016, the previously announced acquisition of Bright House Networks, LLC ("Bright House" or "Legacy Bright House") from Advance/Newhouse Partnership ("A/N") by Charter (the "Bright House Transaction") was completed. In connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger and Bright House Transaction, Liberty Broadband entered into certain agreements with Legacy Charter, Charter, Liberty Interactive Corporation ("Liberty Interactive") and Time Warner Cable. In connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger and Bright House Transaction, Liberty Broadband exchanged its shares of Time Warner Cable for shares of Charter and purchased additional shares of Charter. As a result, and pursuant to proxy agreements entered into with Liberty Interactive and A/N, Liberty Broadband controls 25.01% of the aggregate voting power of Charter. In addition, in connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger, Liberty Broadband funded its purchase of shares of Charter Class A common stock using proceeds of $4.4 billion related to subscriptions for approximately 78.3 million newly issued shares of Liberty Broadband Series C common stock.  The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Skyhook Holding, Inc. (formerly known as TruePosition, Inc.), was originally incorporated to provide technology for locating wireless phones and other mobile devices through a passive network overlay system using its patented U-TDOA technology ("U-TDOA service"). In February 2014, Skyhook Holding, Inc. acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Skyhook Wireless, Inc., which operates a global location network containing billions of geolocated Wi-Fi access points ("Wi-Fi location software solution") and cell towers that serve as the reference infrastructure for providing location services. In 2015, one of Skyhook Holding, Inc.'s customers, a wireless carrier utilizing the legacy U-TDOA service which accounted for approximately 80% - 90% of consolidated revenue at the time, gave notice that it planned to discontinue use of the U-TDOA service and did not intend to renew its contract, which expired on December 31, 2015. The loss of this customer had a material adverse effect on Skyhook Holding, Inc.'s business. As a result of the loss of this wireless carrier customer, further changes in the regulatory environment and a shift in the overall market for the legacy U-TDOA service, Skyhook Holding, Inc. ceased making further investment in its U-TDOA products. In 2016, Skyhook Holding, Inc. and Skyhook Wireless, Inc. combined operations in order to focus on the development and sale of the suite of location and context products, and are referred to collectively herein as "Skyhook."  The financial information represents a consolidation of the historical financial information of Skyhook, Liberty Broadband's interest in Charter, Liberty Broadband's former minority equity investment in Time Warner Cable and certain deferred tax liabilities. This financial information refers to the consolidation of the aforementioned subsidiary, investments, and financial instruments, as "Liberty Broadband," "the Company," "us," "we" and "our" here and in the notes to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.

A corporation is a type of entity that is formed and regulated on a state level. The corporation is formed by filing Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State within the state of incorporation. Ownership in a corporation is expressed through the issuance of shares while the management of the corporation is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the shareholders.The board of directors select officers who manage the day to day activities of the corporation. The board of directors also will draft bylaws for the corporation Bylaws are basically written protocols that define the way that the corporation will be governed. Corporations are required to hold annual meetings for both the shareholders and the board of directors. The annual meetings are held to discuss and decide on important decisions that are faced by the corporation.

Commonly Asked Questions for starting a C Corporation




 Are Non-U.S. Residents Allowed to Own a Corporation or LLC?

There are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC. The S-Corporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders (owner), but any US citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder (owner). You would, of course, require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process, known as the registered agent address, but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC.



 In What State Should I Form my LLC or Corporation?

Unless you plan on having a large, multi-state operation, it is generally best to form your company in the state in which it is located.Generally speaking, most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business and/or a physical presence in that state. If you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located, you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign (out of state) company with your home state, which will subject you to all of the fees, taxes, and regulations of that state.



 What are the Differences Between Officers, Directors and Shareholders?

A corporation consists of all three: officers, directors and shareholders. Shareholders are the owners of the corporation and elect the directors. Directors guide and are involved in the fundamental decisions of the corporation on behalf of the shareholders. Officers are selected by the directors and run the day-to-day operations of the corporation. These do not need to be separate people. Any person can fill all three positions. In small businesses, one person can be the only shareholder, the only director, and the only officer.





 What is a C Corporation?


A C Corporation is a completely separate tax and legal entity from its owners, and owners who work in the business are treated and taxed as employees of the corporation (Note: The "C" in C Corporation refers to a sub chapter of the tax code; C Corporations are one of the most common forms of corporations, and they are frequently referred to generically as corporations).
C Corporations are subject to corporate income taxes separate from the owners, where most other forms of business entity allow for the company profits to "pass-through" to the personal income tax statements of the owners. As such, C Corporations are the most formal business entity and they have greater tax reporting responsibilities than other business entities. C Corporations allow for profits to be retained in the business, if desired, and frequently these profits can be taxed at a lower rate than personal income. C Corporations can also pay out after tax profits to its owners in the form of dividends, but this can also lead to double taxation.



 What is Stock Par Value?

Par value is a nominal dollar amount given to corporate shares. It doesn't necessarily reflect their real value, and is typically set at a low value (i.e. one dollar or one cent). The par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders, and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class. The shares can be sold to the initial shareholders, at par value or more, but the price must be the same for each share. Not all states require a par value. Unless you specify otherwise, IncFile will authorize 1500 shares (this is due to the fact that 1500 is easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) with a par value of one cent, or at no par value if not required by your state.



 What are Bylaws?

The bylaws of a corporation are an internal document that contains rules for holding corporate meetings and carrying out other formalities according to state corporate laws. Bylaws are not filed with the state.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

Composite Score:





                        IncFile.com, LLC has received 4.7 out of 5 stars based on 13 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
