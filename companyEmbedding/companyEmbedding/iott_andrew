Globus Launches MONUMENT™ Anterior Spondylolisthesis Reduction System



May 30, 2014Steve HerzogOffAUDUBON, PA, May 29, 2014: Globus Medical, Inc. (NYSE:GMED), a leading musculoskeletal implant manufacturer, today announced the launch of MONUMENT™, a unique anterior lumbar interbody fusion device with a built-in mechanical feature designed to aid in spondylolisthesis reduction. The self-locking and threaded translational feature can be engaged to reduce the implant up to 8mm in situ and the screws are designed for optimal cortical purchase.
“MONUMENT™, with its threaded translational reduction feature, is designed to be more efficient for the surgeon by incorporating mechanized implant reduction with an integrated plate-spacer. Alternative procedures require additional steps in treating this challenging condition. Our new system includes all the benefits typical of an anterior lumbar interbody spacer with a large stabilizing surface area and large graft window to optimize fusion,” commented Andrew Iott, Senior Vice President of Product Development.
“The implant’s translational reduction feature performs exceptionally well. MONUMENT™ offers the benefits of an integrated ALIF system and simple, intuitive instruments combined with in-situ implant reduction, making it an attractive surgical solution for patients with spondylolisthesis,” commented Christopher Tomaras, MD, Neurosurgeon at Peachtree Neurosurgery in Atlanta, Georgia.
The MONUMENT™ Spacer is available in different sizes, heights and sagittal angles to accommodate
the lumbar and sacral spine, including L5-S1. The device is intended for use with supplemental fixation.
