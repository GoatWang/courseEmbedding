Terms of Service




















Authentication Services Description
All Authentication Services may be accessed only by Authorized Users and are subject to usage limitations and payment of applicable fees, as more fully set forth in the ValiMail Subscription Terms. 
 
ValiMail's Value Proposition 
ValiMail's service provides Email Authentication as a Service (EaaS). This provides you with the following: 


1)  Visibility into email sent globally claiming to come from your domain(s) _


2)  Improved deliverability thanks to proper authentication _


3)  Protection against email phishing attacks on your employees, clients, and brand _


 
ValiMail's extensive experience with both email and security has created a 'turn-key' solution that is fully automated and shields users from the complexities laid out in earlier sections. Through a unique approach and by partnering with key vendors, ValiMail has abstracted the steps and effort needed to set up DMARC to a simple 'point and click' configuration. Domain owners can configure their domain simply by selecting which third-party services they are using to send email. Power users, who may have their own internal email infrastructure, are supported through additional customization options in our ValiMail Pro service. 
The abstraction ValiMail has performed has several benefits. First, as explained above, it allows for simpler configuration of email authentication, making it accessible even to non-technical users. Second, by automating the process, ValiMail has been able to reduce the cost of implementation by several orders of magnitude. This has enabled ValiMail to offer a solution that is priced appropriately for any organization that wants a low cost, easy to implement DMARC solution. Third, the approach ValiMail has taken has allowed us to fix several existing issues with email authentication, most notably existing restriction on the number of partners who can legitimately send emails on your behalf (e.g., Salesforce, Zendesk, Marketo, Google apps, etc.) for a single domain. 
 
 
 
ValiMail Subscription Terms (last updated July 25, 2016)
The following terms and conditions (the 'Subscription Terms') are a legal contract between you and ValiMail. By selecting the 'agree' or 'accept' option or by using ValiMail's authentication services that are offered subject to these Subscription Terms, you are agreeing to be bound by these Subscription Terms. Please read them carefully before proceeding.
1. PARTIES
In these Subscription Terms, the words 'ValiMail,' 'we,' and 'us' refer to ValiMail Inc. The words 'Customer' and 'you' refer to the subscriber to our authentication services, whether an individual, corporation, or other entity. You may not use these services unless you accept these Subscription Terms and have the power and legal right to form a contract with us. Any individual subscribing to or using our services in the name of a company or other organization represents and warrants that he or she is authorized and intends by those actions to bind the company or other organization to these Subscription Terms.
2. DEFINITIONS
The following terms and any others defined in these Subscription Terms will be interpreted according to the definitions given.
2.1. 'Authentication Services' means the web-based services included in your subscription plan, as specified in the Order Form (and any applicable service description referenced in the Order Form), that are facilitated by ValiMail's cloud platform.
2.2.  'Authorized User' means you (if you are an individual) or an individual employee or agent of yours who has been assigned unique credentials to access and use the Authentication Services, whether or not that individual is accessing or using the Authentication Services at any particular time.
2.3.  'Order Form' means ValiMail's online or written order form or account setup form, as submitted by Customer and accepted by ValiMail, that specifies the trial or paid subscription plan being selected and that references these ValiMail Subscription Terms. 
3. SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES
3.1. Authorization. Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of these Subscription Terms, ValiMail will provide your Authorized Users with access to and use of the Authentication Services, during your free trial or paid-up subscription period set forth in the Order Form (and, if applicable, any paid-up Renewals under Section 6.1), solely for your internal business purposes related to email authentication in accordance with ValiMail's relevant end-user documentation. 
3.2. Usage Limits. Your and your Authorized Users' use of the Authentication Services is further subject to the usage limitations indicated in the Order Form or in ValiMail's applicable service description referenced therein or provided by ValiMail (for example, limits on the number of domains).
3.3. Customer Responsibilities. You are responsible for: (i) maintaining the confidentiality of any user IDs, passwords and other credentials associated with your account, (ii) all activities that occur with respect to your account, (iii) your and your Authorized Users' use of the Authentication Services and compliance with these Subscription Terms, and (iv) any Customer-furnished data. You are also responsible for modifying the DNS records or other necessary settings for your domains, as outlined in ValiMail's documentation, in order to enable the Authentication Services for those domains, and, at the end of your subscription, restoring those records or settings to their original state.
3.4. Restrictions. You may not: (i) copy, reproduce, modify, decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer the Authentication Services or any associated software or materials (except to the extent that applicable law prohibits or restricts reverse engineering restrictions); (ii) provide any third parties with access to any of the Authentication Services, or use any of the Authentication Services for time sharing or similar purposes for the benefit of any third party; (iii) remove any copyright or proprietary notices contained in the Authentication Services or any output thereof; (iv) breach, disable or tamper with, or develop or use (or attempt) any workaround for, any security measure provided or used by the Authentication Services; (v) access the Authentication Services via any bot, web crawler or non-human user; or (vi) access or use (or permit a third party to access or use) the Authentication Services for any unlawful purpose or for purposes of monitoring the availability, performance or functionality of the Authentication Services or for any other benchmarking or competitive purposes.
3.5. Maintenance and Support. If the Order Form or ValiMail's associated service description provides for Customer to receive maintenance and/or technical support in connection with the Authentication Services, then (unless otherwise set forth in the Order Form or service description): (i) such maintenance will consist of access to new features or performance improvements in the Authentication Services if and when ValiMail makes any such features or improvements generally available to its subscriber base at no additional charge, and (ii) such technical support will consist of first-level telephone or email assistance in accordance with ValiMail's Service Level Agreement attached to or referenced in the Order Form.  
4. PLATFORM AND DATA SECURITY
ValiMail's Authentication Services do not utilize, and do not require, any personally identifiable information or the content of any emails authenticated by the Authentication Services. ValiMail will employ commercially reasonable environmental, safety and facility procedures, data security procedures and other safeguards to protect against the unauthorized accessing, use, destruction, corruption, loss or alteration of the Authentication Services and any Customer-furnished data stored on ValiMail's servers. 
5. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
5.1. Provision of Services.  If indicated in the Order Form, and subject to Customer's timely payment of all corresponding fees, ValiMail will provide Customer with the initial assessment and implementation services, consulting services, and/or other professional services that are specified in the Order Form (and any applicable service description referenced therein) in connection with Customer's use of the Authentication Services. Customer will provide such cooperation and assistance as ValiMail may reasonably request in order to facilitate the performance of any such professional services.
5.2. Contacts. Each party will designate in writing the individual who will be its primary point of contact for matters relating to any professional services to be performed thereunder. A party may designate replacement contacts by written notice to the other party.
5.3. Deliverables. If any professional services involve the delivery of reports, documents or other deliverables, Customer will be free to use such deliverables for its internal business purposes, subject to the applicable confidentiality provisions of these Subscription Terms. The parties acknowledge, however, that the professional services do not involve any custom development, and will not be construed as transferring (or as requiring ValiMail to transfer) to Customer any intellectual property rights in any deliverables or other work product.  
6. TERM AND TERMINATION 
6.1. Duration and Renewal. If you are using the Authentication Services on a free trial basis, that subscription will expire at the end of the trial period specified in the Order Form or, if earlier, upon commencement of your paid subscription if you purchase one. If you have a paid subscription for the Authentication Services, it will remain in effect throughout the subscription term specified in the Order Form (unless terminated as set forth below). Except as otherwise specified in the Order Form your subscription to the Authentication Services will automatically renew for successive one-year periods (each, a 'Renewal') unless either party gives the other party written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days in advance. These Subscription Terms will expire at the end of your subscription as described above.
6.2. Termination. A party may terminate these Subscription Terms for a material breach by the other party that remains uncured more than 30 days after receiving written notice of the breach. In addition, ValiMail may suspend these Subscription Terms and the provision of the Authentication Services 10 business days following Customer's receipt of written notice that it is late in paying an invoice (which notice shall also serve as notice that Customer is in material breach of these Subscription Terms). Your subscription for the Authentication Services will automatically terminate upon any termination of these Subscription Terms.
6.3. Survival. The following provisions will survive expiration or termination of these Subscription Terms: Sections 0, 6.3, 7 (to the extent of any outstanding payments), 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 15. 
7. FEES AND PAYMENT
7.1. Fees.  In consideration for ValiMail providing the Authentication Services and any agreed-upon professional services, Customer shall pay to ValiMail the corresponding fees set forth in the Order Form.
7.2. Renewal Fees. For each subscription Renewal, Customer will pay for the Authentication Services consistent with the subscription-fee rates specified in the Order Form or, if applicable, such other rates as ValiMail may establish by written notice to Customer at least 60 days prior to the Renewal. If the use of the Authentication Services under Customer's account exceeds any usage limitations that apply to Customer's subscription, then (without limiting ValiMail's other remedies) the Renewal fee will be increased to cover the higher level of usage at ValiMail's then-current rates.
7.3. Invoices; Payment.  ValiMail shall invoice Customer in advance at the beginning of the subscription period and each Renewal. Each invoice is due and payable thirty (30) days following the invoice date.  Overdue payments will accrue interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month, but in no event greater than the highest rate of interest allowed by law.
7.4.  Taxes.  The fees specified in these Subscription Terms are exclusive of taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, VAT) (collectively, 'Taxes'). Customer shall be responsible for payment of all Taxes and any related interest and/or penalties resulting from any payments made hereunder, other than ValiMail's U.S. federal and state income taxes. Such Taxes will be itemized in the applicable invoice.  
8. OWNERSHIP
As between ValiMail and Customer, the Authentication Services and all software, data and technologies embodied in or used to provide the Authentication Service, and all intellectual property rights therein or relating thereto, are and shall remain the exclusive property of ValiMail. Without limiting the foregoing, ValiMail reserves all rights with respect to any technical or analytic data gathered by or used to provide the Authentication Services.
9. CONFIDENTIALITY
9.1. Obligations. 'Confidential Information' means (subject to the exclusions below) any non-public information relating to or disclosed in the course of the Authentication Services that should be reasonably understood to be confidential. The receiving party will use the same care to protect Confidential Information as it uses for its own similar information, but no less than reasonable care, will not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without prior written authorization, and will use Confidential Information only for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations or exercising its rights expressly reserved or granted under these Subscription Terms. The receiving party will promptly return or destroy the other party's Confidential Information upon request. 
9.2. Exclusions. Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) was already in possession of the receiving party without confidentiality restrictions at the time of receipt from the other party, as evidenced by written records; or (iii) was independently developed by the receiving party without violation of this Section. If a receiving party is required to disclose Confidential Information by law, the receiving party will promptly notify the disclosing party and reasonably cooperate with its efforts to limit or protect the required disclosure, but will otherwise not be in violation of this Section on account of making the required disclosure.
10.   SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT
If Customer's subscription includes service-level commitments, and the Order Form accordingly specifies that ValiMail's Service Level Agreement applies, Customer will be entitled to the commitments and remedies set forth in such Service Level Agreement as attached to or referenced in the Order Form. The remedies expressly provided in the Service Level Agreement are Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and ValiMail's entire obligation, with respect to any service-level violation. 
11.   DISCLAIMER
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THESE SUBSCRIPTION TERMS (AND WITHOUT LIMITING REMEDIES TO WHICH CUSTOMER MAY BE ENTITLED UNDER THE SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT, IF APPLICABLE), THE AUTHENTICATION SERVICES AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE,' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE. VALIMAIL DISCLAIMS, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
12.   INDEMNIFICATION
12.1.  By ValiMail.  ValiMail will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Customer against any damages awarded by a court in connection with claims, demands, suits or proceedings ('Claims') made or brought by a third party against Customer to the extent based upon an allegation that the Authentication Services, as furnished by ValiMail hereunder and used by Customer within the scope of these Subscription Terms, infringe any copyright or any U.S. patent or trademark rights of any third party. THE FOREGOING STATES THE ENTIRE OBLIGATION OF VALIMAIL WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED OR ACTUAL INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS BY THE AUTHENTICATION SERVICES. ValiMail shall have no liability under this Section 12.1 to the extent that any Claims are based on any combination of the Authentication Services with products, services, methods, content or other elements not furnished by ValiMail unless such combination is necessary for the intended use of the Authentication Services, or any use of the Authentication Services in a manner that violates these Subscription Terms or the instructions given to Customer by ValiMail.
12.2.  Mitigation Measures. In the event of any Claim or potential Claim covered by Section 12.1, ValiMail may, in its discretion, seek to mitigate the impact of such Claim by modifying the Authentication Services to make them non-infringing, and/or by suspending or terminating Customer's use of the Authentication Services upon reasonable notice to Customer (provided, in the case of such suspension or termination, that ValiMail will refund to Customer a portion of fees prepaid by Customer for the then-current subscription period, prorated to the portion of that subscription period that is affected by the suspension or termination). 
12.3.  Indemnification by Customer. Customer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless ValiMail against any Claims arising from or related to any Customer-furnished data or Customer's use of the Authentication Services in violation of these Subscription Terms or any applicable ValiMail end-user documentation.  
12.4.  Procedures. Each party's indemnity obligations are subject to the following: (i) the aggrieved party will promptly notify the indemnifier in writing of the applicable Claim; (ii) the indemnifier will have sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations with respect to the Claim (provided that the indemnifier may not settle any Claim in a manner that would impair any of the aggrieved party's rights or interests without prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld); and (iii) the aggrieved party will, at the indemnifier's expense, provide all cooperation, information and assistance reasonably requested by the indemnifier for the defense of such Claim.
13.   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
13.1.  Waiver of Certain Damages. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR INFORMATION, OR COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, ARISING OUT OF THESE SUBSCRIPTION TERMS OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
13.2.  Liability Cap. EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS OWED UNDER SECTION 7, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THESE SUBSCRIPTION TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER TO VALIMAIL UNDER THESE SUBSCRIPTION TERMS FOR THE SERVICE PERIOD TO WHICH SUCH DAMAGES PERTAIN.  
13.3.  Exceptions. Nothing in this Section 13 shall limit or waive a party's: (i) liability for any breach of its confidentiality obligations under these Subscription Terms; (ii) liability for its infringement or misappropriation of any proprietary rights of the other party; or (iii) indemnification obligations under Section 12.
14.   PUBLICITY
14.1.  Identification of Customer. ValiMail may identify Customer, by name and (upon Customer's approval) by logo, as a customer of the Authentication Services on ValiMail's website and other marketing materials.
14.2.  Case Study. Provided Customer is satisfied with the Authentication Services, ValiMail may develop a case study for public dissemination and marketing use by ValiMail describing the benefits Customer has derived from the Authentication Services. Customer will reasonably cooperate with such case study. Publishing shall be subject to Customer's prior written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld.
15.   MISCELLANEOUS
15.1.  Assignment.  Neither party may assign these Subscription Terms without the other party's prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may transfer these Subscription Terms together with all Order Forms (and subject to any usage limitations therein) upon written notice to the other party: (i) to any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, the transferring party, where "control" means direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 50% of the voting interest of the subject entity; or (ii) to any entity acquiring the transferring party, with which the transferring party is merging or to which the transferring party sells all or substantially all of its assets. ValiMail shall have the right to increase amounts charged to Customer in the event of any transfer by Customer that increases the cost of providing the Authentication Services or reduces the amount received by ValiMail. Any attempt to assign these Subscription Terms, except as permitted under this Section, will be null and of no effect.  Subject to the foregoing, these Subscription Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's successors and permitted assigns.
15.2.  Force Majeure.  Neither party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance (other than non-payment of amounts owing) due to causes beyond its reasonable control.    
15.3.  Export Compliance.  Customer agrees to comply fully with all relevant export laws and regulations of the United States and other applicable jurisdictions to ensure that neither the Authentication Services, nor any direct product thereof, are: (i) exported or re-exported directly or indirectly in violation of such export laws and regulations; or (ii) used for any purposes prohibited by the such export laws and regulations. 
15.4.  Government Rights. If Customer is the U.S. government or any agency or other division thereof, ValiMail's services are furnished under these Subscription Terms as a "commercial item," as that term is defined and used in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (48 C.F.R. ¤ 2.101) and other applicable regulations, and the government's rights with respect to the services (and to any associated software, technical data or other materials) are limited to those expressly granted in these Subscription Terms.
15.5.  Severability.  If any part of these Subscription Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, in whole or in part, by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of these Subscription Terms will remain in full force and effect, and the provision affected will be construed so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible by law. 
15.6.  Waiver.  The waiver of a breach of any provision of these Subscription Terms will not operate or be interpreted as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach of that or any other provision.  
15.7.  Notices.  All notices permitted or required under these Subscription Terms shall be in writing, will reference these Subscription Terms, and shall be delivered in person, by overnight courier or express delivery service, or by first class, registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, or by confirmed email delivery, to the address of the party specified on the Order Form or such other address as either party may specify in writing. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given upon receipt. 
15.8.  Governing Law.  These Subscription Terms will be governed by both the substantive and procedural laws of California, excluding its conflict of law rules and the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods. Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Subscription Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Northern District of California and the parties irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.
15.9.  Revisions to Subscription Terms. ValiMail may change these Subscription Terms and its policies from time to time. We may inform you of any such changes by posting the revised version to our website at the same URL as the original version. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, any such changes will take effect for the Authentication Services upon the next Renewal if we have posted or otherwise informed you of the revision prior to the deadline for giving non-renewal notice.
15.10. Entire Agreement. Any amendment or modification to these Subscription Terms must be in writing signed by both parties. These Subscription Terms constitute the entire agreement and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements regarding the subject matter hereof.
 
 
ValiMail Service Level Agreement
This ValiMail Service Level Agreement ('SLA') pertains to the subscription agreement for Authentication Services between ValiMail and Customer that incorporates this SLA by reference (the 'Agreement'). All capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Agreement. This SLA terminates or expires upon any termination or expiration of the Agreement.
 
1.          Service Availability
We conduct maintenance and upgrades during scheduled times. Outside of these times we guarantee 99.9% uptime for the Authentication Services, excluding downtime outside of ValiMail's reasonable control. For any month in which we fail to provide the guaranteed uptime, we will, upon your written request, issue you a service credit against any renewal fees in an amount equal to 10% of the effective monthly Authentication Services subscription fee (equal to 1/12 of any annual Authentication Services subscription fee) that you paid for the affected month.  
The scheduled time for maintenance is 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. PST/PDT, and may be used by us with no advance notification to you.   
We may expand these scheduled times provided that we notify you at least one day in advance.  In addition, in the event that we in our sole discretion determine that any unscheduled maintenance is necessary, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you.
The rights and remedies granted under this SLA apply to you only if you are a current subscriber of the Authentication Services.
This SLA describes your sole remedy, and our entire obligation, if we fail to satisfy our uptime guarantee.  This SLA does not diminish or override the disclaimer of warranties in the Agreement to which this SLA is attached (except as expressly stated therein).
2.          Technical Support
We will provide commercially reasonable telephone and/or email assistance for general advice and technical support, as well as technical assistance and remediation for operational issues, consistent with the level of support that ValiMail generally offers at no additional charge to users of the Authentication Services.

Privacy Policy




















Effective Date: April 13, 2016

Privacy Policy
ValiMail Inc. provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of our website (this 'Site') and our email authentication services (which, together with our Site, are collectively referred to as the 'Services'). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Services. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes.
 
By using our Services you are consenting to our policies regarding your information, and the ways in which we may collect, use, process, transfer and otherwise deal with that information, as described in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.
 
1.         Information Collection and Use
 
Personally Identifiable Information
 
o   In the course of using our Services, you may provide us with personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ('Personal Information'). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, billing information, email address and home and business street addresses. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide our services and administer your inquiries. For example, when you register with us through the Site, we will ask you for Personal Information to associate with your account.
 
o   We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your account (for example, your zip code or individual preferences) ('Non-Identifying Information').
 
o   We use your Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information (in some cases, in conjunction with one another) mainly to provide the Services, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries. We may also use Non-Identifying Information for more general purposes such as to plan and measure the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and to identify ways to improve or change our Services.
 
o   Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are not Personal Information on their own or when combined only with other Non-Identifying Information (for example, combining your zip code with your viewing preferences).
 
o   We may also use your Personal Information to contact you with ValiMail newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your 'user preferences' information. See 'Changing or Deleting Information,' below, for more detail.
 
Log Data. When you visit the Site, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a 'ValiMail User'), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ('Log Data'). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the Services' technical administration, to increase our Site's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Services to our visitors' needs. For example, some of this information may be collected so that when you visit the Site again, it can recognize you and display Site content that is appropriate to your interests or needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.
 
DMARC and DNS Data. The ValiMail email authentication service operates based on data automatically forwarded to our servers regarding email purporting to be sent from or to the Internet domains that we service. This data is primarily generated and received using common technical standards and protocols known as Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC), Domain Name System (DNS), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Sender Policy Framework (SPF). This data includes DMARC aggregate reports, DMARC failure reports, and logs of DNS requests for DMARC, DKIM and SPF records. Reports such as DMARC failure reports, which inform us of failed email transmissions, may contain some header information or content from the affected email message (depending on the receiving domain's email system settings), but we use any such information only to provide our service to the operator of the domain from which the email purports to originate. The other DMARC and DNS-related reports and logs do not provide any information that we consider Personal Information, although some of this data does allow us to determine the originating or delivering domain, the originating IP address, and/or the service provider used to send an email message. We log this information and use it for operational and analytics purposes.
 
2.         Cookies and Web Beacons
Like many websites, we use 'cookies' to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may link the information we store in cookies to the Personal Information you submit while on our Site.
We use session ID cookies for session management, to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services, and to monitor aggregate usage by ValiMail Users and web traffic routing on the Services. We may also use persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of our Services.
We also use 'web beacons,' 'pixel tags,' 'clear GIFs' or similar means ('Web Beacons') on our Site. A Web Beacon is an electronic image, often a single pixel, embedded on web pages. Web Beacons are ordinarily not visible to users. Web Beacons allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services and to generate statistics about how our Site is used.
 
3.         Information Sharing and Disclosure
 
Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information, Log Data and DMARC and DNS data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.
 
Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our services, to provide our services on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (for example, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, improvement of the Services' features, and communications with users of our Services) or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and we do not authorize them to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
 
Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. ValiMail cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of ValiMail or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
Business Transfers. ValiMail may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.
 
4.         Changing or Deleting Your Information
Registered ValiMail users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by logging into their account and changing the preferences associated with their account. If you completely delete all such information, your account may be deactivated. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
 
5.         Security
ValiMail is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored 'personal data' (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
 
6.         International Transfer
Your information may be transferred to and processed and stored on computers, networks and other equipment located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. This includes our own computers and networks as well as those of the cloud-based service providers that provide much of our Services' infrastructure. This equipment may be located within and/or outside of the United States. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of any information represents your agreement to the transfer of that information as described above.
 
7.         Our Policy Toward Children
This Site is not directed to children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@valimail.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.
 
8.         Phishing
Identity theft and the practice currently known as 'phishing' are of great concern to ValiMail. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in an unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website.
 
9.         Links to Other Sites
Our Services may contain links to other websites. If you choose to click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a third-party website or allow advertising of (or otherwise refer to) third-party products or services on our Services is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third-party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
 
10.         Do-not-Track Signals
While our Site at this time does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, such as "do not track" instructions, you can generally express your privacy preferences regarding the use of most cookies and similar technologies through your web browser, as indicated elsewhere in this privacy policy.
 
11.       Contacting Us 
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: privacy@valimail.com.
