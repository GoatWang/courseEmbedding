What a blessing! My two little ones ended up with an issue at the same time...as I was recovering from my own surgery. Rushing out of the house to sit at an Urgent Care center was just not an option. I contacted PediaQ and within minutes I got a response. Soon after, a friendly and knowledgeable nurse arrived. She came complete with what seemed to be a full doctor's office worth of supplies and equipment in her bag ready to take on anything. I even received a personalized text the next day following up. I HIGHLY recommend PediaQ. They saved the day!
- Jennifer, Dallas


We had absolutely the best experience possible on our first visit. I put in a request. Received a phone call from my nurse within 5 minutes letting me know when she would arrive. She (an experienced pediatric nurse practitioner) arrived as expected, examined my child, diagnosed her quickly, and put in the script to the pharmacy. No leaving the house when my girl felt so bad. No waiting... waiting... waiting some more at a yucky, dirty clinic. I can't say enough about how positive our experience was. My husband and daughter were really impressed too.
- Brandi, Dallas


This service is a life changer. With in 45 minutes of initially downloading this app our nurse had come and gone! If i had gone to urgent care, i may have still been waiting in a waiting room exposing my other healthy child to illnesses there. Our nurse treated our son with meds she had on hand (no pharmacy hassle!) and was so helpful, informative but most of all kind. She immediately took to our son offering him comfort and was sweet and loving. My son was cooperative and at ease since he was in his own home surrounded by his toys during his exam. Cannot recommend this enough. I'm hooked. Thank you to whomever created this app and to all PediaQ's employees, its a life saver.
- Anne, Dallas


PediaQ was prompt and VERY professional!!! The nurse was excellent with my daughter and even gave her a little teddy bear (which has not left my daughters side, even went to to game with us!) It's hard to see us , in the future, choosing to get all kids out (including the one who's sick) and waiting in Dr's office, instead of bringing the knowledgeable nurse directly to my child at home. PediaQ is the way to go!
- Cheri, Dallas


I had the opportunity to use PediaQ today and had a wonderful experience! My daughter had been up all night sick and we couldn't get in to see our pediatrician today so I gave it a shot. Within minutes of making a request, via the app, a Nurse Practitioner called to get details about what was going on. She arrived shortly after and did a full examination of my sick little girl while she was laying on our sofa still comfy in her pj's. The PediaQ NP even brought her a Q Bear (sweet little teddy bear) to help break the ice, that my daughter loves and hasn't put down since! Here's the best part, not only did she call in our prescription, she went to pick it up for us! With my husband traveling, 1 sick kiddo, trying to make dinner for my other kiddo and it pouring rain, I was beyond thankful!!! Thank you, PediaQ! We will definitely use your service again! Hopefully not too soon, though.
- Amy, Dallas

Does PediaQ Accept Insurance?
Yes, we accept most major insurance plans

PediaQ now accepts managed care insurance. If you have a valid credit card associated with your health savings account (HSA), you can use it as the form of payment for all of your PediaQ visits.
As with any other medical visit, your insurance provider will determine services that are covered by your plan. PediaQ will submit a claim to your insurance provider and notify you of any services that were not covered.
Fees that are the responsibility of the user may include co-pays, deductibles, convenience fees, or other fees that are not reimbursable by your managed care insurance carrier.
For additional information, visit our price list or help page.


About using your insurance
Please note that health insurance is intended to cover some, but not all of the cost of your child's health care. Most plans require co-payments, deductibles and/or co-insurance expenses, which must be paid by the patient. It is important for you to become familiar with your insurance policy and understand what services your policy covers. This will allow you to receive the maximum benefits of your specific insurance plan. Please bring your child's insurance card with you to each visit.
Please note that contracts are subject to change without notice. Insurance directories may not provide the most current provider listings. Please contact your insurance company with questions regarding your plan participation. This list is provided for informational purposes only and does not guarantee payment of medical claims.

We will say “yes” unless a law requires us to share that information.





                        Get a list of those with whom we’ve shared information

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                Y
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
