				“I have had the good fortune to work with FP in several different contexts: as a working partner doing two acquisitions, as an investor in my company, and as a member of my board.   They were instrumental in our most significant acquisition that more than doubled the value of the company.   I was most impressed by their representation on the board and their day to day willingness to work at all levels in building a more valuable company.” 
Brian NeSmith, President & CEO  Blue Coat Systems
