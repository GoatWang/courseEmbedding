Company history[edit]




Tucows headquarters in Toronto


Scott Swedorski started Tucows in 1993 to provide users with downloads of both freeware and trial versions of shareware. The name originally was an acronym for "The Ultimate Collection Of Winsock Software".[4] Internet Direct, owned and operated by John Nemanic, Bill Campbell, and Colin Campbell, acquired Tucows in 1996.[4] STI Ventures acquired Tucows in 1999.[4]
The company employed roughly 30 employees in Flint, Michigan, in 1998 with additional employees in Canada.[citation needed] For several years Scott Swedorski personally oversaw day-to-day activity in the Flint office located in the White House building on Beecher Road.[citation needed]
In 2000, Tucows acquired Linux Weekly News.[5]
In 2001, Tucows became a wholly owned subsidiary of Infonautics, and afterwards Infonautics changed its own name to Tucows,[6] a business tactic called a "reverse takeover". On August 26, 2002, Tucows sold eLibrary and Encyclopedia.com, its search and reference services properties inherited from Infonautics, to Alacritude.[6]
In 2004, Tucows acquired Boardtown Corporation, a billing software provider.
On August 19, 2005 Tucows went public[7] on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange.
In January 2006, Tucows completed its acquisition of certain assets of Critical Path, an outsourced email services provider.
In June 2006 Tucows paid $18 million to purchase Mailbank.com Inc, a company that owns over 17,000 domain names for common surnames, such as smith.net and brown.org. Mailbank generates income from ads on its websites (from domain parking) and also from customers who want e-mail accounts with their surname in the domain name.
On June 15, 2006, Noss disclosed that the portfolio of NetIdentity's domain names acquired by Tucows represents at least 68% of surnames in the United States and Europe, and that the cost of the acquisition was $18 million.[8] On February 19, 2008 Tucows announced that they were launching a "Personal Names Service" using their portfolio of 39,000 domain names.[9] "The launch of the Personal Names Service marks the complete integration of the surname assets we acquired with NetIdentity into our wholesale channel", said Elliot Noss, President and CEO of Tucows.[9]
On August 26, 2006, Tucows won an eBay auction for the web calendar site Kiko.com. The company planned to roll Kiko's features into their existing email platform.[10]
On July 27, 2007, Tucows acquired ItsYourDomain.com (IYD), another privately held ICANN-accredited wholesale registrar offering domain services through a network of over 2,500 affiliates with over 700,000 domains under management, paying US$10.35 million.[11] ItsYourDomain.com managed 699,951 domains compared to Tucows's 5,919,987, at the time of the sale in July 2007 ItsYourDomain.com's monthly growth of 29,181 exceeded Tucows growth of 21,126.[12]
By June 2008, Tucows had a total of three domain name registration services called ItsYourDomain (IYD), NetIdentity, and DomainDirect. Tucows decided to discontinue these three services, and merge them into one new domain name registration service, called Hover. Hover is a simple domain name registration service powered by Tucows Inc, that started in July 2008. All IYD, DomainDirect, and NetIdentity customers are fulfilled by Hover.com.[13]
On November 6, 2008, Tucows announced that they were launching Butterscotch.com, an online video network with video tutorials to explain Internet technology, starting with 35 video tutorials and plans to reach 500 clips by Spring 2009.[14] On October 14, 2011, Butterscotch.com producer Sean Carruthers stated production had been shut down.[15]
In December 2014, Tucows launched RealNames, offering e-mail service using domain names acquired from Mailbank.com Inc.
On January 20, 2017, the company acquired eNom for $83.5 million, making Tucows the second-largest domain registrar in the world.[16]
Business lines[edit]
Tucows is the second-largest ICANN-accredited registrar in the world and the largest publicly traded registrar.[12]
In July 2008, Tucows rebranded its wholesale services as "Open SRS".[17]
Domain portfolio management[edit]
Tucows has three sources of income from its domain portfolio: 1) Advertising from pages of domains within their domain name portfolio;[18] 2) Sales of domains from their portfolio, which is constantly being replenished;[19] 3) Auction of the steady stream of thousands of domain names that expire every day and become available for resale.[20]
In November 14, 2007, Tucows disclosed that they offer pay-per-click advertising on the pages of domains within their domain name portfolio.[18] When a user types one of these domain names into the address of the browser (direct navigation), they are presented with dynamically generated links which are pay-per-click advertising.[18] Every time a user clicks on one of the links listed on a web page, it generates revenue for Tucows through its partnership with third parties who provide syndicated pay-per-click results.[18]
On February 7, 2008, Tucows disclosed that it had switched from Google Ads to a new advertising partner in 2007, which led to a one-third increase in its revenue.[21]
On May 7, 2008, Tucows announced it put a process in place for the regular sale of direct navigation names.[22] These domain names would come from names that expire each month from customers who decide they no longer want the domain names and that Tucows is able to select the ones they want to keep from these domain names.[23]
Tucows announced on June 12, 2008, that they have reached an agreement with Afternic to auction Tucows’ large daily inventory of expired domain names.[20] "We have over eight million domains under management and thousands expiring every day, so this deal provides us with a great way to share revenue with our resellers while participating in Afternic’s popular secondary domain name marketplace”, said Bill Sweetman, General Manager of Tucows Domain Portfolio.[20] Tucows will share 10% of the gross sale price with the reseller for the sale of expired domains that were originally registered through the reseller.[24] Revenue will be shared automatically without the reseller having to take any additional action.[24] Tucows chose Afternic as a partner even though SnapNames with Register.com and NameJet with NetSol/eNom are the dominant players in expired domains.[25]
On October 29, 2008, Tucows announced that it would begin direct sales from their inventory of premium domain names under the brand name of Yummy Names.[26] The service was created especially for marketers to obtain a high-quality domain name from Tucows inventory.[26] Customers have the option of purchasing a premium domain name outright or leasing the name.[26] In 2009 one of Tucows' subsidiaries, Buydomains Holdings, sold another premium domain name for a record $50,000 for Myhomepage.com.[27]
On February 20, 2008, Tucows announced a portfolio of over 1,000 "gems", or domain names that have the high potential value such as "Jewellers.com", "Actresses.com", "BasketballPlayers.com", and "ProjectManagers.com".[28]
In February 2008, Tucows successfully defended against an arbitration proceeding over Batchelor.com, which it had acquired as part of its NetIdentity purchase. The complaint had been filed by Ken Batchelor Cadillac Company, a car dealership. A National Arbitration Forum panel determined that the dealership had not established rights in the mark "Batchelor". In fact, Tucows has won all surname-related arbitration proceedings.[29]
In 2007, Weidner Investment Services filed a complaint claiming that Weidner was its trademark or service mark and asked the National Arbitration Forum to order the transfer of Weidner.com from Tucows to Weidner.[30] Tucows failed to respond, and the National Arbitration Forum ordered Tucows to transfer Weidner.com to Weidner Investment Services.[30]
In January 2017, eNom was sold to Canadian domain seller Tucows for $83.5M Canadian.[31][32]
Email services[edit]
Tucows provides millions of email boxes through their network of over 9,000 service providers.[33] Customers of Tucows fully hosted email service are provided with POP3, IMAP, WAP and webmail access.[33] Providers using Tucows Email Service have the option of using Tucows' spam and virus filtering with their current email infrastructure.[33]
As part of the NetIdentity acquisition, Tucows had problems migrating retail customers' email from a third-party provider to Tucows in-house mail systems in September 2006.[34]
Starting August 12, 2008, Tucows Email Service running on their servers designated as Cluster A experienced a multi-day outage lasting until August 15, 2008.[35][36] On October 6, 2008, Cluster A again suffered another multi-day outage affecting at least 50% of users and at times all users.[37] As of the afternoon of October 9, 2008, this cluster was still partially down ("degraded") preventing an unknown number of users from being able to retrieve email.[38]
Retail services[edit]
Tucows sells services to consumers and small businesses and offers personalized email through net identity.[21] Tucows also offers customers hosting and other services with NetIdentity. Tucows also expected to receive income for pay per click advertising revenue from domain parking the surnames.[8]
Mobile phone services[edit]
In February 2012, Tucows launched a new mobile phone business called Ting, which resells voice and data services on Sprint and T-Mobile networks.[39] As of March 2017[update], the service has approximately 250,000 subscribers.[40]
Fiber Internet services[edit]
On December 15, 2014, Ting announced it was buying ISP Blue Ridge InternetWorks of Charlottesville, Virginia, which was already building fiber Internet.[41] They began offering symmetrical gigabit fiber internet without bandwidth caps. Since expanding the existing fiber network in Charlottesville, Ting has also launched a similar service in Westminster, Maryland and Holly Springs, North Carolina. Ting also announced plans to expand into Sandpoint, Idaho and Centennial, Colorado in 2017.
De-emphasis and divestment of business lines[edit]
De-emphasis of software downloads[edit]
Tucows maintains a download archive that includes more than 30,000 software titles in its worldwide network of partner sites. Although some listing features now have fees, basic listing remains free. Tucows founder Scott Swedorski announced his resignation in November 2003.[4] On March 10, 2006, Tucows Content division closed its satellite office located in Flint, Michigan, and relocated the remaining editorial functions to its corporate head office in Toronto. On February 7, 2008, Tucows disclosed that Tucows plans to de-emphasize the software download aspect of their business.[21]
Divestment of web hosting accounts[edit]
On May 6, 2008, Tucows announced that they are getting out of the web hosting business.[42] As part of the divestment Tucows signed an agreement for Hostopia to purchase about 14,000 Domain Direct, NetIdentity and ItsYourDomain.com (IYD) customer web hosting accounts and would migrate the web hosting accounts to Hostopia's unified web service platform by July 2008.[42]
Divestment of equity interest in Afilias[edit]
On November 5, 2008, Tucows announced that it was selling its entire 7.38% equity interest in Afilias for $7.4 million.[43] Afilias is the registry operator of the .info and .aero TLDs, and the service provider of the .org generic top-level domain (gTLD), .mobi mobile phone TLD, and a provider of domain name registry services for several countries around the world, including .AG (Antigua and Barbuda), .BZ (Belize), .GI (Gibraltar), .HN (Honduras), .IN (India), .ME (Montenegro), .SC (the Seychelles), and .VC (St. Vincent and the Grenadines).[44]
Reputation[edit]
Domain name add grace period (AGP) abuse[edit]
On January 8, 2008, Tucows explained its values and position on domain name front running: "We work to uphold the rights of Registrants. That means, for example, not putting 60-day locks on domains when a Registrant makes a change to their WHOIS information effectively locking some into a renewal and blocking domain name transfers to other Registrars. That also means having a clear, defined policy surrounding expiry and redemption periods."[45] Tucows addresses domain tasting "by charging our Resellers a monetary fee on domain name registrations that are cancelled within the five-day Add Grace Period (AGP)", but it "doesn’t use WHOIS query data or search data from our API to front-run domain names".[45]
Although it supports ICANN’s fee to discourage domain tasting and Google's decision to drop names added and deleted during the AGP from its AdSense program, Tucows claimed that AGP abuse could be further curbed by shortening the AGP period to 12 hours or less, sufficient time for registrants to correct spelling mistakes—AGP's original purpose.[46]
Registrations to sites selling illegal goods[edit]
In 2015, the U.S. Trade Representative included Tucows on its annual "notorious markets" list—the first time it has named a domain name registrar—in order to set an example for what happens to registrars that do not block or suspend sites that sell illegal goods.[47] Tucows responded that it suspended dozens of sites every day, but that "unlike some competitors, it considered all complaints carefully to ensure they were justified".[48]

Company history[edit]




Tucows headquarters in Toronto


Scott Swedorski started Tucows in 1993 to provide users with downloads of both freeware and trial versions of shareware. The name originally was an acronym for "The Ultimate Collection Of Winsock Software".[4] Internet Direct, owned and operated by John Nemanic, Bill Campbell, and Colin Campbell, acquired Tucows in 1996.[4] STI Ventures acquired Tucows in 1999.[4]
The company employed roughly 30 employees in Flint, Michigan, in 1998 with additional employees in Canada.[citation needed] For several years Scott Swedorski personally oversaw day-to-day activity in the Flint office located in the White House building on Beecher Road.[citation needed]
In 2000, Tucows acquired Linux Weekly News.[5]
In 2001, Tucows became a wholly owned subsidiary of Infonautics, and afterwards Infonautics changed its own name to Tucows,[6] a business tactic called a "reverse takeover". On August 26, 2002, Tucows sold eLibrary and Encyclopedia.com, its search and reference services properties inherited from Infonautics, to Alacritude.[6]
In 2004, Tucows acquired Boardtown Corporation, a billing software provider.
On August 19, 2005 Tucows went public[7] on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange.
In January 2006, Tucows completed its acquisition of certain assets of Critical Path, an outsourced email services provider.
In June 2006 Tucows paid $18 million to purchase Mailbank.com Inc, a company that owns over 17,000 domain names for common surnames, such as smith.net and brown.org. Mailbank generates income from ads on its websites (from domain parking) and also from customers who want e-mail accounts with their surname in the domain name.
On June 15, 2006, Noss disclosed that the portfolio of NetIdentity's domain names acquired by Tucows represents at least 68% of surnames in the United States and Europe, and that the cost of the acquisition was $18 million.[8] On February 19, 2008 Tucows announced that they were launching a "Personal Names Service" using their portfolio of 39,000 domain names.[9] "The launch of the Personal Names Service marks the complete integration of the surname assets we acquired with NetIdentity into our wholesale channel", said Elliot Noss, President and CEO of Tucows.[9]
On August 26, 2006, Tucows won an eBay auction for the web calendar site Kiko.com. The company planned to roll Kiko's features into their existing email platform.[10]
On July 27, 2007, Tucows acquired ItsYourDomain.com (IYD), another privately held ICANN-accredited wholesale registrar offering domain services through a network of over 2,500 affiliates with over 700,000 domains under management, paying US$10.35 million.[11] ItsYourDomain.com managed 699,951 domains compared to Tucows's 5,919,987, at the time of the sale in July 2007 ItsYourDomain.com's monthly growth of 29,181 exceeded Tucows growth of 21,126.[12]
By June 2008, Tucows had a total of three domain name registration services called ItsYourDomain (IYD), NetIdentity, and DomainDirect. Tucows decided to discontinue these three services, and merge them into one new domain name registration service, called Hover. Hover is a simple domain name registration service powered by Tucows Inc, that started in July 2008. All IYD, DomainDirect, and NetIdentity customers are fulfilled by Hover.com.[13]
On November 6, 2008, Tucows announced that they were launching Butterscotch.com, an online video network with video tutorials to explain Internet technology, starting with 35 video tutorials and plans to reach 500 clips by Spring 2009.[14] On October 14, 2011, Butterscotch.com producer Sean Carruthers stated production had been shut down.[15]
In December 2014, Tucows launched RealNames, offering e-mail service using domain names acquired from Mailbank.com Inc.
On January 20, 2017, the company acquired eNom for $83.5 million, making Tucows the second-largest domain registrar in the world.[16]
Business lines[edit]
Tucows is the second-largest ICANN-accredited registrar in the world and the largest publicly traded registrar.[12]
In July 2008, Tucows rebranded its wholesale services as "Open SRS".[17]
Domain portfolio management[edit]
Tucows has three sources of income from its domain portfolio: 1) Advertising from pages of domains within their domain name portfolio;[18] 2) Sales of domains from their portfolio, which is constantly being replenished;[19] 3) Auction of the steady stream of thousands of domain names that expire every day and become available for resale.[20]
In November 14, 2007, Tucows disclosed that they offer pay-per-click advertising on the pages of domains within their domain name portfolio.[18] When a user types one of these domain names into the address of the browser (direct navigation), they are presented with dynamically generated links which are pay-per-click advertising.[18] Every time a user clicks on one of the links listed on a web page, it generates revenue for Tucows through its partnership with third parties who provide syndicated pay-per-click results.[18]
On February 7, 2008, Tucows disclosed that it had switched from Google Ads to a new advertising partner in 2007, which led to a one-third increase in its revenue.[21]
On May 7, 2008, Tucows announced it put a process in place for the regular sale of direct navigation names.[22] These domain names would come from names that expire each month from customers who decide they no longer want the domain names and that Tucows is able to select the ones they want to keep from these domain names.[23]
Tucows announced on June 12, 2008, that they have reached an agreement with Afternic to auction Tucows’ large daily inventory of expired domain names.[20] "We have over eight million domains under management and thousands expiring every day, so this deal provides us with a great way to share revenue with our resellers while participating in Afternic’s popular secondary domain name marketplace”, said Bill Sweetman, General Manager of Tucows Domain Portfolio.[20] Tucows will share 10% of the gross sale price with the reseller for the sale of expired domains that were originally registered through the reseller.[24] Revenue will be shared automatically without the reseller having to take any additional action.[24] Tucows chose Afternic as a partner even though SnapNames with Register.com and NameJet with NetSol/eNom are the dominant players in expired domains.[25]
On October 29, 2008, Tucows announced that it would begin direct sales from their inventory of premium domain names under the brand name of Yummy Names.[26] The service was created especially for marketers to obtain a high-quality domain name from Tucows inventory.[26] Customers have the option of purchasing a premium domain name outright or leasing the name.[26] In 2009 one of Tucows' subsidiaries, Buydomains Holdings, sold another premium domain name for a record $50,000 for Myhomepage.com.[27]
On February 20, 2008, Tucows announced a portfolio of over 1,000 "gems", or domain names that have the high potential value such as "Jewellers.com", "Actresses.com", "BasketballPlayers.com", and "ProjectManagers.com".[28]
In February 2008, Tucows successfully defended against an arbitration proceeding over Batchelor.com, which it had acquired as part of its NetIdentity purchase. The complaint had been filed by Ken Batchelor Cadillac Company, a car dealership. A National Arbitration Forum panel determined that the dealership had not established rights in the mark "Batchelor". In fact, Tucows has won all surname-related arbitration proceedings.[29]
In 2007, Weidner Investment Services filed a complaint claiming that Weidner was its trademark or service mark and asked the National Arbitration Forum to order the transfer of Weidner.com from Tucows to Weidner.[30] Tucows failed to respond, and the National Arbitration Forum ordered Tucows to transfer Weidner.com to Weidner Investment Services.[30]
In January 2017, eNom was sold to Canadian domain seller Tucows for $83.5M Canadian.[31][32]
Email services[edit]
Tucows provides millions of email boxes through their network of over 9,000 service providers.[33] Customers of Tucows fully hosted email service are provided with POP3, IMAP, WAP and webmail access.[33] Providers using Tucows Email Service have the option of using Tucows' spam and virus filtering with their current email infrastructure.[33]
As part of the NetIdentity acquisition, Tucows had problems migrating retail customers' email from a third-party provider to Tucows in-house mail systems in September 2006.[34]
Starting August 12, 2008, Tucows Email Service running on their servers designated as Cluster A experienced a multi-day outage lasting until August 15, 2008.[35][36] On October 6, 2008, Cluster A again suffered another multi-day outage affecting at least 50% of users and at times all users.[37] As of the afternoon of October 9, 2008, this cluster was still partially down ("degraded") preventing an unknown number of users from being able to retrieve email.[38]
Retail services[edit]
Tucows sells services to consumers and small businesses and offers personalized email through net identity.[21] Tucows also offers customers hosting and other services with NetIdentity. Tucows also expected to receive income for pay per click advertising revenue from domain parking the surnames.[8]
Mobile phone services[edit]
In February 2012, Tucows launched a new mobile phone business called Ting, which resells voice and data services on Sprint and T-Mobile networks.[39] As of March 2017[update], the service has approximately 250,000 subscribers.[40]
Fiber Internet services[edit]
On December 15, 2014, Ting announced it was buying ISP Blue Ridge InternetWorks of Charlottesville, Virginia, which was already building fiber Internet.[41] They began offering symmetrical gigabit fiber internet without bandwidth caps. Since expanding the existing fiber network in Charlottesville, Ting has also launched a similar service in Westminster, Maryland and Holly Springs, North Carolina. Ting also announced plans to expand into Sandpoint, Idaho and Centennial, Colorado in 2017.
De-emphasis and divestment of business lines[edit]
De-emphasis of software downloads[edit]
Tucows maintains a download archive that includes more than 30,000 software titles in its worldwide network of partner sites. Although some listing features now have fees, basic listing remains free. Tucows founder Scott Swedorski announced his resignation in November 2003.[4] On March 10, 2006, Tucows Content division closed its satellite office located in Flint, Michigan, and relocated the remaining editorial functions to its corporate head office in Toronto. On February 7, 2008, Tucows disclosed that Tucows plans to de-emphasize the software download aspect of their business.[21]
Divestment of web hosting accounts[edit]
On May 6, 2008, Tucows announced that they are getting out of the web hosting business.[42] As part of the divestment Tucows signed an agreement for Hostopia to purchase about 14,000 Domain Direct, NetIdentity and ItsYourDomain.com (IYD) customer web hosting accounts and would migrate the web hosting accounts to Hostopia's unified web service platform by July 2008.[42]
Divestment of equity interest in Afilias[edit]
On November 5, 2008, Tucows announced that it was selling its entire 7.38% equity interest in Afilias for $7.4 million.[43] Afilias is the registry operator of the .info and .aero TLDs, and the service provider of the .org generic top-level domain (gTLD), .mobi mobile phone TLD, and a provider of domain name registry services for several countries around the world, including .AG (Antigua and Barbuda), .BZ (Belize), .GI (Gibraltar), .HN (Honduras), .IN (India), .ME (Montenegro), .SC (the Seychelles), and .VC (St. Vincent and the Grenadines).[44]
Reputation[edit]
Domain name add grace period (AGP) abuse[edit]
On January 8, 2008, Tucows explained its values and position on domain name front running: "We work to uphold the rights of Registrants. That means, for example, not putting 60-day locks on domains when a Registrant makes a change to their WHOIS information effectively locking some into a renewal and blocking domain name transfers to other Registrars. That also means having a clear, defined policy surrounding expiry and redemption periods."[45] Tucows addresses domain tasting "by charging our Resellers a monetary fee on domain name registrations that are cancelled within the five-day Add Grace Period (AGP)", but it "doesn’t use WHOIS query data or search data from our API to front-run domain names".[45]
Although it supports ICANN’s fee to discourage domain tasting and Google's decision to drop names added and deleted during the AGP from its AdSense program, Tucows claimed that AGP abuse could be further curbed by shortening the AGP period to 12 hours or less, sufficient time for registrants to correct spelling mistakes—AGP's original purpose.[46]
Registrations to sites selling illegal goods[edit]
In 2015, the U.S. Trade Representative included Tucows on its annual "notorious markets" list—the first time it has named a domain name registrar—in order to set an example for what happens to registrars that do not block or suspend sites that sell illegal goods.[47] Tucows responded that it suspended dozens of sites every day, but that "unlike some competitors, it considered all complaints carefully to ensure they were justified".[48]

Company history[edit]




Tucows headquarters in Toronto


Scott Swedorski started Tucows in 1993 to provide users with downloads of both freeware and trial versions of shareware. The name originally was an acronym for "The Ultimate Collection Of Winsock Software".[4] Internet Direct, owned and operated by John Nemanic, Bill Campbell, and Colin Campbell, acquired Tucows in 1996.[4] STI Ventures acquired Tucows in 1999.[4]
The company employed roughly 30 employees in Flint, Michigan, in 1998 with additional employees in Canada.[citation needed] For several years Scott Swedorski personally oversaw day-to-day activity in the Flint office located in the White House building on Beecher Road.[citation needed]
In 2000, Tucows acquired Linux Weekly News.[5]
In 2001, Tucows became a wholly owned subsidiary of Infonautics, and afterwards Infonautics changed its own name to Tucows,[6] a business tactic called a "reverse takeover". On August 26, 2002, Tucows sold eLibrary and Encyclopedia.com, its search and reference services properties inherited from Infonautics, to Alacritude.[6]
In 2004, Tucows acquired Boardtown Corporation, a billing software provider.
On August 19, 2005 Tucows went public[7] on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange.
In January 2006, Tucows completed its acquisition of certain assets of Critical Path, an outsourced email services provider.
In June 2006 Tucows paid $18 million to purchase Mailbank.com Inc, a company that owns over 17,000 domain names for common surnames, such as smith.net and brown.org. Mailbank generates income from ads on its websites (from domain parking) and also from customers who want e-mail accounts with their surname in the domain name.
On June 15, 2006, Noss disclosed that the portfolio of NetIdentity's domain names acquired by Tucows represents at least 68% of surnames in the United States and Europe, and that the cost of the acquisition was $18 million.[8] On February 19, 2008 Tucows announced that they were launching a "Personal Names Service" using their portfolio of 39,000 domain names.[9] "The launch of the Personal Names Service marks the complete integration of the surname assets we acquired with NetIdentity into our wholesale channel", said Elliot Noss, President and CEO of Tucows.[9]
On August 26, 2006, Tucows won an eBay auction for the web calendar site Kiko.com. The company planned to roll Kiko's features into their existing email platform.[10]
On July 27, 2007, Tucows acquired ItsYourDomain.com (IYD), another privately held ICANN-accredited wholesale registrar offering domain services through a network of over 2,500 affiliates with over 700,000 domains under management, paying US$10.35 million.[11] ItsYourDomain.com managed 699,951 domains compared to Tucows's 5,919,987, at the time of the sale in July 2007 ItsYourDomain.com's monthly growth of 29,181 exceeded Tucows growth of 21,126.[12]
By June 2008, Tucows had a total of three domain name registration services called ItsYourDomain (IYD), NetIdentity, and DomainDirect. Tucows decided to discontinue these three services, and merge them into one new domain name registration service, called Hover. Hover is a simple domain name registration service powered by Tucows Inc, that started in July 2008. All IYD, DomainDirect, and NetIdentity customers are fulfilled by Hover.com.[13]
On November 6, 2008, Tucows announced that they were launching Butterscotch.com, an online video network with video tutorials to explain Internet technology, starting with 35 video tutorials and plans to reach 500 clips by Spring 2009.[14] On October 14, 2011, Butterscotch.com producer Sean Carruthers stated production had been shut down.[15]
In December 2014, Tucows launched RealNames, offering e-mail service using domain names acquired from Mailbank.com Inc.
On January 20, 2017, the company acquired eNom for $83.5 million, making Tucows the second-largest domain registrar in the world.[16]
Business lines[edit]
Tucows is the second-largest ICANN-accredited registrar in the world and the largest publicly traded registrar.[12]
In July 2008, Tucows rebranded its wholesale services as "Open SRS".[17]
Domain portfolio management[edit]
Tucows has three sources of income from its domain portfolio: 1) Advertising from pages of domains within their domain name portfolio;[18] 2) Sales of domains from their portfolio, which is constantly being replenished;[19] 3) Auction of the steady stream of thousands of domain names that expire every day and become available for resale.[20]
In November 14, 2007, Tucows disclosed that they offer pay-per-click advertising on the pages of domains within their domain name portfolio.[18] When a user types one of these domain names into the address of the browser (direct navigation), they are presented with dynamically generated links which are pay-per-click advertising.[18] Every time a user clicks on one of the links listed on a web page, it generates revenue for Tucows through its partnership with third parties who provide syndicated pay-per-click results.[18]
On February 7, 2008, Tucows disclosed that it had switched from Google Ads to a new advertising partner in 2007, which led to a one-third increase in its revenue.[21]
On May 7, 2008, Tucows announced it put a process in place for the regular sale of direct navigation names.[22] These domain names would come from names that expire each month from customers who decide they no longer want the domain names and that Tucows is able to select the ones they want to keep from these domain names.[23]
Tucows announced on June 12, 2008, that they have reached an agreement with Afternic to auction Tucows’ large daily inventory of expired domain names.[20] "We have over eight million domains under management and thousands expiring every day, so this deal provides us with a great way to share revenue with our resellers while participating in Afternic’s popular secondary domain name marketplace”, said Bill Sweetman, General Manager of Tucows Domain Portfolio.[20] Tucows will share 10% of the gross sale price with the reseller for the sale of expired domains that were originally registered through the reseller.[24] Revenue will be shared automatically without the reseller having to take any additional action.[24] Tucows chose Afternic as a partner even though SnapNames with Register.com and NameJet with NetSol/eNom are the dominant players in expired domains.[25]
On October 29, 2008, Tucows announced that it would begin direct sales from their inventory of premium domain names under the brand name of Yummy Names.[26] The service was created especially for marketers to obtain a high-quality domain name from Tucows inventory.[26] Customers have the option of purchasing a premium domain name outright or leasing the name.[26] In 2009 one of Tucows' subsidiaries, Buydomains Holdings, sold another premium domain name for a record $50,000 for Myhomepage.com.[27]
On February 20, 2008, Tucows announced a portfolio of over 1,000 "gems", or domain names that have the high potential value such as "Jewellers.com", "Actresses.com", "BasketballPlayers.com", and "ProjectManagers.com".[28]
In February 2008, Tucows successfully defended against an arbitration proceeding over Batchelor.com, which it had acquired as part of its NetIdentity purchase. The complaint had been filed by Ken Batchelor Cadillac Company, a car dealership. A National Arbitration Forum panel determined that the dealership had not established rights in the mark "Batchelor". In fact, Tucows has won all surname-related arbitration proceedings.[29]
In 2007, Weidner Investment Services filed a complaint claiming that Weidner was its trademark or service mark and asked the National Arbitration Forum to order the transfer of Weidner.com from Tucows to Weidner.[30] Tucows failed to respond, and the National Arbitration Forum ordered Tucows to transfer Weidner.com to Weidner Investment Services.[30]
In January 2017, eNom was sold to Canadian domain seller Tucows for $83.5M Canadian.[31][32]
Email services[edit]
Tucows provides millions of email boxes through their network of over 9,000 service providers.[33] Customers of Tucows fully hosted email service are provided with POP3, IMAP, WAP and webmail access.[33] Providers using Tucows Email Service have the option of using Tucows' spam and virus filtering with their current email infrastructure.[33]
As part of the NetIdentity acquisition, Tucows had problems migrating retail customers' email from a third-party provider to Tucows in-house mail systems in September 2006.[34]
Starting August 12, 2008, Tucows Email Service running on their servers designated as Cluster A experienced a multi-day outage lasting until August 15, 2008.[35][36] On October 6, 2008, Cluster A again suffered another multi-day outage affecting at least 50% of users and at times all users.[37] As of the afternoon of October 9, 2008, this cluster was still partially down ("degraded") preventing an unknown number of users from being able to retrieve email.[38]
Retail services[edit]
Tucows sells services to consumers and small businesses and offers personalized email through net identity.[21] Tucows also offers customers hosting and other services with NetIdentity. Tucows also expected to receive income for pay per click advertising revenue from domain parking the surnames.[8]
Mobile phone services[edit]
In February 2012, Tucows launched a new mobile phone business called Ting, which resells voice and data services on Sprint and T-Mobile networks.[39] As of March 2017[update], the service has approximately 250,000 subscribers.[40]
Fiber Internet services[edit]
On December 15, 2014, Ting announced it was buying ISP Blue Ridge InternetWorks of Charlottesville, Virginia, which was already building fiber Internet.[41] They began offering symmetrical gigabit fiber internet without bandwidth caps. Since expanding the existing fiber network in Charlottesville, Ting has also launched a similar service in Westminster, Maryland and Holly Springs, North Carolina. Ting also announced plans to expand into Sandpoint, Idaho and Centennial, Colorado in 2017.
De-emphasis and divestment of business lines[edit]
De-emphasis of software downloads[edit]
Tucows maintains a download archive that includes more than 30,000 software titles in its worldwide network of partner sites. Although some listing features now have fees, basic listing remains free. Tucows founder Scott Swedorski announced his resignation in November 2003.[4] On March 10, 2006, Tucows Content division closed its satellite office located in Flint, Michigan, and relocated the remaining editorial functions to its corporate head office in Toronto. On February 7, 2008, Tucows disclosed that Tucows plans to de-emphasize the software download aspect of their business.[21]
Divestment of web hosting accounts[edit]
On May 6, 2008, Tucows announced that they are getting out of the web hosting business.[42] As part of the divestment Tucows signed an agreement for Hostopia to purchase about 14,000 Domain Direct, NetIdentity and ItsYourDomain.com (IYD) customer web hosting accounts and would migrate the web hosting accounts to Hostopia's unified web service platform by July 2008.[42]
Divestment of equity interest in Afilias[edit]
On November 5, 2008, Tucows announced that it was selling its entire 7.38% equity interest in Afilias for $7.4 million.[43] Afilias is the registry operator of the .info and .aero TLDs, and the service provider of the .org generic top-level domain (gTLD), .mobi mobile phone TLD, and a provider of domain name registry services for several countries around the world, including .AG (Antigua and Barbuda), .BZ (Belize), .GI (Gibraltar), .HN (Honduras), .IN (India), .ME (Montenegro), .SC (the Seychelles), and .VC (St. Vincent and the Grenadines).[44]
Reputation[edit]
Domain name add grace period (AGP) abuse[edit]
On January 8, 2008, Tucows explained its values and position on domain name front running: "We work to uphold the rights of Registrants. That means, for example, not putting 60-day locks on domains when a Registrant makes a change to their WHOIS information effectively locking some into a renewal and blocking domain name transfers to other Registrars. That also means having a clear, defined policy surrounding expiry and redemption periods."[45] Tucows addresses domain tasting "by charging our Resellers a monetary fee on domain name registrations that are cancelled within the five-day Add Grace Period (AGP)", but it "doesn’t use WHOIS query data or search data from our API to front-run domain names".[45]
Although it supports ICANN’s fee to discourage domain tasting and Google's decision to drop names added and deleted during the AGP from its AdSense program, Tucows claimed that AGP abuse could be further curbed by shortening the AGP period to 12 hours or less, sufficient time for registrants to correct spelling mistakes—AGP's original purpose.[46]
Registrations to sites selling illegal goods[edit]
In 2015, the U.S. Trade Representative included Tucows on its annual "notorious markets" list—the first time it has named a domain name registrar—in order to set an example for what happens to registrars that do not block or suspend sites that sell illegal goods.[47] Tucows responded that it suspended dozens of sites every day, but that "unlike some competitors, it considered all complaints carefully to ensure they were justified".[48]

Company history[edit]




Tucows headquarters in Toronto


Scott Swedorski started Tucows in 1993 to provide users with downloads of both freeware and trial versions of shareware. The name originally was an acronym for "The Ultimate Collection Of Winsock Software".[4] Internet Direct, owned and operated by John Nemanic, Bill Campbell, and Colin Campbell, acquired Tucows in 1996.[4] STI Ventures acquired Tucows in 1999.[4]
The company employed roughly 30 employees in Flint, Michigan, in 1998 with additional employees in Canada.[citation needed] For several years Scott Swedorski personally oversaw day-to-day activity in the Flint office located in the White House building on Beecher Road.[citation needed]
In 2000, Tucows acquired Linux Weekly News.[5]
In 2001, Tucows became a wholly owned subsidiary of Infonautics, and afterwards Infonautics changed its own name to Tucows,[6] a business tactic called a "reverse takeover". On August 26, 2002, Tucows sold eLibrary and Encyclopedia.com, its search and reference services properties inherited from Infonautics, to Alacritude.[6]
In 2004, Tucows acquired Boardtown Corporation, a billing software provider.
On August 19, 2005 Tucows went public[7] on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange.
In January 2006, Tucows completed its acquisition of certain assets of Critical Path, an outsourced email services provider.
In June 2006 Tucows paid $18 million to purchase Mailbank.com Inc, a company that owns over 17,000 domain names for common surnames, such as smith.net and brown.org. Mailbank generates income from ads on its websites (from domain parking) and also from customers who want e-mail accounts with their surname in the domain name.
On June 15, 2006, Noss disclosed that the portfolio of NetIdentity's domain names acquired by Tucows represents at least 68% of surnames in the United States and Europe, and that the cost of the acquisition was $18 million.[8] On February 19, 2008 Tucows announced that they were launching a "Personal Names Service" using their portfolio of 39,000 domain names.[9] "The launch of the Personal Names Service marks the complete integration of the surname assets we acquired with NetIdentity into our wholesale channel", said Elliot Noss, President and CEO of Tucows.[9]
On August 26, 2006, Tucows won an eBay auction for the web calendar site Kiko.com. The company planned to roll Kiko's features into their existing email platform.[10]
On July 27, 2007, Tucows acquired ItsYourDomain.com (IYD), another privately held ICANN-accredited wholesale registrar offering domain services through a network of over 2,500 affiliates with over 700,000 domains under management, paying US$10.35 million.[11] ItsYourDomain.com managed 699,951 domains compared to Tucows's 5,919,987, at the time of the sale in July 2007 ItsYourDomain.com's monthly growth of 29,181 exceeded Tucows growth of 21,126.[12]
By June 2008, Tucows had a total of three domain name registration services called ItsYourDomain (IYD), NetIdentity, and DomainDirect. Tucows decided to discontinue these three services, and merge them into one new domain name registration service, called Hover. Hover is a simple domain name registration service powered by Tucows Inc, that started in July 2008. All IYD, DomainDirect, and NetIdentity customers are fulfilled by Hover.com.[13]
On November 6, 2008, Tucows announced that they were launching Butterscotch.com, an online video network with video tutorials to explain Internet technology, starting with 35 video tutorials and plans to reach 500 clips by Spring 2009.[14] On October 14, 2011, Butterscotch.com producer Sean Carruthers stated production had been shut down.[15]
In December 2014, Tucows launched RealNames, offering e-mail service using domain names acquired from Mailbank.com Inc.
On January 20, 2017, the company acquired eNom for $83.5 million, making Tucows the second-largest domain registrar in the world.[16]
Business lines[edit]
Tucows is the second-largest ICANN-accredited registrar in the world and the largest publicly traded registrar.[12]
In July 2008, Tucows rebranded its wholesale services as "Open SRS".[17]
Domain portfolio management[edit]
Tucows has three sources of income from its domain portfolio: 1) Advertising from pages of domains within their domain name portfolio;[18] 2) Sales of domains from their portfolio, which is constantly being replenished;[19] 3) Auction of the steady stream of thousands of domain names that expire every day and become available for resale.[20]
In November 14, 2007, Tucows disclosed that they offer pay-per-click advertising on the pages of domains within their domain name portfolio.[18] When a user types one of these domain names into the address of the browser (direct navigation), they are presented with dynamically generated links which are pay-per-click advertising.[18] Every time a user clicks on one of the links listed on a web page, it generates revenue for Tucows through its partnership with third parties who provide syndicated pay-per-click results.[18]
On February 7, 2008, Tucows disclosed that it had switched from Google Ads to a new advertising partner in 2007, which led to a one-third increase in its revenue.[21]
On May 7, 2008, Tucows announced it put a process in place for the regular sale of direct navigation names.[22] These domain names would come from names that expire each month from customers who decide they no longer want the domain names and that Tucows is able to select the ones they want to keep from these domain names.[23]
Tucows announced on June 12, 2008, that they have reached an agreement with Afternic to auction Tucows’ large daily inventory of expired domain names.[20] "We have over eight million domains under management and thousands expiring every day, so this deal provides us with a great way to share revenue with our resellers while participating in Afternic’s popular secondary domain name marketplace”, said Bill Sweetman, General Manager of Tucows Domain Portfolio.[20] Tucows will share 10% of the gross sale price with the reseller for the sale of expired domains that were originally registered through the reseller.[24] Revenue will be shared automatically without the reseller having to take any additional action.[24] Tucows chose Afternic as a partner even though SnapNames with Register.com and NameJet with NetSol/eNom are the dominant players in expired domains.[25]
On October 29, 2008, Tucows announced that it would begin direct sales from their inventory of premium domain names under the brand name of Yummy Names.[26] The service was created especially for marketers to obtain a high-quality domain name from Tucows inventory.[26] Customers have the option of purchasing a premium domain name outright or leasing the name.[26] In 2009 one of Tucows' subsidiaries, Buydomains Holdings, sold another premium domain name for a record $50,000 for Myhomepage.com.[27]
On February 20, 2008, Tucows announced a portfolio of over 1,000 "gems", or domain names that have the high potential value such as "Jewellers.com", "Actresses.com", "BasketballPlayers.com", and "ProjectManagers.com".[28]
In February 2008, Tucows successfully defended against an arbitration proceeding over Batchelor.com, which it had acquired as part of its NetIdentity purchase. The complaint had been filed by Ken Batchelor Cadillac Company, a car dealership. A National Arbitration Forum panel determined that the dealership had not established rights in the mark "Batchelor". In fact, Tucows has won all surname-related arbitration proceedings.[29]
In 2007, Weidner Investment Services filed a complaint claiming that Weidner was its trademark or service mark and asked the National Arbitration Forum to order the transfer of Weidner.com from Tucows to Weidner.[30] Tucows failed to respond, and the National Arbitration Forum ordered Tucows to transfer Weidner.com to Weidner Investment Services.[30]
In January 2017, eNom was sold to Canadian domain seller Tucows for $83.5M Canadian.[31][32]
Email services[edit]
Tucows provides millions of email boxes through their network of over 9,000 service providers.[33] Customers of Tucows fully hosted email service are provided with POP3, IMAP, WAP and webmail access.[33] Providers using Tucows Email Service have the option of using Tucows' spam and virus filtering with their current email infrastructure.[33]
As part of the NetIdentity acquisition, Tucows had problems migrating retail customers' email from a third-party provider to Tucows in-house mail systems in September 2006.[34]
Starting August 12, 2008, Tucows Email Service running on their servers designated as Cluster A experienced a multi-day outage lasting until August 15, 2008.[35][36] On October 6, 2008, Cluster A again suffered another multi-day outage affecting at least 50% of users and at times all users.[37] As of the afternoon of October 9, 2008, this cluster was still partially down ("degraded") preventing an unknown number of users from being able to retrieve email.[38]
Retail services[edit]
Tucows sells services to consumers and small businesses and offers personalized email through net identity.[21] Tucows also offers customers hosting and other services with NetIdentity. Tucows also expected to receive income for pay per click advertising revenue from domain parking the surnames.[8]
Mobile phone services[edit]
In February 2012, Tucows launched a new mobile phone business called Ting, which resells voice and data services on Sprint and T-Mobile networks.[39] As of March 2017[update], the service has approximately 250,000 subscribers.[40]
Fiber Internet services[edit]
On December 15, 2014, Ting announced it was buying ISP Blue Ridge InternetWorks of Charlottesville, Virginia, which was already building fiber Internet.[41] They began offering symmetrical gigabit fiber internet without bandwidth caps. Since expanding the existing fiber network in Charlottesville, Ting has also launched a similar service in Westminster, Maryland and Holly Springs, North Carolina. Ting also announced plans to expand into Sandpoint, Idaho and Centennial, Colorado in 2017.
De-emphasis and divestment of business lines[edit]
De-emphasis of software downloads[edit]
Tucows maintains a download archive that includes more than 30,000 software titles in its worldwide network of partner sites. Although some listing features now have fees, basic listing remains free. Tucows founder Scott Swedorski announced his resignation in November 2003.[4] On March 10, 2006, Tucows Content division closed its satellite office located in Flint, Michigan, and relocated the remaining editorial functions to its corporate head office in Toronto. On February 7, 2008, Tucows disclosed that Tucows plans to de-emphasize the software download aspect of their business.[21]
Divestment of web hosting accounts[edit]
On May 6, 2008, Tucows announced that they are getting out of the web hosting business.[42] As part of the divestment Tucows signed an agreement for Hostopia to purchase about 14,000 Domain Direct, NetIdentity and ItsYourDomain.com (IYD) customer web hosting accounts and would migrate the web hosting accounts to Hostopia's unified web service platform by July 2008.[42]
Divestment of equity interest in Afilias[edit]
On November 5, 2008, Tucows announced that it was selling its entire 7.38% equity interest in Afilias for $7.4 million.[43] Afilias is the registry operator of the .info and .aero TLDs, and the service provider of the .org generic top-level domain (gTLD), .mobi mobile phone TLD, and a provider of domain name registry services for several countries around the world, including .AG (Antigua and Barbuda), .BZ (Belize), .GI (Gibraltar), .HN (Honduras), .IN (India), .ME (Montenegro), .SC (the Seychelles), and .VC (St. Vincent and the Grenadines).[44]
Reputation[edit]
Domain name add grace period (AGP) abuse[edit]
On January 8, 2008, Tucows explained its values and position on domain name front running: "We work to uphold the rights of Registrants. That means, for example, not putting 60-day locks on domains when a Registrant makes a change to their WHOIS information effectively locking some into a renewal and blocking domain name transfers to other Registrars. That also means having a clear, defined policy surrounding expiry and redemption periods."[45] Tucows addresses domain tasting "by charging our Resellers a monetary fee on domain name registrations that are cancelled within the five-day Add Grace Period (AGP)", but it "doesn’t use WHOIS query data or search data from our API to front-run domain names".[45]
Although it supports ICANN’s fee to discourage domain tasting and Google's decision to drop names added and deleted during the AGP from its AdSense program, Tucows claimed that AGP abuse could be further curbed by shortening the AGP period to 12 hours or less, sufficient time for registrants to correct spelling mistakes—AGP's original purpose.[46]
Registrations to sites selling illegal goods[edit]
In 2015, the U.S. Trade Representative included Tucows on its annual "notorious markets" list—the first time it has named a domain name registrar—in order to set an example for what happens to registrars that do not block or suspend sites that sell illegal goods.[47] Tucows responded that it suspended dozens of sites every day, but that "unlike some competitors, it considered all complaints carefully to ensure they were justified".[48]

Tucows Second Quarter Investment Community Conference Call is Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 5:00 P.M. (ET)
TORONTO, July 26, 2017 – Tucows Inc. (NASDAQ: TCX, TSX: TC) plans to report its second quarter fiscal 2017 financial results via news release on Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at approximately 4:05 p.m. (ET). Tucows management will host a conference call on the same day at 5:00 p.m. (ET) to discuss the results and the outlook for the company. Read more | Live stream

Corporate Profile
Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX, TSX:TC) is a provider of network access, domain names and other Internet services. Since 1994, the business has pivoted and grown from shareware to wholesale domain name registration to retail domain name registration to mobile phone service to symmetrical Gigabit Internet service via fiber-to-the-premises. Today, Tucows employs over 400 people and services millions of customers around the world.
Ting Mobile disrupted the US cellphone industry in 2012, offering shockingly fair pricing, usable interfaces and no-hold, no-transfer live customer support. About six months after launch, GigaOM included us, along with Apple, Samsung, FitBit and Waze, in The Mobile 15 as one of fifteen companies “…that are changing or could potentially change the mobile landscape.” In 2015 and 2016, we beat Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and every other provider in the annual Consumer Reports survey of US cell phone services. In just over four years, we operate on two nationwide networks, have over 200,000 active devices and generate over 50 million dollars in annual revenue.
Ting Internet launched in the US in 2015. In December 2015, Gizmodo listed us as one of The 6 Best Things That Happened to the Internet This Year. We are investing millions in fiber networks and partnering with small towns to change what people expect from their Internet service and their Internet service provider. We have already launched Gigabit speed Internet service in Charlottesville, Virginia, Westminster, Maryland and Holly Springs, North Carolina and we just announced that we will be coming to Centennial, Colorado.
OpenSRS and Enom have set the standard for wholesale domain name platforms for nearly twenty years and make Tucows the second largest domain name registrar in the world. Through a combined network of over 40,000 Web companies, we manage domain names, email addresses and digital security products for millions of end users.
Hover makes it easy for individuals and small businesses to manage their domain names and email addresses. Our easy-to-use management tools and extraordinary customer support earned us top mention in Lifehacker’s Five Best Domain Name Registrars and, more importantly, regularly delights over 250,000 customers.

      Telcos want control of the Internet. Together we can still stop them.      

 July 11, 2017 / By Monica Webb / Category : 
Blog


 Time is running out to protect the Internet as we know it.
Today is a day to rally. A day to talk, to reach out and especially to act. 
It’s the last chance to fight to keep fair and equal access to the Internet. The day we exercise our freedom of speech to maintain the same right online. The day we hold high the principle of common carriage; the principal that service providers must serve the general public without discrimination. A principle that started with blacksmiths, innkeepers and ship owners and is today part of our social contracts with public airlines, railroads, buses, taxicabs, freight and phone companies and yes, Internet service providers. The latter, because as Public Knowledge said so succinctly:
“Networks are so vital to the functioning of society that the maintenance of such networks cannot be left to the market solely.”
The Internet is the world’s principal source of information. We deserve access to all lawful content unedited, unfiltered, uncensored, unfettered. We want real journalism, not an echo chamber. We want to hear all voices, not only the ones who’ve paid to speak.
We don’t want a two-tiered system controlling online communication. 
We are not alone.
At Tucows, we believe the Internet is the greatest agent for positive change the world has even seen. We are thrilled and humbled by what can be achieved when billions of people have access to information and a vehicle to communicate, collaborate and co-create. We are increasingly wary of large corporations that are willing to compromise customer experiences and impede progress to protect market share. We are similarly concerned about politicians that legislate on the Internet without truly understanding the world they are affecting. 
So today we ask you to join our voice to protect the open Internet, by asking the FCC to preserve net neutrality. It’s easy. We promise.

“During the first quarter of 2017 we successfully began integrating Enom into our domain business and we successfully migrated over 20,000 mobile customers to Ting from RingPlus. We also continued to deploy significant resources to develop our Ting Internet operations and to invest in building out our Ting Fiber network. With a solid quarter behind us, I am pleased to report that we remain on track to meet our adjusted EBITDA goal of $50 million less $8 million of acquisition related non-cash impacts for fiscal 2017,”2 said Elliot Noss, President and Chief Executive Officer, Tucows Inc.
“Revenue for first quarter grew 55% year-over year to $69.6 million.  Net deferred revenues increased in the first quarter of 2017 by $4.8 million primarily due to the Enom acquisition.  Prior to the second quarter of 2016, this amount would have been included in our then adjusted EBITDA definition.   Overall, we are delighted with how each of our businesses executed against core strategies. Domains took steps toward scale and efficiency, Ting Mobile grew and Ting Internet improved and invested in fiber network expansion, systems and people,” added Mr. Noss.  “With our sound financial position and our significant cash flows, we remain well positioned for sustainable growth and continued investment in our strategic priority, building fiber.”
The adjusted EBITDA goal information discussed above is a non-GAAP financial measure. See footnote 2 below for more information on this non-GAAP measure.
Financial Results
Net revenue for the first quarter of 2017 increased 55% to $69.6 million from $44.7 million for the first quarter of 2016. The first quarter’s results only include the contribution from Enom’s operations since January 20, 2017, the date the acquisition was completed.
Net income for the first quarter of 2017 decreased to $2.4 million, or $0.23 per share, from $4.4 million, or $0.42 per share, for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA1 for the first quarter of 2017 decreased to $6.2 million from $7.3 million for the first quarter of 2016.  The first quarter of 2017 was impacted by the effect of the purchase price accounting adjustment related to the fair value write down of deferred revenue from the Enom acquisition which lowered adjusted EBITDA by $1.4 million and is a portion of the $4.8 million net deferred revenue change noted above. The first quarter of 2016 benefited from $0.4 million reversal of an overachievement bonus accrual for 2015 that was no longer required and a foreign exchange gain of $0.4 million that was not repeated. 
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter of 2017 decreased slightly to $15.0 million compared with $15.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 and $10.0 million at the end of the first quarter of 2016.
Notes:
1. Adjusted EBITDA
Tucows reports all financial information required in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Along with this information, to assist financial statement users in an assessment of our historical performance, the Company typically disclose and discuss a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted EBITDA, on investor conference calls and related events that exclude certain non-cash and other charges as the Company believes that the non-GAAP information enhances investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance.
The Company believes that the provision of this supplemental non-GAAP measure allows investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the Company’s core business using similar evaluation measures to those used by management. The Company uses adjusted EBITDA to measure its performance and prepare its budgets.  Since adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure, the Company’s calculation of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies; and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA is calculated before recurring cash charges, including interest expense and taxes, and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of the business, it should not be considered as a liquidity measure. Non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies and/or analysts and may differ from period to period. The Company endeavors to compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA to net income based on U.S. GAAP, which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s results.  Tucows strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.
The Company’s adjusted EBITDA definition excludes depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, income tax provision, interest expense, interest income, stock-based compensation, asset impairment, gains and losses from unrealized foreign currency transactions and infrequently occurring items, including acquisition and transitions costs. Gains and losses from unrealized foreign currency transactions removes the unrealized effect of the change in the mark-to-market values on outstanding unhedged foreign currency contracts, as well as the unrealized effect from the translation of monetary accounts denominated in non-U.S. dollars to U.S. dollars.
Prior year Adjusted EBITDA amounts presented herein have been recast to reflect adjusted EBITDA definitional changes described in the Company’s Form 10-Q Quarterly Report for the three months ended September 30, 2016.
The following table reconciles net income to adjusted EBITDA (dollars in thousands):

1 Acquisition and transition costs represent non-recurring costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of eNom, Incorporated in January 2017.  These costs are primarily comprised of professional fees for legal, accounting and other services.



During 2016, the Company identified an immaterial error that affects the classification of certain marketing program costs. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company recorded the cost for certain marketing credits as Sales and marketing expense which should have been recorded as a reduction in Net revenue. The discussion presented here correctly reflect these marketing credits as a reduction in Net Revenues for all current and comparative periods. This resulted in a decrease in Net Revenues, and a corresponding decrease in Sales and marketing expenses of $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
2. 2017 adjusted EBITDA goal
The adjusted EBITDA goal information discussed above is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Because we are unable to predict certain potentially material items affecting net income on a GAAP basis at this time, principally the amount deferred revenue will be reduced by the impact of purchasing accounting on historical deferred revenue, we cannot reconcile the estimated adjusted EBITDA for future years, a non-GAAP measure, to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, in reliance on the “unreasonable efforts” exception set forth in SEC rules.

Tucows Second Quarter Investment Community Conference Call is Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 5:00 P.M. (ET)
TORONTO, July 26, 2017 – Tucows Inc. (NASDAQ: TCX, TSX: TC) plans to report its second quarter fiscal 2017 financial results via news release on Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at approximately 4:05 p.m. (ET). Tucows management will host a conference call on the same day at 5:00 p.m. (ET) to discuss the results and the outlook for the company. Read more | Live stream

Corporate Profile
Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX, TSX:TC) is a provider of network access, domain names and other Internet services. Since 1994, the business has pivoted and grown from shareware to wholesale domain name registration to retail domain name registration to mobile phone service to symmetrical Gigabit Internet service via fiber-to-the-premises. Today, Tucows employs over 400 people and services millions of customers around the world.
Ting Mobile disrupted the US cellphone industry in 2012, offering shockingly fair pricing, usable interfaces and no-hold, no-transfer live customer support. About six months after launch, GigaOM included us, along with Apple, Samsung, FitBit and Waze, in The Mobile 15 as one of fifteen companies “…that are changing or could potentially change the mobile landscape.” In 2015 and 2016, we beat Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and every other provider in the annual Consumer Reports survey of US cell phone services. In just over four years, we operate on two nationwide networks, have over 200,000 active devices and generate over 50 million dollars in annual revenue.
Ting Internet launched in the US in 2015. In December 2015, Gizmodo listed us as one of The 6 Best Things That Happened to the Internet This Year. We are investing millions in fiber networks and partnering with small towns to change what people expect from their Internet service and their Internet service provider. We have already launched Gigabit speed Internet service in Charlottesville, Virginia, Westminster, Maryland and Holly Springs, North Carolina and we just announced that we will be coming to Centennial, Colorado.
OpenSRS and Enom have set the standard for wholesale domain name platforms for nearly twenty years and make Tucows the second largest domain name registrar in the world. Through a combined network of over 40,000 Web companies, we manage domain names, email addresses and digital security products for millions of end users.
Hover makes it easy for individuals and small businesses to manage their domain names and email addresses. Our easy-to-use management tools and extraordinary customer support earned us top mention in Lifehacker’s Five Best Domain Name Registrars and, more importantly, regularly delights over 250,000 customers.

About Us | Tucows Inc.



































		About Us	






What We Do
We offer Internet services to thousands of business partners and millions of end users around the world, including:

The leading wholesale platforms for selling and integrating domain names. (OpenSRS, Enom)
The simplest way for businesses and individuals to manage their domain names. (Hover)
A mobile phone service that makes shockingly good sense for US families and businesses. (Ting Mobile)
Symmetrical gigabit fiber Internet serving select “Ting towns” in the US. (Ting Internet)

What We Believe

The Internet is the greatest agent for positive change the world has ever seen.
People find the Internet complex and confusing so we work to make things simple and reliable.
Innovation and creativity are found in every employee, customer and partner we have.
We know “we beats me” any day.

What We Have Accomplished

Quite a lot! Check out our company financials and quarterly earnings reports here.
OpenSRS and Enom manage over 29 million domain names for over 40 thousand resellers around the world.
Hover is growing at over 20% a year and is widely regarded as one of the best domain name services.
Ting Mobile is home for well over 200,000 phones and, more importantly, the people that own them.
Crazy fast fiber Internet is in or coming to five Ting Internet towns already, with plans for several more to come.

What We Care About
We lobby, agitate, and educate to promote and protect an open Internet around the world.
We are thrilled and humbled by what can be achieved when billions of people have access to information and a vehicle to communicate, collaborate and co-create. We are increasingly wary of large corporations that are willing to compromise consumer experiences and impede progress to protect their market shares. We are similarly concerned about politicians that legislate on the Internet without truly understanding the world they are affecting.
This passion has led us to actively support organizations and causes such as:

Demand Progress
Internet Infrastructure Coalition
Freedom to Connect
Fight For The Future
We ❤ Wifi

We also tend to buy Christmas gifts every year for kids in our neighborhood and ride bikes to raise money for kids with cancer. But that’s pretty much what decent people should do.

Company history[edit]




Tucows headquarters in Toronto


Scott Swedorski started Tucows in 1993 to provide users with downloads of both freeware and trial versions of shareware. The name originally was an acronym for "The Ultimate Collection Of Winsock Software".[4] Internet Direct, owned and operated by John Nemanic, Bill Campbell, and Colin Campbell, acquired Tucows in 1996.[4] STI Ventures acquired Tucows in 1999.[4]
The company employed roughly 30 employees in Flint, Michigan, in 1998 with additional employees in Canada.[citation needed] For several years Scott Swedorski personally oversaw day-to-day activity in the Flint office located in the White House building on Beecher Road.[citation needed]
In 2000, Tucows acquired Linux Weekly News.[5]
In 2001, Tucows became a wholly owned subsidiary of Infonautics, and afterwards Infonautics changed its own name to Tucows,[6] a business tactic called a "reverse takeover". On August 26, 2002, Tucows sold eLibrary and Encyclopedia.com, its search and reference services properties inherited from Infonautics, to Alacritude.[6]
In 2004, Tucows acquired Boardtown Corporation, a billing software provider.
On August 19, 2005 Tucows went public[7] on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange.
In January 2006, Tucows completed its acquisition of certain assets of Critical Path, an outsourced email services provider.
In June 2006 Tucows paid $18 million to purchase Mailbank.com Inc, a company that owns over 17,000 domain names for common surnames, such as smith.net and brown.org. Mailbank generates income from ads on its websites (from domain parking) and also from customers who want e-mail accounts with their surname in the domain name.
On June 15, 2006, Noss disclosed that the portfolio of NetIdentity's domain names acquired by Tucows represents at least 68% of surnames in the United States and Europe, and that the cost of the acquisition was $18 million.[8] On February 19, 2008 Tucows announced that they were launching a "Personal Names Service" using their portfolio of 39,000 domain names.[9] "The launch of the Personal Names Service marks the complete integration of the surname assets we acquired with NetIdentity into our wholesale channel", said Elliot Noss, President and CEO of Tucows.[9]
On August 26, 2006, Tucows won an eBay auction for the web calendar site Kiko.com. The company planned to roll Kiko's features into their existing email platform.[10]
On July 27, 2007, Tucows acquired ItsYourDomain.com (IYD), another privately held ICANN-accredited wholesale registrar offering domain services through a network of over 2,500 affiliates with over 700,000 domains under management, paying US$10.35 million.[11] ItsYourDomain.com managed 699,951 domains compared to Tucows's 5,919,987, at the time of the sale in July 2007 ItsYourDomain.com's monthly growth of 29,181 exceeded Tucows growth of 21,126.[12]
By June 2008, Tucows had a total of three domain name registration services called ItsYourDomain (IYD), NetIdentity, and DomainDirect. Tucows decided to discontinue these three services, and merge them into one new domain name registration service, called Hover. Hover is a simple domain name registration service powered by Tucows Inc, that started in July 2008. All IYD, DomainDirect, and NetIdentity customers are fulfilled by Hover.com.[13]
On November 6, 2008, Tucows announced that they were launching Butterscotch.com, an online video network with video tutorials to explain Internet technology, starting with 35 video tutorials and plans to reach 500 clips by Spring 2009.[14] On October 14, 2011, Butterscotch.com producer Sean Carruthers stated production had been shut down.[15]
In December 2014, Tucows launched RealNames, offering e-mail service using domain names acquired from Mailbank.com Inc.
On January 20, 2017, the company acquired eNom for $83.5 million, making Tucows the second-largest domain registrar in the world.[16]
Business lines[edit]
Tucows is the second-largest ICANN-accredited registrar in the world and the largest publicly traded registrar.[12]
In July 2008, Tucows rebranded its wholesale services as "Open SRS".[17]
Domain portfolio management[edit]
Tucows has three sources of income from its domain portfolio: 1) Advertising from pages of domains within their domain name portfolio;[18] 2) Sales of domains from their portfolio, which is constantly being replenished;[19] 3) Auction of the steady stream of thousands of domain names that expire every day and become available for resale.[20]
In November 14, 2007, Tucows disclosed that they offer pay-per-click advertising on the pages of domains within their domain name portfolio.[18] When a user types one of these domain names into the address of the browser (direct navigation), they are presented with dynamically generated links which are pay-per-click advertising.[18] Every time a user clicks on one of the links listed on a web page, it generates revenue for Tucows through its partnership with third parties who provide syndicated pay-per-click results.[18]
On February 7, 2008, Tucows disclosed that it had switched from Google Ads to a new advertising partner in 2007, which led to a one-third increase in its revenue.[21]
On May 7, 2008, Tucows announced it put a process in place for the regular sale of direct navigation names.[22] These domain names would come from names that expire each month from customers who decide they no longer want the domain names and that Tucows is able to select the ones they want to keep from these domain names.[23]
Tucows announced on June 12, 2008, that they have reached an agreement with Afternic to auction Tucows’ large daily inventory of expired domain names.[20] "We have over eight million domains under management and thousands expiring every day, so this deal provides us with a great way to share revenue with our resellers while participating in Afternic’s popular secondary domain name marketplace”, said Bill Sweetman, General Manager of Tucows Domain Portfolio.[20] Tucows will share 10% of the gross sale price with the reseller for the sale of expired domains that were originally registered through the reseller.[24] Revenue will be shared automatically without the reseller having to take any additional action.[24] Tucows chose Afternic as a partner even though SnapNames with Register.com and NameJet with NetSol/eNom are the dominant players in expired domains.[25]
On October 29, 2008, Tucows announced that it would begin direct sales from their inventory of premium domain names under the brand name of Yummy Names.[26] The service was created especially for marketers to obtain a high-quality domain name from Tucows inventory.[26] Customers have the option of purchasing a premium domain name outright or leasing the name.[26] In 2009 one of Tucows' subsidiaries, Buydomains Holdings, sold another premium domain name for a record $50,000 for Myhomepage.com.[27]
On February 20, 2008, Tucows announced a portfolio of over 1,000 "gems", or domain names that have the high potential value such as "Jewellers.com", "Actresses.com", "BasketballPlayers.com", and "ProjectManagers.com".[28]
In February 2008, Tucows successfully defended against an arbitration proceeding over Batchelor.com, which it had acquired as part of its NetIdentity purchase. The complaint had been filed by Ken Batchelor Cadillac Company, a car dealership. A National Arbitration Forum panel determined that the dealership had not established rights in the mark "Batchelor". In fact, Tucows has won all surname-related arbitration proceedings.[29]
In 2007, Weidner Investment Services filed a complaint claiming that Weidner was its trademark or service mark and asked the National Arbitration Forum to order the transfer of Weidner.com from Tucows to Weidner.[30] Tucows failed to respond, and the National Arbitration Forum ordered Tucows to transfer Weidner.com to Weidner Investment Services.[30]
In January 2017, eNom was sold to Canadian domain seller Tucows for $83.5M Canadian.[31][32]
Email services[edit]
Tucows provides millions of email boxes through their network of over 9,000 service providers.[33] Customers of Tucows fully hosted email service are provided with POP3, IMAP, WAP and webmail access.[33] Providers using Tucows Email Service have the option of using Tucows' spam and virus filtering with their current email infrastructure.[33]
As part of the NetIdentity acquisition, Tucows had problems migrating retail customers' email from a third-party provider to Tucows in-house mail systems in September 2006.[34]
Starting August 12, 2008, Tucows Email Service running on their servers designated as Cluster A experienced a multi-day outage lasting until August 15, 2008.[35][36] On October 6, 2008, Cluster A again suffered another multi-day outage affecting at least 50% of users and at times all users.[37] As of the afternoon of October 9, 2008, this cluster was still partially down ("degraded") preventing an unknown number of users from being able to retrieve email.[38]
Retail services[edit]
Tucows sells services to consumers and small businesses and offers personalized email through net identity.[21] Tucows also offers customers hosting and other services with NetIdentity. Tucows also expected to receive income for pay per click advertising revenue from domain parking the surnames.[8]
Mobile phone services[edit]
In February 2012, Tucows launched a new mobile phone business called Ting, which resells voice and data services on Sprint and T-Mobile networks.[39] As of March 2017[update], the service has approximately 250,000 subscribers.[40]
Fiber Internet services[edit]
On December 15, 2014, Ting announced it was buying ISP Blue Ridge InternetWorks of Charlottesville, Virginia, which was already building fiber Internet.[41] They began offering symmetrical gigabit fiber internet without bandwidth caps. Since expanding the existing fiber network in Charlottesville, Ting has also launched a similar service in Westminster, Maryland and Holly Springs, North Carolina. Ting also announced plans to expand into Sandpoint, Idaho and Centennial, Colorado in 2017.
De-emphasis and divestment of business lines[edit]
De-emphasis of software downloads[edit]
Tucows maintains a download archive that includes more than 30,000 software titles in its worldwide network of partner sites. Although some listing features now have fees, basic listing remains free. Tucows founder Scott Swedorski announced his resignation in November 2003.[4] On March 10, 2006, Tucows Content division closed its satellite office located in Flint, Michigan, and relocated the remaining editorial functions to its corporate head office in Toronto. On February 7, 2008, Tucows disclosed that Tucows plans to de-emphasize the software download aspect of their business.[21]
Divestment of web hosting accounts[edit]
On May 6, 2008, Tucows announced that they are getting out of the web hosting business.[42] As part of the divestment Tucows signed an agreement for Hostopia to purchase about 14,000 Domain Direct, NetIdentity and ItsYourDomain.com (IYD) customer web hosting accounts and would migrate the web hosting accounts to Hostopia's unified web service platform by July 2008.[42]
Divestment of equity interest in Afilias[edit]
On November 5, 2008, Tucows announced that it was selling its entire 7.38% equity interest in Afilias for $7.4 million.[43] Afilias is the registry operator of the .info and .aero TLDs, and the service provider of the .org generic top-level domain (gTLD), .mobi mobile phone TLD, and a provider of domain name registry services for several countries around the world, including .AG (Antigua and Barbuda), .BZ (Belize), .GI (Gibraltar), .HN (Honduras), .IN (India), .ME (Montenegro), .SC (the Seychelles), and .VC (St. Vincent and the Grenadines).[44]
Reputation[edit]
Domain name add grace period (AGP) abuse[edit]
On January 8, 2008, Tucows explained its values and position on domain name front running: "We work to uphold the rights of Registrants. That means, for example, not putting 60-day locks on domains when a Registrant makes a change to their WHOIS information effectively locking some into a renewal and blocking domain name transfers to other Registrars. That also means having a clear, defined policy surrounding expiry and redemption periods."[45] Tucows addresses domain tasting "by charging our Resellers a monetary fee on domain name registrations that are cancelled within the five-day Add Grace Period (AGP)", but it "doesn’t use WHOIS query data or search data from our API to front-run domain names".[45]
Although it supports ICANN’s fee to discourage domain tasting and Google's decision to drop names added and deleted during the AGP from its AdSense program, Tucows claimed that AGP abuse could be further curbed by shortening the AGP period to 12 hours or less, sufficient time for registrants to correct spelling mistakes—AGP's original purpose.[46]
Registrations to sites selling illegal goods[edit]
In 2015, the U.S. Trade Representative included Tucows on its annual "notorious markets" list—the first time it has named a domain name registrar—in order to set an example for what happens to registrars that do not block or suspend sites that sell illegal goods.[47] Tucows responded that it suspended dozens of sites every day, but that "unlike some competitors, it considered all complaints carefully to ensure they were justified".[48]

domain names or modify existing registrations.

The compilation, repackaging, dissemination or other use of this Data is
expressly prohibited without the prior written consent of Tucows.
