2016
December 16, 2016 SOURCE: PR NEWSWIRERegen BioPharma, Inc., (OTCBB: RGBP) and (PINK: RGBP) announced today identification of a series of compounds that have been identified by biochemical testing which interact with the Company's newly identified immune checkpoint NR2F6. This is the first of a series of steps in developing small molecules which the Company plans to use as a basis for creating "a checkpoint inhibitor pill." Previously, the Company reported that the use of gene silencing of NR2F6 leads to induction of cancer stem cell differentiation, a process that renders malignant cancer cells benign.DOWNLOAD>>>​December 15, 2016 SOURCE: PR NEWSWIRERegen BioPharma Inc. (OTCQB: RGBP), (OTCQB: RGBPP) announced today the filing of a [provisional/nonprovisional] utility patent application with the United States Patents and Trademark Office covering NR2F6-silenced CAR T cells. While previous work demonstrated that methodologies developed by Regen and covered under its issued patent #9,091,696 are useful in stimulation of T cell activity, the current patent further modifies T cells to express molecules that act as a localized "danger signal" to the immune system. CAR T cells are T Cells (T lymphocytes ) which are genetically engineered to produce chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on their surface. CARs are proteins that allow the T cells to recognize an antigen on targeted tumor cells.DOWNLOAD>>>October 31, 2016 SOURCE: PR NEWSWIRE Regen BioPharma Inc.

Beginning in March 2016, 5 patients with chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression were treated with HemaXellerate and initial 1 month follow up data were provided. Pan Am Cancer Treatment Center has now provided 3 and 6 month follow up data in these same patients. The primary endpoint of the study is safety and the secondary endpoint is effectiveness. Pan Am Cancer Treatment Center has been granted a non-exclusive license to test HemaXellerate in a first-in-human proof of concept study.DOWNLOAD>>>October 19, 2016 SOURCE: PR NEWSWIRE Entest BioMedical's (OTCPINK: ENTB) wholly owned subsidiary Zander Therapeutics, Inc. announced the filing of a patent application covering composition of matter and methods of use related to molecules identified in their small molecule program that activate and inhibit NR2F6 ('Small Molecule Modulators of NR2F6 Activity for Animals').DOWNLOAD>>>September 29, 2016 SOURCE: PR NEWSWIRE Regen BioPharma Inc.

Regen BioPharma, Inc. Receives FDA Clearance to Initiate Clinical Trial of HemaXellerate

		  Company to Initiate Phase I Clinical Trial for Immune Modulatory Personalized Cell Therapy in Treatment of Aplastic Anemia

SAN DIEGO, California, December 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --
Regen BioPharma, Inc., (OTCBB: RGBP) and (PINK: RGBP) announced today receipt of a communication from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, allowing for initiation of clinical trials under its Investigational New Drug (IND) #15376.  
The clearance of the IND allows the company to initiate clinical trials of HemaXellerate, a personalized immune-modulatory cell therapy that has demonstrated benefit in animal models of aplastic anemia.  
Aplastic anemia, a condition that occurs when the body stops producing enough blood cells, is a potentially fatal disease of the bone marrow that leads to bleeding, infection and fever. Severe and very severe aplastic anemia can have a mortality rate of greater than 70% and are considered a hematologic emergency.  Current treatments include blood transfusions, immunosuppression and stem cell transplantation.
The Company's initial Phase I clinical trial will treat patients having refractory aplastic anemia - aplastic anemia patients who haven't responded to first-line immunosuppressive therapy - with HemaXellerate and follow them for safety parameters and signals of efficacy. Therapeutic effects will be quantified based on immunological and hematological measurements. Because the trial will be unblinded, data will be available as the study progresses.
"Current drug-based approaches for healing bone marrow dysfunction involve flooding the body with growth factors, which is extremely expensive and causes unintended consequences because of lack of selectivity," said Harry Lander, Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regen Biopharma. "By utilizing a cell-based approach that both modulates the immune system and stimulates production of blood cells, we aim to offer alternatives to the current approaches to treating patients with aplastic anemia. This product will complement our immune-modulatory pipeline that includes a potential novel checkpoint inhibitor."
If the clinical trial is successful, the company plans to expand the use of HemaXellerate to other conditions associated with bone marrow dysfunction, with the overall goal of entering the hematopoietic growth factor market. This market is substantial in size and currently includes drugs such as Neupogen®, Neulasta®, Leukine® and Revolade®. 
"The FDA clearance marks a substantial step for Regen, in that we are now a clinical-stage company.  We are grateful to our collaborators and scientific advisory board members who have worked tirelessly in bringing our product to the point where the FDA has permitted treatment of patients," said David Koos, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Regen BioPharma. "We believe the success of today will not only allow for the rapid execution of HemaXellerate's development plan, but will also allow for more rapid translation of the company's other immune modulatory products to the clinic."
About Regen BioPharma, Inc. 
Regen BioPharma Inc. is a publicly traded biotechnology company (OTCBB: RGBP) and (OTC PINK: RGBP). The Company seeks to identify undervalued regenerative medicine applications in the immunotherapy and stem cell space. The Company is focused on rapidly advancing these technologies through pre-clinical and Phase I/ II clinical trials. Currently the Company is centering on gene silencing therapy for treating cancer, telomeres and small molecule therapies, along with developing stem cell treatments for aplastic anemia.

Regen BioPharma, Inc. Key Developments

Regen BioPharma's Researchers Discover New Dynamic Compound Which Modulates the NR2F6 Checkpoint
Jul 12 17
Regen BioPharma Inc. reported continued progress in developing small molecule drugs that activate and inhibit NR2F6. The company reports that using a focused compound library and Regen's patented screening methodology, it has identified a dynamic new chemical compound series that modulates NR2F6. The NR2F6 nuclear receptor has been identified as a potentially very important immune cell inhibitor (an immune checkpoint) and cancer stem cell differentiator. The NR2F6 program at Regen aims to identify antagonists of NR2F6 in an effort to unleash the cancer-killing potential of a patient's own immune system as well as identifying agonists, which should suppress the immune system in diseases where the immune system is over-activated, such as autoimmunity.

Regen BioPharma, Inc. Licenses NR2F6 Technology for Cancer Treatment and Autoimmune Disorders to CheckPoint Immunology
Mar 2 17
Regen BioPharma Inc. has granted CheckPoint Immunology Inc. an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize Regen's NR2F6 technology for human therapeutic use. The objective of the license grant is the separation of Regen's small molecule technology from its other intellectual property in order to facilitate any future transactions involving small molecule therapies focused on the NR2F6 checkpoint. The company's focus on NR2F6 has two developmental streams. The first area of development involves the inhibition of the checkpoint, NR2F6, in order to cause the body's immune system to destroy cancer cells. The second area of development involves the activation of NR2F6 which is believed to be a fulcrum for curing such autoimmune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis.

SAN DIEGO, California, September 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
Regen BioPharma, Inc. (OTCQB: RGBP), (OTCQB: RGBPP), announced today submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of a revised Investigational New Drug (IND) application focused on using a novel method to unleash the body's innate ability to kill cancer.  The package submitted contained preclinical experiments as well as details of the proposed clinical trial.  Results of the studies clearly demonstrated that the approach outlined, using siRNA to silence a key enzyme related to inhibition of the immune system, is effective at stimulating the type of immune response associated with known checkpoint inhibitors.
The enzyme silenced is Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) , an enzyme that is overexpressed in some cancers and which suppresses immune system response against the cancer. The Company believes it has supplied the additional data and clarifications the FDA requested.
"Because dCellVax is a personalized cell therapy product aimed at activating the immune system of patients with metastatic breast cancer, we are excited to potentially have a product to deliver to patients who at the moment have no other options," said Dr. David Koos, CEO of Regen BioPharma.
"dCellVax is comprised of cells extracted from the patient's own circulating immune cells and processed using a proprietary method so as to activate these immune cells in such a way that they can attack cancer cells.    Studies in animal and human immune cells by Regen and other groups have shown that the cells in dCellVax are highly active and secrete the same cytokines that immune cells known to kill cancer cells do.  Thus, we are optimistic that this treatment will be useful in patients with cancer."
The proposed dCellVax clinical trial involves generation of patient-specific immune stimulatory cells termed "dendritic cells" that are modified by gene-silencing so as to lose expression of the immune checkpoint gene IDO.  Ten patients with advanced breast cancer will be treated in the proposed clinical trial.
"dCellVax is one of the programs we are developing to activate the immune system in order to allow the body to kill cancer.   Immune modulation, both inhibitory and stimulatory, is unlocking many novel ways to have the human body heal itself.  dCellVax is only one of our immune modulatory products that we expect to bring to market in the future.  The data package we sent to the FDA is an important step in this process," said Harry Lander, Ph.D., MBA, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regen BioPharma.

               			     			(Majority-Owned Susidiary of BMSN) Regen BioPharma, Inc., a subsidiary of Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc. (OTCBB: BMSN) 			is a biotechnology company focused on identifying undervalued regenerative medicine applications 			in the stem cell space and rapidly advancing these technologies through pre-clinical andPhase I/ II clinical trials.       			"Our business model is to acquire and form companies around 			undervalued assets identified froma highly focused analysis of issued 			patents in regenerative medicinethat have demonstrated proof of concept"        			Dr. Ichim is one of the leading authorities in the 			world on stem cell biology.   			"A STEM CELL INCUBATOR COMPANY"  			With an emphasis on stem cell regenerative medicine 			     			  Our Business Model | Regen BioPharma 			                       			Regen BioPharma has assessed over 20,000 stem cell related issued patents, narrowed down to 2000 patents with commercial applicability, and further identified 30 patents available for licensing. The company seeks to inlicense, take the product to, and through clinical safety and efficacy "signal" and spin out technologies.  			      Our Approach | Regen BioPharma            REGEN BIOPHARMA AVOIDS WASTE OF "ONE PRODUCT/ONE INFRASTRUCTURE" APPROACH       In the "Conventional Model", stem cell companies are started with one basic technology, infrastructure is developed around that technology, then if the technology fails, significant resources are lost that have been used in the product-specific development              Conventional Model    			             Regen BioPharma Model   			       Operational Plan 			   Month 1-2: Assembly of Team: Regen intends to assemble a team of world-class leaders in the spheres of Technology, Intellectual Property assessment, valuation and Clinical development. Regen will seek to compile a team of Physician-Scientists with experience in the area of clinical trials for regenerative medicine/stem cell products, Regulatory experts who have successfully taken products through the FDA and corresponding agencies internationally, and Biotech Entrepreneurs who have track records of excellence in business formation and value optimization. -DONE 			  Month 1-4: Inlicensing of Intellectual Property: The Company having already assessed over 20,000 issued patents and havingcompiled a shortlist of 30 targets; Regen will seek to execute licensing deals on an initial core of 3 technologies. Regen focuses onissued patents that have already passed preclinical studies but are not under clinical development. -DONE 			  Month 3-6: Interaction with Regulatory Agencies: Regen intends to develop data packages for each of the technologies andinitiate interaction with Regulatory Agencies such as the FDA for initiation of trials.-DONE 			  Month 6-18: Clinical Implementation: Regen intends to launch clinical trials with world-leading institutions to obtain human safety data and "signal" of therapeutic efficacy.  NEXT UP 			  Month 18-24: Exit: It is intended that technologies "incubated" by Regen will be spun off either as separate companies, or sold to Large Pharma companies seeking to enhance their therapeutic pipeline. 			         "At present there exists a wealth of intellectual property that is 'collecting dust' in the corridors of Academia. Given the field of regenerative medicine and stem cell therapy is so young, and the business models are fuzzy at best in terms of valuation, we see this space as a unique opportunity for acceleration of clinical development/value optimization," said Bio-Matrix Chairman & CEO David Koos about its Regen BioPharma. "Valuations for stem cell companies that have passed the threshold of clinical safety, with signals of efficacy are astronomical. The $1.8 billion Mesoblast-Cephalon deal, as well as recent financings of private companies with as little as 3 patient data such as Promethera ($31 million) or Allocure with 16 patients ($23 million), is testimony to the extremely high valuations that are characteristic of this space."           Regen BioPharma Pipeline 			   HemaXellerate I™ FDA FILING [Regen BioPharma filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application on February 5th, 2013.  Regen BioPharma has received approval from the FDA for the clinical protocol and the product manufacturing information for HemaXellerate I.  On May 9, 2014 Regen BioPharma submitted clarification on animal safety studies that the FDA requested.  On September 10, 2014 Regen BioPharma announced they were working hand-in-hand with FDA cellular specialists to finalize the animal safety studies in a GLP laboratory.] HemaXellerate I is a cellular therapy designed to heal damaged bone marrow. HemaXellarate I utilizes a collection of cells harvested from the patient’s own adipose (fat) tissue to repair damaged bone marrow and stimulate production of blood cells . The initial application of HemaXellerate I will be the treatment of severe aplastic anemia, a rare and serious condition in which the bone marrow fails to make enough blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. In practice, the physician is shipped a kit, which is used to collect adipose tissue. The tissue is sent to a processing facility, and a standardized cellular product is delivered in a ready-to-use manner for administration into the patient intravenously.  **The Company intends to seek Orphan Drug Designation under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 from the US Food and Drug Administration for HemaXellerate I**   dCellVax™ [Regen BioPharma is currently in the preclinical stage of development for dCellVax and plans to file an Investigational New Drug Application in Fall 2014]  			The dCellVax therapeutic product is based on extracting blood from patients, growing a specialized type of immune cell from the blood called the "dendritic cell" and then subsequently genetically modifying the dendritic cell to become resistant to cancer's immune suppressive activity. It is known that cancer modifies the immune system by producing proteins which result in immune suppression. One such protein which cancer stimulates is an enzyme, indolamine 2,3 deoxygenase (IDO), which cancer turns on in dendritic cells. While dendritic cells are usually immune stimulators, dendritic cells found in cancer patients suppress the immune system as a result of expressing IDO.  			The dCellVax therapeutic product uses patents that Regen BioPharma has in-licensed from Dr. Wei-Ping Min coupled with patents in-licensed from Benitec BioPharma.  By utilizing methods covered in both of these patents Regen BioPharma hopes to develop an immune-based, non-toxic cancer treatment initially targeting breast cancer.  HemaXellerate II™ [Regen BioPharma is currently in the preclinical stage of development for HemaXellerate II]  			HemaXellerate II is intended to be a universal donor endothelial cell based therapeutic and is intended to be manufactured by obtaining cells from a part of the placenta called the “vascular lobules”. The cells are processed and utilized for the purpose of stimulating bone marrow hematopoetic stem cell repair and proliferation. The mechanism of action for HemaXellerate II is similar to HemaXellerate I whereby the harvested and processed cells would produce growth factors which would mediate the therapeutic effects of the product. 			  Cancer Treatment via siRNA and Innate Immune System Stimulation     NEW 9/16/14!!! [Regen BioPharma is currently in the preclinical stage of development for this treatment.  A patent application was filed for this novel cancer treatment on 9/16/2014]  			This novel cancer treatment utilizes siRNA to stimulate the innate immune system in order to eradicate cancer.  Preclinical data from the company suggests that this treatment is effective in eradicating various cancers in humans such as lung, skin, glioma, and breast cancers. 			      Managent Team | Regen BioPharma 			    David R.

He is also the Chief Scientific Officer of Sernova Corp and was formerly a Therapeutic Area Head for Novartis. He received the B.Sc. degree from the University of Surrey and the M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from Cambridge University.   David A. Suhy, PhD  Dr Suhy has a long-term interest in development of shRNA based therapeutics to treat human diseases. He is in the unique position of seeing of directing the research of a RNAi-based therapeutic from its earliest inception until it reaches clinical trials. Development of a shRNA therapeutic against the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was initiated at Avocel in 2003. Financial constraints caused the company to shutter research operations in 2006.Upon raising venture capital, Tacere Therapeutics acquired the rights to the HCV family of drugs and brought back Dr. Suhy to head the program. Partnered with Pfizer shortly thereafter, this drug is their first foray into gene therapy-based approaches and is the first shRNA program partnered with a large pharma. Given Pfizer’s lack of experience in both areas, Dr. Suhy has played a pivotal role in its development as Tacere has continued to lead the research efforts for advancement of this product into the clinic and has stood side-by-side with Pfizer through all of the regulatory agency meetings. 			     			    Current Business Partners | Regen BioPharma                                                                                                                              			   Regen BioPharma Share Structure:  			UPDATE per latest 10-Q (as of December 31, 2016) 145,412,605 shares issued and outstanding  			UPDATE per latest 10-Q (as of June 30, 2016) 134,548,138 shares issued and outstanding    UPDATE = Checked Again 2/29/2016 = Regen Biopharma, Inc. only has  127,253,938 common shares issued and outstanding.  			A/S = 500,000,000  			RGBP Transfer Agent: 			Securities Transfer Corporation 2591 Dallas Parkway Suite 102 Frisco, Texas 75034 Phone - 469-633-0101 FAX 469-633-0088 			  LATEST NEWS -  Regen BioPharma Files Patent Application on New Therapy That Uses the "Innate" Immune System to Kill Cancer http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/RGBP/news

Regen BioPharma, Inc. Research Demonstrates Ex-Vivo Immune Suppression With Novel NR2F6 Activators

If you are affiliated with this page and would like it removed please contact pressreleases@franklyinc.comSOURCE  Regen BioPharma, Inc.Novel Activators Demonstrate Selective Inhibition of IL-17a and IL-2SAN DIEGO, July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --Regen BioPharma Inc. (OTCQB: RGBP) and (OTCQB: RGBPP) today reported continued progress in Regen's development of small molecule drugs that activate and inhibit NR2F6. The Company reports that recently identified novel chemical compounds that activate NR2F6 also selectively inhibit cytokines secreted from activated immune cells. This indicates that researchers have identified a compound that appears to be effective in treating autoimmune diseases with virtually no toxicity. Research was conducted by ChemDiv, Inc. (an internationally recognized contract research organization) which has been retained by Regen to conduct research and experiments on Regen's behalf.The NR2F6 nuclear receptor has been identified as a potentially very important immune cell inhibitor (an immune checkpoint) and cancer stem cell differentiator. The NR2F6 program at Regen aims to identify antagonists of NR2F6 in an effort to unleash the cancer-killing potential of a patient's own immune system as well as identifying agonists which should suppress the immune system in diseases where the immune system is over-activated, such as autoimmunity."We tested three recently-identified agonists which share a privileged structure for their ability to inhibit cytokine production in stimulated immune cells," says Harry Lander, Ph.D., MBA, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regen. "After stimulating the immune cells in the presence or absence of our compounds, we measured the cytokines IL-2, IL-1ß, TNFa, IFN-?, and IL-17a which are well-known to mediate many inflammatory and autoimmune-related diseases. Remarkably, our compounds inhibited IL-17a and IL-2, had a modest effect on TNFa and had no effect on IL-1 ß and IFN-? secretion. This gives us insight into the mechanism of action of these drugs and paves the way forward for optimizing these compounds.""With this important series of experiments, we have significantly de-risked the agonist program," says David Koos, Ph.D., Chairman & CEO Regen BioPharma Inc. "What this really means is the Company has identified a number of compounds that modulate checkpoint NR2F6. Recent developments show 3 compound groups that appear to be turbo-charged in the way they modulate NR2F6. The Company believes that these recent 3 compound groups just need some fine-tuning to be the basis for our autoimmune therapies. Additionally, using this information, we are now able to ramp up our inhibitor program which focuses on anti-cancer drugs."About Regen BioPharma Inc.:  Regen BioPharma Inc. is a publicly traded biotechnology company (OTCQB: RGBP) and (OTCQB: RGBPP).

dCellVax 
Breast Cancer – dCellVax - IND #16200CellVax is  a dendritic cell based immunotherapy that stimulates the patient’s  immune system through a process called “gene silencing.”
10 advanced breast cancer patientsEfficacy endpoints at 6 and 12 monthsEstablishment of safety will allow for rapid expansion of patient numbers Currently addressing FDA questions with Dr. Santosh Kesari, head of UCSD Neuro-Oncology program 



DiffronC
Myelodysplastic Syndrome Gene Silencing – DiffronCDiffronC is  a novel form of therapy called differentiation therapy that is expected  to have much milder toxicity than chemotherapy. The mechanism of action  is to correct the specific genes that prevent the myelodysplastic  syndrome stem cell from producing mature blood cells.
siRNA silencing of our newly discovered cancer stem cell target geneSilencing using DiffronC induces differentiation of cancer cells Initial indication is treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome Other indications include solid tumors and acute leukemia



Telomeres & Genomic Integrity
Stem cells and cancer cells have found ways of maintaining their telomeres in a state that prevents senescence. Our research in to the cancer stem cell has given us a molecular pathway that can be manipulated to expand stem cells and maintain telomeres.
Telomeres are protective structures at the ends of chromosomes that enable cell divisionsTelomere attrition is involved in aging, cancer and genetic mutations We are developing drugs that modulate telomere maintenance In pre-clinical development for indications of solid cancers and acute leukemia

“To our knowledge, ‘universal donor’ cellular immunotherapies have not been developed to date," says chief executive David Koos.


 

ucVax could substantially reduce costs








Regen BioPharma Inc (OTCBB:RGBP) has kicked off a preclinical development program designed to create a cord blood based cancer immunotherapeutic product.

	It will be the first such product leveraging the NR2F6 immunological checkpoint, the company said.

	Regen highlighted that a prior provisional patent application had described a generation of cord blood derived killer cells whose anti-cancer activity was potentiated by gene silencing.

	It is intended that the product will be a ‘universal donor’ cellular immunotherapy. Such a product would be able to be shipped frozen to the site of use, and would not involve complex cellular manipulations.

	David Koos, Regen Biopharma chief executive and chairman, said: "Developing a universal donor immunotherapy will substantially reduce costs of clinical implementation and allow for wide access to treatment including at institutions that do not possess cellular processing abilities. 

	“To our knowledge, ‘universal donor’ cellular immunotherapies have not been developed to date. 

	“We believe ucVax will possess both therapeutic and commercial advantages as compared to other immunotherapies."

	Existing cancer cellular immunotherapies require patient blood cells to be extracted and manipulated before re-infusion, Regen highlighted. It added that this kind of approach is more costly and require additional facilities at the point of treatment.
