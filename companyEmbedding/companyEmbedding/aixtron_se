Our market expertise is your recipe for successTo date, AIXTRON has delivered more than 2,000 deposition systems to customers around the world. We have also enhanced existing technologies and take pride that our comprehensive expertise and many years of experience in the deposition of complex semiconductor materials have served as a foundation for many of customers’ success.




Production Systems




Compound Semiconductors



MOCVD


Applying this production methodology, the source materials (which are metal-organic compounds) are transported by way of a carrier gas and gradually supplied to the reactor. A complex chemical reaction results in thin semiconductor layers. The introduced gases are of a very high purity and can be exceptionally well dosed, which enables the film growth to be precisely controlled.



Planetary Reactor


The Planetary Reactor is based on the principle of a horizontal laminar flow reactor. The laminar flow principle ensures extremely precise transitions between different materials, and an unparalleled control over the deposition rates for films that are only a few atoms thick. AIX G5+ for GaN on 200 mm SiAIX G5+ C for GaN on 150/200 mm SiAIX G5 HT-TM AIX 2800G4-TM 


Close Coupled Showerhead


Applying this technology, the process gases are introduced vertically over the entire coating surface in the reactor via the water-cooled showerhead surface. The gas flow into the reactor is designed in such a manner that the Group III and Group V gases are separated until they enter the reactor (by many small narrow tubes at the showerhead inlet). This technology ensures an unmatched level of reproducibility. AIX R6  


SiC Planetary Reactor


For semiconductor properties, Silicon carbide stands out especially when it comes to power rectifiers, as well as switches for converting and distributing electricity. The Planetary Reactor enables several 4- or 6-inch, or 200 mm SiC wafers to be coated at the same time. AIX G5 WW 








Silicon Semiconductors



ALD


Atomic layer deposition is a process for manufacturing ultrathin films for semiconductor components and future non-semiconductor applications. QXP 8300 ALD (Brochure)QXP 8300 ALD (FLyer) QXP 8300 NVM 



CVD/(PE)CVD


Applying this methodology, the deposition of thin films takes place by means of chemical reactions, in which the wafers are exposed to a gas mixture that reacts on the wafer surface. The process can also be plasma-enhanced. LYNX-iXP 







Organic Semiconductors



OVPD


Organic Vapor Phase Deposition (OVPD) is an innovative technology for the thin-film deposition of organic “small molecules,” based on the principle of gas phase transport. When combined with AIXTRON’s patented Close Coupled Showerhead technology, the process can be scaled to any degree and any substrate dimensions. Compared to conventional vapor processes, the gas phase transport allows for more precise control of the deposition rates and thus greater flexibility in manufacturing complex structures. OVPD-200 



PVPD


Polymer Vapor Phase Deposition (PVPD) is a technology for the controlled gas-phase deposition and in situ cross-linking of polymer-based thin-film structures.
When combined with AIXTRON’s patented Close Coupled Showerhead technology, the process is scalable to any degree and can be used for any substrate dimensions. Compared to conventional vapor processes, the gas phase transport allows for more precise control of the deposition rates and thus the creation of new materials through targeted copolymerization, for example. PVPD PRODOS-200 







Nanotechnology



(PE)CVD


AIXTRON‘s BM systems can operate in both thermal CVD and plasma-enhanced CVD modes, which is extremely important for controlling the structure of nanomaterials as it enables virtually all variations and morphologies of carbon nanotubes and graphene to be produced. Our systems feature fast ramp rates, automatic recipe execution, excellent uniformity and reproducibility for nanomaterial growth. The systems are based on the highly scalable showerhead concept and are available for wafer-sizes from 50mm to 300mm diameter. BM 300

PECVD


OPTACAP (TM)The patented OPTACAP™ technology offers an innovative plasma-enhanced CVD approach based on linear plasma sources. It provides high growth rates at very low temperatures.
The enabling features of the proprietary source are: Linear pre-activation region providing very high activation, thus resulting in high utilization of source gases and facilitating high deposition rates. Unique and patent-pending microstructure of the deposited film forming a high-quality flexible encapsulation film. The OPTACAP™ technology achieves very high deposition rates, yielding highly productive deposition of dense inorganic film with excellent barrier capability and extraordinary flexibility.

History[edit]
AIXTRON was founded as a spin-out industry from RWTH Aachen University in 1983.[3] The company listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange's now-defunct Neuer Markt, in November 1997.[4] Since going public the company has made several acquisitions, with the Scientific Equipment Division of the British company Thomas Swan & Co. and the Swedish chemical vapor deposition equipment maker Epigress AB both purchased in 1999.[5][6]
The company completed a €118 million merger with American rival Genus, Inc. in March 2005[7] and bought British nanomaterial developer Nanoinstruments Ltd., a company spun out from the University of Cambridge, in 2007.[8]
In December 2010 the company converted from a German Aktiengesellschaft to a Societas Europaea to reflect its European and international nature.
In October 2016 China’s Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund LP wanted to acquire Aixtron, but Germany’s economics ministry withdrew the approval of the takeover.[9] In November 2016 the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) recommended both sides to drop their plan, because of national security concerns.[10]
Operations[edit]
65% of AIXTRON's revenues come from clients in Asia, with around 16% coming from Europe and the remaining 19% from the United States.[1] The company produces metalorganic chemical vapour deposition equipment, used for making a range of electronic and opto-electronic products containing compound, organic and silicon-based semiconductors as well as nanotubes and nanofibers.[11]
Many AIXTRON systems use a "planetary reactor" process whereby gaseous semiconductor substances are deposited on revolving wafers,[12] while others utilise a Close Coupled "shower head" method of deposition.
Manufacturing sites are located in Herzogenrath near Aachen in Germany, Cambridge in the United Kingdom, and Sunnyvale, California, United States.

History[edit]
AIXTRON was founded as a spin-out industry from RWTH Aachen University in 1983.[3] The company listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange's now-defunct Neuer Markt, in November 1997.[4] Since going public the company has made several acquisitions, with the Scientific Equipment Division of the British company Thomas Swan & Co. and the Swedish chemical vapor deposition equipment maker Epigress AB both purchased in 1999.[5][6]
The company completed a €118 million merger with American rival Genus, Inc. in March 2005[7] and bought British nanomaterial developer Nanoinstruments Ltd., a company spun out from the University of Cambridge, in 2007.[8]
In December 2010 the company converted from a German Aktiengesellschaft to a Societas Europaea to reflect its European and international nature.
In October 2016 China’s Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund LP wanted to acquire Aixtron, but Germany’s economics ministry withdrew the approval of the takeover.[9] In November 2016 the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) recommended both sides to drop their plan, because of national security concerns.[10]
Operations[edit]
65% of AIXTRON's revenues come from clients in Asia, with around 16% coming from Europe and the remaining 19% from the United States.[1] The company produces metalorganic chemical vapour deposition equipment, used for making a range of electronic and opto-electronic products containing compound, organic and silicon-based semiconductors as well as nanotubes and nanofibers.[11]
Many AIXTRON systems use a "planetary reactor" process whereby gaseous semiconductor substances are deposited on revolving wafers,[12] while others utilise a Close Coupled "shower head" method of deposition.
Manufacturing sites are located in Herzogenrath near Aachen in Germany, Cambridge in the United Kingdom, and Sunnyvale, California, United States.
