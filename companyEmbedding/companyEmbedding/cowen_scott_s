Background[edit]
Son of Helen Cowen and Stanley Cowen, Scott Cowen finished his secondary education at Metuchen High School, where he was class president for his first three years and then president of the student council. Upon graduation in 1964 he was cited as "the student who had done the most" for Metuchen High.[6] Cowen was recruited by Lou Holtz to play football for the University of Connecticut, where later-legendary Holtz was briefly serving as an assistant coach. After receiving his bachelor of science degree from UConn in 1968, Cowen entered the United States Army Infantry Officer Candidate School and served for three years as an infantry officer, including a tour in the Middle East. On discharge he enrolled in George Washington University, where he received his master of business administration (MBA) in finance and doctor of business administration (DBA) in finance and management. After a brief stint as an instructor at Bucknell University, he began a 23-year career starting as an assistant professor and finished as dean and Albert J. Weatherhead Professor of Management in the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University.[7]
Cowen chairs the Posse Foundation’s New Orleans Advisory Board[8] and is a director of Barnes & Noble,[9] NACCO Industries,[10] Parkwood Corporation,[11] Forest City Enterprises,[12] Newell Rubbermaid;,[13] the University of Notre Dame,[14] Case Western Reserve University,[11] the New Orleans Museum of Art,[11] and the Weatherhead and Marcus Foundations, respectively.[11][15] He also serves as an overseer of TIAA-CREF[16] and a senior advisor to the Boston Consulting Group.[17] He is a former president of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)[18] and former chair of the American Association of Universities.[19]
President of Tulane[edit]
Prior to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Cowen was known in higher education as a supporter of reform in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to bolster academics involving athletes and also to open Bowl Championship Series (BCS) eligibility to teams in conferences such as Conference USA (C-USA) to which Tulane belonged.[20] Cowen supported efforts "to get rid of the BCS and go to a playoff system."[21]
Hurricane Katrina[edit]
Main article: Effect of Hurricane Katrina on Tulane University
Hurricane Katrina and flood waters resulting from the levee's failures hit Tulane's uptown and downtown campuses shortly after the start of the 2005 fall semester. Cowen led Tulane through a rebuilding and remodeling program,[22] during which the decision to merge and eliminate Newcomb College's quasi-selfstanding character wholly into Tulane was criticized, as was also the decision to reduce the School of Engineering and merge its remaining departments with the other science departments.[23]
Cowen was critical of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the State of Louisiana for their handling of Katrina recovery.[24] In the plans to reconstruct New Orleans' Charity Hospital, Cowen's defended the need for Tulane Medical Center's representation on Charity's board, which resulted in the Louisiana State University System to depart from earlier plans to monopolize the board appointments and instead to seek accommodation with Tulane, Xavier University of Louisiana, and three other institutions in Orleans Parish (Dillard University, Southern University at New Orleans, and Delgado Community College).[25]
Cowen was appointed to the city’s Bring New Orleans Back Commission and charged with leading a committee to reform and rebuild the city’s failing public school system.[26] Cowen also is a co-founder of the Fleur-de-lis Ambassadors program, a group of New Orleans civic leaders dedicated to spreading the message nationwide that post-Katrina New Orleans is an economically viable, livable city with a recovery plan in progress.[27]
Continuing challenges[edit]
In 2009 Cowen represented Louisiana's 10 private colleges and universities when he testified in the Louisiana legislature against a bill that provided for concealed weapons on campuses.[28]
In 2010, both before and after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, Cowen testified, successfully, in the Commerce Committee of the Louisiana senate, against a bill by state senator Robert Adley to terminate funding for the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic.

Also in 2010 Cowen increased his attention to Tulane's athletics program, including a joint announcement with athletics director Rick Dickson that Tulane would build a new practice facility for basketball and volleyball and recognition that Tulane "must get better" in all its athletics programs and especially men's basketball and football. The message announced that Tulane in academic year 2011-2012 would be back up to the 16 athletics teams fielded prior to Katrina.[29]
Awards and honors[edit]
Cowen was one of four US recipients of the Carnegie Corporation Academic Leadership Awards in 2009. Cowen dedicated the $500,000 award to Tulane's community-related activities, including the Cowen Institute for Public Education Initiatives, the Center for Public Service that coordinates the university's service-learning requirements, and social entrepreneurship professorships. The Carnegie Corporation cited Cowen's leadership in New Orleans' recovery from Hurricane Katrina.[30] In 2009, TIME Magazine named Cowen one of the nation’s top "10 Best College Presidents".[31] The following year, Cowen was appointed by President Barack Obama to the White House Council for Community Solutions, which advised the President on ways to reconnect young people who are neither working nor in school.[32] Cowen is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[33]
Recipient of the Times-Picayune Loving Cup for 2010,[34] Cowen holds honorary doctorates from the University of Notre Dame,[35] Brown, Case Western, George Mason, and Yeshiva universities as well as several other universities.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Cowen and his wife Marjorie Feldman Cowen still reside in New Orleans. They have four grown children and five grandchildren.[17]
Scott and Marjorie Cowen were credited by Mary Matalin for swaying her to relocate to New Orleans. They convinced Matalin that her husband James Carville was right about the merits of moving their family to New Orleans. After having breakfast with the Cowens, Matalin went shopping for a house.[36]

Background[edit]
Son of Helen Cowen and Stanley Cowen, Scott Cowen finished his secondary education at Metuchen High School, where he was class president for his first three years and then president of the student council. Upon graduation in 1964 he was cited as "the student who had done the most" for Metuchen High.[6] Cowen was recruited by Lou Holtz to play football for the University of Connecticut, where later-legendary Holtz was briefly serving as an assistant coach. After receiving his bachelor of science degree from UConn in 1968, Cowen entered the United States Army Infantry Officer Candidate School and served for three years as an infantry officer, including a tour in the Middle East. On discharge he enrolled in George Washington University, where he received his master of business administration (MBA) in finance and doctor of business administration (DBA) in finance and management. After a brief stint as an instructor at Bucknell University, he began a 23-year career starting as an assistant professor and finished as dean and Albert J. Weatherhead Professor of Management in the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University.[7]
Cowen chairs the Posse Foundation’s New Orleans Advisory Board[8] and is a director of Barnes & Noble,[9] NACCO Industries,[10] Parkwood Corporation,[11] Forest City Enterprises,[12] Newell Rubbermaid;,[13] the University of Notre Dame,[14] Case Western Reserve University,[11] the New Orleans Museum of Art,[11] and the Weatherhead and Marcus Foundations, respectively.[11][15] He also serves as an overseer of TIAA-CREF[16] and a senior advisor to the Boston Consulting Group.[17] He is a former president of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)[18] and former chair of the American Association of Universities.[19]
President of Tulane[edit]
Prior to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Cowen was known in higher education as a supporter of reform in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to bolster academics involving athletes and also to open Bowl Championship Series (BCS) eligibility to teams in conferences such as Conference USA (C-USA) to which Tulane belonged.[20] Cowen supported efforts "to get rid of the BCS and go to a playoff system."[21]
Hurricane Katrina[edit]
Main article: Effect of Hurricane Katrina on Tulane University
Hurricane Katrina and flood waters resulting from the levee's failures hit Tulane's uptown and downtown campuses shortly after the start of the 2005 fall semester. Cowen led Tulane through a rebuilding and remodeling program,[22] during which the decision to merge and eliminate Newcomb College's quasi-selfstanding character wholly into Tulane was criticized, as was also the decision to reduce the School of Engineering and merge its remaining departments with the other science departments.[23]
Cowen was critical of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the State of Louisiana for their handling of Katrina recovery.[24] In the plans to reconstruct New Orleans' Charity Hospital, Cowen's defended the need for Tulane Medical Center's representation on Charity's board, which resulted in the Louisiana State University System to depart from earlier plans to monopolize the board appointments and instead to seek accommodation with Tulane, Xavier University of Louisiana, and three other institutions in Orleans Parish (Dillard University, Southern University at New Orleans, and Delgado Community College).[25]
Cowen was appointed to the city’s Bring New Orleans Back Commission and charged with leading a committee to reform and rebuild the city’s failing public school system.[26] Cowen also is a co-founder of the Fleur-de-lis Ambassadors program, a group of New Orleans civic leaders dedicated to spreading the message nationwide that post-Katrina New Orleans is an economically viable, livable city with a recovery plan in progress.[27]
Continuing challenges[edit]
In 2009 Cowen represented Louisiana's 10 private colleges and universities when he testified in the Louisiana legislature against a bill that provided for concealed weapons on campuses.[28]
In 2010, both before and after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, Cowen testified, successfully, in the Commerce Committee of the Louisiana senate, against a bill by state senator Robert Adley to terminate funding for the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic.

Also in 2010 Cowen increased his attention to Tulane's athletics program, including a joint announcement with athletics director Rick Dickson that Tulane would build a new practice facility for basketball and volleyball and recognition that Tulane "must get better" in all its athletics programs and especially men's basketball and football. The message announced that Tulane in academic year 2011-2012 would be back up to the 16 athletics teams fielded prior to Katrina.[29]
Awards and honors[edit]
Cowen was one of four US recipients of the Carnegie Corporation Academic Leadership Awards in 2009. Cowen dedicated the $500,000 award to Tulane's community-related activities, including the Cowen Institute for Public Education Initiatives, the Center for Public Service that coordinates the university's service-learning requirements, and social entrepreneurship professorships. The Carnegie Corporation cited Cowen's leadership in New Orleans' recovery from Hurricane Katrina.[30] In 2009, TIME Magazine named Cowen one of the nation’s top "10 Best College Presidents".[31] The following year, Cowen was appointed by President Barack Obama to the White House Council for Community Solutions, which advised the President on ways to reconnect young people who are neither working nor in school.[32] Cowen is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[33]
Recipient of the Times-Picayune Loving Cup for 2010,[34] Cowen holds honorary doctorates from the University of Notre Dame,[35] Brown, Case Western, George Mason, and Yeshiva universities as well as several other universities.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Cowen and his wife Marjorie Feldman Cowen still reside in New Orleans. They have four grown children and five grandchildren.[17]
Scott and Marjorie Cowen were credited by Mary Matalin for swaying her to relocate to New Orleans. They convinced Matalin that her husband James Carville was right about the merits of moving their family to New Orleans. After having breakfast with the Cowens, Matalin went shopping for a house.[36]

Background[edit]
Son of Helen Cowen and Stanley Cowen, Scott Cowen finished his secondary education at Metuchen High School, where he was class president for his first three years and then president of the student council. Upon graduation in 1964 he was cited as "the student who had done the most" for Metuchen High.[6] Cowen was recruited by Lou Holtz to play football for the University of Connecticut, where later-legendary Holtz was briefly serving as an assistant coach. After receiving his bachelor of science degree from UConn in 1968, Cowen entered the United States Army Infantry Officer Candidate School and served for three years as an infantry officer, including a tour in the Middle East. On discharge he enrolled in George Washington University, where he received his master of business administration (MBA) in finance and doctor of business administration (DBA) in finance and management. After a brief stint as an instructor at Bucknell University, he began a 23-year career starting as an assistant professor and finished as dean and Albert J. Weatherhead Professor of Management in the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University.[7]
Cowen chairs the Posse Foundation’s New Orleans Advisory Board[8] and is a director of Barnes & Noble,[9] NACCO Industries,[10] Parkwood Corporation,[11] Forest City Enterprises,[12] Newell Rubbermaid;,[13] the University of Notre Dame,[14] Case Western Reserve University,[11] the New Orleans Museum of Art,[11] and the Weatherhead and Marcus Foundations, respectively.[11][15] He also serves as an overseer of TIAA-CREF[16] and a senior advisor to the Boston Consulting Group.[17] He is a former president of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)[18] and former chair of the American Association of Universities.[19]
President of Tulane[edit]
Prior to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Cowen was known in higher education as a supporter of reform in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to bolster academics involving athletes and also to open Bowl Championship Series (BCS) eligibility to teams in conferences such as Conference USA (C-USA) to which Tulane belonged.[20] Cowen supported efforts "to get rid of the BCS and go to a playoff system."[21]
Hurricane Katrina[edit]
Main article: Effect of Hurricane Katrina on Tulane University
Hurricane Katrina and flood waters resulting from the levee's failures hit Tulane's uptown and downtown campuses shortly after the start of the 2005 fall semester. Cowen led Tulane through a rebuilding and remodeling program,[22] during which the decision to merge and eliminate Newcomb College's quasi-selfstanding character wholly into Tulane was criticized, as was also the decision to reduce the School of Engineering and merge its remaining departments with the other science departments.[23]
Cowen was critical of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the State of Louisiana for their handling of Katrina recovery.[24] In the plans to reconstruct New Orleans' Charity Hospital, Cowen's defended the need for Tulane Medical Center's representation on Charity's board, which resulted in the Louisiana State University System to depart from earlier plans to monopolize the board appointments and instead to seek accommodation with Tulane, Xavier University of Louisiana, and three other institutions in Orleans Parish (Dillard University, Southern University at New Orleans, and Delgado Community College).[25]
Cowen was appointed to the city’s Bring New Orleans Back Commission and charged with leading a committee to reform and rebuild the city’s failing public school system.[26] Cowen also is a co-founder of the Fleur-de-lis Ambassadors program, a group of New Orleans civic leaders dedicated to spreading the message nationwide that post-Katrina New Orleans is an economically viable, livable city with a recovery plan in progress.[27]
Continuing challenges[edit]
In 2009 Cowen represented Louisiana's 10 private colleges and universities when he testified in the Louisiana legislature against a bill that provided for concealed weapons on campuses.[28]
In 2010, both before and after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, Cowen testified, successfully, in the Commerce Committee of the Louisiana senate, against a bill by state senator Robert Adley to terminate funding for the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic.

Also in 2010 Cowen increased his attention to Tulane's athletics program, including a joint announcement with athletics director Rick Dickson that Tulane would build a new practice facility for basketball and volleyball and recognition that Tulane "must get better" in all its athletics programs and especially men's basketball and football. The message announced that Tulane in academic year 2011-2012 would be back up to the 16 athletics teams fielded prior to Katrina.[29]
Awards and honors[edit]
Cowen was one of four US recipients of the Carnegie Corporation Academic Leadership Awards in 2009. Cowen dedicated the $500,000 award to Tulane's community-related activities, including the Cowen Institute for Public Education Initiatives, the Center for Public Service that coordinates the university's service-learning requirements, and social entrepreneurship professorships. The Carnegie Corporation cited Cowen's leadership in New Orleans' recovery from Hurricane Katrina.[30] In 2009, TIME Magazine named Cowen one of the nation’s top "10 Best College Presidents".[31] The following year, Cowen was appointed by President Barack Obama to the White House Council for Community Solutions, which advised the President on ways to reconnect young people who are neither working nor in school.[32] Cowen is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[33]
Recipient of the Times-Picayune Loving Cup for 2010,[34] Cowen holds honorary doctorates from the University of Notre Dame,[35] Brown, Case Western, George Mason, and Yeshiva universities as well as several other universities.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Cowen and his wife Marjorie Feldman Cowen still reside in New Orleans. They have four grown children and five grandchildren.[17]
Scott and Marjorie Cowen were credited by Mary Matalin for swaying her to relocate to New Orleans. They convinced Matalin that her husband James Carville was right about the merits of moving their family to New Orleans. After having breakfast with the Cowens, Matalin went shopping for a house.[36]

President Emeritus Scott S. Cowen

President Emeritus and Distinguished University Professor
 Tulane University
Click here for more information about Dr. Cowen’s work, publications, and latest updates.
Scott S. Cowen is President Emeritus and Distinguished University Professor of Tulane University and served as Tulane’s 14th president from July 1998 through June 2014.
TIME magazine named Cowen one of the nation’s Top 10 Best College Presidents and he was one of only four university leaders nationwide to receive the 2009 Carnegie Corporation Academic Leadership Award. In 2010 Cowen was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, one of the world’s most prestigious honorary societies. That same year he was appointed by President Barack Obama to the White House Council for Community Solutions, which advised the President on ways to reconnect and empower young people who are neither employed nor in school. In 2012-2013 Cowen served as chair of the Association of American Universities, an association comprised of 62 major research universities in North America. In recognition of his commitment to higher education and society at large, Cowen received the 2014 TIAA-CREF Theodore M. Hesburgh Award for Leadership Excellence in Higher Education.
Cowen is the recipient of honorary degrees from institutions such as Brown University, Yeshiva University, the University of Connecticut, Xavier University of Louisiana, the University of Notre Dame and Case Western Reserve University. He is also the recipient of The Times-Picayune’s Loving Cup, which each year honors a New Orleanian who has worked unselfishly for the community without expectation of recognition or material reward. He has been honored by New Orleans CityBusiness as one of the 30 “Driving Forces” in New Orleans in the last 30 years and by Gambit as New Orleanian of the Year in 2011.
During Cowen’s 16-year tenure, Tulane University more than quadrupled its undergraduate applications while experiencing all-time highs in student quality. In addition, Tulane more than doubled the level of total private giving to the university and received a record level of research awards. Under Cowen’s leadership, the university implemented a number of innovative academic and research program initiatives and significantly increased its community outreach. As a result of Tulane’s growth, the university invested approximately $700 million in new and renovated facilities in the last nine years of Cowen’s presidency.
In recognition of Tulane’s achievements under Cowen, the university was noted as one of the “Hottest Schools in America” by Newsweek magazine in 2002 and 2008, and has been nationally recognized on numerous occasions for its civic engagement programs, while also being consistently ranked in the top tier of national research universities.
In June 2008 Cowen announced the successful completion of “Promise and Distinction: The Campaign for Tulane,” which surpassed its $700 million goal, making it the largest university fundraising effort in the history of Louisiana. Upon the completion of a comprehensive university-wide planning process in 2012, Cowen launched a $1 billion- plus campaign to support the university’s long-term future.
Cowen led Tulane through the most trying period of its history when, in August 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated the city of New Orleans, flooding 70 percent of Tulane’s uptown campus and all the buildings of its downtown health sciences campus. Tulane’s faculty, staff and students were dispersed around the country for an entire semester. Under Cowen’s leadership, the campus was repaired and in December 2005, the Board of Tulane approved his Renewal Plan, a sweeping effort that strengthened and focused the university’s academic mission while strategically addressing its current and future operations in the post-Katrina era. A remarkable 87 percent of Tulane undergraduate students returned for classes in January 2006, just months after the storm.
In response to Katrina, Cowen was appointed to the city’s Bring New Orleans Back Commission and charged with leading a committee to reform and rebuild the city’s failing public school system. Cowen has devoted his days and nights to these monumental tasks and has had impressive results. As part of this effort, Tulane chartered a K-12 school in New Orleans and created an Institute for Public Education Initiatives to support the transformation of public education in New Orleans. In addition, Cowen has served as a commissioner of the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority, which played a major role in the rebuilding of Orleans Parish in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. He also served as chair of the Southeast Regional Airport Authority and commissioner of the New Orleans Public Belt Railroad.
Cowen was co-founder of the Fleur-de-lis Ambassadors program, a group of New Orleans civic leaders who, in the aftermath of the storm, spread the message nationwide that post-Katrina New Orleans was an economically viable, livable city with a recovery plan in progress. The Ambassadors also actively sought support for the recovery of New Orleans from businesses and philanthropic organizations around the country.
Cowen has held leadership positions in national academic and professional associations, including the American Council on Education, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the NCAA, Conference-USA, the National Merit Scholarship Corporation and the Council of Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). He currently serves as a trustee of the University of Notre Dame, as an overseer of TIAA-CREF, and as a trustee of the Weatherhead and Marcus Foundations, respectively.
Prior to coming to Tulane, Cowen was at Case Western Reserve University for 23 years as a professor, including 14 years as dean of the Weatherhead School of Management and the Weatherhead Professor of Management. During this time period he served as president of the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business. He is the author of five books and more than 100 academic and professional articles, essays and reviews. His most recent book The Inevitable City: The Resurgence of New Orleans and the Future of Urban America was published in June 2014.
Cowen’s areas of scholarship and teaching focus on strategic financial management systems, corporate governance and leadership. He has consulted with and served on the boards of numerous companies, from startups to Fortune 100 companies and is currently a board member of Newell Rubbermaid Inc., NACCO Industries, Parkwood Corporation, Barnes & Noble and Forest City Enterprises.
Cowen received his bachelor’s degree from the University of Connecticut in 1968. After serving a three-year term in the U.S. Army as an infantry officer from 1968-1971, he went back to school and received masters and doctoral degrees in business administration from the George Washington University.
Cowen and his wife, Marjorie, have four adult children and four grandchildren.

Biotech – Cowen Analysis: When Insiders Buy, Investors Should Too
Cowen analyzed 4K+ open market transactions made by insiders at the 10 largest biotechnology companies over the last 10 years. We find that purchases by insiders are a strong predictor of outperformance, while stock sales by insiders have little predictive value. When insiders purchase shares of fundamentally strong companies, a successful strategy would seem to be to buy right along with them.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cowen Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:COWN) (“Cowen” or the “Company”) today 
      announced the expansion of Cowen and Company’s investment banking team 
      with the addition of four managing directors: Stephen Clarke,

      (TMT); A. Scott Lemone, Retail and Consumer; and Prasad Parmeshwaran, 
      Health Care M&A. Mr. Clarke, Mr. Fisher and Mr. Lemone have also brought

      “Today’s announcement is a continuation of Cowen’s disciplined plan to 
      expand its investment banking capabilities within our focus sectors,”

      transactions. We look forward to their success on our growing platform.”

      in debt and equity capital raising as well as merger and equity stakes, 
      cross-border transactions, shareholder activist situations and takeover

In recognition of his commitment to higher education and society at large, Cowen received the 2014 TIAA-CREF Theodore M. Hesburgh Award for Leadership Excellence in Higher Education.
The truth is in the time after Hurricane Katrina the fate of New Orleans was depending on the vision and competence of a guy that grew up in New Jersey. That person was Tulane President Dr. Scott Cowen.
New Orleanians unanimously credit him as being the most significant individual in the resurrection and rebirth of our city. - James CarvilleCowen is the recipient of honorary degrees from institutions such as Brown University, Yeshiva University, George Mason University, the University of Connecticut, Xavier University of Louisiana, the University of Notre Dame and Case Western Reserve University. He is also the recipient of The Times-Picayune’s Loving Cup, which each year honors a New Orleanian who has worked unselfishly for the community without expectation of recognition or material reward. He has been honored by New Orleans CityBusiness as one of the 30 “Driving Forces” in New Orleans in the last 30 years and by Gambit as New Orleanian of the Year in 2011.

Nine Presidents to Watch
Scott Cowen
 




Daymon Gardner for TIMEScott Cowen 


	
								In September 2005 most of Tulane University lay underwater. Hurricane Katrina had just carved its name into New Orleans, and the school's 13,200 students and 8,700 employees found themselves scattered across the nation. In January 2006, Tulane reopened. And while the Crescent City's three other universities (Xavier, Dillard and Loyola) showed equal resilience, it is Tulane president Scott Cowen who has emerged as both a deft academic leader and a committed civic booster. In addition to helping reconfigure the city's devastated K-12 public schools, Cowen has given the university a sense of renewed vigor. Despite having to cut undergraduate enrollment by about 600, fire professors and either eliminate or combine academic programs, Cowen reports that applications have more than doubled in the years since Katrina. Many of those applicants are attracted by Tulane's commitment to rebuilding New Orleans. "One of the critical decisions we made was to integrate public service into the university's core curriculum so that every student would engage in public service for all four years," Cowen says. That's one way to fight ivory-tower syndrome. Gilbert Cruz

SCOTT COWEN 






















 





LEADERSHIP + CIVIC ENGAGEMENT + URBAN REVITALIZATION 

"The job ahead, for all of us, is to live up 
to that founding vision: to rebuild our
cities, open wide the doors of possibility, 
and revive the American dream." 


 




















Welcome I chose my words carefully in 2013 when I announced my plans to retire as president of Tulane University.
I tried to make sure my colleagues and friends knew I was retiring from the presidency of Tulane, not from work or life! In addition to promoting my new book, The Inevitable City: The Resurgence of New Orleans and the Future of Urban America, I will also continue my efforts to improve K-12 education in New Orleans and my work with Opportunity Youth.more

Scott Cowen Teaches Leadership

            by Mary Sparacello | Tulane New Wave

President Emeritus and Distinguished University Chair Cowen asks the students probing questions and peppers his lecture with anecdotes from his own experience as well as erudite references to articles and books.

Innovation in Professional Education: Steps on a Journey from Teaching to Learning

Richard E. Boyatzis, Scott S. Cowen, David A. Kolb 
ISBN: 978-0-7879-0032-8
280 pages
November 1994, Jossey-Bass



















Description
Based on the experience of the restructuring of the MBA program at
Case Western Reserve University, the book describes the
transformation of a program from one where student learning was
incidental to teaching and research into one where learning is
preeminent. Draws from ten years of curriculum change efforts to
trace the entire process of program redesign, from initial
discussion to implementation and evaluation. Examines strategic
planning within the professional school and describes in detail the
Managerial Assessment Course--a key element of the new program and
a driving force for self-directed learning.

The book provides specific designs, methods, and procedures for
conducting outcome assessment studies, including five types
particularly relevant to professional schools: alumni studies,
employer studies, faculty studies, student-change studies, and
professional competency studies. Throughout the book, the authors
and contributors describe a wealth of useful, thought-provoking
ideas and learnings on management education and institutional
change.

Background[edit]
Son of Helen Cowen and Stanley Cowen, Scott Cowen finished his secondary education at Metuchen High School, where he was class president for his first three years and then president of the student council. Upon graduation in 1964 he was cited as "the student who had done the most" for Metuchen High.[6] Cowen was recruited by Lou Holtz to play football for the University of Connecticut, where later-legendary Holtz was briefly serving as an assistant coach. After receiving his bachelor of science degree from UConn in 1968, Cowen entered the United States Army Infantry Officer Candidate School and served for three years as an infantry officer, including a tour in the Middle East. On discharge he enrolled in George Washington University, where he received his master of business administration (MBA) in finance and doctor of business administration (DBA) in finance and management. After a brief stint as an instructor at Bucknell University, he began a 23-year career starting as an assistant professor and finished as dean and Albert J. Weatherhead Professor of Management in the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University.[7]
Cowen chairs the Posse Foundation’s New Orleans Advisory Board[8] and is a director of Barnes & Noble,[9] NACCO Industries,[10] Parkwood Corporation,[11] Forest City Enterprises,[12] Newell Rubbermaid;,[13] the University of Notre Dame,[14] Case Western Reserve University,[11] the New Orleans Museum of Art,[11] and the Weatherhead and Marcus Foundations, respectively.[11][15] He also serves as an overseer of TIAA-CREF[16] and a senior advisor to the Boston Consulting Group.[17] He is a former president of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)[18] and former chair of the American Association of Universities.[19]
President of Tulane[edit]
Prior to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Cowen was known in higher education as a supporter of reform in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to bolster academics involving athletes and also to open Bowl Championship Series (BCS) eligibility to teams in conferences such as Conference USA (C-USA) to which Tulane belonged.[20] Cowen supported efforts "to get rid of the BCS and go to a playoff system."[21]
Hurricane Katrina[edit]
Main article: Effect of Hurricane Katrina on Tulane University
Hurricane Katrina and flood waters resulting from the levee's failures hit Tulane's uptown and downtown campuses shortly after the start of the 2005 fall semester. Cowen led Tulane through a rebuilding and remodeling program,[22] during which the decision to merge and eliminate Newcomb College's quasi-selfstanding character wholly into Tulane was criticized, as was also the decision to reduce the School of Engineering and merge its remaining departments with the other science departments.[23]
Cowen was critical of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the State of Louisiana for their handling of Katrina recovery.[24] In the plans to reconstruct New Orleans' Charity Hospital, Cowen's defended the need for Tulane Medical Center's representation on Charity's board, which resulted in the Louisiana State University System to depart from earlier plans to monopolize the board appointments and instead to seek accommodation with Tulane, Xavier University of Louisiana, and three other institutions in Orleans Parish (Dillard University, Southern University at New Orleans, and Delgado Community College).[25]
Cowen was appointed to the city’s Bring New Orleans Back Commission and charged with leading a committee to reform and rebuild the city’s failing public school system.[26] Cowen also is a co-founder of the Fleur-de-lis Ambassadors program, a group of New Orleans civic leaders dedicated to spreading the message nationwide that post-Katrina New Orleans is an economically viable, livable city with a recovery plan in progress.[27]
Continuing challenges[edit]
In 2009 Cowen represented Louisiana's 10 private colleges and universities when he testified in the Louisiana legislature against a bill that provided for concealed weapons on campuses.[28]
In 2010, both before and after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, Cowen testified, successfully, in the Commerce Committee of the Louisiana senate, against a bill by state senator Robert Adley to terminate funding for the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic.

Also in 2010 Cowen increased his attention to Tulane's athletics program, including a joint announcement with athletics director Rick Dickson that Tulane would build a new practice facility for basketball and volleyball and recognition that Tulane "must get better" in all its athletics programs and especially men's basketball and football. The message announced that Tulane in academic year 2011-2012 would be back up to the 16 athletics teams fielded prior to Katrina.[29]
Awards and honors[edit]
Cowen was one of four US recipients of the Carnegie Corporation Academic Leadership Awards in 2009. Cowen dedicated the $500,000 award to Tulane's community-related activities, including the Cowen Institute for Public Education Initiatives, the Center for Public Service that coordinates the university's service-learning requirements, and social entrepreneurship professorships. The Carnegie Corporation cited Cowen's leadership in New Orleans' recovery from Hurricane Katrina.[30] In 2009, TIME Magazine named Cowen one of the nation’s top "10 Best College Presidents".[31] The following year, Cowen was appointed by President Barack Obama to the White House Council for Community Solutions, which advised the President on ways to reconnect young people who are neither working nor in school.[32] Cowen is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[33]
Recipient of the Times-Picayune Loving Cup for 2010,[34] Cowen holds honorary doctorates from the University of Notre Dame,[35] Brown, Case Western, George Mason, and Yeshiva universities as well as several other universities.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Cowen and his wife Marjorie Feldman Cowen still reside in New Orleans. They have four grown children and five grandchildren.[17]
Scott and Marjorie Cowen were credited by Mary Matalin for swaying her to relocate to New Orleans. They convinced Matalin that her husband James Carville was right about the merits of moving their family to New Orleans. After having breakfast with the Cowens, Matalin went shopping for a house.[36]

Background[edit]
Son of Helen Cowen and Stanley Cowen, Scott Cowen finished his secondary education at Metuchen High School, where he was class president for his first three years and then president of the student council. Upon graduation in 1964 he was cited as "the student who had done the most" for Metuchen High.[6] Cowen was recruited by Lou Holtz to play football for the University of Connecticut, where later-legendary Holtz was briefly serving as an assistant coach. After receiving his bachelor of science degree from UConn in 1968, Cowen entered the United States Army Infantry Officer Candidate School and served for three years as an infantry officer, including a tour in the Middle East. On discharge he enrolled in George Washington University, where he received his master of business administration (MBA) in finance and doctor of business administration (DBA) in finance and management. After a brief stint as an instructor at Bucknell University, he began a 23-year career starting as an assistant professor and finished as dean and Albert J. Weatherhead Professor of Management in the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University.[7]
Cowen chairs the Posse Foundation’s New Orleans Advisory Board[8] and is a director of Barnes & Noble,[9] NACCO Industries,[10] Parkwood Corporation,[11] Forest City Enterprises,[12] Newell Rubbermaid;,[13] the University of Notre Dame,[14] Case Western Reserve University,[11] the New Orleans Museum of Art,[11] and the Weatherhead and Marcus Foundations, respectively.[11][15] He also serves as an overseer of TIAA-CREF[16] and a senior advisor to the Boston Consulting Group.[17] He is a former president of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)[18] and former chair of the American Association of Universities.[19]

Background[edit]
Son of Helen Cowen and Stanley Cowen, Scott Cowen finished his secondary education at Metuchen High School, where he was class president for his first three years and then president of the student council. Upon graduation in 1964 he was cited as "the student who had done the most" for Metuchen High.[6] Cowen was recruited by Lou Holtz to play football for the University of Connecticut, where later-legendary Holtz was briefly serving as an assistant coach. After receiving his bachelor of science degree from UConn in 1968, Cowen entered the United States Army Infantry Officer Candidate School and served for three years as an infantry officer, including a tour in the Middle East. On discharge he enrolled in George Washington University, where he received his master of business administration (MBA) in finance and doctor of business administration (DBA) in finance and management. After a brief stint as an instructor at Bucknell University, he began a 23-year career starting as an assistant professor and finished as dean and Albert J. Weatherhead Professor of Management in the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University.[7]
Cowen chairs the Posse Foundation’s New Orleans Advisory Board[8] and is a director of Barnes & Noble,[9] NACCO Industries,[10] Parkwood Corporation,[11] Forest City Enterprises,[12] Newell Rubbermaid;,[13] the University of Notre Dame,[14] Case Western Reserve University,[11] the New Orleans Museum of Art,[11] and the Weatherhead and Marcus Foundations, respectively.[11][15] He also serves as an overseer of TIAA-CREF[16] and a senior advisor to the Boston Consulting Group.[17] He is a former president of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)[18] and former chair of the American Association of Universities.[19]
President of Tulane[edit]
Prior to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Cowen was known in higher education as a supporter of reform in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to bolster academics involving athletes and also to open Bowl Championship Series (BCS) eligibility to teams in conferences such as Conference USA (C-USA) to which Tulane belonged.[20] Cowen supported efforts "to get rid of the BCS and go to a playoff system."[21]
Hurricane Katrina[edit]
Main article: Effect of Hurricane Katrina on Tulane University
Hurricane Katrina and flood waters resulting from the levee's failures hit Tulane's uptown and downtown campuses shortly after the start of the 2005 fall semester. Cowen led Tulane through a rebuilding and remodeling program,[22] during which the decision to merge and eliminate Newcomb College's quasi-selfstanding character wholly into Tulane was criticized, as was also the decision to reduce the School of Engineering and merge its remaining departments with the other science departments.[23]
Cowen was critical of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the State of Louisiana for their handling of Katrina recovery.[24] In the plans to reconstruct New Orleans' Charity Hospital, Cowen's defended the need for Tulane Medical Center's representation on Charity's board, which resulted in the Louisiana State University System to depart from earlier plans to monopolize the board appointments and instead to seek accommodation with Tulane, Xavier University of Louisiana, and three other institutions in Orleans Parish (Dillard University, Southern University at New Orleans, and Delgado Community College).[25]
Cowen was appointed to the city’s Bring New Orleans Back Commission and charged with leading a committee to reform and rebuild the city’s failing public school system.[26] Cowen also is a co-founder of the Fleur-de-lis Ambassadors program, a group of New Orleans civic leaders dedicated to spreading the message nationwide that post-Katrina New Orleans is an economically viable, livable city with a recovery plan in progress.[27]
Continuing challenges[edit]
In 2009 Cowen represented Louisiana's 10 private colleges and universities when he testified in the Louisiana legislature against a bill that provided for concealed weapons on campuses.[28]
In 2010, both before and after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, Cowen testified, successfully, in the Commerce Committee of the Louisiana senate, against a bill by state senator Robert Adley to terminate funding for the Tulane University Environmental Law Clinic.

Also in 2010 Cowen increased his attention to Tulane's athletics program, including a joint announcement with athletics director Rick Dickson that Tulane would build a new practice facility for basketball and volleyball and recognition that Tulane "must get better" in all its athletics programs and especially men's basketball and football. The message announced that Tulane in academic year 2011-2012 would be back up to the 16 athletics teams fielded prior to Katrina.[29]
Awards and honors[edit]
Cowen was one of four US recipients of the Carnegie Corporation Academic Leadership Awards in 2009. Cowen dedicated the $500,000 award to Tulane's community-related activities, including the Cowen Institute for Public Education Initiatives, the Center for Public Service that coordinates the university's service-learning requirements, and social entrepreneurship professorships. The Carnegie Corporation cited Cowen's leadership in New Orleans' recovery from Hurricane Katrina.[30] In 2009, TIME Magazine named Cowen one of the nation’s top "10 Best College Presidents".[31] The following year, Cowen was appointed by President Barack Obama to the White House Council for Community Solutions, which advised the President on ways to reconnect young people who are neither working nor in school.[32] Cowen is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[33]
Recipient of the Times-Picayune Loving Cup for 2010,[34] Cowen holds honorary doctorates from the University of Notre Dame,[35] Brown, Case Western, George Mason, and Yeshiva universities as well as several other universities.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Cowen and his wife Marjorie Feldman Cowen still reside in New Orleans. They have four grown children and five grandchildren.[17]
Scott and Marjorie Cowen were credited by Mary Matalin for swaying her to relocate to New Orleans. They convinced Matalin that her husband James Carville was right about the merits of moving their family to New Orleans. After having breakfast with the Cowens, Matalin went shopping for a house.[36]

Tulane University President Scott Cowen is one of 229 leaders in science, public affairs and the arts and humanities who have been elected members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a 230-year-old center for independent policy research.
Tulane University President Scott Cowen 

The academy, which issued the list of inductees Monday, was founded by a group that included John Adams and John Hancock. Among its members have been George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Daniel Webster, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Albert Einstein and Winston Churchill. Membership is for life. 

"To think that I'm amongst the giants who have been in there humbles me," Cowen, 63, said Monday. "I am just very surprised and very pleased. This is one of the most prestigious honors you can receive."

Others elected with Cowen include actors Denzel Washington and John Lithgow; director Francis Ford Coppola; jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins; dancer Suzanne Farrell; G. Wayne Clough, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution; Stephen Bosworth, United States' special envoy to North Korea; David Ferriero, archivist of the United States; and James Leach, chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities.

The induction ceremony will be held Oct. 9 at the academy's headquarters in Cambridge, Mass.

The academy studies complex and emerging policies in such fields as science, technology, global security, social policy, the humanities, culture and education.

Members are called upon to work on these projects. Cowen, who learned of his election Friday night, said he does not know yet what his work will include.

This is the latest in a series of honors for Cowen, who has been Tulane's president since July 1998. This year's recipient of The Times-Picayune Loving Cup, Cowen has received the Carnegie Corporation Academic Leadership Award and been named one of the nation's top 10 college presidents by Time magazine.

He has been a leader in the Hurricane Katrina recovery effort. Mayor Ray Nagin appointed him to the Bring New Orleans Back Commission and the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority, and Cowen founded the Fleur de Lis Ambassadors to barnstorm the country to ensure that Americans remember and care about New Orleans.

As a result of his education-related work on the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, Cowen founded the Cowen Institute for Public Education Initiatives.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
