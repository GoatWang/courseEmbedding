Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NN (NASDAQ:NNBR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $33.50 (16.32% upside)

Eye-Catching Commercial Decorations 

Inform. Message Flags and Message Banners are available with easy-to-read text to give your clients a call to action --  Sale, Now Leasing, Grand Opening, or Best Deals.

Appeal. Complimentary color combinations can be used to enhance the overall   appearance of the business and can relay the mood of the event as   well--playful, formal, patriotic.

Entertain. Creative string pennants are designed to follow, flutter or wave in the wind and can easily add visual interest.

 Commercial decorations can be inexpensive, so have some fun and try different styles to find one that works for your business.  Better yet, change the decorations often to keep your storefront fresh and  interesting.

            Shop FlagandBanner.com for advertising message flags, multi-colored flags, and colored string pennants.

Colorful String Pennant Flags (String Flags or String Pennants)


Colorful String Pennant Flags (String Flags or String Pennants)

Colorful string pennant flags (also known as string flags or pennant strings) are a great way to catch a person's attention. They flutter and fly in the wind, catching the sunlight and creating an instant "look at me" moment. String pennants are great for multiple functions - advertising, grand openings, birthday parties, sports events, restricted access areas, and as backstroke flags. String pennant flags are available in a large array of colors so that you can match up the colors you need with your event. Made in the USA!  If you don't see your color combo already made up, don't fret. Give us a call or use our handy  Custom Order Request for the colors you need. Looking for American Flag themed string pennant flags? Check out these  patriotic string pennants!

More about string pennants and string flags:
Pennants are flags and banners used to display awards, celebratory messages, team spirit, and serve basic decorative purposes. Pennants are generally triangular but other shapes can be found as well, the pennants on this page however deal only with decorative uses. 
The two most popular pennant shapes are the triangle and chevron, but some pennants may come in rectangular shapes or as miniature flags as well. (Check out  our patriotic string pennants for other flag based or patriotic designs.)
The most common decorative use for string flags or string pennants is on car lots, generally to catch attention and highlight specific segments of the lot.
Decorative pennant flags or string flags are sometimes used as part of room designs to create a streamer-type banner effect.
