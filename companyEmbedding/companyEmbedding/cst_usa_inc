Customs Brokerage


Entry of foreign merchandise into the commerce of the United States is complex due to the laws and regulations. US Customs & Border Protection polices the regulations not only for Customs but all other government agencies such as Food & Drug Administration, Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Product Safety, and Agriculture.
Our team streamlines the process to expedite your cargo. We assist the importer in understanding the expectations of US Customs and other government agencies to ensure accurate declarations. We have authority to enter merchandise through any US port of entry. We process in-bond movement of cargo, ATA Carnets, border crossings, and issue required Customs bonds.
CST is known for our service. We keep the importer informed of the movement of the cargo until the shipment is delivered. Our goal is to provide the service and keep the importer compliant with all rules and regulations.
CST, Inc. is a validated partner participating in the C-TPAT program.

About Us


Consulting by Sandra Tovar, Inc. dba CST, Inc. was incorporated in November of 1994 as a consulting business serving textile and apparel companies importing under the Free Trade Agreements.  We assist importers in understanding the complex rules of importing and to maintain compliance within their company in order to avoid penalties and delays of their merchandise. 
The regulations are complex and the required recordkeeping is essential to substantiate the preferential duty treatment.  CST believes companies need to understand the expectations of US Customs in order to be compliant.
We began customs brokerage in 1996 in the port of Atlanta, Georgia.  We expanded to Puerto Rico in 1998 and maintain a strong relationship there.  Our service is excellent.  We are flexible in order to accommodate our customers’ needs.

Consulting


Our company is based on the educational process of importers. The rules are complex but Customs has the authority to enforce the laws, issue penalties, and seize uncompliant merchandise.
Our job is to assist our clients in understanding their responsibilities as an importer. We do educational seminars, assist with any correspondence with US Customs, and obtain rulings from Customs for prospective imported products.
We take the complicated rules of the Free Trade Agreements and make them as simple as possible to understand. We give advice on how to construct the product to obtain a lower duty rate when possible.
Understanding the rules of importing is crucial to remain compliant and avoid Customs penalties.
Let us help you through the complexities of importing.
