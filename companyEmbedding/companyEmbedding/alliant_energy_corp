How we restore your power






We're proud of our record of service. In recent years, nearly 75 percent of all power outages in our service territory have been repaired in two hours or less.
Assessing the situation
Every call helps our crews and operators. It helps us figure out how large the outage is and the cause of the outage.

Once an outage has been diagnosed, our Distribution Dispatch Center sends crews to repair any damaged equipment and get the power flowing again.
Outage protocols
Alliant Energy and other utility companies follow a standard protocol for restoring power quickly and safely:

Make sure police and fire departments and hospitals have power.
Check generation facilities to determine if the original power source is still operating.
Repair transmission lines that carry electricity from the generation stations to substations.
Repair substations where high-voltage power from the transmission lines is reduced for home usage.
Repair distribution lines that carry electricity from substations to each neighborhood.
Repair the tap lines that serve anywhere from 20-300 homes and businesses.
Reconnect lines to individual customers - this is the most difficult and time-consuming step in the restoration process.

When this process is complete, your home may still be without power. That means there is damage to your home's electrical system and a licensed electrician will be needed to complete the work.






Power blinks and power surges






Power blinks 
Have you ever come home to find your digital clocks flashing "12:00"? It's caused by a power blink - a brief interruption that's designed to prevent a longer power outage.

Blinks occur when an obstruction, like a tree limb, comes into contact with a power line or transformer. To prevent damage to the utility system or your home, a circuit breaker interrupts the electricity for a fraction of a second.

If the limb remains on the line, the breaker opens and tries to close again. If the obstruction is still on the line after the third try, the breaker opens and does not close automatically.

At this point, a utility worker must be dispatched to remove the obstruction and manually reset the breaker.

Power blinks rarely cause damage to equipment. Older digital clocks and other devices are the most vulnerable to blinks; newer models are designed to ride out these small voltage fluctuations.
Power surges
A power surge is a variation in electrical voltage. Power surges last less than 1/100th of a second and range in intensity depending on the situation.

Up to 80 percent of all power surges originate within the home - when devices with motors shut off or start up, diverting energy to and from other appliances. Common culprits of internal surges are power tools, refrigerators, printers and hair dryers. Smaller "everyday" surges can slowly destroy your expensive electric appliances - a process called "electronic rust."

External power surges are generally caused by uncontrollable events, such as lightning strikes, animals interfering with electrical equipment, and vehicle accidents with utility poles. Large power surges, such as lightning, can instantly ruin your TV, computer and other electronics. 
Is Alliant Energy responsible for power surges?
Alliant Energy is responsible only for surges that occur due to negligence of our personnel. Most surges are caused by factors outside of the control of telephone, cable and electric utilities.

We are not responsible for surges caused by lightning, animals, tree limbs, faulty wiring or surges created within your home or beyond control of Alliant Energy.
How can I protect my home electronics from power surges?
The best way to prevent damage from power surges is to invest in high-quality surge protectors. All programmable appliances should be connected to a surge protector, including home entertainment systems, computer equipment and other digital devices.

Also remember that power surges can come into your home through other utility lines as well as electrical, so be sure to connect incoming cable and satellite TV lines, and all telephone lines, including fax and modem.

Suppliers

We approach relationships with suppliers the way we approach everything else we do: exploring ways to deliver energy and exceptional service our customers and communities count on – safely, efficiently and responsibly.







We have a focus on competitive costs, and suppliers can play a key role in helping us in this area. We are also very interested in working with diverse suppliers so that our business reflects the diversity of the communities we serve.

If you are a current supplier, or are interested in becoming an Alliant Energy supplier, please create a supplier profile in the Alliant Energy Supplier Registration Tool. Please refer to the Supplier Registration Instructions.pdf to navigate within the tool.
The following steps are required for the registration process:

Go to the Alliant Energy Supplier Registration Tool to create a personal account and a company profile.
We request basic contact and company information, but you also have the option to include products and services your company provides on the “Products and Services” tab. This will help Alliant Energy identify suppliers for the category being sourced.
If you are a current supplier and required to provide us with proof of insurance, you must attach a copy of the Certificate of Insurance to your supplier profile and maintain the expiration dates within the “Insurance” tab.


Conduct and ethics
Alliant Energy expects all of its suppliers to adhere to the highest level of conduct and ethics in its dealings with Alliant Energy, and when it is dealing with third parties on behalf of the Company. As such, Alliant Energy expects its suppliers to adhere to the Alliant Energy Code of Conduct.pdf.

Our Code requires that business dealings be fair, honest and objective. In particular, we expect that our suppliers will participate in bid processes and procurement practices in accordance with best practices. Best practices include communicating only with the named Alliant Energy representatives during contract negotiations or bid evaluation, refraining from “back door selling,” and attempts to influence Alliant Energy employees or senior management in order to obtain work.

Alliant Energy may disqualify suppliers who engage in these activities or violate the Alliant Energy Code of Conduct from continuing business with Alliant Energy and from making future bids.

Supplier and contractor safety requirements
We have established a business relationship with ISNetworld to help our company objectively manage contractor safety prequalification requirements.

As a result, the majority of contractors performing physical work for Alliant Energy will be required to become subscribers to ISNetworld. Contractors performing non-physical or what we determine to be low-risk physical contract work will not be required to subscribe.

History[edit]
Alliant Energy Corporation is a public utility holding company headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin. Alliant Energy's two regulated utilities include Interstate Power and Light Company (IPL) and Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL). IPL started in 1925 as the Interstate Power Company (IPC) and which was a consolidation of several small utility companies scattered across northern Iowa and southern Minnesota. IPC merged or consolidated with several other Iowa-based utilities before forming IPL, which was later merged with WPL.
IPC expanded greatly in the late 1920s to include operations in Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Manitoba (Canada). One of the largest purchases in the late 1920s was the purchase of what became its northern Minnesota territory from the Wilbur Foshay interests. Also was widely carried along CSX Rail lines.
In the 1930s and 1940s, the effects of the Depression and passage of laws to regulate utility operations at the state and federal level had an effect on IPC as well as its neighbors. In Iowa, the legislature passed laws making it easier for cities to establish municipal utilities (and indeed, there are over 100 municipal utilities in Iowa today). By 1940, the state of Nebraska had passed laws that forced all investor-owned utilities in that state to sell their operations to one of several "public power districts" operating in that state.
During the 1940s, IPC divested itself of all its operations that were not part of its main territory in southern MN / northern Iowa. The largest chunk of territory was that operating in northeast ND / northern MN / Emerson, Manitoba which was sold in summer 1943 and fall 1944. The SD properties (around Winner) were sold in 1946. It would not be until 1956 when the last isolated district — the area around Waconia, MN — was sold to Northern States Power.
As IPC sold its properties that were isolated from the main system, it picked up others that were adjacent to its system and more easily interconnected: the Eastern Iowa Power system, and the Iowa / Minnesota properties of the Central States Power and Light Corporation.
The Wisconsin operations were sold to Wisconsin Power and Light (ironically, now the eastern half of Alliant's operations).
The other part of IPL — IES Utilities — incorporated in Iowa in 1925 as the Iowa Railway and Light Corporation and was later known as Iowa Electric Light and Power Company. IES expanded across that part of Iowa south of IPC's territory, eventually acquiring the Iowa operations of the Union Electric Company of St. Louis, MO.
IES and IPC merged in the mid-1990s to form IPL.[5] Today, IPL provides electricity and gas to communities in Iowa and southern Minnesota; while WPL serves southern and central Wisconsin.[4] In late 2007, Alliant Energy received final approval to sell their utility services in Illinois to Jo-Carroll Energy.
In 2000, the utility purchased the naming rights to the campus of the Dane County Expo Center just southwest of downtown Madison, including the county-owned arena, which were all renamed the Alliant Energy Center.
In the 1970s IES constructed the Duane Arnold Energy Center, a 615 MW nuclear plant in Palo, Iowa. In 2006, Alliant closed a deal with FPL Energy to sell their stake in the plant.[6]
Alliant Energy also provides several non-regulated services, including ground transportation and energy engineering (such as wind and geothermal energy).
In 2007 it acquired 200 MW Buffalo Creek Wind Farm at Hampton, Iowa from Wind Capital Group.[7]
Alliant Energy sold to ITC Holdings their transmission system( 34.5kV, 69kV, 115kV, 161kV and 345kV) in Iowa and Minnesota in 2007.
In 2015, the company finalized the sale of its Minnesota territory to a consortium of 12 electric cooperatives operating in that state.
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Alliant Energy shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Vanguard group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and others[8])

History[edit]
Alliant Energy Corporation is a public utility holding company headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin. Alliant Energy's two regulated utilities include Interstate Power and Light Company (IPL) and Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL). IPL started in 1925 as the Interstate Power Company (IPC) and which was a consolidation of several small utility companies scattered across northern Iowa and southern Minnesota. IPC merged or consolidated with several other Iowa-based utilities before forming IPL, which was later merged with WPL.
IPC expanded greatly in the late 1920s to include operations in Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Manitoba (Canada). One of the largest purchases in the late 1920s was the purchase of what became its northern Minnesota territory from the Wilbur Foshay interests. Also was widely carried along CSX Rail lines.
In the 1930s and 1940s, the effects of the Depression and passage of laws to regulate utility operations at the state and federal level had an effect on IPC as well as its neighbors. In Iowa, the legislature passed laws making it easier for cities to establish municipal utilities (and indeed, there are over 100 municipal utilities in Iowa today). By 1940, the state of Nebraska had passed laws that forced all investor-owned utilities in that state to sell their operations to one of several "public power districts" operating in that state.
During the 1940s, IPC divested itself of all its operations that were not part of its main territory in southern MN / northern Iowa. The largest chunk of territory was that operating in northeast ND / northern MN / Emerson, Manitoba which was sold in summer 1943 and fall 1944. The SD properties (around Winner) were sold in 1946. It would not be until 1956 when the last isolated district — the area around Waconia, MN — was sold to Northern States Power.
As IPC sold its properties that were isolated from the main system, it picked up others that were adjacent to its system and more easily interconnected: the Eastern Iowa Power system, and the Iowa / Minnesota properties of the Central States Power and Light Corporation.
The Wisconsin operations were sold to Wisconsin Power and Light (ironically, now the eastern half of Alliant's operations).
The other part of IPL — IES Utilities — incorporated in Iowa in 1925 as the Iowa Railway and Light Corporation and was later known as Iowa Electric Light and Power Company. IES expanded across that part of Iowa south of IPC's territory, eventually acquiring the Iowa operations of the Union Electric Company of St. Louis, MO.
IES and IPC merged in the mid-1990s to form IPL.[5] Today, IPL provides electricity and gas to communities in Iowa and southern Minnesota; while WPL serves southern and central Wisconsin.[4] In late 2007, Alliant Energy received final approval to sell their utility services in Illinois to Jo-Carroll Energy.
In 2000, the utility purchased the naming rights to the campus of the Dane County Expo Center just southwest of downtown Madison, including the county-owned arena, which were all renamed the Alliant Energy Center.
In the 1970s IES constructed the Duane Arnold Energy Center, a 615 MW nuclear plant in Palo, Iowa. In 2006, Alliant closed a deal with FPL Energy to sell their stake in the plant.[6]
Alliant Energy also provides several non-regulated services, including ground transportation and energy engineering (such as wind and geothermal energy).
In 2007 it acquired 200 MW Buffalo Creek Wind Farm at Hampton, Iowa from Wind Capital Group.[7]
Alliant Energy sold to ITC Holdings their transmission system( 34.5kV, 69kV, 115kV, 161kV and 345kV) in Iowa and Minnesota in 2007.
In 2015, the company finalized the sale of its Minnesota territory to a consortium of 12 electric cooperatives operating in that state.
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Alliant Energy shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Vanguard group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and others[8])

Energy management: Sensus will help strengthen power grid in Iowa through new agreement with Alliant Energy Corp.








06/21/2017


































Sponsored by












Energy management: Sensus, a Xylem brand, will help strengthen the power grid in Iowa through a new agreement with Alliant Energy Corp. The companies entered into an agreement to add the Sensus FlexNet® communication system to Alliant Energy’s power grid and natural gas system in Iowa over a three-year period.

The project represents one of Sensus’ largest communication system deployments in the U.S. and includes network deployment, electric and gas meter equipment and installation, and software installation. The project will also update the software for Alliant Energy’s Wisconsin energy company, which already has the FlexNet system.

“The Sensus communication system is foundational to building a smarter power grid in Iowa,” said Linda Mattes, vice president of customer operations. “The technology will improve service to our customers, provide better data to operate our system and position us for future customer options.”[Native Advertisement]

“Providing solutions that address our customers’ needs, so they in turn can better serve their own customers, is our top priority,” said Xylem President and CEO Patrick Decker. “We’re very pleased to expand our relationship with Alliant Energy, bringing the benefits that our advanced metering and communication technologies provide to more customers. Our Sensus FlexNet communication system continues to be the network of choice because of its proven ability to connect multiple applications in a secure, reliable and cost-effective environment.”

The two-way FlexNet network enables utilities to collect, deliver, manage and analyze data in near real time.

History[edit]
Alliant Energy Corporation is a public utility holding company headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin. Alliant Energy's two regulated utilities include Interstate Power and Light Company (IPL) and Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL). IPL started in 1925 as the Interstate Power Company (IPC) and which was a consolidation of several small utility companies scattered across northern Iowa and southern Minnesota. IPC merged or consolidated with several other Iowa-based utilities before forming IPL, which was later merged with WPL.
IPC expanded greatly in the late 1920s to include operations in Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Manitoba (Canada). One of the largest purchases in the late 1920s was the purchase of what became its northern Minnesota territory from the Wilbur Foshay interests. Also was widely carried along CSX Rail lines.
In the 1930s and 1940s, the effects of the Depression and passage of laws to regulate utility operations at the state and federal level had an effect on IPC as well as its neighbors. In Iowa, the legislature passed laws making it easier for cities to establish municipal utilities (and indeed, there are over 100 municipal utilities in Iowa today). By 1940, the state of Nebraska had passed laws that forced all investor-owned utilities in that state to sell their operations to one of several "public power districts" operating in that state.
During the 1940s, IPC divested itself of all its operations that were not part of its main territory in southern MN / northern Iowa. The largest chunk of territory was that operating in northeast ND / northern MN / Emerson, Manitoba which was sold in summer 1943 and fall 1944. The SD properties (around Winner) were sold in 1946. It would not be until 1956 when the last isolated district — the area around Waconia, MN — was sold to Northern States Power.
As IPC sold its properties that were isolated from the main system, it picked up others that were adjacent to its system and more easily interconnected: the Eastern Iowa Power system, and the Iowa / Minnesota properties of the Central States Power and Light Corporation.
The Wisconsin operations were sold to Wisconsin Power and Light (ironically, now the eastern half of Alliant's operations).
The other part of IPL — IES Utilities — incorporated in Iowa in 1925 as the Iowa Railway and Light Corporation and was later known as Iowa Electric Light and Power Company. IES expanded across that part of Iowa south of IPC's territory, eventually acquiring the Iowa operations of the Union Electric Company of St. Louis, MO.
IES and IPC merged in the mid-1990s to form IPL.[5] Today, IPL provides electricity and gas to communities in Iowa and southern Minnesota; while WPL serves southern and central Wisconsin.[4] In late 2007, Alliant Energy received final approval to sell their utility services in Illinois to Jo-Carroll Energy.
In 2000, the utility purchased the naming rights to the campus of the Dane County Expo Center just southwest of downtown Madison, including the county-owned arena, which were all renamed the Alliant Energy Center.
In the 1970s IES constructed the Duane Arnold Energy Center, a 615 MW nuclear plant in Palo, Iowa. In 2006, Alliant closed a deal with FPL Energy to sell their stake in the plant.[6]
Alliant Energy also provides several non-regulated services, including ground transportation and energy engineering (such as wind and geothermal energy).
In 2007 it acquired 200 MW Buffalo Creek Wind Farm at Hampton, Iowa from Wind Capital Group.[7]
Alliant Energy sold to ITC Holdings their transmission system( 34.5kV, 69kV, 115kV, 161kV and 345kV) in Iowa and Minnesota in 2007.
In 2015, the company finalized the sale of its Minnesota territory to a consortium of 12 electric cooperatives operating in that state.
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Alliant Energy shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Vanguard group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and others[8])

History[edit]
Alliant Energy Corporation is a public utility holding company headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin. Alliant Energy's two regulated utilities include Interstate Power and Light Company (IPL) and Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL). IPL started in 1925 as the Interstate Power Company (IPC) and which was a consolidation of several small utility companies scattered across northern Iowa and southern Minnesota. IPC merged or consolidated with several other Iowa-based utilities before forming IPL, which was later merged with WPL.
IPC expanded greatly in the late 1920s to include operations in Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Manitoba (Canada). One of the largest purchases in the late 1920s was the purchase of what became its northern Minnesota territory from the Wilbur Foshay interests. Also was widely carried along CSX Rail lines.
In the 1930s and 1940s, the effects of the Depression and passage of laws to regulate utility operations at the state and federal level had an effect on IPC as well as its neighbors. In Iowa, the legislature passed laws making it easier for cities to establish municipal utilities (and indeed, there are over 100 municipal utilities in Iowa today). By 1940, the state of Nebraska had passed laws that forced all investor-owned utilities in that state to sell their operations to one of several "public power districts" operating in that state.
During the 1940s, IPC divested itself of all its operations that were not part of its main territory in southern MN / northern Iowa. The largest chunk of territory was that operating in northeast ND / northern MN / Emerson, Manitoba which was sold in summer 1943 and fall 1944. The SD properties (around Winner) were sold in 1946. It would not be until 1956 when the last isolated district — the area around Waconia, MN — was sold to Northern States Power.
As IPC sold its properties that were isolated from the main system, it picked up others that were adjacent to its system and more easily interconnected: the Eastern Iowa Power system, and the Iowa / Minnesota properties of the Central States Power and Light Corporation.
The Wisconsin operations were sold to Wisconsin Power and Light (ironically, now the eastern half of Alliant's operations).
The other part of IPL — IES Utilities — incorporated in Iowa in 1925 as the Iowa Railway and Light Corporation and was later known as Iowa Electric Light and Power Company. IES expanded across that part of Iowa south of IPC's territory, eventually acquiring the Iowa operations of the Union Electric Company of St. Louis, MO.
IES and IPC merged in the mid-1990s to form IPL.[5] Today, IPL provides electricity and gas to communities in Iowa and southern Minnesota; while WPL serves southern and central Wisconsin.[4] In late 2007, Alliant Energy received final approval to sell their utility services in Illinois to Jo-Carroll Energy.
In 2000, the utility purchased the naming rights to the campus of the Dane County Expo Center just southwest of downtown Madison, including the county-owned arena, which were all renamed the Alliant Energy Center.
In the 1970s IES constructed the Duane Arnold Energy Center, a 615 MW nuclear plant in Palo, Iowa. In 2006, Alliant closed a deal with FPL Energy to sell their stake in the plant.[6]
Alliant Energy also provides several non-regulated services, including ground transportation and energy engineering (such as wind and geothermal energy).
In 2007 it acquired 200 MW Buffalo Creek Wind Farm at Hampton, Iowa from Wind Capital Group.[7]
Alliant Energy sold to ITC Holdings their transmission system( 34.5kV, 69kV, 115kV, 161kV and 345kV) in Iowa and Minnesota in 2007.
In 2015, the company finalized the sale of its Minnesota territory to a consortium of 12 electric cooperatives operating in that state.

As of 2017 Alliant Energy shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Vanguard group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and others[8])

In 2000, the utility purchased the naming rights to the campus of the Dane County Expo Center just southwest of downtown Madison, including the county-owned arena, which were all renamed the Alliant Energy Center.
In the 1970s IES constructed the Duane Arnold Energy Center, a 615 MW nuclear plant in Palo, Iowa. In 2006, Alliant closed a deal with FPL Energy to sell their stake in the plant.[6]
Alliant Energy also provides several non-regulated services, including ground transportation and energy engineering (such as wind and geothermal energy).
In 2007 it acquired 200 MW Buffalo Creek Wind Farm at Hampton, Iowa from Wind Capital Group.[7]
Alliant Energy sold to ITC Holdings their transmission system( 34.5kV, 69kV, 115kV, 161kV and 345kV) in Iowa and Minnesota in 2007.
In 2015, the company finalized the sale of its Minnesota territory to a consortium of 12 electric cooperatives operating in that state.
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Alliant Energy shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Vanguard group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, and others[8])

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
