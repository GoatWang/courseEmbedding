How we make them
To create our business credit reports, we start with the original source or the best third-party verified data available covering all US businesses (excluding self-completed information). We then cross-reference it with our own international databases to build our online business credit reports.
Our trade payment lines enable us to calculate an accurate picture of a business' payment performance and allow you to gauge how they rank against their industry. With market-leading numbers of partners, we have in excess of 100 million trade payment lines in our databases. On average we provide over 50 lines of information in each delivered report and show more than one line on at least 24 million businesses.

Our business credit scores and limits are constructed using powerful analytical tools that are constantly verified to ensure the accuracy of their predictability. We cross-reference our US group structure information with our international databases to make certain that we can always show all the associated businesses from around the world.
We provide all this rich data in an intuitive format which means you can always find the data you need easily and check business credit scores right away.


How you get them
The best business credit reports in the world aren’t worth reading if they’re not about the actual business you’re doing business with. Our online business credit reports are powered by Creditsafe’s search engine. We’ll always generate a full selection of search results so you can be certain you're looking at the right business.
Our possible matches function will enable you to see businesses that share either the same name and address as the business you’ve searched for, or parts of the name or parts of the address. This is a great way of finding a false shell company or identifying those businesses that keep setting up with slightly different names out of the same address after a track record of failure.

Since we have the world’s largest cross-referenced database, we’ll also conduct an international search every time so you can immediately spot any associated or similar business from around the world. Our freedom access model means you never have to worry about the cost of accidentally checking a business credit report.

We offer instant access to over 190 million companies in our international reports.

Goldman Sachs Is Going To Start A New Type Of Fund For Its Rich Clients

  It's official. Goldman
  Sachs has inaugurated the second stage of Wall Street's
  development after Dodd-Frank and the Volcker
  Rule.

  The first post-reform stage was the transformation of proprietary
  trading units into market-making trading units.

  Before Volcker, Wall Street firms risked their own capital
  trading securities with counterparties. After Volcker, Wall
  Street firms risked their own capital trading securities in
  anticipation and reaction to customer order flow. The old way was
  to ask: "how can we make money by reacting to market events?" The
  new way is to ask: "how can we make money by reacting to customer
  reactions to market events?"

  See the difference? In the old way, you had
  counterparties. In the new way, you focus on
  customers. And those two words — counterparty
  and customer — are totally spelled differently despite
  beginning with the same letter.

  Officially, this was the "getting rid of things we aren't allowed
  to have anymore" stage: hedge funds, private equity funds, prop
  trading outfits. Goldman was a big leader in shedding the stuff
  they figured was taboo even before the final rules were written.





  And now we've entered the next stage, the "building new things
  that we think we can have" stage. In this stage, Wall Street
  firms will attempt to do things that are a lot like what they
  used to do — but in new ways, using new kinds of legal loopholes
  because the old ones were sewn shut with Volcker thread.
Goldman is
  once again taking the lead in this business.

  Ordinary folks will think this means Wall Street is getting
  around the Volcker Rule. But that's why they are so ordinary. On
  Wall Street this is called "compliance."

  The new thing Goldman is going to start doing 
  is running a credit fund for wealthy customers that will invest
  in the unrated debt of mid-sized companies. This will replace
  the old thing Goldman did to run a credit fund for wealthy
  customers that wanted to invest in risky debt.

  The old things at Goldman were called "hedge funds." The new
  thing is called a "business-development company."

  Actually, business-development companies — or BDC if you want to
  sound knowing — aren't really all that new. They've been around
  for decades. They just weren't all that attractive to investment
  banks that could run hedge funds, which were less regulated.

  Goldman's new business-development company will be called
  "Goldman Sachs Liberty Harbor Capital LLC" — probably because the
  guy who came up with this idea has an office that looks out at
  the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. It will sell shares to
  investors in a private placement. Liberty Harbor will then borrow
  money to enhance its ability to buy up loads of debt that has
  never been rated by a credit-rating agency.

  The managers of GS Liberty Harbor LLC — let's call it GoSaLiHa,
  pronounced "Go Sell It Ha!" — are a bunch of guys — and, maybe,
  some gals, but this is Wall Street so, you know, probably not —
  who went over to Goldman after their old hedge fund, Amaranth
  Advisors, imploded back in 2006.

  You will have to try not to confuse GoSaLiHa with a hedge fund
  run by these same people called Liberty Harbor, which is part of
  Goldman Sachs's asset-management group. Liberty Harbor manages
  about $5 billion in assets, according to a fund prospectus. That
  was one of the old things Goldman did. And although it's still
  doing this thing because the Volcker prohibitions are phased in
  over eternity, eventually Goldman's desire to run the fund
  without being able to own a major part of it will diminish.

  Ominously, when GoSaLiHa was first uncovered by Reuters'
  Matt Goldstein 
  back in January, it was run by Greg Felton. He has since left
  Goldman. No one knows why. It will now be run by Raanan Agus, the
  co-head of Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, which is another
  hedge fund run by Goldman.

  But please remember: This isn't a hedge fund! Or a private equity
  company!

  There are many things a hedge fund or private-equity company
  could theoretically do that a BDC cannot do. The law limits the
  amount of debt a BDC can take on to an amount equal to its
  equity. BDCs cannot have single positions that are larger than 25
  percent of their portfolio. Most importantly, they are also
  required to have most percent of their assets in privately issued
  securities of private companies not listed on any national
  exchange.

  But they can also do things that hedge funds could not. Like take
  in investors who aren't super wealthy. Investors do not need to
  meet the income, net worth, or sophistication criteria imposed on
  private-equity investment. So these things can be sold to
  ordinary investors — although that certainly is not Goldman's
  plan. It has too many extraordinary investors to even think about
  selling to ordinary folk.

  Bonus regulatory compliance: Goldman said in its public filings
  that this BDC will also count as an "emerging-growth company"
  under Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. This means it
  can take advantage of reduced reporting rules meant to encourage
  tech start-ups to go public. So none of those pesky
  Sarbanes-Oxley audited internal controls requirements. And if
  Goldman were to IPO this thing, the bank doing the underwriting
  could produce research reports touting it.

  What does it mean to have a credit fund that counts as a start-up
  for disclosure and a business development company run by Wall
  Street's premier investment bank? No one really knows.

  As far as I can tell, no one ever contemplated what would happen
  if someone put hedge-fund managers specializing in risky credit
  in charge of a BDC that is also a JOBS Act emerging-growth
  company. Or, at least, no one who wasn't at Goldman Sachs ever
  did.

  But what could go wrong?

How we make them
To create our business credit reports, we start with the original source or the best third-party verified data available covering all US businesses (excluding self-completed information). We then cross-reference it with our own international databases to build our online business credit reports.
Our trade payment lines enable us to calculate an accurate picture of a business' payment performance and allow you to gauge how they rank against their industry. With market-leading numbers of partners, we have in excess of 100 million trade payment lines in our databases. On average we provide over 50 lines of information in each delivered report and show more than one line on at least 24 million businesses.

Our business credit scores and limits are constructed using powerful analytical tools that are constantly verified to ensure the accuracy of their predictability. We cross-reference our US group structure information with our international databases to make certain that we can always show all the associated businesses from around the world.
We provide all this rich data in an intuitive format which means you can always find the data you need easily and check business credit scores right away.


How you get them
The best business credit reports in the world aren’t worth reading if they’re not about the actual business you’re doing business with. Our online business credit reports are powered by Creditsafe’s search engine. We’ll always generate a full selection of search results so you can be certain you're looking at the right business.
Our possible matches function will enable you to see businesses that share either the same name and address as the business you’ve searched for, or parts of the name or parts of the address. This is a great way of finding a false shell company or identifying those businesses that keep setting up with slightly different names out of the same address after a track record of failure.

Since we have the world’s largest cross-referenced database, we’ll also conduct an international search every time so you can immediately spot any associated or similar business from around the world. Our freedom access model means you never have to worry about the cost of accidentally checking a business credit report.

WHY MONITOR YOUR EXPERIAN BUSINESS CREDIT REPORT?


Business credit reports form the basis for decisions other businesses make about you. 
By using a convenient, online
 business credit reporting service from Experian,
you can make sure that data in your business credit report is accurate, which will enable the following financial decisions:




How much business credit a supplier will extend to you
What interest rates you will pay
How much money lending institutions will loan you
How your customers view you
What your insurance premiums will be
The level of potential investor interest








WHY EVALUATE OTHER COMPANIES' BUSINESS CREDIT REPORTS?

Many experienced and successful entrepreneurs all agree that success is in the details. By utilizing an objective
 business credit reporting service from Experian to monitor a partner or supplier's company credit report, you can discover the following in advance: 




The status of prospective customers' payment practices
Existing clients' business conditions
Suppliers' historical relationships with others
Notifications about changes to suppliers' or customers' business credit reports
What your competitors are doing
Other financially pertinent details




Having immediate access to such data can mean the difference between your profit
and loss — your success and failure.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
