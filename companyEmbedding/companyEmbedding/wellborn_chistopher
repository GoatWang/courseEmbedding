	"In his new position, Chris will assist me in the development and execution of the company's strategy to expand our business and grow the value of Mohawk," Lorberbaum continued. "He brings a strong combination of operational excellence and financial skills to this position. Chris and his team have built Dal-Tile into the world's largest ceramic tile and stone company. He was instrumental in the integration of the Mohawk and Dal-Tile businesses, which leveraged the best of both organizations while keeping the unique attributes which have made us successful." 
	Lorberbaum also noted that Wellborn has served on Mohawk's Board of Directors since 2002 and added that the company's recent acquisition of Unilin, a European and U.S. laminate flooring manufacturer, has positioned Mohawk as "a world-class flooring company."
