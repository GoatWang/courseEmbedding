Company History
We’ve come a long way over the last 160 years, building a reputation as a world leader in the development and supply of specialty soap bases.

Manufacturing Soap Bases Since 1856










History


Stephenson Group was formed in Bradford, Yorkshire, England in 1856 originally manufacturing soap based agents for the processing of wool, along with Furniture Wax and Polish products. Over the course of the last 50 years Stephenson Group has diversified and opened up new markets with new creative chemistry and innovation.


The amalgamation of Thos. Bentley & Son with Stephenson Bros and the subsequent takeover of J.C. Thompson Ltd formed the foundation of the current Stephenson Group; and the manufacturing operations were focused on a state of the art facility in Horsforth, Leeds.
In the late 1990s Stephenson Group transformed with the introduction of Personal Care products focused on speciality soap bases using saponification technology.


This brought a new dimension to the company and now forms a key part of the group’s operations. Stephenson Personal Care is now well established as one of the world’s leading speciality soap base manufacturers and continues to meet the demands of customers worldwide.
Stephenson Group Ltd is run by CEO Jamie Bentley – now the fifth generation of the family to lead the company.

Stephens Metal















































From start to finish.
Your one stop precision manufacturing solution.



OUR SERVICES
CNC punching, Laser Cutting, Waterjet Cutting, Precision Forming, CNC Machining, CNC Turning, Robotic Welding, Welding, Rolling/Shearing/Sawing, Automated Powder Coating, Batch Powdercoating, Finishing/Assembly/Insertion


		LARGE CAPACITIES








								Dependable personnel and equipment. We have some of the largest capacities on the West Coast: the largest robotic weld cell for a job shop, with a 28’swing and multiple 6500lb positioner capacity; laser cutting envelopes of 160”x80”; large precision forming with accuracies of .00004” on a 8-axis 242ton 14’ Pressbrake; machining envelopes of 120”x40”x30” with full 4th axis capabilities.
							







		DONE IN ONE








Being able to produce a finished part on one machine with one setup is invaluable to achieve low lot quantities and maintain accuracies on the first part. This can be seen throughout our shop. Our Laser/turret combination machine allows us to form geometry right into the finished parts.
This also allows us to use the speed of the turret to put in common holes and use the dexterity of a laser to finish it off. One of our machining examples is our 12-axis lathe, with capabilities to make difficult components a reality in even small quantities. We can literally load raw stock into one side of the machine and have finished deburred product come out the out feed conveyor untouched.
Our large vertical machining center can hold very large and heavy work in its 4-axis. It uses a touch probe to locate the exact position of the work, (before machining), to process the work on all sides, then measure the part for accuracy before it is removed from the machine after it is machined. We aspire to have the first part correct and accurate as efficiently as possible.








		REDUNDANCY








								We take pride in knowing that when, not if, one of our machines or personnel goes ill that we are still able to produce the components that you need on time. This is one of the key reasons for our high on time delivery record.
