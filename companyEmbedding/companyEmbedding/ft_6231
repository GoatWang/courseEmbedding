The brown treesnake on GuamProduct Type: Science FeatureYear: 2002Author(s): Fritts, T. and D. Leasman-TannerSuggested Citation: Fritts, T. and D. Leasman-Tanner. 2002. The brown treesnake on Guam. 01/01/1901Shortly after World War II, and before 1952, the brown Treesnake was accidentally transported from its native range in the South Pacific to Guam, probably as a stowaway in ship cargo. As a result of abnormally abundant prey resources on Guam and the absence of natural predators and other population controls, brown Treesnake populations reached unprecedented numbers. Snakes caused the extirpation of most of the native forest vertebrate species; thousands of power outages affecting private, commercial, and military activities; widespread loss of domestic birds and pets; and considerable emotional trauma to residents and visitors alike when snakes invaded human habitats with the potential for severe envenomation of small children. Since Guam is a major transportation hub in the Pacific, numerous opportunities exist for the brown Treesnakes on Guam to be introduced accidentally to other Pacific islands as passive stowaways in ship and air traffic from Guam. Numerous sightings of this species have been reported on other islands, and an incipient population is probably established on Saipan. It is important that people who may come in contact with the brown Treesnake, particularly on neighboring islands and other high-risk sites, understand the scope of this problem and how to identify the snake so proper action can be taken.
This resource has been developed to provide source materials on the history of the invasion, continuing threats, research results, and containment and management of the brown Treesnake (Boiga irregularis) in Guam and its relevance to other islands and mild continental environments.

This beautiful quality-built home with 3 car garage offers over 4000 SF of finished space with 4 generous bedrooms, first floor office w/french doors and built-in shelving, and sun room. The kitchen was remodeled in 2014 with quartz countertops, new appliances and backsplash. The finished lower level includes a family room with built-in theatre system, renovated wet bar for indoor entertainment and plenty of space to play. During the warmer weather, bring your cooking outside to the beautiful wood deck while listening to your favorite music on the outdoor speaker system. The basketball court in the backyard is a perfect place to shoot hoops! And for those who enjoy history and hiking, Prophets Rock and the Wabash Heritage Trail is just one mile away (close enough to walk to!), and Prophets Town State Park with bicycle trails, a water park, hiking, and fishing is just a stones throw away! From the gracious 2 story entry to the generous and open living space beyond, the quality and style are evident. Updates include newer HVAC, water heater (2013), radon system (2015), ductwork & laundry vent cleaned (2016), refinished hardwood floors (2017) with biannual HVAC service and pest inspections. This home has been well maintained and is move-in ready!
