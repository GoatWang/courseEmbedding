AP250 - The Most Adaptable Enterprise Wireless Access Point
The AP250 is a 3x3:3, dual radio, 802.11ac Wave 2 access point with a software selectable radio, designed for the best coverage and capacity.
“We are eager to deploy the AP250 access points in order to leverage higher density 5GHz coverage. We believe that the software selectable radio will play a key role in our transition from a network designed for coverage to one designed for capacity.”  Norman Elton, Network Engineer, College of William & Mary

Does Your Network Adapt to Change?
Modern networks must continuously adjust and adapt to keep up with the pace of change that mobility has created, something now unachievable in traditional network architectures. SD-LAN builds on the principles of Software Defined Networks (SDN) in the data center and Software Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) to create a new approach to adaptable, flexible, and cost effective wireless and wired access network. 
“One of the great advantages with Aerohive’s SD-LAN is that not only is it an intuitive solution and easy to manage, but as our needs change and expand, we also can adopt and add enterprise features and adapt the network as required.  It was important to MassChallenge to find a solution partner that was also entrepreneurial at heart, and that understood our mission and vision. We are confident Aerohive is able to support and connect with us at all levels.” Roman Kern, Senior Director of Programs and Operations, MassChallenge

At Aerohive, our Sales Team is a group of go-getters, that are self-motivated and thrive in a fast paced, competitive environment. Our reps have an internal drive to succeed whether it be exceeding quotas, closing a prospective customer, or taking the initiative to broaden their product knowledge. It is the reason why we offer uncapped commissions with aggressive accelerators. But our Sales floor is hardly all work and no play. Each sale is celebrated (a celebration that can heard throughout HQ might we add) and top performers are recognized weekly.
How we sell Aerohive is completely channel sales driven, with channel partners such as Dell and CDW. Aerohive reps are responsible building and managing the relationships of our resellers and existing accounts, but also pursuing new leads and potential customers. We offer the tools and training needed to develop top sales performers, as we believe in promoting within the organization and offer lots of opportunity for growth.
Aerohive is currently looking to expand our Sales Team with openings for both our entry level and more experienced sales roles. Ready to join?

Candidate Preparation


Our Hiring Process


Interview Preparation


Aerohive at a Glance











Searching Jobs & Applying

Search our Open Jobs 
Register and create a profile in our database. This will allow you to apply for multiple jobs and will make your resume searchable by our recruiters.
Fill out and submit the job application; you will receive an automated email to confirm that we have received the application.
Our recruiters will review your profile and share it with our hiring team.
If your background and experience matches one of our open positions, a recruiter will reach out to you directly. Due to the high volume of applications received, not all candidates will be contacted for interviews.



Interview Process
Our interview process will vary depending on the group and location of the interview. Generally, you can expect:

One telephone interview with an Aerohive recruiter
1 - 2 telephone interviews with a hiring manager or member of the hiring team. If interviewing for a technical position, this step may include coding questions using a sharable document such as a Google Document.
2 or more in-person interviews with the hiring team. In-person interviews may include one-on-one or panel interviews and can take between 1 -5 hours depending on the position.

An Aerohive recruiter will be available throughout the process to answer your questions and keep you informed of the expected timeline. The time it takes to make a hiring decision will differ for every position, however, we will make every effort to provide you with prompt feedback after your interview. You should feel fully empowered to contact your recruiter to check on timeline and next steps.


Considering an Offer
We understand that deciding to accept a new job can be an equally exciting and stressful life-changing decision. There is much to consider when making your decision:


The Company's Story
 and Values
Financial Compensation for the positionIn addition to our Benefits and Perks, our compensation package offers a competitive combination of base salary, equity, and variable performance-based pay.
The health and reputation of the company

We encourage you to ask questions throughout the interview and offer process to learn more about Aerohive and make sure we are the right fit!





 





Study up on Aerohive
Our hiring team will expect you to have done some research before your interview. You should have a general understanding of our products and services and how we differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Luckily, there are resources you can use:

Aerohive Networks Website
This Careers page!
Aerohive LinkedIn page
Aerohive Wikipedia page
Aerohive YouTube
Aerohive Twitter



Preparing for a Technical Interview
If you are interviewing for one of our engineering positions, chances are the majority of your time interviewing will involve technical assessment and coding questions. Above all else, we want to see if you can write good code with sound design. We will be looking at your analytical skills and your ability to course correct throughout the coding exercise. Recommendations for success:

Study up on basic algorithms and data structures (especially if you are rusty)
Practice writing code on a whiteboard or on a shareable document such as a Google Document. We might use one or both of these mediums through the interview process and you will be able to write code faster if you have practiced.
Explain your work as you code. Your answer may not be perfect right away, but this way the interviewer can follow along with you and see that you understand the problem.



Ready, Set, Practice!
Preparation is key for a great interview. One way to prepare for an interview (and shake the nerves) is to practice with a friend or in front of a mirror. Half of the battle is being able to communicate strong examples of your previous work into STAR responses. STAR is a method of answering interview questions using examples of your past behavior. Our hiring teams are trained to look for these types of responses from candidates.

Situation: What was the specific event or situation?
Task/Obstacle: What were you responsible to accomplish?
Action: What actions did you take? Be specific.
Result: What was the outcome? Whenever possible add a specific metric of success (revenue added, cost saved, etc.).






 









 


 

The Candidate Experience is of great importance at Aerohive Networks. Regardless of your status in the hiring process, your feedback and experience matters greatly to us so we would appreciate if you can complete a survey that will ask several questions about your experience as a job applicant. This is a completely anonymous survey and the results will be directed to a 3rd party, the Talent Board. Once all responses are collected and analyzed, Aerohive will receive a compiled report in October on how well Aerohive is doing against other companies and where we can improve so that we are sure to provide a truly memorable and respectful experience for ALL job applicants.

 Read More  


In appreciation for your time, we will offer a $10 Starbucks gift card for all completed surveys submitted on or before 7/30/17. All you need to do is send a follow up email to Talentacquisition@aerohive.com and confirm the date and time the survey was completed (send a screenshot of the last page of the survey). Responses will remain anonymous. We will email the gift card to you within 10 business days of receiving your email confirmation.

How to Apply for E-rate

 Step 1 - Getting Started  


You will need to have this information available to start the E-Rate process:

What are your plans or goals for your E-rate Wi-Fi project?
What is your District or School’s student enrollment?
Use these tools to determine your E-rate discount percentage:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

For public schools, find out your NSLP (National Students Lunch Program) percentage
For private and faith based schools who may not know their percentage, use the Alternative Funding Mechanism (AFM) survey
Use the USAC scoring matrix to map the NSLP percentage to your E-rate discount percentage


Use the urban/rural online tool on the USAC site to determine your classification
What is your total Wi-Fi budget for E-rate? Use the Aerohive online E-rate calculator

Next you must determine the size and scope of your project:

Select the Aerohive solution that best fits your needs
If you are submitting an RFP, use the Aerohive RFP template.



  Step 2 - Filing Your Form 470  

The Form 470 is the application form that begins the E-rate process. This form lets interested vendors and service providers know that you are applying for E-rate funding.
 
Resources

USAC E-rate Forms
Download Form 470
Form 470 instructions
For section 10, detail the equipment and services information discussed in Step 1 with your Aerohive E-rate team
Attach your RFP if you are posting one 
Indicate if you will require site surveys or walk-through/onsite meeting for those bidding on your projects or services 
Follow the instructions closely to ensure the form is filled out accurately to avoid any processing delays



  Step 3 - Filing Your Form 471  


Once you file your Form 470, vendors have 28 days to bid on your project/service. The next step is to file your Form 471, which announces your chosen bidder & requested costs.
Resources

USAC E-rate Forms
Download Form 471
Form 471 instructions -  Follow the instructions closely to ensure the form is filled out accurately to avoid any processing delays

Tips

Ensure sufficient time is allocated during these 28 days for walk-throughs, FAQ’s, RFP response review, and bid evaluation
Require your chosen vendor to provide a prepopulated Item 21-B detailing the items & services of the project
Expect multiple bids and use a scoring matrix to evaluate them
Example matrix



  Step 4 - The PIA Process  


During the Program Integrity Audit (PIA) process, your E-rate application forms & processes are reviewed for compliance. During the PIA process, you are issued a series of questions that you must respond to in 15 days or less. At the end of the PIA process, a Funding Commitment Decision Letter (FCDL) is sent to all parties detailing the funding status & amount.
Resources

USAC PIA process information from USAC

Tips

There are 15 days to respond to PIA questions but you can ask for a 1 week 	extension. Plan to do so if you need additional time.
There will be a minimum of 2-4 questions but it can be as many as several 100
Be readily available during this time period to spend time on responding to the  PIA questions & make sure to communicate everything in writing by email so you have a record between yourself, the PIA reviewer & your vendors.



  Step 5 - Filing the Form 486 & Starting Your Project or Service  


The Form 486 is filed to “turn on the funding pipeline”. After receipt, a notification letter is sent to all parties. You can then start the project or service.
Resources

USAC E-rate Forms
Download Form 486
Form 486 instructions



  Step 6 - Invoicing: Form 472 (BEAR) or 474 (SPI)  


This phase determines how invoicing/funding occurs:

472 BEAR (Billed Entity Application Reimbursement): Using this invoice method, the school pays the vendor in full, then is reimbursed by USAC.  In this case, the project can start as soon as April 1
474 SPI (Service Provider Invoice): Using this method, the vendor invoices the school and USAC directly for their designated portions.  In this case, the project cannot start until July 1

Calculate Funds



Student Count:                                      
E-rate Percentage:                                       10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% 55% 60% 65% 70% 75% 80% 85% 90% 95% 



The E-rate category 2 Wi-Fi budget is a 5 year, CAP-Cost budget. Find out what funding budget your school is entitled to using the following formula:
$150 x Student Count = Total Budget                          
Calculate your school's discount using the following formula:
Total Budget x School E-rate % = School Discount                          
Calculate what your school would be required to pay using the following formula:
Total Budget - School Discount = Amount that School Pays

the terms and conditions of this Agreement: (a) as required under applicable securities regulations; and (b) on a confidential basis to present or future investors or acquirers (including entities with which a Party may merge) of such Party or any of its assets or business.
5.PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS
5.1Orders. PARTNER may acquire Products by submitting a written or electronic order for Products to Aerohive during the term of this Agreement in accordance with Section 5.1 (each an “Order”). Each Order must provide the following information:
a.For all deals, Product model number, quantity, unit and/or extended price, end user address and company name, and requested ship date and delivery address and contact information (contact name, address, email, and phone number) with the requested delivery method (i.e., Ground, Air, Next Business Day)
b.For all Registered Deals, PARTNER will provide an Aerohive-approved deal registration code on all Orders for that specific End User and ensure that all products ordered against that deal registration code are only sold to that specific End User for the purpose of the specific Registered Deal.
5.2Order Acknowledgement. Aerohive will acknowledge receipt of each Order in writing or electronically, and may either accept or reject such Order. No Order shall be binding upon Aerohive until accepted in writing and Aerohive shall have no liability to PARTNER with respect to Orders that are not accepted. No partial shipment of an Order shall constitute acceptance of the entire Order. If Aerohive fails to acknowledge receipt of any Order, such Order shall be deemed rejected.
5.3Pricing. PARTNER shall pay to Aerohive the then-current Product price based on the then-current Price List, less applicable discounts as set forth in Exhibit A. The prices set forth on the Price List do not include additional charges or fees for shipment, insurance, taxes, duties, handling, and similar costs, which charges shall be paid by PARTNER. PARTNER shall set its own prices for Sales to End Users without consultation with Aerohive.
5.4Taxes. All fees and payments stated herein exclude, and PARTNER shall pay, any sales, use, withholdings, levies, or similar governmental charges, however designated, including any related penalties and interest (“Taxes”), related to the performance of its obligations or exercise of its rights under this Agreement. PARTNER will pay, or reimburse Aerohive for the payment of, all Taxes except: (a) taxes on the net income or net worth of Aerohive,
(b) franchise taxes assessed on Aerohive, and (c) taxes for which PARTNER has provided to Aerohive prior to shipment a certificate of exemption acceptable to both Aerohive and the appropriate taxing authority.
5.5Price Changes. The prices of Products and services may be changed from time to time in Aerohive’s sole discretion. Aerohive will provide PARTNER with thirty (30) days written or email notice prior to the effective date of any price increase (“Price Notice”). Price increases will apply to the corresponding Products and services ordered by PARTNER on or after the effective date of the Price Notice. However, Aerohive will honor all outstanding written PARTNER proposals to potential or existing End Users for Products, for a period of thirty (30) days effective from the date of the Price Notice; provided, however, that within 5 business days of such Price Notice, PARTNER provides to Aerohive a list of the outstanding proposals that PARTNER desires to be subject to this price protection. For price decreases, Aerohive will either provide thirty (30) days notice (with no Price Protection) or in the event that Aerohive is unable to provide thirty (30) days advance notice, it will provide Price Protection for all Products that PARTNER has


ordered from Aerohive but has not yet received at the time the price change is announced. As used herein, “Price Protection” means Aerohive will sell to PARTNER for the reduced price, Products that are subject of an Order that PARTNER has placed prior to receiving notice of the reduced price but that Aerohive has not yet shipped.
5.6Product Changes. Aerohive may, at its sole discretion and without incurring any liability to PARTNER, change the features or functionality of, or discontinue the manufacture, license or Sale of any Products provided hereunder. Aerohive shall use commercially reasonable means to notify PARTNER in advance of any such changes, but PARTNER understands and agrees that Aerohive cannot and does not make any warranty in regard to advance notice of any such changes in Products.
5.7Change Order. PARTNER may cancel or reschedule any Order, without charge, by delivering written notice to Aerohive prior to the shipment of the product, but in no event after the Products have shipped. Aerohive has no obligation to accept rescheduling requests or cancellations after shipment of the product occurs.
5.8Payment Terms. Aerohive will invoice PARTNER for Products upon shipment to PARTNER. PARTNER shall pay the amount invoiced for Products to Aerohive thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice, unless stated otherwise on Aerohive’s invoice. PARTNER agrees that any late payments, at the sole discretion of Aerohive, may bear interest at the lower of a rate of 1.5% per month, or the highest rate allowed by law, on all invoiced and unpaid amounts. Aerohive reserves the right in its reasonable commercial judgment to place PARTNER on credit hold, in which event Aerohive will promptly inform PARTNER and may delay or reschedule PARTNER’s orders. If the Products are delivered in installments, then PARTNER shall pay for each installment in accordance with this Section 5.8. Each shipment shall be treated as a separate transaction, but if PARTNER fails to make payment as provided herein, Aerohive may decline to make further shipments without in any way affecting its rights hereunder. PARTNER shall be solely responsible for billing and collecting fees from PARTNER’S End Users. Non-payment of fees to PARTNER by an End User does not affect PARTNER’s obligation to pay the applicable amounts to Aerohive in accordance with this Agreement.
5.9Charge-Backs. Aerohive may, in its sole discretion, set cash discounts, make such allowances and adjustments, accept such returns from its End Users, and write off as bad debts such overdue End User accounts. In each such case, Aerohive may charge back to PARTNER's account any amounts previously paid or credited to it with respect to such cash discounts, allowances, adjustments, returns or bad debts.
5.10Delivery. All Products delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be delivered to PARTNER or the End User (as agreed by the Parties), FCA Aerohive’s facility, at which time risk of loss and title, shall pass to PARTNER. Unless otherwise instructed in writing by PARTNER and agreed to by Aerohive, Aerohive shall select the carrier. Unless indicated as “firm” by Aerohive in writing, all delivery dates are estimates only. As used herein, the term “FCA” shall be construed in accordance with the International Chamber of Commerce “Incoterms” (published 2000). Aerohive hereby reserves a purchase money security interest in all Products sold to PARTNER and the proceeds thereof, in the amount of the purchase price. If PARTNER defaults in any of its obligations to Aerohive, then Aerohive will have the right to repossess the Products without liability to PARTNER. These security interests will be satisfied by payment in full. A copy of the invoice may be filed with appropriate authorities at any time as a financing

Demonstration kits are not for resale and quantities are limited to the number of technically trained personnel as each PARTNER site: (iii) order evaluation product at the PARTNER Originated Registered Deal discount rate set forth on Exhibit A.

A.Deal Registration Program
1.Aerohive Deal Registration Program. The Aerohive Deal Registration Program is intended to give partners who are compliant and enrolled in the Aerohive Deal Registration Program the ability to register deals to gain an added Product margin.
2.Registration Criteria. The following criteria will be used by Aerohive in determining a PARTNER Registered Deal:
a.The deal cannot already be registered to or by another partner;
b.Aerohive Sales Representative and Partner must have a joint meeting or conference call with End User confirming that End User will purchase Products from Partner.
c.PARTNER must provide an acceptable budget, timeline and assurance that the appropriate decision makers are involved in the deal;
d.PARTNER may not be quoting or representing a competitive product to the End User account or specific Registered deal;
e.Registration protection is valid for ninety (90) days. This period may be extended for an additional ninety (90) day period upon written request from PARTNER if Aerohive determines that the PARTNER has made a substantial effort and progress towards closing the deal during the initial 90 day period.
f.PARTNER may not register for a deal that is outside of the Territory; unless it has received prior written approval from Aerohive.
g.PARTNER must receive or generate an opportunity price quote for each Registered Opportunity prior to any quote to the End- User.
h.PARTNER must provide the Deal Registration Number on the Purchase Order it provides to Aerohive for each Registered Deal.
3.Registration Process. The Aerohive Deal Registration Program requires both the participation of the PARTNER and Aerohive, as qualification of both the End User account and deal are critical to the success of the program. The overall intent is to ensure efficiency and that neither Aerohive nor its partner’s waste times on opportunities that are either not qualified or are already registered to or originated by another PARTNER. The following outlines a step by step process for registering deals:




Aerohive Confidential


7


Aerohive Networks Reseller Agreement 05‐01‐10






a.REGISTERED Deal
i.PARTNER prospects an Aerohive opportunity or receives a lead from Aerohive.
ii.PARTNER contacts Aerohive Sales Representative and submits a completed copy of Aerohive’s then-current registration process via email, fax or online as appropriate. As used in this Exhibit C, “Aerohive Sales Representative” means Aerohive’s designated account manager.
iii.An Aerohive Sales Representative reviews Aerohive’s Deal Registration Program database to confirm the deal has not been registered by another PARTNER. If the deal is not already registered, the Aerohive Sales Representative shall contact the PARTNER representative within seventy-two (72) hours to schedule an initial phone conference with the End User to verify the opportunity and to confirm that PARTNER has an adequate level of account access to close the specific deal.
iv.Following the joint meeting or conference call with the End User, the Aerohive Sales Representative shall accept the registration request if they have confirmed that the deal meets the criteria stated in Section A.2 (“Registration Criteria”) above and Aerohive shall provide to PARTNER the Registration Confirmation Number and a Tentative opportunity Price Quote.
v.If Aerohive registers the deal to the specified PARTNER, the appropriate discount will apply for that specific deal for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of registration. This period may be extended for an additional 90 day period if Aerohive determines that the PARTNER has made a substantial effort and progress towards closing the deal during the initial 90 day period.
B.Protected Support Renewal
As used herein, “Protected Support Renewal” means that one PARTNER, which has sold Products to the End User in a Registered Deal and is authorized by Aerohive, will have the right to solicit the End User for Orders to renew the Aerohive Support Agreement with the specified discount. If multiple PARTNERs have Registered Deals with the same End User, and the End User requests a “Coterminous Agreement,” which means the End User wants all of its Aerohive support and maintenance contracts to renew on the same date with a single renewal source, the Aerohive Sales Representative, in Aerohive’s sole discretion, will select the appropriate PARTNER for Protected Support Renewal based on the End User’s location, support required by the End User, and End User preference. PARTNERs that have not sold Aerohive Products to the End User in a Registered Deal will not receive a discount for support renewals. Aerohive may transfer Protected Support Renewal rights to another PARTNER if it determines in its sole discretion such a transfer is necessary, such as, due to an End User request or continued issues among Aerohive, PARTNER and the End User. PARTNER will be given notice prior to any change in its right to Protected Support Renewal. One PARTNER and only one PARTNER will be given Protected Support Renewal for each End User account.

4.CONFIDENTIALITY
4.1Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means any and all information that is disclosed by either Party to the other Party, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, which if disclosed in writing or tangible form is marked as “Confidential,” or with some similar designation, or if disclosed orally or by inspection or observation, is identified as being proprietary and/or confidential at the time of disclosure, or by the nature of the circumstances surrounding the disclosure should reasonably be treated as proprietary and/or confidential.
4.2Exclusions.

Each Party may use the other Party’s Confidential Information solely as necessary for its performance under this Agreement and each Party may disclose the Confidential Information of the other Party solely to those of its employees or subcontractors that need to know such Confidential Information for the purpose of performing this Agreement, provided that any such employee or subcontractor is subject to a written agreement that includes binding use and disclosure restrictions that are at least as protective of Confidential Information as those set forth herein. Each Party must use all reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information of the other Party in its possession or control, but in no event less than the efforts that Party ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information of similar nature and importance. The foregoing obligations will not restrict either Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other Party: (i) pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that the Party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable notice to the other Party to contest such order or requirement and (ii) on a confidential basis to its legal or financial advisors.

the terms and conditions of this Agreement: (a) as required under applicable securities regulations; and (b) on a confidential basis to present or future investors or acquirers (including entities with which a Party may merge) of such Party or any of its assets or business.
5.PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS
5.1Orders. PARTNER may acquire Products by submitting a written or electronic order for Products to Aerohive during the term of this Agreement in accordance with Section 5.1 (each an “Order”). Each Order must provide the following information:
a.For all deals, Product model number, quantity, unit and/or extended price, end user address and company name, and requested ship date and delivery address and contact information (contact name, address, email, and phone number) with the requested delivery method (i.e., Ground, Air, Next Business Day)
b.For all Registered Deals, PARTNER will provide an Aerohive-approved deal registration code on all Orders for that specific End User and ensure that all products ordered against that deal registration code are only sold to that specific End User for the purpose of the specific Registered Deal.
5.2Order Acknowledgement. Aerohive will acknowledge receipt of each Order in writing or electronically, and may either accept or reject such Order. No Order shall be binding upon Aerohive until accepted in writing and Aerohive shall have no liability to PARTNER with respect to Orders that are not accepted. No partial shipment of an Order shall constitute acceptance of the entire Order. If Aerohive fails to acknowledge receipt of any Order, such Order shall be deemed rejected.
5.3Pricing. PARTNER shall pay to Aerohive the then-current Product price based on the then-current Price List, less applicable discounts as set forth in Exhibit A. The prices set forth on the Price List do not include additional charges or fees for shipment, insurance, taxes, duties, handling, and similar costs, which charges shall be paid by PARTNER. PARTNER shall set its own prices for Sales to End Users without consultation with Aerohive.
5.4Taxes. All fees and payments stated herein exclude, and PARTNER shall pay, any sales, use, withholdings, levies, or similar governmental charges, however designated, including any related penalties and interest (“Taxes”), related to the performance of its obligations or exercise of its rights under this Agreement. PARTNER will pay, or reimburse Aerohive for the payment of, all Taxes except: (a) taxes on the net income or net worth of Aerohive,
(b) franchise taxes assessed on Aerohive, and (c) taxes for which PARTNER has provided to Aerohive prior to shipment a certificate of exemption acceptable to both Aerohive and the appropriate taxing authority.
5.5Price Changes. The prices of Products and services may be changed from time to time in Aerohive’s sole discretion. Aerohive will provide PARTNER with thirty (30) days written or email notice prior to the effective date of any price increase (“Price Notice”). Price increases will apply to the corresponding Products and services ordered by PARTNER on or after the effective date of the Price Notice. However, Aerohive will honor all outstanding written PARTNER proposals to potential or existing End Users for Products, for a period of thirty (30) days effective from the date of the Price Notice; provided, however, that within 5 business days of such Price Notice, PARTNER provides to Aerohive a list of the outstanding proposals that PARTNER desires to be subject to this price protection. For price decreases, Aerohive will either provide thirty (30) days notice (with no Price Protection) or in the event that Aerohive is unable to provide thirty (30) days advance notice, it will provide Price Protection for all Products that PARTNER has


ordered from Aerohive but has not yet received at the time the price change is announced. As used herein, “Price Protection” means Aerohive will sell to PARTNER for the reduced price, Products that are subject of an Order that PARTNER has placed prior to receiving notice of the reduced price but that Aerohive has not yet shipped.
5.6Product Changes. Aerohive may, at its sole discretion and without incurring any liability to PARTNER, change the features or functionality of, or discontinue the manufacture, license or Sale of any Products provided hereunder. Aerohive shall use commercially reasonable means to notify PARTNER in advance of any such changes, but PARTNER understands and agrees that Aerohive cannot and does not make any warranty in regard to advance notice of any such changes in Products.
5.7Change Order. PARTNER may cancel or reschedule any Order, without charge, by delivering written notice to Aerohive prior to the shipment of the product, but in no event after the Products have shipped. Aerohive has no obligation to accept rescheduling requests or cancellations after shipment of the product occurs.
5.8Payment Terms. Aerohive will invoice PARTNER for Products upon shipment to PARTNER. PARTNER shall pay the amount invoiced for Products to Aerohive thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice, unless stated otherwise on Aerohive’s invoice. PARTNER agrees that any late payments, at the sole discretion of Aerohive, may bear interest at the lower of a rate of 1.5% per month, or the highest rate allowed by law, on all invoiced and unpaid amounts. Aerohive reserves the right in its reasonable commercial judgment to place PARTNER on credit hold, in which event Aerohive will promptly inform PARTNER and may delay or reschedule PARTNER’s orders. If the Products are delivered in installments, then PARTNER shall pay for each installment in accordance with this Section 5.8. Each shipment shall be treated as a separate transaction, but if PARTNER fails to make payment as provided herein, Aerohive may decline to make further shipments without in any way affecting its rights hereunder. PARTNER shall be solely responsible for billing and collecting fees from PARTNER’S End Users. Non-payment of fees to PARTNER by an End User does not affect PARTNER’s obligation to pay the applicable amounts to Aerohive in accordance with this Agreement.

Aerohive shall have sole control of any such action or settlement negotiations, and Aerohive agrees to pay, subject to the limitations hereinafter set forth, any final judgment entered against PARTNER or settlement entered into in any such Claim. Further, should such final judgment or settlement require that the Product be returned and/or the purchase price refunded to End Users, Aerohive will pay such related costs. PARTNER agrees that Aerohive, at its sole option, shall be relieved of the foregoing obligations unless PARTNER (a) gives prompt, written notice to Aerohive of all Claims, (b) cooperates reasonably with Aerohive (at Aerohive’s expense) in the defense or settlement of Claims, and (c) allows Aerohive the sole right to defend, or at Aerohive’s option settle, Claims. If Aerohive becomes aware of a Claim, then Aerohive may, in its sole discretion, obtain the right for PARTNER to continue to Sell the Products, modify the Products so that they are no longer infringing, or require return of unsold Products from PARTNER and refund to PARTNER the amount paid by PARTNER for such unsold Products. Aerohive shall have no liability for any Claim resulting from or caused by: (d) use or combination of the Products with any other goods or services not supplied by Aerohive; or (e) any modification or alteration of Products by a party other than Aerohive. The foregoing expresses PARTNER’s sole remedy, and Aerohive’s sole liability, for any claim of infringement.
11.2Scope of PARTNER Indemnity. PARTNER shall fully defend, indemnify and hold harmless Aerohive, its directors, officers, employees, shareholders, customers, affiliated companies and agents from and against any and all liability (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) for any claims, suits, actions, demands or threats of any third party based in any way upon any act, omission, failure to act or misrepresentation by PARTNER including, without limitation, any claims regarding any Sales of Products, unauthorized export of the Products, solicitations of Aerohive maintenance and support contracts, or distribution of non- Aerohive goods or services in conjunction with the Products (including, without limitation, in connection with any representation or warranty regarding the Product by PARTNER and its employees or agents that is inconsistent with or broader than the scope of the Limited Warranty) or any breach or alleged breach of PARTNER’s representations, warranties, or covenants set forth herein. Aerohive shall give prompt, written notice thereof to PARTNER, shall cooperate reasonably with PARTNER (at PARTNER’s expense), and shall allow PARTNER the sole right to defend, or at PARTNER’s option, settle all of the foregoing.


12.EXPORT CONTROL AND COMPLIANCE.PARTNER certifies that it shall not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export or transship the Products or any parts or copies thereof without the express written consent of Aerohive, and in any event, in any manner as to violate such laws and regulations in effect from time to time. The rights and obligations of PARTNER shall be subject to such United States laws and regulations as shall from time to time govern the license and delivery of products and technology abroad by persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, including the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, any successor legislation to the Export Administration Act of 1979 and the Export Administration regulations issued by the Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration and Bureau of Export Administration. PARTNER (or any agent) agrees that Aerohive shall not appear as an exporter on any document used for export control purposes. PARTNER hereby represents and covenants that it will comply with United States Export Control Regulations. Further, PARTNER hereby agrees not to sell or deliver the Products for ultimate delivery to those areas to which delivery would be forbidden if directly exported from the United States. PARTNER understands that it will receive the Products under a U.S. distribution license and the restrictions on re-export or resale to, individuals or companies listed on the Table of Denial Orders, and High Risk of Diversion candidates must be complied with. The Table of Denial Orders is a list of individuals and companies that have been denied export privileges by the U.S. Department of Commerce. No U.S. Products may be sold to individuals or companies on the list.
13.GENERAL
13.1Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by PARTNER without the express prior written consent of Aerohive, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Any attempted assignment by PARTNER in derogation of the foregoing shall be void. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted assigns.
13.2Approvals.

13.3Currency Control. PARTNER represents and warrants that, as of the Effective Date of this Agreement, no currency control laws applicable in the Territory prevent the payment to Aerohive of any sums due under this Agreement. If any such laws come into effect and the local government of the Territory does not permit that payment be made in United States Dollars, PARTNER will notify Aerohive immediately, and if so instructed by Aerohive, deposit all monies due Aerohive to the account of Aerohive in a local bank of Aerohive’s choice in the Territory.

Demonstration kits are not for resale and quantities are limited to the number of technically trained personnel as each PARTNER site: (iii) order evaluation product at the PARTNER Originated Registered Deal discount rate set forth on Exhibit A.

A.Deal Registration Program
1.Aerohive Deal Registration Program. The Aerohive Deal Registration Program is intended to give partners who are compliant and enrolled in the Aerohive Deal Registration Program the ability to register deals to gain an added Product margin.
2.Registration Criteria. The following criteria will be used by Aerohive in determining a PARTNER Registered Deal:
a.The deal cannot already be registered to or by another partner;
b.Aerohive Sales Representative and Partner must have a joint meeting or conference call with End User confirming that End User will purchase Products from Partner.
c.PARTNER must provide an acceptable budget, timeline and assurance that the appropriate decision makers are involved in the deal;
d.PARTNER may not be quoting or representing a competitive product to the End User account or specific Registered deal;
e.Registration protection is valid for ninety (90) days. This period may be extended for an additional ninety (90) day period upon written request from PARTNER if Aerohive determines that the PARTNER has made a substantial effort and progress towards closing the deal during the initial 90 day period.
f.PARTNER may not register for a deal that is outside of the Territory; unless it has received prior written approval from Aerohive.
g.PARTNER must receive or generate an opportunity price quote for each Registered Opportunity prior to any quote to the End- User.
h.PARTNER must provide the Deal Registration Number on the Purchase Order it provides to Aerohive for each Registered Deal.
3.Registration Process. The Aerohive Deal Registration Program requires both the participation of the PARTNER and Aerohive, as qualification of both the End User account and deal are critical to the success of the program. The overall intent is to ensure efficiency and that neither Aerohive nor its partner’s waste times on opportunities that are either not qualified or are already registered to or originated by another PARTNER. The following outlines a step by step process for registering deals:




Aerohive Confidential


7


Aerohive Networks Reseller Agreement 05‐01‐10






a.REGISTERED Deal
i.PARTNER prospects an Aerohive opportunity or receives a lead from Aerohive.
ii.PARTNER contacts Aerohive Sales Representative and submits a completed copy of Aerohive’s then-current registration process via email, fax or online as appropriate. As used in this Exhibit C, “Aerohive Sales Representative” means Aerohive’s designated account manager.
iii.An Aerohive Sales Representative reviews Aerohive’s Deal Registration Program database to confirm the deal has not been registered by another PARTNER. If the deal is not already registered, the Aerohive Sales Representative shall contact the PARTNER representative within seventy-two (72) hours to schedule an initial phone conference with the End User to verify the opportunity and to confirm that PARTNER has an adequate level of account access to close the specific deal.
iv.Following the joint meeting or conference call with the End User, the Aerohive Sales Representative shall accept the registration request if they have confirmed that the deal meets the criteria stated in Section A.2 (“Registration Criteria”) above and Aerohive shall provide to PARTNER the Registration Confirmation Number and a Tentative opportunity Price Quote.
v.If Aerohive registers the deal to the specified PARTNER, the appropriate discount will apply for that specific deal for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of registration. This period may be extended for an additional 90 day period if Aerohive determines that the PARTNER has made a substantial effort and progress towards closing the deal during the initial 90 day period.
B.Protected Support Renewal
As used herein, “Protected Support Renewal” means that one PARTNER, which has sold Products to the End User in a Registered Deal and is authorized by Aerohive, will have the right to solicit the End User for Orders to renew the Aerohive Support Agreement with the specified discount. If multiple PARTNERs have Registered Deals with the same End User, and the End User requests a “Coterminous Agreement,” which means the End User wants all of its Aerohive support and maintenance contracts to renew on the same date with a single renewal source, the Aerohive Sales Representative, in Aerohive’s sole discretion, will select the appropriate PARTNER for Protected Support Renewal based on the End User’s location, support required by the End User, and End User preference. PARTNERs that have not sold Aerohive Products to the End User in a Registered Deal will not receive a discount for support renewals. Aerohive may transfer Protected Support Renewal rights to another PARTNER if it determines in its sole discretion such a transfer is necessary, such as, due to an End User request or continued issues among Aerohive, PARTNER and the End User. PARTNER will be given notice prior to any change in its right to Protected Support Renewal. One PARTNER and only one PARTNER will be given Protected Support Renewal for each End User account.

Aerohive Networks is an American multinational computer networking equipment company headquartered in Milpitas, California, with 17 additional offices worldwide.[3] The company was founded in 2006, and provides wireless networking to medium-sized and larger businesses.[3][4]
In 2012, Aerohive was listed on The Wall Street Journal's list of "Top 50 Start-Ups."[5] The company raised around $105 million in venture capital funding before undergoing an IPO in March 2014.[6][7]
History[edit]
Aerohive was founded in 2006 by Changming Liu. That same year, the company raised $4 million in series A round funding. In July 2007, the company raised an additional $20 million in series B round funding led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[8] Aerohive completed a series C round of funding, raising $23.5 million to expand its sales and marketing strategy in March 2010.[9][10] In 2011, the company acquired Pareto Networks, a cloud-based routing service, the acquisition allowed Aerohive to integrate Paret's cloud management technology into its existing offerings.[11][12][13] In September 2012, Aerohive raised $22.5 million in a series E round of funding and announced its plans to undergo an IPO the following year.[14] The company raised an additional $10 million in funding as it prepared to go public, in 2013.[7] On March 28, 2014, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the HIVE symbol.[15] Aerohive joined Barack Obama's ConnectED initiative in October 2014, when it partnered with Apple Inc. and provided wireless connectivity to the schools receiving Apple products.[16]
Aerohive announced that its devices would operate more seamlessly with Barracuda Networks security products in May 2015.[17] In September 2015, the company announced a technology alliance with Juniper Networks.[18] In January 2016, the company released HiveSchool, a learning application for K-12 classrooms that runs on any network with any computer running the Google Chrome web browser.[19] The company announced that it had entered a distribution agreement with Synnex Corporation in February 2016. The agreement named Synnex as the exclusive distributor of Aerohive products in Canada.[20] In April 2016, Aerohive announced a strategic partnership with the technology company Dell.[21]
In September 2016, the company released SD-LAN, a software-defined network that functions on local area networks.[22]
Operations[edit]
Aerohive develops a controller-less LAN architecture called Cooperative Control, which provides all the performance, availability, management, mobility, and security needed in a large campus deployment. This architecture also enables secure, scalable, high-performance, and mission-critical wireless networking in a manageable and cost-effective way to industries such as education, distributed enterprises, retail, healthcare, state and local government and manufacturing.[23] The company also develops an operating system, HiveOS, for access points and switches, a cloud enabled management system, HiveManager, Wi-Fi planning tools, applications, and network administration tools for its devices.[24]
The company makes available open REST APIs to its cloud platform, Aerohive Cloud Services, for developers to build Wi-Fi management and analytics solutions.[25] In September 2016, Aerohive announced an update to its cloud management system, HiveManager NG, which enabled LAN networks to become software-defined.[26]

New Aerohive Connect Product Line Offers Adaptable, Scalable, and Affordable Connectivity


Enterprise-Class Wi-Fi Starting at $229 per Access Point
Milpitas, Calif. — January 31, 2017 — Aerohive Networks® (NYSE:HIVE), the fastest growing enterprise Wi-Fi vendor, today announced the introduction of Aerohive Connect™, a new cloud networking solution that delivers enterprise connectivity and centralized management starting at $229 per access point. Aerohive Connect is built on the power of cloud networking, Aerohive’s unique Cooperative Control Wi-Fi architecture, and access to the industry’s best customer support. Connect allows organizations to grow as they go, simplify their network operations, and effortlessly upgrade to the full suite of Aerohive solutions as their needs change.
As part of the new Connect offering, Aerohive also announced the launch of the AP122, a new enterprise-grade 802.11ac access point. Aerohive Connect and the AP122 are available immediately. Aerohive will showcase these new solutions at Aerohive’s February 28, 2017 customer webinar “5 Reasons You Have Been Overpaying for Your Wi-Fi.”
News Facts

Aerohive Connect delivers cloud-managed connectivity to customers starting at the disruptive prices of $229 for the AP122, Aerohive’s newest 802.11ac access point, and $299 for the AP130, one of Aerohive’s best-selling access points previously priced at $599. Aerohive Connect includes the same access point technology used in Aerohive’s largest and most demanding deployments, as well as HiveManager® Connect, a simplified version of Aerohive’s cloud-based network management, access to the industry’s best customer support, and an easy path to upgrade to Aerohive’s full suite of features, deployment options, and support, all for the per-AP price of $229 or $299.
Aerohive Connect provides the essential functionality businesses need to provision robust Wi-Fi connectivity at one or thousands of locations.  Aerohive Connect is particularly well-suited to connectivity-oriented and price-focused organizations that have limited on-site IT resources, such as hospitality, hotspots, small and medium enterprises, as well as managed service providers supporting such deployments. Customers who purchase Aerohive Connect get the benefits of:       

Reduced Cost – Dramatically lower purchase prices than comparable Cisco and HP solutions, as well as a self-optimizing and self-healing architecture that keeps ongoing costs down without compromising quality.
Six-Click Configuration – Step-by-step-guided configuration and intuitive management that lets customers build enterprise-level connectivity configurations in six clicks.
Simplified Cloud Management – Ongoing operation of even the largest networks from a single point of management using Aerohive’s leading cloud networking platform. HiveManager Connect is perfectly designed for simpler networks and connectivity-oriented use cases.
Effortless Scale – The ability to scale from one to thousands of access points with a single architecture. Aerohive is the only vendor that uses the same architecture to support all customers, from the smallest organizations to the largest.
High Quality Support – HiveCare™ Connect Support with access to the HiveCare Connect Community, a forum-based interactive support community, online tools and resources, and email support. The optional HiveCare Connect CallBack service provides phone access to Aerohive’s support team.
Seamless Upgrade Path – Ability to upgrade to Aerohive’s highest levels of functionality and support with no need to touch already deployed access points.


Aerohive Connect customers can upgrade to Aerohive Select, Aerohive’s proven and previously available solution, to deliver a more complete Connected Experience. Aerohive Select includes additional capabilities, such as advanced security and troubleshooting tools, support for BYOD programs, increased network visibility, more enterprise support options, and the ability to deploy HiveManager on-premises or in a private cloud. Aerohive Connect customers can purchase an upgrade to Aerohive Select at any time as their requirements change and migrate between the solutions in minutes.
Aerohive’s new AP122, which is a 2x2 MIMO, dual radio 802.11ac access point, is designed for coverage-focused environments, as well as IoT and location-based services. The AP122 supports two spatial streams and has built-in BLE and USB to accommodate beacons and other IoT devices. Versatile and value-priced, AP122 enables organizations not only to deploy essential Wi-Fi, but also to utilize the product’s additional rich capabilities now and in the future.
Aerohive AP130 is a 2x2, 2 spatial stream, 802.11ac access point which provides powerful 802.11ac performance. Advanced software features and simplified management offer a cost-optimized solution that allows for high-speed 802.11ac Wi-Fi in every office or environment. Running Aerohive’s powerful HiveOS® coupled with Aerohive’s innovative, distributed Cooperative Control protocols, the AP130 maintains Aerohive’s high standard for a cost-effective WLAN solution for mid-to-high-density environments.

“We are seeing software functionality becoming more of the differentiator for WLAN vendors as hardware becomes more standardized, and as cloud networking becomes mainstream,” said Nolan Greene, senior research analyst, network infrastructure, IDC. “Aerohive’s new disruptive pricing strategy and flexible purchasing model should be considered by any organization looking for an enterprise-grade wireless solution that can evolve in response to organizational needs.”
“With the on-premises controller system we had before deploying Aerohive, we would have needed to buy another controller plus access points to expand our network,” said Chris Clough, network administrator, AppNeta. “But with Aerohive, we can simply buy more access points when we need them and register them on HiveManager allowing us to easily monitor and grow our Wi-Fi network.”
“With Aerohive Connect we’re looking forward to expanding our footprint and giving more customers a path to discover the full value of Aerohive’s Wi-Fi and cloud networking solutions.” said David Flynn, chief executive officer, Aerohive Networks. “Connect offers a compelling value proposition that will introduce Aerohive technology to new markets, customers, resellers, and managed service providers,”

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

AP250 - The Most Adaptable Enterprise Wireless Access Point
The AP250 is a 3x3:3, dual radio, 802.11ac Wave 2 access point with a software selectable radio, designed for the best coverage and capacity.
“We are eager to deploy the AP250 access points in order to leverage higher density 5GHz coverage. We believe that the software selectable radio will play a key role in our transition from a network designed for coverage to one designed for capacity.”  Norman Elton, Network Engineer, College of William & Mary

Does Your Network Adapt to Change?
Modern networks must continuously adjust and adapt to keep up with the pace of change that mobility has created, something now unachievable in traditional network architectures. SD-LAN builds on the principles of Software Defined Networks (SDN) in the data center and Software Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) to create a new approach to adaptable, flexible, and cost effective wireless and wired access network. 
“One of the great advantages with Aerohive’s SD-LAN is that not only is it an intuitive solution and easy to manage, but as our needs change and expand, we also can adopt and add enterprise features and adapt the network as required.  It was important to MassChallenge to find a solution partner that was also entrepreneurial at heart, and that understood our mission and vision. We are confident Aerohive is able to support and connect with us at all levels.” Roman Kern, Senior Director of Programs and Operations, MassChallenge
