 David Miller CD music Product Description

David Miller's album is strictly from the word of God. This second album keeps the quality level high, mixing equal parts contemporary Gospel, Rhythm and Blues, and hip-hop to good effect. David's voice has noticeably matured over the years. This album provides more of a modern hip-hop/street-edge in "You Got it" and "I won't complain." He continues to uplift others with his testimony of deliverance from what we call everyday struggles in songs such as "Show me the way," "Here I am" and "Day by Day." Having said that, David Miller remains the essential musical starting point, as there's little here that matches the anointing of "Nothing without YOU" or "My Love for YOU." For those who want to hear the sound of an artist growing up, David Miller is required listening.

Product Description‚ñº‚ñ≤
Big or small, your children's ministry can ignite in younghearts faith that grows and spreads in ways you never dreamed. It happens all the time at Willow Creek's Promiseland, and it can happen at your church. Sunday morning can be absolutely the most exciting, fun-filled time of the week for children, a Great kid-venture that impacts them for the rest of their lives. Telling the story of Promiseland from its early days until today and offering glimpses of succesful children's minsitries across the country, Promiseland Director Sue Miller shares insights that can reshape your whole approach to children's ministry and cast a new vision for everyone involved: church leaders, parents and above all,kids. Gleaning from twenty-eight years of hands-on ministry experience, here is practical guidance to helpaddress your most vital concerns and challenges: how to grab and hold kids' interest, how to balance evangelism and discipleship, six specific ministry values that meet kid's needs, and secrets to recruiting, training, and leading volunteers, and more.

            Not the best theologically, but I purchased a copy for everyone involved in our Sunday School ministry and set up a date for them to discuss their reactions. It really helped them think out of the box and create an ongoing process of continually looking to make our program better.

Fluorescent Gallery is very pleased to offer Light Panels representing the excellent work of acclaimed artist David Miller.
David‚Äôs talent as a colorist is exceptional. Certified for open water scuba, he has spent many hours diving in the beautiful waters of the Hawaiian Islands, Jamaica, California, and Mexico. Virtually all of his creations depict an aspect of the natural world. Along with his window to Paradise paintings, David is known for his brilliantly colored tropical fish, sea turtles, and most of all his dolphins and whales frolicking just below the surface of the deep, clean blue ocean in his ‚Äúabove and below‚Äù pieces.
You can¬†view additional works by David Miller at www.mauiarts.com
Panel Brightness?Lightness-DarknessThe Panel Brightness rating assigned to each design is based on the average luminosity (0-Black to 255-White) of the digital artwork file. It can be used as a guideline to predict artwork light reduction of one design compared to another.

#2: Not as dark as #1. Requires some task lighting in the room. Used commonly in treatment rooms.
#1: This design selection is for ambient lighting only with several other light sources for tasks.

Length01/81/43/81/25/83/47/8Width01/81/43/81/25/83/47/8Print Medium?Print Medium ChoicesWe proudly offer only very high quality acrylic products for our decorative prints. Any acrylic thickness may be selected for your artwork of choice on common or smaller panel sizes. For oversize panels, the recommended thickness of material will be automatically selected at purchase, based on your size. Lowering the recommended thickness may result in obvious panel center sag.
Fluorescent Gallery acrylic options are available in the following thicknesses:
‚Ä¢  .060‚Ä≥ ‚Äì Our standard white acrylic has a slight matte finish to allow the print to adhere nicely to each panel. Though it is our thinnest material, it is at least 30% thicker than many light panels found available for purchase elsewhere.
‚Ä¢  .080‚Ä≥ Lumieo ‚Äì Normally for oversize lenses, this material is slightly less opaque than white, while still providing excellent light diffusion. It produces a beautiful result that is more durable than our .060‚Ä≥ acrylic.
‚Ä¢  .125‚Ä≥ Lumieo ‚Äì A thicker version of our .080‚Ä≥. At 1/8 inch thick, this is the choice for the largest prints we offer, or for applications that benefit from a more rugged panel. Note: This thickness may not be flexible enough to bend into small fixtures.
¬†
Available Acrylic Choices
Although a more costly option, Lumieo Acrylic offers enhanced features and benefits, such as greater light throughput and bulb hiding capabilities.
