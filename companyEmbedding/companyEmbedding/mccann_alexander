Publisher's Description▼▲
What if you didnt have to go to an Ignatian retreat to experience its many benefits? What if the retreat came to you? Retreat in the Real World allows anyone to make an in-depth, self-directed Ignatian retreat on his or her own time. This 34-week retreat can be started at any point in the calendar year and can be done anywhere at any timeby yourself or in conjunction with others. Each of the 34 weeks includes background information, a simple reflection, prayer helps, and Scripture readings, along with beautiful photography. This print version of the formerly digital-only online retreat from Creighton Universitys Online Ministries will prove extremely popular with anyone who has always wanted to make an Ignatian retreat but has not had the time or resources to do so.  


Author Bio▼▲

Alexander Technique with Meg McCann

Alexander Technique with Meg McCann


















































Stress-Relieving
Students will learn to become responsive rather than reactive to life's demands as their neurological system is calmed. This results in a completely new, meditative state of mind.







Studied and Effective
Research from the British Medical Journal, American Urological Association, and Annals of Internal Medicine have all done studies proving results through Alexander Technique.







Local
All Alexander Technique lessons are done here in Cincinnati, in one-on-one sessions that are meant to be specialized towards the individual and teach suitable techniques.







To the Student:
The Alexander Technique is based on the notion that we as humans have the capacity to use our bodies with ease and gracefulness. Watching a toddler move we can see the freedom and ease in their bodies. The reality is, as we grow up we develop patterns in the way we carry ourselves. Examples include:

locking our knees in standing
clenching our jaws when we work physically or mentally
slouching when sitting, standing, or walking

These behaviors are usually not even noticed in ourselves but they do slowly rob us of the freedom and ease we possessed as children. The Alexander Technique is a process that literally changes these interfering muscular patterns and behaviors that cause pain, limit movement, and diminish performance.
The Alexander Technique gives us the opportunity to reeducate our bodies and allow freedom in movement to return. With this, pain can subside, posture improves, and performance increases.



To the Physician:
The Alexander Technique lengthens the spine and increases join mobility. This is achieved by lessening muscular tension or collapse that individuals carry within themselves.
Frequently the cause of back or joint pain is overuse of muscles or continuous muscular tension. The vertebrae or joints are held tightly against each other, with grinding occurring over time. Discs degenerate, arthritis occurs, and pain sets in. Specific issues that are aggravated by poor patterns of muscular use include: spinal, join, headache, and balance issues.
By interrupting the muscular patterns, a door is opened for change in the person. New pathways are established that do not include the tension. Importantly, pain is reduced and activity is restored.
The goal of the Alexander Technique is for optimal neuromuscular and motor coordination of the student's head, neck, back, and limbs.
The patient who is referred for Alexander Technique sessions received direct hands-on input that activates neuromuscular change. Alexander Technique can be employed as a primary treatment or as support to other medical regimen.

Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

*Attorneys who only have peer reviews prior to April 15, 2008 are not displayed.









Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

Testimonials or endorsements in any review do not constitute a guarantee, warranty, or prediction regarding the outcome of your legal matter. Past results are not a guarantee of any future results as each case must be decided on its own merits. Client Review Ratings and/or Peer Review Ratings may not be available for all firms and/or lawyers and the fact that a firm or lawyer has not been reviewed should not be construed as unfavorable.
