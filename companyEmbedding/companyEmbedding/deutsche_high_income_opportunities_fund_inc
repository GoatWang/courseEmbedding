Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

Investment return and principal value fluctuate with changing market conditions so when sold shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance includes reinvestment of all distributions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Please call (800) 349-4281 and speak to a representative to obtain the fund’s most recent performance.   Total return based on market price reflects changes in market value. Total return based on net asset value reflects changes in the fund’s net asset value during each period. Each figure assumes that dividends and capital gains, if any, were reinvested. These figures will differ depending on the level of any discount from or premium to NAV at which the fund’s shares traded during the period. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.Returns during part or all of the periods shown reflect a fee and/or expense waiver. Without this waiver, returns would have been lower and any rankings/ratings might have been less favorable. Expenses of the fund include investment advisory and administration fees and other fund expenses. Total returns shown take into account these fees and expenses.Growth of a $10,000 Investment from 06/30/07 to 06/30/17 06/0706/0906/1106/1306/1506/17Growth Chart$10000$3928$6235$7484$8628$9493SourceSource: Deutsche Asset Management.

Annualized dividend yield is the latest monthly dividend shown as an annualized percentage of net asset value and market price as of month-end. Annualized dividend yield simply measures the level of dividends and is not a complete measure of performance.  Annualized dividend yield does not include any non-income items, such as offering proceeds or borrowings.closeCredit QualityAAA4 %BBB11 %BB60 %B23 %CCC2 %  Credit Quality Information...Credit quality represents the higher rating of either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation and is their opinion as to the quality of the securities they rate. Credit quality does not remove market risk and is subject to change.Effective maturity is the weighted average of the bonds held by the fund taking into consideration any maturity shortening features.Effective duration is the measurable change in the value of a security in response to a change in interest rates.closeManagement TeamGary Russell CFA24 years experienceThomas R.

    Executive Summary   R-002912.9 (9/16)Important Objectives and Risk InformationScheduled Liquidation date: No later than 3/30/18. The fund’s investment objectives will be to seek high current income with a secondary objective of total return.Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.Any fund that concentrates in a particular segment of the market will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investments in lower-quality ("junk bonds") and non-rated securities present greater risk of loss than investments in higher-quality securities. There are special risks associated with an investment in real estate, including REITS. These risks include credit risk, interest rate fluctuations and the impact of varied economic conditions. Stocks may decline in value. Investing in foreign securities presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Leverage results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any gains or losses.Important Information and Definitions©2017 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. Morningstar, Inc., shall not be responsible for investment decisions, damages or other losses resulting from use of this rating. For each fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in a category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Effective maturity is the weighted average of the bonds held by the fund taking into consideration any maturity shortening features. Effective duration is an approximate measure of the Fund’s sensitivity to interest rate changes taking into consideration any maturity shortening features.

The Funds investment objective is to seek high current income with a secondary objective of total return. The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing primarily in securities designed to generate income, with the potential for capital appreciation being a secondary consideration.The Fund may invest in a broad range of income-producing securities, including, but not limited to, domestic and foreign debt securities of any credit quality or maturity (including below investment grade debt securities and debt securities of issuers located in countries with new or emerging securities markets), convertible securities (including convertible bonds), dividend-paying common stocks, preferred stocks, and securities of real estate investment trusts (REITS), energy trusts and other investment companies.The Fund may invest in debt securities not paying interest currently and securities in default.In addition, the Fund may invest in senior bank loans, including bank loan participations and assignments.The Fund may buy or sell protection on credit exposure and may also purchase securities on a when-issued basis and engage in short sales.The Fund may invest in cash or money market instruments in the event portfolio management determines that securities meeting the Funds investment objectives are not readily available for purchase.Its shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DHG. Future earnings of the Fund can not be guaranteed and the Funds dividend policy is subject to change. Any fund that concentrates in a particular segment of the market will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate and credit risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investments in lower-quality and non-rated securities present greater risk of loss than investments in higher-quality securities. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. Stocks may decline in value. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Leverage results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any losses. There are special risks associated with an investment in real estate, including REITS. These risks include credit risk, interest rate fluctuations and the impact of varied economic conditions.
