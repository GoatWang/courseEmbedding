 Sarbit Advisory Services, led by well-known value portfolio manager Larry Sarbit, is pleased to 
         










    










 






 











 









Sarbit Advisory Services, led by well-known value portfolio manager Larry Sarbit, is pleased to announce the strengthening of its investment team, by promoting Tim Skelly and Jonathan Rotem to Associate Portfolio Managers

Apr 07, 2015, 07:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Sarbit Advisory Services Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


TORONTO, April 7, 2015 /CNW/ - Under Sarbit's tutelage, Skelly and Rotem, who have been working with Larry for nearly half a decade, have honed their skill set by following closely in his investment footsteps. "I have worked day in and day out with these two talented individuals and they both understand my investment philosophy and follow it to a tee when making active contributions to our stock selection." Sarbit declared.
Larry Sarbit has had a history of staying the course and adhering to his strict investment discipline over a 25 year history, with returns that reflect this focused investment style.
As sub advisors to IA Clarington, Larry has Mr. Skelly following the U.S. equity markets while Mr. Rotem focuses primarily on the Activist strategy. Both individuals feel privileged to be aligned so closely with Mr. Sarbit."I recognized the opportunity that I was being given right from the start," Skelly states. "It's remarkable to learn from someone with such an incredible history, who is renowned for his long held discipline." Mr. Sarbit's endorsement reflects his commitment to reinforce his research and investment team as Sarbit continues to conduct business. These promotions do just that.
"I'm not going anywhere," Sarbit laughs and reminds us that Buffett is well into his 80's and still investing. "I eat, sleep and breathe the stock market – just ask my wife, who recognizes my wish to never retire." "Why would I, when I love what I do, am committed to the investors and get rejuvenated every time I talk to advisors who remind me how long we have been doing business together?" 
The Sarbit team can now continue to build on its success as Tim Skelly and Jonathan Rotem are slowly introduced to all those who have come to know and trust Larry Sarbit over his 30 plus career.

Corporate Office | Sarbit Advisory Services






























































HomeFund Managersfundsinvestment approachOur Peoplemediacontact























The Activist Fund
Our Definition of an ‘Activist’ is an agent of change, either coming from outside the company or from within it.
Broad Definition of Traditional Perception Irrelevant where change Originates.
Our Approach:
Invest in companies where:

The change has been identified
There is high probability that it will happen






Why Shadowing Works

ACTIVIST COMPANIES OUTPERFORM THE MARKET

Lots of studies done showing this


ACTIVISTS INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES
ACTIVISTS ARE VALUE INVESTORS—Trained bargain hunters
Shadowing is flexible:

Flexible timing
Flexible position size



SUMMARY: We get Returns, Activists do the Hard Work

 


Buffett Rule
“What you really want to do in investments is figure out what is important and knowable. If it’s unimportant or unknowable, you forget about it.”
Warren Buffett, University of Florida, Talk to MBA Students, YouTube 1998


We have a HUGE Disadvantage

We are Outsiders:
Not Privy to Inside Thinking, Planning and Intended Actions of Activist or Target Company
We find out along with everyone else




Risks
Investing  Too Soon After Activist Campaign Initiation Begins
The Problem

Campaign may fail
Activists may evacuate—decide it’s not worth the effort


Activist may succeed, but Potential Negative Issues:

Campaign drags on—long work-out period
Their analysis is faulty
Target Company Wins Battle—Activists Successfully Repelled




 


BIG INVESTING VULNERABILITY
“I went in search of cheap stocks and had the misfortune to find them.”
Warren Buffett


Risks: Relying on the Activist’s Analysis
Appears Cheap on Financial Statements, BUT:
Buy Awful Businesses
OR
Pay Too Much, Even If Great Business


Risks: Activist Has Aggressive Sale Value for Company/Segment
The Problem:

It is very hard to know how long the sale process will take
Company/Segment may not be put up for sale
The company/Segment may be put up for sale, but not receive
serious bids
The eventual buyout price may be significantly lower than expected



Solution
Have Patience – No Need to Rush In for Great Long-Term Returns




Solution
Do Independent Analysis

Do Your Own Fundamental Research
Determine Downside/Risks



Solution
Focus on High Probability Situations
In most cases, we have found that the best outcome is to either wait:

For a formal announcement that the company will be restructuring its operations or is initiating a “strategic alternatives” process
The activists are well represented on the Board

The Activist Fund
Our Definition of an ‘Activist’ is an agent of change, either coming from outside the company or from within it.
Broad Definition of Traditional Perception Irrelevant where change Originates.
Our Approach:
Invest in companies where:

The change has been identified
There is high probability that it will happen






Why Shadowing Works

ACTIVIST COMPANIES OUTPERFORM THE MARKET

Lots of studies done showing this


ACTIVISTS INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES
ACTIVISTS ARE VALUE INVESTORS—Trained bargain hunters
Shadowing is flexible:

Flexible timing
Flexible position size



SUMMARY: We get Returns, Activists do the Hard Work

 


Buffett Rule
“What you really want to do in investments is figure out what is important and knowable. If it’s unimportant or unknowable, you forget about it.”
Warren Buffett, University of Florida, Talk to MBA Students, YouTube 1998


We have a HUGE Disadvantage

We are Outsiders:
Not Privy to Inside Thinking, Planning and Intended Actions of Activist or Target Company
We find out along with everyone else




Risks
Investing  Too Soon After Activist Campaign Initiation Begins
The Problem

Campaign may fail
Activists may evacuate—decide it’s not worth the effort


Activist may succeed, but Potential Negative Issues:

Campaign drags on—long work-out period
Their analysis is faulty
Target Company Wins Battle—Activists Successfully Repelled




 


BIG INVESTING VULNERABILITY
“I went in search of cheap stocks and had the misfortune to find them.”
Warren Buffett


Risks: Relying on the Activist’s Analysis
Appears Cheap on Financial Statements, BUT:
Buy Awful Businesses
OR
Pay Too Much, Even If Great Business


Risks: Activist Has Aggressive Sale Value for Company/Segment
The Problem:

It is very hard to know how long the sale process will take
Company/Segment may not be put up for sale
The company/Segment may be put up for sale, but not receive
serious bids
The eventual buyout price may be significantly lower than expected



Solution
Have Patience – No Need to Rush In for Great Long-Term Returns




Solution
Do Independent Analysis

Do Your Own Fundamental Research
Determine Downside/Risks



Solution
Focus on High Probability Situations
In most cases, we have found that the best outcome is to either wait:

For a formal announcement that the company will be restructuring its operations or is initiating a “strategic alternatives” process
The activists are well represented on the Board



Solution
Stick Around After it is all Over

  Add Some Punch	                 














Some simple advice as paraphrased from Warren Buffett.
An investor should act as though he had a lifetime decision card with just twenty punches on it.
With every investment decision his card is punched, and he has one fewer available for the rest of his life.
Choose wisely for good returns.
Make Sarbit your next punch.

Four Pillars

Our Principles

Unique Research Advantage

Surveying the Market: The Rent-A-Center Story


Add Some Punch
 

  Four Pillars	                 




Have Patience
Real successful business investors own businesses for years, decades and generations. Bargains don’t emerge because of positive events. Patience is required in undervalued situations in most instances because often, a negative event has occurred. We don’t know when the event will pass, but we have a high degree of certainty that it will happen at some point in the future. Investors in our funds may have to wait for these events to unfold. But the returns received from having patience far outweigh the time that is needed to be patient.


Concentration – Own a Few Terrific Companies
Again, we are imitating successful business owners. In practically every case, they have prospered by being in and understanding one business. Owning hundreds of companies as characterized by most mutual funds and investment portfolios is a guaranteed road to mediocrity, not the path take by the few winners in the field of business and investing.


Paying a Bargain Price
This simple concept means that the business buyer will purchase a company in whole or part (shares) only when the price of the business is below a conservative evaluation of the estimated range of the true underlying value of the enterprise.
This allows the investor to achieve two goals: first and most importantly, to protect capital. Paying such a price means the investor is naturally less likely to suffer a lose of capital. Successful business owners are usually very conscious of never overpaying for any input to their business or in buying other companies. Secondly, paying a bargain price for a wonderful business enhances the return generated by that business, in exactly the same way that buying a bond below issue price will increase the coupon to the debt holder. The end result: high returns and lower risk – the ideal objective of intelligent investing.


Buy Wonderful Businesses
Successful business people have been winners because they usually own companies that possess a few simple, but critical characteristics.
These include, An enormous sustainable competitive advantage against others in the same industry. They generate large growing streams of free cash flow (excess cash not needed by the company for ongoing operations). They are simple and understandable businesses. They have a high degree of predictability with repeatable consistent revenue streams, selling products or services that people will require now and in the future. They have a high return on invested capital – that is, they don’t require much capital or future capital expenditures in order to succeed.
A wonderful business is allowed to make mistakes – sometimes large ones – but the company survives such events because of the strength of the franchise. Such companies obviously differ significantly from an average business where competition and future revenue and cash flow streams are usually much less predictable.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
