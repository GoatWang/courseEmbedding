A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

Immune shareholders to receive additional pro rata shares in Cytovia




NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Immune Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: IMNP) (“Immune”) today confirmed it is 
      continuing to structure and pursue a spin-off of Cytovia, Inc. 
      (“Cytovia”), its subsidiary dedicated to the development and 
      commercialization of Oncology drugs and drug candidates, into a 
      separate, stand-alone publicly-traded company. It is contemplated that a 
      pro rata distribution of shares in Cytovia would be issued to Immune 
      shareholders as a dividend. The spin-off is expected to create two 
      independent publicly-traded companies with distinct strategic plans, 
      leadership, growth strategies, and operational and development 
      priorities.
    

      The new Cytovia, will focus on the development and commercialization of 
      novel immuno-oncology and hematology therapeutics to meaningfully 
      improve cancer patients’ lives. Cytovia aims to grow into a global 
      specialty biopharmaceuticals company through potential acquisitions and 
      rejuvenation of late-stage development or commercial-stage products. The 
      initial core asset of Cytovia will be CEPLENE (histamine 
      dihydrochloride) an immunotherapy treatment approved in Europe in 
      combination with low-dose IL2 for remission maintenance in patients with 
      Acute Myeloid Leukemia (“AML”).
    

Cytovia Update


      As previously disclosed in a press release and our current report on 
      Form 8-K filed with Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on June 
      15, 2017, Immune signed, on behalf of its subsidiary Cytovia, a 
      definitive asset purchase agreement with Mylan to acquire the rights to 
      Ceplene in the territories that Immune did not previously own; namely 
      Asia, Europe, Middle East and Africa. The European Marketing 
      Authorization allows us to commercialize in 30 EU countries and serves 
      as the basis for approval in Latin America, Russia and other Eastern 
      European countries and countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. 
      The addressable market for remission maintenance of Acute Myeloid 
      Leukemia patients that could be treated with Celine exceeds 10,000 
      patients in Europe, Russia and other Eastern European countries. The 
      current reimbursement in Europe is $25,000 for a full course of 
      treatment.
    

      On July 11, 2017, Cytovia entered into a definitive licensing and 
      commercialization agreement with Pint Pharma Int’l Ltd. for all the 
      markets in Latin America. Pint will implement Early Market Access 
      programs until full registration in those countries. The addressable 
      Latin American market for Ceplene is estimated at 4,000 patients. Under 
      the Pint agreement, Cytovia is eligible to receive 35% of net sales in 
      Latin America subject to the terms contained therein. Additionally, Pint 
      has committed to make a $4 million equity investment in Cytovia.
    

      Cytovia is committed to further development of Ceplene in additional 
      indications such as Myelo-Displasic Syndrome (MDS), also known as CMML ( 
      chronic mono-myelocytic leukemia) for which a pilot clinical study has 
      been initiated in Sweden.
    

Cytovia Strategic Plan


      Cytovia expects that it will be well-positioned to establish itself as a 
      “pure play” commercial stage specialty pharmaceutical company in the 
      highly attractive immuno-oncology field, with an integrated pipeline 
      portfolio.
    

      Cytovia’s strategic plan includes the following initiatives:
    


        Commercialize Ceplene in select territories directly and through 
        partnerships with leading regional companies in other territories 
        following the business model being implemented with Pint Pharma in 
        Latin America
      

        Focus development resources toward an approval of Ceplene in the 
        United States for remission maintenance in patients with AML as well 
        as the extension of the use of Ceplene to new indications;
      

        Consider potential acquisitions and rejuvenation of synergistic 
        late-stage development or commercial-stage immuno-oncology drugs;
      

        Realize the strategic potential of its pipeline, including through 
        potential collaborative partnerships of its phase 2 drug candidates, 
        Azixa and crolibulin, its bi-specific antibody platform technology and 
        other early-stage drug candidates
      


Additional Information about the Proposed Cytovia Spin-off and Next 
      Steps


      The spin-off transaction is intended to take the form of a tax-free 
      distribution to Immune’s shareholders of common stock of a new 
      publicly-traded Cytovia; however, as the proposed transaction 
      progresses, or as we may receive SEC or other tax related comments, this 
      structure may be revised accordingly. The stock distribution ratio and 
      other matters, including the stock exchange on which the new Cytovia 
      stock will be listed, will be determined at a later date. Immune will 
      continue to be listed on the NASDAQ under its existing symbol, “IMNP.”
    

      More details about Cytovia, including pro forma financial information, 
      will be disclosed in any Form 10 registration statement we file with the 
      SEC in connection with the transaction. The initial filing of the Form 
      10 registration statement is expected to occur in the third quarter of 
      2017. The transaction is expected to be completed in 2017, subject to 
      certain conditions and regulatory review, including the receipt of a 
      favorable opinion from outside tax counsel, execution of inter-company 
      agreements by Immune and Cytovia, the effectiveness of the Form 10 
      registration statement and final approval of the transaction by Immune’s 
      board of directors. The transaction will not require the approval of 
      Immune’s shareholders. The record date will be announced by the board of 
      directors after the filling of the Form 10 and receipt of initial 
      feedback from the SEC.
    

Immune Pharmaceuticals


      The transaction will allow Immune to become a pure play 
      immuno-inflammation, clinical stage. development company with all 
      resources being allocated to its lead assets, bertilimumab and 
      nano-cyclosporin, with a special interest in Immuno-Dermatology. 
      Immune’s core assets are bertilimumab, a first-in-class human monoclonal 
      antibody targeted at eotaxin-1, currently in phase 2 development in 
      bullous pemphigoid and ulcerative colitis, with a planned phase 2 in 
      severe atopic dermatitis, and a proprietary topical nano-cyclosporine 
      for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and of moderate psoriasis.
    

      Immune expects that the spin-off transaction will enhance the 
      capitalization of the company and will allow for a focused deployment of 
      resources to accelerate growth and thereby attract increased attention 
      from institutional and other investors.

Immune Pharma shares tumble 9% premarket as it unveils restructuring
Shares of Immune Pharmaceuticals Inc.  slid 9% in premarket trade Monday, after the company unveiled a restructuring and said it has received notice from the Nasdaq that it is not in compliance with listing requirements after the delay of a key regulatory filing. Immune Pharma said it has not yet filed its 10-K for 2016, but will do so as soon as practicable. Meanwhile, the company is making inflammatory disease and dermatology its key areas of focus. Its oncology business will be folded into its Cytovia Inc. unit, which may be spun off to Immune shareholders. Chief Executive Dr. Daniel Teper will step down from that role to run Cytovia's cancer research and development effort, but will remain on the Immune board. Elliot Maza, currently a board member, will become interim CEO of Immune. Shares are down 3% in 2017 through Friday, while the S&P 500  has gained 5%.

Immune Pharma shares tumble 9% premarket as it unveils restructuring
Shares of Immune Pharmaceuticals Inc.  slid 9% in premarket trade Monday, after the company unveiled a restructuring and said it has received notice from the Nasdaq that it is not in compliance with listing requirements after the delay of a key regulatory filing. Immune Pharma said it has not yet filed its 10-K for 2016, but will do so as soon as practicable. Meanwhile, the company is making inflammatory disease and dermatology its key areas of focus. Its oncology business will be folded into its Cytovia Inc. unit, which may be spun off to Immune shareholders. Chief Executive Dr. Daniel Teper will step down from that role to run Cytovia's cancer research and development effort, but will remain on the Immune board. Elliot Maza, currently a board member, will become interim CEO of Immune. Shares are down 3% in 2017 through Friday, while the S&P 500  has gained 5%.

Bertilimumab
Supported by 1,500 peer-reviewed studies, bertilimumab is a novel personalized therapy that targets and lowers eotaxin-1 levels in many inflammatory conditions . It is being studied to see if it will improve outcomes in patients with diseases that do not have therapies or the therapies have severe limitations.
Bertilimumab is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody designed to block the protein eotaxin-1, which is responsible for causing inflammation in a significant number of diseases. It is currently in clinical development for bullous pemphigoid, an orphan auto-immune skin blistering disease, IBD (Crohn’s and Colitis) and atopic dermatitis.
Eotaxin-1 causes eosinophils to migrate toward sites of inflammation, where they release substances that damage tissue and enhance inflammation. By neutralizing Eotaxin-1, Bertilimumab may prevent the migration of eosinophils, thus helping to relieve inflammatory conditions associated with the protein.
It is important to note that eotaxin-1 is not only the target, but also the biomarker for treatment. Personalized therapies are designed to optimize safety-to-efficacy ratio by selecting patients with higher response rates based on specific biomarkers. Our precision medicine, bertilimumab, may enable the identification and treatment of patients with elevated eotaxin-1, as is found in some autoimmune diseases.
Bertilimumab was developed by Cambridge Antibody Technology (now part of MedImmune, the biologics division of AstraZeneca). Immune took responsibility for product supply and all non-ophthalmic indications in June 2011, while iCo Therapeutics retains the rights to develop any ophthalmic indications.
Phase 2 clinical trials in Bullous Pemphigoid and Ulcerative are currently ongoing in Israeli sites.  In additional, we are considering a small Phase 2 trial in Atopic Dermatitis. We are expecting results of the clinical trials and orphan drug designation for BP following Investigational New Drug (IND) clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 
Nanocyclo

Nanocyclo is the next generation topical treatment for atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.
Cyclosporin A is a well-known small-molecule widely used to prevent organ transplant rejection. It has also been approved to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, and for local use in the treatment for dry eye and some forms of keratitis.
It is an immunosuppressant drug interfering with the activity and growth of T-cells, which are key in the inflammatory cascade.
The nanoformulation enables the molecule to better penetrate into the skin layers and provide a local action on skin lesions.
The benefit for the patient is to avoid potential effects of systemic cyclosporine A including severe infections and adverse effects on the kidney function.
Immune pharmaceuticals Inc, is partnering with Yissum, Hebrew University of Jerusalem for the development developing a topical formulation of cyclosporine A, which is delivered as a nanoformulation in a cream, to treat atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.
Phase IIa clinical trials are expected to be initiated in 2017.

"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

THE PROMISE OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE

















THE PROMISE OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."
