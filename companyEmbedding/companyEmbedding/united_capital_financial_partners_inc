United Capital - Financial Life Management


































MORE











Welcome toFinancial Life Management
It’s not about the money.
                        The way you live matters more.










We work with money every day, but one question often eludes us,
"What does it mean to be truly financially happy?"
Well, we thought we'd ask...
                        We hired a team of researchers who asked people just like you what lessons they have learned throughout their entire financial life.
                    























As we talked to people around the country, we took away four really important insights that matter to us, and should matter to you too...

Here is what we learned...









Interesting,   Tell Me More!

93%told us their entire life story.
A financial life isn't just about money. It's about a person's entire life.
         
People didn't talk to us about their portfolios or their investment strategies. They talked to us about their lives.







Working and spending are far more important to our financial lives than saving and investing.
Get The    Full Scoop


90% talked about working and spending


You wouldn't guess it by the way most people in our industry talk to you. 









Where’d You    Get Those Facts?
Life is a series of trade-offs. More of one thing usually means less of another.
Retire on time
Send both children to private school
Move to a better neighborhood
Contribute to the college fund

83%people's financial life stories involved a trade-off of one kind or another.
We've heard it all our lives, "You can't have it all." Turns out, this understanding is a central component of a successful financial life as well.








Our financial decisions move us either toward or away from our ideal selves.
I Want To    Know More
It turns out people are happiest when their financial decisions are in alignment with their personal values – not when they have more money.









How do your biases affect your decisions?
How do you make sure your money serves your life's goals?
What is it you really want your money to do for you?
How are you going to make sure it happens?
If we don't answer these questions, how can we possibly get what we want out of our one financial life?
Learn more about your biases







We have one singular, obsessive focus, to help people improve their lives.
There is only one way to do it, by helping people to make better choices.
                    
We help by bringing truth, understanding and discipline to the financial choices you make every day.








TRUTH
An unfiltered, unbiased and complete set of accurate facts.
UNDERSTANDING
Objective analysis with a caring and aligned perspective.
DISCIPLINE
Clear, deliberate and well-executed action steps.






Introducing your Financial Life Management. Or as we like to call it, FINLIFE.

A new interactive, collaborative and engaging way to think about your financial life

With more than 40 years of experience in client service, enterprise management, mergers and acquisitions, Joel is a resource of knowledge and experience, which he shares with his staff and each of his clients.Prior to joining United Capital, Joel purchased Bedrock Capital in 2001 after having been a client. He immediately began putting his own spin on things, hiring a top-notch professional team to support his vision. The result: Bedrock Capital Management evolved into a full-service comprehensive wealth management firm. In December 2015, Bedrock joined United Capital Financial Advisers as its anchor office in Silicon Valley.Joel has a history of success. He was just 24 when he was named a Vice President at Neiman Marcus. By 1990, Joel was running his own consulting business, which specialized in purchasing and accounts payable auditing for high-tech firms. The Shaps Group was named one of the 500 fastest growing companies in the U.S. in both 1996 and 1997 by INC. Magazine. After selling the company to The Profit Recovery Group in 1997, he joined their management team as a Division President until he left to head up Bedrock Capital Management.Joel holds a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Pennsylvania. He is a professional member of:The Financial Planning Association (FPA)Investment Management Consultants Associations (IMCA)Joel is also involved in the community as a member of the following:Board of the Los Altos Committee FoundationChair of the LACF Investment CommitteeIn his free time, Joel loves playing just about any sport, which mirrors his philosophy of living, “I think that life should have variety and be fun while offering challenge and excitement.”Joel graduated from playing football and baseball in his youth to playing competitive squash, skiing and scuba diving as an adult. And many weekends, he can now be found at the golf course or bicycling around the valley. Joel lives in Los Altos with his wife, Sally, who was his high school sweetheart. When they’re not playing sports, traveling or sipping fine wine, they’re rooting for the San Francisco Giants and enjoying their two adorable grandchildren.Eric Lewis, CFA, CFP®Managing Directoreric.lewis@unitedcp.comEric Lewis is a Managing Director at the United Capital Silicon Valley office. He revels in complex client portfolios. The more twists and turns the better, as far as he is concerned. Joel met Eric at a financial conference in 2001. After realizing that he was clearly the smartest guy in the room, Joel asked Eric to join him as a partner at Bedrock Capital Management, now the United Capital office in Silicon Valley. Eric’s intense intellect, experience and training are readily evident as he oversees client relations, tax planning and investment strategies for the office. Before joining Bedrock as partner, Eric held management positions at International Data Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, and a division of Standard & Poor’s.Eric received a Bachelor of Arts from Princeton University and an MBA from Harvard Business School. He is a CFA Charterholder and a CFP® certificant.Eric grew up in New York, where he took every opportunity to learn from his father, who was an economist on Wall Street and worked in the regulatory division of the New York Stock Exchange. Visiting the NYSE as a small child, Eric loved the cacophony that echoed around the floor, and it instilled a thrill he remembers today.Eric and his wife, Sheryl, love to soak in the people, culture, food, museums and architecture as they travel around the globe. It’s hard for Eric to choose a favorite venue, mostly because he can find something enjoyable to do wherever his travels take him. And with two grown sons, traveling together as a family makes any place a great vacation.Eric also cares deeply about philanthropy, giving both his time and resources, (“giving in tax-advantaged, intelligent ways!”). He has served on the executive boards of the South Peninsula Hebrew Day School and Congregation Beth David, for which he currently serves as member of the legacy giving committee. Eric is also the chair of the investment committee for Hillel of Silicon Valley.When Eric’s not working, traveling, volunteering or hanging out with his family, he likes to hike and cycle the beautiful trails around the Bay. Always on a quest to learn, Eric notes, “I’m more knowledgeable today than I was yesterday but less knowledgeable than I will be tomorrow.”Tony Blagrove, CFA®, CFP®Managing Directortony.blagrove@unitedcp.comPrevious experience:Portfolio Manager, Bedrock Capital Management (later United Capital Silicon Valley), Los Altos, CaliforniaPortfolio Analyst, Bedrock Capital Management, Los Altos, California Financial Analyst, Symantec, Mountain View, CaliforniaSummer Intern, Smith Barney, San Jose, CaliforniaEducation:BS, Finance, Santa Clara UniversityBS, Economics, Santa Clara UniversityChartered Financial Analyst (CFA)Certified Financial Planner (CFP)Began career in 2006:Tony Blagrove is a Managing Director of the United Capital Silicon Valley office, where he both advises clients and manages portfolios for all of the clients of the office.
