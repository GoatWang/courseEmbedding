Seattle Times technology reporter 


Peter Thompson, a biotechnology investor and a University of Washington affiliate professor, is launching a biotech startup in Bellevue while netting $10 million for the firm Tuesday.
The company, Silverback Therapeutics, filed Securities and Exchange Commission documents stating the company had raised $10 million of a larger $60 million round. 
Thompson, who is the only executive listed in the filing, said Tuesday the company is in “stealth mode” and declined to give details on the company’s work or how many employees it has. 


Thompson is a private equity partner at OrbiMed Advisors, an investment firm based in San Francisco and New York that focuses on health care and biotech. He hinted Tuesday that OrbiMed is involved with Silverback, saying that founding a company and investing in it are “not mutually exclusive.”

Thompson also co-founded Cleave BioSciences and sits on the boards of several biotech companies.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.
