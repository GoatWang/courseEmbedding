 Career History



Co-Founder

                                    2009 - Current                


Vollero Beach Capital Partners LLC


                  Vollero Beach Capital Partners manages various funds that employ a fundamental market neutral, relative value, long/short equity  investment strategy.  The investment objective of the funds is to generate consistent positive returns, in varying market conditions, by investing on both a long and short basis in equity securities of companies worldwide that operate predominantly in Commodity and Old Economy industries. The Vollero Beach investment approach is one of relative value and employs fundamental analysis as well as trading expertise. Energy, and a wide variety of Energy subsectors, is the primary focus of the funds, with broad diversification among companies in the Energy industry. Other Commodity-related and Old Economy industries in which the funds invest include, but are not be limited to, Materials (Paper & Packaging, Agriculture, Chemicals, Metals & Mining), Industrials and Transportation.                




Portfolio Manager

                                    2005 - 2008                


Touradji Capital Management LP


                  Touradji Capital Management provides  investment  advisory  services  to  private pooled  investment  vehicles. The Funds currently have four active investment strategies. The  Touradji  Global  Resources  investment  strategy seeks to  maximize compounded annual  total  returns  and  minimize  the volatility of returns through a portfolio of investments across the global equity and commodity  markets  with  smaller  and  shorter-term  trades  that  revolve  around  relative-value  opportunities. The strategy  seeks to achieve portfolio returns which are non-correlated with equities, fixed income, commodity, or hedge fund indices.The  Touradji  Diversified  investment  strategy is similar  to  the  Global  Resource  Strategy, sometimes trading pari passu on commodity  trades. However, over time it is  Touradji’s expectation that the strategy will diversify its portfolio relative to that of the  Global Resources Strategy.The Touradji Index I Plus investment strategy primarily trades in commodity futures with  an objective of outperforming a commodity benchmark while maintaining reasonable volatility and leverage.The Touradji Merger Arbitrage investment strategy seeks to produce consistent returns  on a risk-adjusted basis that offer low correlation to traditional equity and fixed income portfolios, by simultaneously buying and selling stock of companies of announced  mergers or leveraged LBOs. The strategy evaluates the risk of a merger or LBO closing, not closing on time, or not closing at all. This uncertainty creates the arbitrage opportunity by bringing a discount to the target company’s equity price versus the price that the combined company would have when the deal closes. Of the major sources of risk, deal collapse is the greatest, but can be mitigated through diversification and hedging with options.
