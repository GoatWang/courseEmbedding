About Brandes






Who We Are A Pioneer in Global Value Investing Driven by a singular goal to help investors pursue their long-term investment objectives, Brandes Investment Partners, L.P., (Brandes) has scoured the globe for attractively priced companies since the firm’s founding in 1974. A leading investment advisory firm specializing in managing a variety of global equity and fixed-income assets for investors worldwide, Brandes was among the first investment firms to invest globally using a value approach. We apply a long-term perspective to both investment strategies and management of our business, as outlined in the firm's 100-Year Vision . Focused on the Principles of Benjamin Graham  Brandes applies the value-investing discipline to security selection pioneered by Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing. This approach seeks to identify and invest in companies that are selling at a discount to their estimated fundamental value, or true worth. Inspired by the Pursuit of Value-Driven Growth Potential Finding value for our clients inspires Brandes just as much today as it did when we started 40 years ago.  After navigating four decades of market ebbs and flows, we continue to believe true value investing is the only way to seek meaningful, long-term growth potential for our clients. Invested In Our Strategies – Alongside Our Clients  At Brandes, we have a long-established culture of investing alongside of our clients. Our Co-Investment Guidelines ensure that our leadership’s financial interests are aligned with those of our clients by requiring that all members of the firm’s various Investment Committees maintain meaningful personal investments in Brandes strategies, especially in those they co-manage.
We invite you to learn more about the firm, and our investment approach and services by viewing our Brandes at a Glance .

Brandes Investment Partners

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Brandes Investment Partners is an investment advisory firm, managing assets for institutional and private clients worldwide. It was founded by Charles Brandes in 1974.[1]
Since the firm’s inception in 1974, Brandes has applied the value investing approach, pioneered by Benjamin Graham, to its investment in stocks and fixed-income assets. Among the first investment firms to bring a global perspective to value investing, Brandes manages a variety of investment strategies.[2] As of June 30, 2017, the firm manages approximately $29.7 billion (USD) for a broad range of clients worldwide.[3]
Headquartered in San Diego, the firm and its related entities have offices in Dublin, Milwaukee, Singapore, and Toronto and employ more than 290 employees worldwide.[4]
The firm's strategy involves buying out-of-favor securities trading at discounts to their intrinsic value and holding them until their true worth is realized.[5]
History[edit]
Brandes was founded in 1974 in Del Mar, California under the name Branco Investors. [6] In 1977, the firm launched the Brandes Global Equity Strategy, which invested in stocks around the world. [6] In 1996, Brandes began offer mutual funds to investors and clients.[6] In order to expand their fixed-income offerings, Brandes acquired strategies from Hilltop Capital in 1999.[5] In 2002, Brandes founded The Brandes Insitute to lead thought leadership and research initiatives into investing and other areas.[6]

Brandes Investment Partners

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Brandes Investment Partners is an investment advisory firm, managing assets for institutional and private clients worldwide. It was founded by Charles Brandes in 1974.[1]
Since the firm’s inception in 1974, Brandes has applied the value investing approach, pioneered by Benjamin Graham, to its investment in stocks and fixed-income assets. Among the first investment firms to bring a global perspective to value investing, Brandes manages a variety of investment strategies.[2] As of June 30, 2017, the firm manages approximately $29.7 billion (USD) for a broad range of clients worldwide.[3]
Headquartered in San Diego, the firm and its related entities have offices in Dublin, Milwaukee, Singapore, and Toronto and employ more than 290 employees worldwide.[4]
The firm's strategy involves buying out-of-favor securities trading at discounts to their intrinsic value and holding them until their true worth is realized.[5]
History[edit]
Brandes was founded in 1974 in Del Mar, California under the name Branco Investors. [6] In 1977, the firm launched the Brandes Global Equity Strategy, which invested in stocks around the world. [6] In 1996, Brandes began offer mutual funds to investors and clients.[6] In order to expand their fixed-income offerings, Brandes acquired strategies from Hilltop Capital in 1999.[5] In 2002, Brandes founded The Brandes Insitute to lead thought leadership and research initiatives into investing and other areas.[6]
