	Registration Statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-196958)  Transocean Partners LLC



	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	We have acted as special counsel as to
	matters of the law of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (

	Marshall Islands Law

	) for Transocean Partners LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company (the 

	Company

	), in connection with the proposed initial
	public offering by Transocean Partners Holding Limited (the 

	Selling Unitholder

	) of up to 20,125,000 of the Companys common units, each representing limited liability company interests in the Company (the
	

	Units

	), pursuant to the Companys registration statement on Form S-1 (such registration statement, any amendments or supplements thereto, including any post-effective amendments, the 

	Registration
	Statement

	).


	As counsel, we have examined originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of the following
	documents:


	 




	(i)


	the Registration Statement and the prospectus contained therein (the 

	Prospectus

	);




	 




	(ii)


	the First Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement filed as an appendix to the prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 22, 2014;




	 




	(i)


	the underwriting agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to the Registration Statement (the 

	Stanley & Co. LLC and Barclays Capital Inc., as representatives of the underwriters named therein relating to the sale of the Units;




	 




	(ii)


	the contribution, conveyance and assumption agreement filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the Registration Statement (the 

	(iii)


	such other papers, documents, agreements, certificates of public officials and certificates of representatives of the Company as we have deemed relevant and necessary as the basis for the opinion hereafter expressed.




	In such examination, we have assumed (a) the legal capacity of each natural person, (b) the genuineness of all signatures and the
	authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, (c) the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as conformed or photostatic copies, (d) that the documents reviewed by us in connection with the
	rendering of the opinion set forth herein are true, correct and complete and (e) the truthfulness of each statement as to all factual matters contained in any document or certificate encompassed within the due diligence review undertaken by us.


	In rendering this opinion, we have also assumed:


	 




	(i)


	that the issuance and sale of the Units complies in all respects with the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in the Prospectus and all of the instruments and other documents relating thereto or executed in
	connection therewith;




	 




	(ii)


	that each of the Underwriting Agreement and the Contribution Agreement has been duly and validly authorized by the Company and the other parties thereto, and executed and delivered by such parties; and




	 




	(iii)


	the validity and enforceability of the Underwriting Agreement and the Contribution Agreement against the parties thereto.




	As to matters of fact material to this opinion that have not been independently established, we have relied upon the representations and certificates of
	officers or representatives of the Company and of public officials, in each case as we have deemed relevant and appropriate, and upon the representations and warranties of the Company in the Underwriting Agreement and the Contribution Agreement. We
	have not independently verified the facts so relied on.


	This opinion letter is limited to Marshall Islands Law and is as of the date hereof. We expressly
	disclaim any responsibility to advise of any development or circumstance of any kind, including any change of law or fact that may occur after the date of this opinion letter that might affect the opinion expressed herein.


	Based on the foregoing, and having regard to legal considerations which we deem relevant, and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions set
	forth herein, we are of the opinion that when the Units are issued and delivered against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Contribution Agreement as executed and delivered, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, such Units
	will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

	Re:


	Transocean Partners LLC Registration Statement on Form S-1




	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	We have acted as U.S. counsel for Transocean Partners LLC (the Company), a Marshall Islands limited liability company, with respect
	to certain legal matters in connection with the offer and sale by Transocean Partners Holdings Limited of common units representing limited liability company interests in the Company. We have also participated in the preparation of a Prospectus (the
	Prospectus) forming part of the Registration Statement on Form S-1, No. 333-196958 (the Registration Statement).


	This opinion is based on various facts and assumptions, and is conditioned upon certain representations made by the Company as to factual
	matters through a certificate of an officer of the Company (the Officers Certificate). In addition, this opinion is based upon the factual representations of the Company concerning its business, properties, and governing documents
	as set forth in the Registration Statement.


	In our capacity as counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and factual examinations
	and inquiries, including an examination of originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of such documents, corporate records, and other instruments, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this
	opinion. In our examination, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures thereon, the legal capacity of natural persons executing such documents, and the conformity to authentic
	original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. For the purpose of our opinion, we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in the above-referenced documents or in the Officers Certificate. In
	addition, in rendering this opinion we have assumed the truth and accuracy of all representations and statements made to us which are qualified as to knowledge or belief, without regard to such qualification.


	We are opining herein as to the effect on the subject transaction only of the federal income tax laws of the United States, and we express no
	opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of other federal laws, foreign laws, the laws of any state or any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any other local agencies within any
	state. We hereby confirm that all statements of legal conclusions contained in the discussion in the Prospectus under the caption Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations constitute the opinion of Baker Botts L.L.P. with respect
	to the matters set forth therein as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, subject to the assumptions, qualifications, and limitations set forth therein. No opinion is expressed as to any matter not discussed therein.


	This opinion is rendered to you as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, and we undertake no obligation to update this opinion
	subsequent to the date hereof. This opinion is based on various statutory provisions, regulations promulgated thereunder, and interpretations thereof by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts having jurisdiction over such matters, all of which
	are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. Also, any variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the representations described above, including in the Registration Statement and the Officers Certificate, may
	affect the conclusions stated herein.

	Purchasers transferees, immediately after the Closing Date, to be the owner of such valid leasehold interests or fee ownership interests in and to the Assets as are necessary to enable Purchaser, or Purchasers transferees, to own and
	operate the Assets in substantially the same manner that the Assets were owned and/or operated by Seller, or Sellers transferors, immediately prior to the date hereof, (ii) without limiting the generality of the other provisions of this
	Agreement, the Contribution Agreement or the Omnibus Agreement, any judicial determination substantially to the effect that Seller did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange therefor or was rendered insolvent by reason of the sale,

	and

	(b)(iii)

	above, to the extent that Seller is notified by Purchaser of such Liabilities within three years after the Closing Date; and (c) (i) any documentary, filing, recording, transfer, deed and conveyance Taxes (as defined in the

	date immediately preceding the date of this Agreement, including any such Tax liabilities of the Seller, or Sellers transferors, that may result from the consummation of the formation transactions for Purchaser to the extent that Seller is
	notified by Purchaser of any such Tax liabilities within the applicable statute of limitations plus 60 days, but excluding any Taxes reserved on the books of Purchaser on the Closing Date. Any indemnification pursuant to this paragraph 2 shall be
	treated as an adjustment to the Asset Purchase Price.


	3. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this Agreement, the aggregate
	liability under (i) clause (a) of paragraph 2 of this Agreement, (ii) similar indemnity provisions contained in all other Assignments and Bills of Sale executed in connection with the Contribution Agreement and (iii) the

	Post-Closing Adjustment

	 means the amount equal to $[]
	(

	Initial Net Working Capital

	) minus Actual Net Working Capital. Any Post-Closing Adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 4 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Asset Purchase Price.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

	EXPLANATORY NOTE




	DEREGISTRATION OF SECURITIES




	This Post-Effective Amendment relates to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the “Registration Statement”), File No. 333-206171, of Transocean Partners LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company (“Transocean Partners”) and Transocean Partners’ subsidiary guarantor registrants (together with Transocean Partners, the “Registrants”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 6, 2015 and declared effective August 21, 2015. The Registration Statement registered the offer and sale from time to time of up to $2,000,000,000 of Transocean Partners’ common units representing limited liability company interests (“common units”), other classes of units representing limited liability company interests (“general units”), debt securities (“debt securities”) and guarantees of debt securities (“guarantees” and, together with common units, general units and debt securities, the “Securities”).




	On December 6, 2016, the unitholders of Transocean Partners approved the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 31, 2016 (the “Original Merger Agreement”), as amended on November 21, 2016 (the “Amendment” and the Original Merger Agreement as amended by the Amendment, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Transocean Ltd., a Swiss corporation (“Transocean”), Transocean Partners, Transocean Partners Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Transocean Holdings”) and TPHL Holdings LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on December 9, 2016, Transocean Partners is anticipated to merge with Merger Sub, with Transocean Partners continuing as the surviving entity and as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean (the “Merger”). Each outstanding common unit representing a limited liability company interest of Transocean Partners, other than common units held by Transocean, Transocean Partners, Transocean Holdings, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Transocean, was converted into the right to receive 1.2000 Transocean shares.




	In connection with the anticipated completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Registrants have terminated all offerings of Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement. In accordance with undertakings made by the Registrants in the Registration Statement to remove from registration, by means of a post-effective amendment, any of the Securities that had been registered for issuance that remain unsold at the termination of such offering, the Registrants hereby remove from registration all of such Securities of the Registrants registered but unsold under the Registration Statement.

Transocean Partners LLC launch IPO
Transocean Partners LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company formed by Transocean Ltd., announced today that it has commenced an initial public offering of 17,500,000 common units representing limited liability company interests pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). All of the common units are being offered by Transocean Partners Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean Ltd. The underwriters of the offering are expected to be granted a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,625,000 common units from Transocean Partners Holdings Limited. The common units are expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RIGP.” The common units being offered represent a 25.4 percent limited liability company interest in Transocean Partners LLC, or a 29.2 percent limited liability company interest if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units. Transocean Ltd., through Transocean Partners Holdings Limited, will own the remaining limited liability company interests in Transocean Partners. Transocean Partners LLC will initially take majority holdings in the ‘Discoverer Inspiration’ and ‘Discoverer Clear Leader’ drillships and the ‘Development Driller III’ semisub units. The newly listed company also has the first right to offer for ownership of the newbuilds, ‘Deepwater Invictus’, ‘Deepwater Thalassa’, Deepwater Proteus’, Deepwater Pontus’, Deepwater Poesidon’ and ‘Deepwater Conqueror’ units, should Transocean Ltd decide to sell the assets.

Discoverer Inspiration Begins Five-Year Contract With Chevron
Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG) today announced that the newbuild ultra-deepwater drillship Discoverer Inspiration has commenced operations for Chevron U.S.A. Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico under a five-year drilling contract. The dynamically positioned double-hulled Discoverer Inspiration includes the most advanced drilling capabilities in the offshore drilling industry. The vessel is an enhanced version of Transocean's three predecessor Enterprise-class drillships, which have set deepwater drilling records in recent years, including the world water-depth drilling record of 10,011 feet set by the Discoverer Deep Seas while working for Chevron in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

	There

	issued and sold by the registrant from time to time hereunder, which together shall have an aggregate initial offering price not to exceed $2,000,000,000. There are also being registered under this
	registration statement 21,254,310 common units as may be sold by Transocean Ltd. (or subsidiaries thereof) from time to time. Pursuant to Rule 457(i) under the Securities Act of 1933, as
	amended (the "Securities Act"), the securities registered hereunder also include such indeterminate number of securities that may be issued upon exercise, settlement, exchange or conversion of
	securities offered hereunder, or pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of any such securities. In addition, pursuant to Rule 416 under the Securities Act, the securities being registered

	(4)




	Pursuant
	to Rule 457(c) under the Securities Act, the offering price and registration fee for the common units to be sold by Transocean Ltd.
	(or subsidiaries thereof) are computed based on the average of the high and low prices reported for the registrant's common units traded on the New York Stock Exchange on July 31, 2015.






	(5)




	Estimated
	solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee pursuant to Rule 457(o). In no event will the aggregate initial offering price

	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS






	        In this prospectus, except as otherwise indicated, the terms "Company," "we," "us," or "our" mean Transocean Partners LLC and
	all entities included in our consolidated financial statements, and references to "Transocean" or the "selling security holder" refer to Transocean Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries and
	predecessors, unless the context requires otherwise).




	        This
	prospectus is part of a registration statement on Form S-3 that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the "SEC," using a "shelf" registration process.
	Under this shelf process, Transocean Partners LLC may, from time to time, sell any combination of the securities described in this prospectus in one or more offerings, and any such securities
	which are debt securities may be guaranteed by one or more guarantors, and Transocean may offer and sell up to 21,254,310 of our common units from time to time. This prospectus provides you with a
	general description of those securities. Each time we sell securities, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of that offering, including the
	specific amounts, prices and terms of the securities offered. The prospectus supplement may also add, update or change information contained in this prospectus. If there is any inconsistency between
	the information in this prospectus and any prospectus supplement, you should rely on the information in the prospectus supplement. You
	should read this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement together with the additional information described herein under the heading "Where You Can Find More Information."















	WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION






	        You may obtain from the SEC, through the SEC's website or at the SEC offices mentioned in the following paragraph, a copy of the
	registration statement on Form S-3, including exhibits, which have been filed with the SEC to register the securities offered under this prospectus. This prospectus is part of the registration
	statement and does not contain all the information in the registration statement. You will find additional information in the registration statement. Any statement made in this prospectus concerning a
	contract or other document of ours is not necessarily complete, and you should read the documents that are filed as exhibits to the registration statement or otherwise filed with the SEC for a more
	complete understanding of the document or matter. Each such statement is qualified in all respects by reference to the document to which it refers.




	        We
	file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. Our SEC filings are available to the public over the Internet at the SEC's website at



	http://www.sec.gov



	and on our corporate website at



	http://transoceanpartners.com



	. Information on our
	website does not constitute part of this prospectus. You may inspect without charge any documents filed by us at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.
	You may obtain copies of all or any part of these materials from the SEC upon the payment of certain fees prescribed by the SEC. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the
	Public Reference Room. Our SEC filings are also available at the office of the New York Stock Exchange located at 20 Broad Street, New York, New York 10005.




	        We
	"incorporate by reference" into this prospectus certain documents we file with the SEC, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you to those
	documents. The information incorporated by reference is an important part of this prospectus. Some information contained in this prospectus updates the information incorporated by reference, and
	information that we file subsequently with the SEC will automatically update this prospectus. In other words, in the case of a conflict or inconsistency between information set forth in this
	prospectus and information that we file later and incorporate by reference into this prospectus, you should rely on the information contained in the document that was filed later.




	        We
	incorporate by reference into this prospectus the documents listed below and any filings we make with the SEC under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14, or 15(d) of the Securities

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS






	        This prospectus, any accompanying prospectus supplement and the documents incorporated by reference herein may contain statements,
	estimates or projections that constitute "forward-looking statements" as defined under U.S. federal securities laws. Generally, the words "anticipate," "believe," "budget," "could," "estimate,"
	"expect," "forecast," "intend," "may," "might," "plan," "predict," "project," "scheduled," "should," "will," and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not
	historical in nature, although not all forward-looking statements contain such language. Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
	differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. These risks include, but are not limited to:






	




	the adequacy of and access to sources of liquidity;








	




	our inability to renew drilling contracts at comparable dayrates;








	




	operational performance;






	2











	Table of Contents







	




	the impact of regulatory changes;








	




	the cancellation of drilling contracts currently included in our reported contract backlog;








	




	losses on impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets;








	




	changes in political, social and economic conditions;








	




	the effect and results of litigation, regulatory matters, settlements, audits, assessments and contingencies; and








	




	other risks discussed in this prospectus and our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
	ended December 31, 2014, which filings are available as described in "Where You Can Find More Information."






	        All
	subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by reference to these risks and
	uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement. We expressly disclaim any
	obligations or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations or beliefs with regard to the statement or any change
	in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forward-looking statement is based, except as required by law.












	OUR COMPANY








	Overview





	        Transocean Partners LLC (together with its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context requires otherwise, "Transocean
	Partners," "we," "us," or "our") is a growth-oriented limited liability company formed by Transocean Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries and predecessors, unless the context requires
	otherwise, "Transocean"), one of the world's largest offshore drilling contractors, to own, operate and acquire modern, technologically advanced offshore drilling rigs. Our assets consist of
	51 percent ownership interest in each of the entities that owns or operates our three ultra-deepwater drilling rigs that are currently operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (each individually, a
	"RigCo," and collectively, the "RigCos"). Transocean owns the remaining 49 percent noncontrolling interest in each of the RigCos. We generate revenue through contract drilling services, which
	involves contracting our mobile offshore drilling fleet, related equipment and work crews on a dayrate basis to large international energy companies to drill oil and gas wells.




	        Our
	drilling rigs currently operate under long-term contracts with Chevron Corporation and BP plc, two leading international energy companies, with an average remaining contract
	term of approximately 3.1 years as of July 15, 2015, the shortest of which is contracted through November 2016. We believe that our drilling contracts will continue to generate stable
	and reliable cash flows over their term. We depend on Transocean affiliates to assist us with the operation of our drilling units, management of our customer relationships, renewing existing and
	obtaining new drilling contracts and to perform other administrative support activities. We intend to use the relationships and expertise of Transocean to re-contract our fleet when the existing
	contracts expire and identify opportunities to expand our fleet through acquisitions.




	        We
	were formed in February 2014 under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Our registered and principal executive offices are located at Deepwater House, Kingswells
	Causeway, Prime Four Business Park, Aberdeen, AB15 8PU, Scotland, United Kingdom, and our phone number is +44 1224 945 100. We maintain a website at



	www.transoceanpartners.com



	where
	general information about us is available. We are not incorporating the contents of the website into this prospectus.

	Table of Contents





	        We
	qualify as an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we are deemed an emerging growth company, we
	may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements that are generally unavailable to other public companies. As an emerging growth company, we may, for up to five
	years, take advantage of specified exemptions from reporting and other regulatory requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies, including, but not limited to, not being
	required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports
	and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory say-on-pay votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. In addition,
	Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for
	complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can, therefore, delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private
	companies. We have elected to take advantage of all of the applicable JOBS Act exemptions, including the exemption provided by Section 107 of the JOBS Act, as described above. This election to
	take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards is irrevocable. Accordingly, the information that we provide unitholders may be
	different than what holders may receive from other public companies in which you hold equity interests.






	Relationship with Transocean





	        One of our principal strengths is our relationship with Transocean. Transocean is a leading international provider of offshore contract
	drilling services for oil and gas wells. Transocean retains a significant interest in us through its ownership of common and subordinated units, representing an aggregate 70.8 percent limited
	liability company interest in us, and all of our incentive distribution rights. Transocean Partners Holdings Limited (the "Transocean Member"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
	Transocean Ltd., holds the Transocean Member interest, which is a non-economic interest in us that includes the right to appoint three of the seven members of our Board of Directors. Under our
	limited liability company agreement, common unitholders that own 50 percent or more of our common units have the ability to request that cumulative voting be in effect for the election of
	elected directors. Cumulative voting is an irrevocable election that allows for the unitholder
	to allocate its votes cumulatively, rather than proportionally. Therefore, for so long as Transocean owns 50 percent or more of our common units, it will have the ability to request that
	cumulative voting be in effect for the election of elected directors, which would enable Transocean to elect one or more of the elected directors even after it owns less than 50 percent of our
	common units. As a result, if cumulative voting was in effect, Transocean would have the ability to appoint the majority of our board as long as it retains at least 20 percent of our common
	units. The directors appointed by Transocean may designate a member of the Board of Directors to be the chairman of the Board of Directors. Specific rights of the Transocean Member are designated in
	our second amended and restated limited liability company agreement.




	        We
	believe that our relationship with Transocean provides us with access to leading international energy companies, as well as suppliers and other key service providers for our industry.
	We also believe that Transocean's operational and managerial expertise enables us to compete more effectively for contract opportunities than other contract drilling companies similar in size to us.

	RISK FACTORS






	        Investing in our securities involves risk. You should consider the specific risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
	for the year ended December 31, 2014, the risk factors described under the caption "Risk Factors" in any applicable prospectus supplement and any risk factors set forth in our other filings
	with the SEC, pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, which are incorporated by reference into this prospectus, before making an investment decision. If any of these
	risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations and your investment in the securities could be adversely affected. See "Where You Can Find More Information" in this prospectus.
	You should also carefully review the cautionary statement in this prospectus referred to under "Forward-Looking Statements." Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing
	environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to
	which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. These risks could materially and adversely affect our
	business, financial condition or operating results and could result in a partial or complete loss of your investment.















	USE OF PROCEEDS






	        Except as may be otherwise set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement accompanying this prospectus, the net proceeds from the
	sale of the securities by us will be used for general corporate purposes, including:






	




	working capital;








	




	capital expenditures;








	




	acquisitions of or investments in businesses or assets;








	




	redemption and repayment of short-term or long-term borrowings; and








	




	purchases of our common units.






	        Pending
	application of the net proceeds, we may temporarily invest the net proceeds in short-term marketable securities.




	        Unless
	otherwise set forth in an accompanying prospectus supplement, we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our securities by Transocean.















	RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES






	        The following table presents our historical ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the six month period ended June 30, 2015 and
	for the year ended December 31, 2014. We have not presented the ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the annual periods prior to the completion of our formation entries and initial public
	offering, as the combined results of operations of the Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor (the "Predecessor") did not include any fixed charges, as defined.


































	 





	 





	Six months

	ended

	June 30,

	2015

	Historical ratio of earnings to fixed charges




	 




	 




	47.1x




	 




	 




	276.4x




	 










	        We
	have computed the ratios of earnings to fixed charges shown above by dividing earnings by fixed charges. For this purpose, "earnings" is the amount resulting from adding
	(a) income from continuing operations before income tax expense, (b) fixed charges, (c) amortization of capitalized




	5











	Table of Contents





	interest,
	and (d) distributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates; and then subtracting (a) capitalized interest, (b) equity in earnings or losses of incurred unconsolidated
	affiliates, and (c) the noncontrolling interest in pre-tax income of subsidiaries that have not incurred fixed charges. "Fixed charges" is the amount resulting from adding (a) interest
	expense, (b) amortization of debt discount or premium, (c) capitalized interest, and (d) an estimate of the interest component of rent expense. Interest expense excluded interest
	on unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, as such amounts are recognized income tax expense and are immaterial.




	        For
	the period prior to August 5, 2014, the date we completed our formation transactions and initial public offering, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is calculated based on
	the combined financial information of the Predecessor. The Predecessor represents 100 percent of the combined results of operations, assets and liabilities of the drilling units in the fleet
	(the "Predecessor Business"). Such combined financial information was derived from Transocean Ltd.'s accounting records and has been prepared as if the Predecessor Business had been combined
	for such period in the year ended December 31, 2014. The Predecessor did not incur fixed charges for the period prior to August 5, 2014.




	        Our
	ratios of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2014 are the same as
	the ratios of earnings to fixed charges because we had no preferred stock outstanding for any of the periods presented.















	DESCRIPTION OF UNITS REPRESENTING LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY INTERESTS






	        Set forth below is a summary description of the material terms of our limited liability company interests. For more information, please
	see our second amended and restated limited liability company agreement, which is incorporated by reference to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part as
	Exhibit 4.1 and referred to herein as our limited liability company agreement.






	General





	        The common units and general units represent limited liability company interests in us. The holders of common units are entitled to
	participate in company distributions and exercise the rights and privileges available to members under our limited liability company agreement, as may be amended from time to time, and the rights of
	the holders of general units will be determined prior to the offering of any such units and will be set forth in the prospectus supplement related to such offering and an amendment to our limited
	liability company agreement. For a description of the rights and privileges of members under our limited liability company agreement, including voting rights, please read "Our Limited Liability
	Company Agreement."










	Transfer Agent and Registrar








	Duties





	        Computershare Trust Company, N.A. serves as the registrar and transfer agent for the common units. We pay all fees charged by the
	transfer agent for transfers of common units, except the following, which must be paid by unitholders:






	




	surety bond premiums to replace lost or stolen certificates, taxes and other governmental charges;








	




	special charges for services requested by a holder of a common unit; and








	




	other similar fees or charges.






	        There
	is no charge to unitholders for disbursements of our cash distributions. We will indemnify the transfer agent, its agents and each of their stockholders, directors, officers and
	employees against all claims and losses that may arise out of acts performed or omitted for its activities in that capacity,




	6











	Table of Contents





	except
	for any liability due to any gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the indemnified person or entity.






	Resignation or Removal





	        The transfer agent may resign, by notice to us, or be removed by us. The resignation or removal of the transfer agent will become
	effective upon our appointment of a successor transfer agent and registrar and its acceptance of the appointment. If a successor has not been appointed or has not accepted its appointment within
	30 days after notice of the resignation or removal, the Transocean Member may, at the direction of our Board of Directors, act as the transfer agent and registrar until a successor is
	appointed.









	Description of Common Units





	        The common units represent limited liability company interests in us. The holders of common units are entitled to participate in
	company distributions and exercise the rights and privileges available to members under our limited liability company agreement. For a description of the rights and privileges of members under our
	limited liability company agreement, including voting rights, please read "Our Limited Liability Company Agreement."







	Transfer of Common Units






	        By transfer of common units in accordance with our limited liability company agreement, each transferee of common units will be
	admitted as a member with respect to the common units transferred when such transfer and admission is reflected in our books and records. Each transferee, with or without executing our limited
	liability company agreement:






	




	agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of our limited liability company agreement;








	




	represents that the transferee has the power, authority and capacity to enter into our limited liability company agreement; and








	




	gives the consents, acknowledgements and waivers contained in our limited liability company agreement.






	        We
	are entitled to treat the nominee holder of a common unit as the absolute owner in the event such nominee is the record holder of such common unit. In such case, the beneficial
	holder's rights are limited solely to those that it has against the nominee holder as a result of any agreement between the beneficial owner and the nominee holder.




	        Common
	units are securities and are transferable according to the laws governing the transfer of securities. Until a common unit has been transferred on our register, we and the transfer
	agent are entitled to treat the record holder of the common unit as the absolute owner, except as otherwise required by law or stock exchange regulations.









	Description of General Units





	        Our limited liability company agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited number of additional securities and rights to buy
	securities for the consideration and on the terms and conditions determined by our Board of Directors without the approval of the unitholders. It is possible that we will fund acquisitions through the
	issuance of general units or other equity securities, and we may issue general units or other equity securities for other purposes, subject to the terms of or limited liability company agreement. In
	addition, the issuance of additional units or other equity securities may dilute the value of the interests of the then-existing holders of units in our net assets. In accordance with Marshall Islands
	law and the provisions of our limited liability company agreement, we may also issue additional securities that, as determined by our Board of Directors, may have special voting rights to which the
	common units are not entitled. The Board of Directors may designate for each class or series of units

	Organization and Duration






	        We were organized on February 6, 2014 and have a perpetual existence.







	Purpose






	        Our purpose under our limited liability company agreement is to engage in any business activities that may lawfully be engaged in by a
	limited liability company pursuant to the Marshall Islands Limited Liability Company Act of 1996, which we refer to as the Marshall Islands Act.




	        Although
	our Board of Directors has the ability to cause us or our subsidiaries to engage in activities other than the provision of offshore drilling services, it has no current plans to
	do so and our limited liability company agreement provides that it may decline to do so free of any fiduciary duty or obligation whatsoever to us or the members, including any duty to act in the best
	interests of us or our members other than as may be required by law. Our Board of Directors has the authority to oversee and direct our operations, management and policies on an exclusive and
	irrevocable basis. Transocean provides executive officers for our benefit pursuant to agreements that we entered into with Transocean.







	Cash Distributions






	        Our limited liability company agreement specifies the manner in which we will make cash distributions to holders of our common units
	and other limited liability company interests, including to the holders of our incentive distribution rights. For a description of these cash distribution provisions, please read "Provisions of Our
	Limited Liability Company Agreement Relating to Cash Distributions."

	Capital Contributions






	        Unitholders are not obligated to make additional capital contributions, except as described below under "Limited
	Liability."







	Voting Rights






	        The following is a summary of the unitholder vote required for the approval of the matters specified below under "Action."
	Matters that need the approval of a "unit majority" require:






	




	during the subordination period, the approval of (i) a number of outstanding common units equal to or exceeding the sum of
	(1) a majority of the outstanding common units, plus (2) 50 percent of the number of outstanding common units held by the Transocean Member and its affiliates, voting as a single
	class, and (ii) a majority of the subordinated units, voting as a single class; and








	




	after the subordination period, the approval of a majority of the outstanding common units, voting as a single class.






	        In
	voting their common units and subordinated units the Transocean Member and its affiliates have no duty or obligation whatsoever to us or our members, including any duty to act in good
	faith or in the best interests of us or our members.




	        Each
	outstanding common unit is entitled to one vote on each matter subject to a vote of common unitholders except for voting for elected directors following the effective date of a
	cumulative voting request, as discussed below.




	        We
	hold a meeting of the unitholders every year to elect one or more members of our Board of Directors and to vote on any other matters that are properly brought before the meeting. Our
	Board of Directors currently consists of seven members. Pursuant to our limited liability company agreement, the Transocean Member has the right to appoint three directors to serve on our board and
	our common unitholders have the right to elect four directors. Holders of subordinated units are not entitled to vote in the election of directors.




	        The
	Transocean Member may, in its sole discretion, elect to classify the elected members of our Board of Directors by submitting written notice to our Board of Directors. Prior to the
	effective date of such election, which our limited liability company agreement calls the "Transocean classification election date," each elected director will serve for a term ending on the next
	succeeding annual meeting of the members. Following the Transocean classification election date, the elected directors will be divided into three classes: class I, class II and
	class III. Each elected director will serve for a term ending on the third succeeding annual meeting following the meeting at which directors of that class were elected, except that any elected
	director first designated as a class I director will serve for a term ending on the first succeeding annual meeting and any elected director first designated as a class II director will
	serve for a term ending on the second succeeding annual meeting. The determination of which elected directors initially will serve in which class will be made by the Board of Directors.




	        At
	any time, non-Transocean members that own 50% or more of the outstanding common units may request that cumulative voting be in effect for the election of elected directors, referred
	to in our limited liability company agreement as a "cumulative voting request." Following the effective date of a cumulative voting request, each holder of common units that are entitled to vote for
	elected directors will be entitled to cast as many votes as shall equal the number of votes which the holder would be entitled to cast for an election of elected directors absent cumulative voting
	multiplied by the number of elected directors to be elected. A holder entitled to so vote may cast all such votes for a single director, or for any two or more directors, as the holder sees fit.

	Applicable Law; Forum, Venue and Jurisdiction






	        Our limited liability company agreement is governed by Marshall Islands law. Our limited liability company agreement requires that any
	claims, suits, actions or proceedings:






	




	arising out of or relating in any way to our limited liability company agreement (including any claims, suits or actions to interpret,
	apply or enforce the provisions of our limited liability company agreement or the duties, obligations or liabilities among members or of members to us, or the rights or powers of, or restrictions on,
	the members or us),








	




	brought in a derivative manner on our behalf,








	




	asserting a claim of breach of duty (including a fiduciary duty) owed by any director, officer or other employee of us or the
	Transocean Member, or owed by the Transocean Member, to us or the members,








	




	asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Marshall Islands Act, or








	




	asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine,






	shall
	be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any other court located in the State of Delaware with
	subject matter jurisdiction), unless otherwise provided for by Marshall Islands law, regardless of whether such claims, suits, actions or proceedings sound in contract, tort, fraud or otherwise, are
	based on common law, statutory, equitable, legal or other grounds, or are derivative or direct claims. By purchasing a common unit, a member is irrevocably consenting to these limitations and
	provisions regarding claims, suits, actions or proceedings and submitting to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or such other Delaware courts) in connection
	with any such claims, suits, actions or proceedings. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies' certificates of incorporation or similar governing documents have been
	challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any action, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our limited liability company agreement to be
	inapplicable or unenforceable in such action.







	Limited Liability






	        Under the Marshall Islands Act, a limited liability company may not make a distribution to a member if, after the distribution, all
	liabilities of the limited liability company, other than liabilities to members on account of their limited liability company interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited
	to specific property of the limited liability company, would exceed the fair value of the assets of the limited liability company. For the purpose of determining the fair value of the assets of a
	limited liability company, the Marshall Islands Act provides that the fair value of property subject to liability for which recourse of creditors is limited shall be included in the
	assets of the limited liability company only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that liability. The




	11











	Table of Contents





	Marshall
	Islands Act provides that a member who receives a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the Marshall Islands Act shall be liable to
	the limited liability company for the amount of the distribution for three years (unless within such period an action is commenced to recover the distribution). Under the Marshall Islands Act, a
	purchaser of units who becomes a member of a limited liability company is liable for the obligations of the transferor to make contributions to the company, except that the transferee is not obligated
	for liabilities unknown to him at the time he became a member and that could not be ascertained from the limited liability company agreement.




	        Our
	subsidiaries conduct business in several jurisdictions, and we may have subsidiaries that conduct business in other jurisdictions in the future. Maintenance of our limited liability
	may require compliance with legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which we and our subsidiaries conduct business, which may include qualifying to do business in those jurisdictions.




	        Limitations
	on the liability of members for the obligations of a limited liability company have not been clearly established in many jurisdictions. If, by virtue of our equity interests
	in our subsidiaries or otherwise, it were determined that we were conducting business in any jurisdiction without compliance with the applicable limited liability company or similar statute, or that
	the right or exercise of the right by the members as a group to remove or replace the Transocean Member, to approve some amendments to our limited liability company agreement, or to take other action
	under our limited liability company agreement constituted "participation in the control" of our business for purposes of the statutes of any relevant jurisdiction, then the members could be held
	personally liable for our obligations under the law of that jurisdiction. We will continue to operate in a manner that our Board of Directors considers reasonable and necessary or appropriate to
	preserve the limited liability of the members.







	Issuance of Additional Interests






	        Our limited liability company agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited amount of additional limited liability company interests
	and options, rights and warrants to buy limited liability company interests for the consideration and on the terms and conditions determined by our Board of Directors without the approval of the
	unitholders.




	        It
	is possible that we will fund acquisitions through the issuance of additional common units, subordinated units or other equity securities and the issuance of debt securities. Holders
	of any additional common units we issue will be entitled to share equally with the then-existing holders of common units in our distributions of available cash. In addition, the issuance of additional
	common units or other equity securities interests may dilute the value of the interests of the then-existing holders of common units in our net assets.




	        In
	accordance with Marshall Islands law and the provisions of our limited liability company agreement, we may also issue additional limited liability company interests that, as
	determined by our Board of Directors, have special voting rights to which the common units are not entitled. In addition, our limited liability agreement does not prohibit the issuance by our
	subsidiaries of equity interests, which may effectively rank senior to the common units.




	        The
	Transocean Member and its affiliates will have the right, which it may from time to time assign in whole or in part to any of its affiliates, to purchase common units, subordinated
	units or other equity securities whenever, and on the same terms that, we issue those securities to persons other than the Transocean Member and its affiliates, to the extent necessary to maintain its
	and its affiliates' percentage interest, including its interest represented by common units and subordinated units, that existed immediately prior to each issuance. The other holders of common units
	will not have similar preemptive rights to acquire additional common units or other limited liability company interests.

	Tax Status






	        Our limited liability company agreement provides that the company will be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes.







	Amendment of our Limited Liability Company Agreement








	General





	        Amendments to our limited liability company agreement may be proposed only by or with the consent of our Board of Directors. However,
	our Board of Directors does not have any duty or obligation to propose any amendment and our limited liability company agreement provides that it may decline to do so free of any duty or obligation
	whatsoever to us or our members or any other person or entity, including, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any duty to act in good faith or in the best interests of us or the
	members. In order to adopt a proposed amendment, other than the amendments discussed below, approval of our Board of Directors, the Transocean Member and a unit majority is required.






	Prohibited Amendments





	        No amendment may be made that would:





	        (1)   enlarge
	the obligations of any member without its consent, unless approved by at least a majority of the type or class of limited liability company interests so
	affected; or




	        (2)   enlarge
	the obligations of, restrict in any way any action by or rights of, or reduce in any way the amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise payable by us to
	the Transocean Member or any of its affiliates without the consent of the Transocean Member, which may be given or withheld at its option.





	        The
	provision of our limited liability company agreement preventing the amendments having the effects described in clauses (1) and (2) above can be amended upon the
	approval of the holders of at least 90 percent of the outstanding units voting together as a single class (including units owned by the Transocean Member and its affiliates).






	No Unitholder Approval





	        Our Board of Directors may generally make amendments to our limited liability company agreement with the approval of the Transocean
	Member but without the approval of any other member to reflect:






	

	




	the admission, substitution, withdrawal or removal of members in accordance with our limited liability company agreement;








	

	limited liability company or an entity in which the members have limited liability under the laws of any jurisdiction;








	




	a change in our fiscal year or taxable year and related changes;








	




	an amendment that is necessary, upon the advice of our counsel, to prevent us or our officers or directors or the Transocean Member or
	their or its directors, officers, trustees or agents from in any manner being subjected to the provisions of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, the U.S. Investment Advisors Act of 1940, or "plan
	asset" regulations adopted under the U.S.

	any class or series of membership interests pursuant to our limited liability company agreement;








	

	modification of the incentive distribution rights made in connection with the issuance of additional limited liability company interests or rights to acquire limited liability company interests,
	provided that, any such modifications and related issuance of limited liability company interests have received approval by a majority of the members of the conflicts committee of our Board of
	Directors;








	




	any amendment expressly permitted in our limited liability company agreement to be made by our Board of Directors acting alone;

	        In
	addition, our Board of Directors may make amendments to our limited liability company agreement with the approval of the Transocean Member, but without the approval of any other
	member, if our Board of Directors determines that those amendments:






	




	do not adversely affect the members (or any particular class of members) in any material respect;








	




	are necessary or appropriate to satisfy any requirements, conditions, or guidelines contained in any opinion, directive, order, ruling

	liability company agreement or are otherwise contemplated by our limited liability company agreement.

	Table of Contents







	Opinion of Counsel and Unitholder Approval





	        Our Board of Directors will not be required to obtain an opinion of counsel that an amendment will not result in a loss of limited
	liability to the members if one of the amendments described above under "Amendment of our Limited Liability Company AgreementNo Unitholder Approval" should occur. No other
	amendments to our limited liability company agreement will become effective without the approval of holders of at least 90 percent of the outstanding units voting as a single class unless we
	obtain an opinion of counsel to the effect that the amendment will not affect the limited liability under applicable law of any of our members.




	        In
	addition to the above restrictions, any amendment that would have a material adverse effect on the rights or preferences of any type or class of outstanding units in relation to other
	classes of units will require the approval of at least a majority of the type or class of units so affected. Any amendment that reduces the voting percentage required to take any action must be
	approved by the written consent or affirmative vote of members whose aggregate outstanding units constitute not less than the voting requirement sought to be reduced.







	Merger, Sale, Conversion or Other Disposition of Assets






	        A merger, consolidation or conversion of us requires the approval of our Board of Directors and the Transocean Member, and in declining
	to consent to a merger, consolidation or conversion, our Board of Directors may act in its sole discretion to the fullest extent permitted by law. In addition, our limited liability company agreement
	generally prohibits our Board of Directors, without the prior approval of the holders of at least a unit majority, from causing us to, among other things, sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or
	substantially all of our assets, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, including by way of merger, consolidation or other combination or sale of ownership
	interests in our subsidiaries. Our Board of Directors may, however, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in all or substantially all of our assets without the prior approval of a
	unit majority. Our Board of Directors may also determine to sell all or substantially all of our assets under a foreclosure or other realization upon those encumbrances without the approval of a unit
	majority. Finally, our Board of Directors may consummate any merger with another limited liability entity without the prior approval of our unitholders if we are the surviving entity in the
	transaction, our Board of Directors has received an opinion of counsel regarding limited liability and tax matters, the transaction would not result in an amendment to our limited liability agreement
	requiring unitholder approval, each of our units will be an identical unit of our company following the transaction, and the membership interests to be issued by us in such merger do not exceed
	20 percent of our outstanding membership interests (other than incentive distribution rights) immediately prior to the transaction.




	        If
	conditions specified in our limited liability company agreement are satisfied, our Board of Directors, may, without any vote of unitholders, convert us or any of our subsidiaries into
	a new limited liability entity or merge us or any of our subsidiaries into, or convey some or all of our assets to, a newly formed entity if the sole purpose of that merger or conveyance is to effect
	a mere change in our legal form into another limited liability entity. The unitholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights of appraisal under our limited liability company agreement or applicable
	law in the event of a conversion, merger or consolidation, a sale of substantially all of our assets, or any other similar transaction or event.







	Special Vote Required for Combinations with Interested Unitholders






	        Our limited liability company agreement includes a provision that is based upon the Delaware law regarding business combinations. This
	provision provides that, in general, we may not engage in a




	15











	Table of Contents





	business
	combination with an interested unitholder for a period of three years after the time of the transaction in which the person became an interested unitholder.




	        The
	prohibition on business combinations with interested unitholders does not apply in some cases, including if:






	




	our Board of Directors, prior to the time of the transaction in which the person became an interested unitholder, approves
	(1) the business combination or (2) the transaction which resulted in such person becoming an interested unitholder;








	




	upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in such person becoming an interested unitholder, the interested unitholder owned
	at least 85 percent of the voting units of the company at the time the transaction commenced; or








	




	the business combination is approved by the Board of Directors and authorized at an annual meeting or special meeting of unitholders,
	and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66

	2

	/

	3

	% of the outstanding voting units of the company, voting as a single class, which are not owned by the interested
	unitholder.






	        As
	defined in our limited liability company agreement, an interested member generally includes any person that is the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting units of the company
	or (ii) that is an affiliate or associate of the company and was the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting units at any time within the three-year period immediately prior to the date
	on which it is sought to be determined whether such person is an interested unitholder, and also the affiliates and associates of such person; provided, however, that the term interested unitholder
	does not include (a) the Transocean Member, any Transocean Direct Transferee (as defined below), any Transocean Indirect Transferee (as
	defined below) or any of their respective affiliates or successors or any "group" (as such term is used in Rule 13d-5 of the Exchange Act, or Rule 13d-5) or any member of any such
	"group;" (b) any person whose ownership of voting units in excess of the 15% limitation is the result of (i) action taken solely by the company or (ii) the conversion of the
	combined interest; provided that such person will be an interested unitholder if thereafter such person acquires additional voting units, except as a result of (x) further corporate action not
	caused, directly or indirectly, by such person or (y) the exercise of the limited preemptive right under our limited liability company agreement; or (c) any person to the extent its
	ownership is attributable to that person's participation in as a bona fide underwriter in an offering of units. For the purpose of determining whether a person is an interested unitholder, the voting
	units deemed to be in issue will include voting units deemed to be owned by the person (through the application of the definition of "owner" (as defined in our limited liability company agreement))
	but shall not include any other unissued voting units which may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options, or
	otherwise.




	        "Transocean
	Direct Transferee" means any person that acquires (in a transaction in which the Transocean Member or any affiliate or successor or any "group" as such term is used in
	Rule 13d-5 or any member of any such "group" assigns its rights (with respect to the units transferred in the transaction) to not be deemed to be an interested unitholder) directly from either
	the Transocean Member or any of its affiliates or successors or any "group" (as such term is used in Rule 13d-5), or any member of any such "group," beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the
	then outstanding voting units.




	        "Transocean
	Indirect Transferee" means any person that acquires (in a transaction in which a Transocean Direct Transferee or any affiliate or successor or any "group" as such term is
	used in Rule 13d-5 or any member of any such "group" assigns its rights (with respect to the units transferred in the transaction) to not be deemed to be an interested unitholder) directly from
	any Transocean Direct Transferee or any other Transocean Indirect Transferee beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then outstanding voting units.

	        "Voting Units" means, with respect to the company or any other entity that is not a corporation, any equity interest entitled to vote generally in the election of
	directors or any other governing body of such entity, but with respect to the company, does not include the Transocean Member Interest, and means, with respect to any corporation, stock of any class
	or series entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Every reference above to a percentage of voting units refers to such percentage of the votes of such voting units.




	        Although
	our limited liability company agreement contains the provisions described above, under the Marshall Islands Act there is generally no prohibition on business combinations with
	interested unitholders.







	Termination and Dissolution






	        We will continue as a limited liability company until terminated or converted under our limited liability company agreement. We will
	dissolve:





	        (1)   upon
	the election of our Board of Directors to dissolve us, if approved by the holders of units representing a unit majority;




	        (2)   except
	as otherwise permitted by our limited liability company agreement or the Marshall Islands Act, at any time there are no members;




	        (3)   upon
	the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of us pursuant to the Marshall Islands Act; or




	        (4)   upon
	the withdrawal or removal of the Transocean Member or any successor to the Transocean Member interest or any other event that results in its ceasing to be the
	Transocean Member other than by reason of a transfer of the Transocean Member interest in accordance with our limited liability company agreement or withdrawal or removal following approval and
	admission of a successor.





	        Upon
	a dissolution under clause (4), the holders of a unit majority may also elect, within specific time limitations, to continue our business on the same terms and conditions
	described in our limited liability company agreement by appointing an entity to hold the Transocean Member interest that is approved by the holders of units representing a unit majority.







	Liquidation and Distribution of Proceeds






	        Upon our dissolution, unless we are continued as a new limited liability company, the liquidator authorized to wind up our affairs,
	acting with all of the powers of our Board of Directors that are necessary or appropriate, will liquidate our assets and apply the proceeds of the liquidation as provided in "Provisions of Our Limited
	Liability Company Agreement Cash DistributionsDistributions of Cash Upon Liquidation." The liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of our assets for a reasonable period or
	distribute assets to members in kind if it determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to our members.







	Withdrawal or Removal of the Transocean Member






	        The holder of the Transocean Member interest is Transocean Partners Holdings Limited. When we refer in this prospectus to "removal" or
	"withdrawal" of the Transocean Member, technically, we are referring to the termination of the rights of the Transocean Member. For example, if at the time of any such removal or withdrawal, the
	Transocean Member owns common units, following any such removal or withdrawal, the Transocean Member would technically continue to be a member owning common units. It would not, however, continue to
	be the Transocean Member we refer to in this prospectus, since it would no longer have the rights that make it the Transocean Member.

	Table of Contents





	        Except
	as described below, the Transocean Member has agreed not to withdraw voluntarily prior to June 30, 2024, without obtaining the approval of the holders of at least a
	majority of the outstanding common units, excluding common units held by the Transocean Member and its affiliates, and furnishing an opinion of counsel regarding limited liability. On or after
	June 30, 2024, the Transocean Member may withdraw without first obtaining approval of any unitholder by giving 90 days' written notice, and that withdrawal will not constitute a
	violation of our limited liability company agreement. Notwithstanding the information above, the Transocean Member may withdraw without unitholder approval upon 90 days' notice to the members
	if at least 50 percent of the outstanding units are held or controlled by one person and its affiliates other than the Transocean Member and its affiliates. In addition, our limited liability
	company agreement permits the Transocean Member to sell or otherwise transfer all of its Transocean Member interest in us without the approval of the unitholders. Please read "Transfer of
	Transocean Member Interest" and "Transfer of Incentive Distribution Rights."




	        Upon
	withdrawal of the Transocean Member under any circumstances, other than as a result of a transfer by the Transocean Member of all or a part of its Transocean Member interest in us,
	the holders of a majority of the outstanding common units and subordinated units, voting as separate classes, may select a successor to that withdrawing member. If a successor is not elected, we will
	be dissolved, wound up and liquidated, unless within a specified period of time after that withdrawal, the holders of a unit majority agree in writing to continue our business and to appoint a
	successor member that will have the rights held by the Transocean Member. Please read "Termination and Dissolution."




	        The
	Transocean Member may not be removed unless that removal is approved by the vote of the holders of not less than 66

	2

	/

	3

	 percent of the outstanding common and
	subordinated units, including units
	held by the Transocean Member and its affiliates, voting together as a single class. The ownership of more than 33

	1

	/

	3

	 percent of the outstanding units by the Transocean Member
	and its affiliates or controlling our Board of Directors would provide the practical ability to prevent the Transocean Member's removal. Any removal of the Transocean Member is also subject to the
	successor to the Transocean Member being approved by a unit majority.




	        Our
	limited liability company agreement also provides that if the Transocean Member is removed under circumstances where cause does not exist and units held by the Transocean Member and
	its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal:






	




	the subordination period will end and all outstanding subordinated units will immediately convert into common units on a one-for-one
	basis;








	




	any existing arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units will be extinguished;








	




	the Transocean Member will have the right to convert its Transocean Member interest into common units or to receive cash in exchange
	for such interest in accordance with the procedures set forth in our limited liability company agreement; and








	




	the holders of the incentive distribution rights (currently, the Transocean Member) will have the right to convert the incentive
	distribution rights it owns into common units or to receive cash in exchange for those interests.






	        In
	the event of removal of the Transocean Member under circumstances where cause exists or withdrawal of the Transocean Member where that withdrawal violates our limited liability
	company agreement, a successor member that will own the Transocean Member interest will have the option to purchase the Transocean Member interest and incentive distribution rights owned by such
	departing member that owned the Transocean Member interest for a cash payment equal to the fair market value of those interests. Under all other circumstances where the member that has the rights of
	the
	Transocean Member withdraws or is removed by the members, such departing member that owned the Transocean Member interest will have the option to require the successor member to purchase the




	18











	Table of Contents





	Transocean
	Member interest of such departing member that owned the Transocean Member interest and its incentive distribution rights for their fair market value. In each case, this fair market value
	will be determined by agreement between the departing member that owned the Transocean Member interest and the successor member that will own the Transocean Member interest. If no agreement is
	reached, an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert selected by the departing member that owned the Transocean Member interest and the successor member that will own the
	Transocean Member interest will determine the fair market value. Or, if the departing member that owned the Transocean Member interest and the successor member that will own the Transocean Member
	interest cannot agree upon an expert, then an expert chosen by agreement of the experts selected by each of them will determine the fair market value.




	        If
	the option described above is not exercised by either the departing member that owned the Transocean Member interest or the successor member that will own the Transocean Member
	interest, the departing member's Transocean Member interest and its incentive distribution rights will automatically convert into common units equal to the fair market value of those interests as
	determined by an investment banking firm or other independent expert selected in the manner described in the preceding paragraph.




	        In
	addition, we will be required to reimburse the departing member that owned the Transocean Member interest for all amounts due to such departing member, including, without limitation,
	any employee-related liabilities, including severance liabilities, incurred for the termination of any employees employed by such departing member or its affiliates for our benefit.







	Transfer of Transocean Member Interest






	        The Transocean Member and its affiliates may at any time transfer its Transocean Member interest and all or any portion of common units
	or subordinated units to one or more persons, without unitholder approval.







	Transfer of Ownership Interests in the Transocean Member






	        At any time, the members of the Transocean Member may sell or transfer all or part of their respective limited liability company
	interests in the Transocean Member to an affiliate or a third party without the approval of our unitholders.







	Transfer of Incentive Distribution Rights






	        At any time, the Transocean Member may sell or transfer its incentive distribution rights to an affiliate or third party without the
	approval of our unitholders.










	Change of Management Provisions






	        Our limited liability company agreement contains specific provisions that are intended to discourage a person or group from attempting
	to remove the Transocean Member or otherwise change management. For example, our limited liability company agreement provides that if the Transocean Member is removed under circumstances where cause
	does not exist and units held by the Transocean Member and its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal:






	




	the subordination period will end and all outstanding subordinated units will immediately convert into common units on a one-for-one
	basis;








	




	any existing arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units will be extinguished;






	19











	Table of Contents







	




	the Transocean Member will have the right to convert its Transocean Member interest into common units or to receive cash in exchange
	for such interest in accordance with the procedures set forth in our limited liability company agreement; and








	




	the holders of the incentive distribution rights (currently, the Transocean Member) will have the right to convert its incentive
	distribution rights into common units or to receive cash in exchange for those interests.









	Limited Call Right






	        If at any time the Transocean Member and its affiliates hold more than 80 percent of the then-issued and outstanding limited
	liability company interests of any class, the Transocean Member will have the right, which it may assign in whole or in part to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all,
	of the remaining limited liability company interests of the class held by unaffiliated persons as of a record date to be selected by the Transocean Member, on at least 10 but not more than
	60 days' notice, at a price equal to the greater of (x) the average of the daily closing prices of the limited liability company interests of such class over the 20 trading days
	preceding the date three days before the notice of exercise of the call right is first mailed and (y) the highest price paid by the Transocean Member or any of its affiliates for limited
	liability company interests of such class during the 90-day period preceding the date such notice is first mailed. The Transocean Member is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion, nor will the
	unitholders be entitled to dissenter's rights of appraisal, regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon the exercise of this limited call right and has no fiduciary duty in
	determining whether to exercise this limited call right.




	        As
	a result of the Transocean Member's right to purchase outstanding limited liability company interests, a holder of limited liability company interests may have the holder's limited
	liability company interests purchased at an undesirable time or price. Please read "Risk FactorsRisks Inherent in an Investment in UsThe Transocean Member has a limited call
	right that
	may require you to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price" contained in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
	2014.







	Board of Directors






	        Under our limited liability company agreement, our Board of Directors has the authority to oversee and direct our operations, policies
	and management on an exclusive and irrevocable basis. Our Board of Directors also has the authority to construe and interpret our limited liability company agreement and to act upon any such
	construction or interpretation. Any such construction or interpretation of our limited liability company agreement by our Board of Directors and any action taken pursuant thereto and any determination
	made by our Board of Directors in good faith will, in each case, be conclusive and binding for all purposes.




	        Our
	Board of Directors currently consists of seven directors, three of whom are appointed by the Transocean Member, in its sole discretion (the "appointed directors"), and four of whom
	are elected by our common unitholders at the annual meeting, the elected directors. Each appointed director serves until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier
	death, resignation or removal and each elected director has been elected for a term ending at the next annual meeting in 2016 or until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified
	or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.




	        The
	Transocean Member may remove an appointed board member with or without cause at any time. "Cause," with respect to a director, generally means a court's finding such director or
	officer liable for actual fraud or willful misconduct and with respect to the Transocean Member. Any and all of the board members appointed by the Transocean Member may be removed for cause at a
	properly called meeting of the members by a majority vote of the outstanding units, voting as a single class. If




	20











	Table of Contents





	any
	appointed board member is removed, resigns or is otherwise unable to serve as a board member, the Transocean Member may fill the vacancy. Any and all of the board members elected by the common
	unitholders may be removed at any time for cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of the other board members or at a properly called meeting of the members by a majority vote of the outstanding
	common units. If any elected board member is removed, resigns or is otherwise unable to serve as a board member, the vacancy may be filled by a majority of the other elected board members then
	serving.







	Meetings; Voting






	        Unitholders who are record holders of units on the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, meetings of our members and
	to act upon matters for which approvals may be solicited.




	        We
	are required to hold a meeting of the members every year to elect one or more members of our Board of Directors and to vote on any other matters that are properly brought before the
	meeting. Any action that is required or permitted to be taken by the unitholders may be taken either at a meeting of the unitholders or, if authorized by the Board of Directors, without a meeting if
	consents in writing describing the action so taken are signed by holders of the number of units necessary to authorize or take that action at a meeting. Meetings of the unitholders may be called by
	our Board of Directors or by unitholders owning at least 20 percent of the outstanding units of the class for which a meeting is proposed. Unitholders may vote either in person or by proxy at
	meetings. The holders of 33

	1

	/

	3

	 percent of the outstanding units of the class or classes for which a meeting has been called, represented in person or by proxy, constitute a
	quorum unless any action by the unitholders requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of the units, in which case the quorum will be the greater percentage.




	        Each
	record holder of a unit may vote according to the holder's percentage interest in us, although additional limited liability company interests having special voting rights could be
	issued. Please read "Issuance of Additional Interests." Units held in nominee or street name account are voted by the broker or other nominee in accordance with the instruction of the
	beneficial owner, unless the arrangement between the beneficial owner and his nominee provides otherwise. Except as our limited liability company agreement otherwise provides, subordinated units vote
	together with common units as a single class.




	        Any
	notice, demand, request report, or proxy material required or permitted to be given or made to record holders of common units under our limited liability company agreement will be
	delivered to the record holder by us or by the transfer agent.







	Voting Rights of Incentive Distribution Rights






	        For so long as a majority of the incentive distribution rights are held by the Transocean Member, the holders of the incentive
	distribution rights will not be entitled to vote such incentive distribution rights except as may otherwise be required by law. The holders of the incentive
	distribution rights, in their capacity as such, will be deemed to have approved any matter approved by the Transocean Member.




	        If
	less than a majority of the incentive distribution rights are held by the Transocean Member, the incentive distribution rights will be entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a
	vote of unitholders, other than (i) the election of elected directors and (ii) amendments and other matters that our Board of Directors determines do not adversely affect the holders of
	the incentive distribution rights as a whole in any material respect. On any matter in which the holders of incentive distribution rights are entitled to vote, such holders will vote together with the
	subordinated units, prior to the end of the subordination period, or together with the common units, thereafter, in either case as a single class. The incentive distribution rights will be treated in
	all respects as subordinated units or common units,




	21











	Table of Contents





	as
	applicable, when sending notices of a meeting, calculating required votes, determining the presence of a quorum or for other similar purposes under our limited liability company agreement. The
	relative voting power of the incentive distribution rights and the subordinated units or common units, as applicable, will be set in the same proportion as cumulative cash distributions, if any, in
	respect of the incentive distribution rights for the four consecutive quarters prior to the record date for the vote bears to the cumulative cash distributions in respect of such class of units for
	such four quarters.







	Status as Member






	        Except as described above under "Limited Liability," the common units are fully paid, and unitholders are not required to
	make additional contributions. By transfer of common units in accordance with our limited liability company agreement, each transferee of such units will be admitted as a member with respect to the
	units transferred when such transfer and admission is reflected in our books and records. The terms of the general units will be set forth in the prospectus supplement related to the sale of such
	general units.









	Indemnification






	        Under our limited liability company agreement, in most circumstances, we will indemnify each of the following persons, to the fullest
	extent permitted by law, from and against all losses, claims, damages or similar events arising by reason of such person's status as such:





	        (1)   the
	Transocean Member or any successor owning the Transocean Member interest;




	        (2)   any
	departing member owning the Transocean Member interest;




	        (3)   any
	person who is or was an affiliate of the Transocean Member or any departing member owning the Transocean Member interest;




	        (4)   any
	person who is or was an officer, director, member, fiduciary or trustee of any entity described in (1), (2) or (3) above;




	        (5)   any
	person who is or was serving as a director, officer, member, fiduciary or trustee of another person at the request of our Board of Directors, the Transocean Member
	or any departing member owning the Transocean Member interest;




	        (6)   any
	person designated by our Board of Directors; and




	        (7)   the
	members of our Board of Directors and our officers.





	        Any
	indemnification under these provisions will only be out of our assets. Unless it otherwise agrees, the Transocean Member or any departing member owning the Transocean Member interest
	will not be personally liable for or have any obligation to contribute or lend funds or assets to us to enable us to effectuate indemnification. We may purchase insurance against liabilities asserted
	against and expenses incurred by persons for our activities, regardless of whether we would have the power to indemnify the person against liabilities under our limited liability company agreement.







	Reimbursement of Expenses






	        Our limited liability company agreement requires us to reimburse the members of our Board of Directors for their out-of-pocket costs
	and expenses incurred in the course of their service to us. Our limited liability company agreement also requires us to reimburse the Transocean Member or any departing member owning the Transocean
	Member interest for all expenses it incurs or payments it makes on our behalf and all other expenses allocable to us or otherwise incurred by such member in connection with acting in its role as the
	Transocean Member. These expenses include expenses allocated to us or such member by our Board of Directors.

	Table of Contents








	Books and Reports






	        We keep appropriate books and records of our business. The books are maintained for financial reporting purposes on an accrual basis.
	For tax and fiscal reporting purposes, our fiscal year is the calendar year.




	        We
	are required to furnish or make available to record holders of common units, within 105 days after the close of each fiscal year, an annual report containing audited financial
	statements and a report on those financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm. Except for our fourth quarter, we are required to also furnish or make available summary
	financial information within 50 days after the close of each quarter.







	Right to Inspect Our Books and Records






	        Our limited liability company agreement provides that a member can, for a purpose reasonably related to his interest as a member, upon
	reasonable written demand stating the
	purpose of such demand and at the member's own expense, have furnished to the member:






	




	a current list of the name and last known address of each member;








	




	copies of our limited liability company agreement, the certificate of formation of the company and related amendments; and








	




	certain information regarding the status of our business and financial condition.






	        Our
	Board of Directors may, and intends to, keep confidential from the members, trade secrets or other information the disclosure of which our Board of Directors believes in good faith
	is not in our best interests or that we are required by law or by agreements with third parties to keep confidential.







	Registration Rights






	        Under our limited liability company agreement, we have agreed to register for resale under the Securities Act and applicable state
	securities laws any common units, subordinated units or other limited liability company interests proposed to be sold by any holder or holders of at least 25% of the outstanding interests, other than
	the Transocean Member interest. We are obligated to pay all expenses incidental to the registration, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions and fees and expenses of counsel and advisors of
	any selling unitholders.

	DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES






	        This section describes the general terms and provisions of the debt securities. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the
	specific terms of the debt securities offered by that prospectus supplement and any general terms outlined in this section that will not apply to those debt securities.




	        Any
	debt securities will be our senior obligations and may be issued in one or more series. We will issue the debt securities under an indenture between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National
	Association, as trustee, which we refer to as the "indenture." As used in this prospectus, "debt securities" means the debentures, notes, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness that we issue and
	the trustee authenticates and delivers under the indenture. The indenture and all debt securities issued under the indenture will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
	of New York. Additionally, the indenture is subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.




	        We
	have summarized selected terms and provisions of the indenture in this section. We have also incorporated by reference the indenture as an exhibit to the registration statement of
	which this
	prospectus forms a part. You should read the indenture for additional information before you buy any debt securities. See "Where You Can Find More Information" for information on how to obtain
	copies of the indenture. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this summary have the meanings specified in the indenture.






	General





	        The debt securities will rank equally and ratably with our other senior debt obligations. Any unsecured debt securities will rank
	junior to all of our secured debt (including any debt securities issued hereunder that may be secured) to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured debt. We currently do not have
	any secured or unsecured debt outstanding.




	        We
	are not limited as to the amount of debt securities that we can issue under the indenture. We may issue debt securities under the indenture in one or more series, each with different
	terms, up to the aggregate principal amount which we may authorize from time to time.




	        A
	prospectus supplement relating to a series of debt securities being offered will include specific terms relating to that offering. These terms will include some or all of the
	following:






	




	the title and type of the debt securities;








	




	the total principal amount of debt securities of that series that are authorized and outstanding as of the most recent date;








	




	any limit on the total principal amount of the debt securities;








	




	the price at which the debt securities will be issued;








	




	the date or dates on which the principal of and premium, if any, on the debt securities will be payable;








	




	the maturity date of the debt securities;








	




	the minimum denominations in which the debt securities will be issued;








	




	if the debt securities will bear interest;








	




	the interest rate on the debt securities or the method of calculating the interest rate;








	




	the date from which interest will accrue;








	




	the record and interest payment dates for the debt securities;








	




	the first interest payment date;






	24











	Table of Contents







	




	the place or places at which the principal or premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the debt securities will be paid;








	




	any optional redemption provisions that would permit us or the holders of the debt securities to elect redemption of the debt
	securities prior to their final maturity;








	




	any sinking fund or mandatory redemption or retirement provisions that would obligate us to redeem the debt securities prior to their
	final maturity;








	




	the currency or currencies in which the debt securities will be denominated and payable, if other than U.S. dollars;








	




	any provisions that would permit us or the holders of the debt securities to elect the currency or currencies in which the debt
	securities are paid;








	




	the portion of the principal amount of the debt securities that will be payable upon declaration or acceleration of maturity of the
	debt securities (if other than the principal amount of the debt securities);








	




	whether the provisions described under the heading "Defeasance of the Indenture and the Securities" below apply to the debt
	securities;








	




	whether the provisions of some or all of the covenants described under the heading "Restrictive Covenants" below apply to the debt
	securities;








	




	any changes to or additional Events of Default (as defined under the heading "Events of Default" below) or covenants;








	




	whether the debt securities will be issued in whole or in part in the form of global securities and, if so, the depositary for those
	global securities;








	




	any special tax implications of the debt securities;








	




	whether the debt securities are convertible or exchangeable into our common units or other equity securities and the terms and
	conditions upon which such conversion or exchange shall be effected; and








	




	any other terms of the debt securities.






	        If
	the purchase price of any debt securities is denominated in a foreign currency or composite currency, or if the principal of or any premium or interest on any debt securities is
	payable in a foreign currency or composite currency, we will include the restrictions, elections, tax consequences, specific terms and other information with respect to the debt securities and the
	applicable foreign currency or composite currency in the applicable prospectus supplement.




	        The
	particular terms of a series of debt securities will be set forth in an officers' certificate or supplemental indenture, and described in the applicable prospectus supplement. We
	urge you to read the applicable indenture as supplemented by any officers' certificate or supplemental indenture that is applicable to you because that indenture, as supplemented, and not this
	section, defines your rights as a holder of the debt securities.






	Guarantees





	        Our payment obligations under any series of debt securities may be guaranteed by one or more of our direct or indirect subsidiaries. If
	a series of debt securities is so guaranteed, the guarantors will execute a supplemental indenture or notation of guarantee as further evidence of their guarantee. The applicable prospectus supplement
	will describe the terms of any guarantee. It is possible that a series of debt securities is guaranteed by our subsidiaries and that other series are not.




	25











	Table of Contents





	        The
	obligations of each guarantor under its guarantee may be limited to the maximum amount that will not result in such guarantee obligations constituting a fraudulent conveyance or
	fraudulent transfer under federal or state law, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of that subsidiary and any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any
	other guarantor in respect to its obligations under its guarantee.






	Covenants





	        The debt securities shall be subject to, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to the benefits of, certain covenants
	including:






	




	a requirement to maintain an office or agency in the place of payment designated in any such debt securities;








	




	a requirement to maintain our corporate existence and rights and franchises;



	provided



	,



	however



	, that we shall not be required to preserve any such rights and franchises if our Board of Directors determines that the preservation thereof is
	no longer necessary or desirable in the conduct of our business;








	




	a requirement to maintain our properties;








	




	a requirement to deliver a compliance certificate within 120 days of each of our fiscal years;








	




	a requirement to deliver to the trustee annual reports and other information, documents and reports which we are required to file
	pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended






	        The
	prospectus supplement will describe any additional covenants of which the debt securities of such issue shall be subject and entitled, if any.






	Consolidation, Merger, Conveyance, Transfer or Lease





	        Unless otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement for a series of debt securities, the Company may not consolidate or
	merge with or into, or transfer or lease its assets substantially as an entirety to, any entity, unless:






	




	the Company is the surviving entity or, if not, the successor entity formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged
	or which acquires or leases the Company's assets expressly assumes the Company's obligations with respect to the debt securities and under the Indenture;








	




	no default or event of default exists or will occur immediately after giving effect to the transaction; and








	




	the Company has delivered to the trustee the certificates and opinions required under the Indenture.








	Collateral Security





	        A series of debt securities may be secured by collateral pledged by us or one or more of our direct or indirect securities. If a series
	of debt securities is so secured, additional security documentation in favor of the trustee shall be executed in connection with the issuance of such securities. The applicable prospectus supplement
	will describe the collateral security and the terms of the security documentation.




	26











	Table of Contents







	Event of Default





	        Unless otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement for a series of debt securities, the following are events of default
	under the Indenture with respect to any series of debt securities:






	




	failure to pay any installment of interest on such series of debt securities when due and the continuance of such failure for
	30 days;








	




	failure to pay principal of, or premium, if any, on such series of debt securities when due;








	




	failure to deposit any sinking fund payment with respect to such series of debt securities when due, and the continuance of such
	failure for 30 days;








	




	failure to observe or perform any other covenant or agreement in such series of debt securities or the Indenture and the continuance
	of such failure for 60 days after receipt by the Company of notice of such failure specifying such failure and requiring the same to be remedied from the trustee or holders of at least 25% of
	the principal amount of such series of debt securities outstanding;








	




	certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company; and








	




	any other event of default we may provide for that series of debt securities.






	        If
	an event of default with respect to the outstanding debt securities of a particular series occurs and continues, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate
	principal amount of such series of outstanding debt securities may declare the principal amount of such series of debt securities to be due and payable immediately;



	provided
	that



	, in the case of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, such principal amount, or portion thereof will automatically become due and payable without any
	action by the trustee or any holder. However, at any time after an acceleration with respect to the debt securities of a particular series has occurred, but before a judgment or decree based on such
	acceleration has been obtained, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series may, under certain circumstances, rescind and annul such
	acceleration. For information as to waiver of defaults, see "Modification and Waiver" below.




	        If
	the principal or any premium or interest on any debt security is payable in a currency other than U.S. dollars and such currency is not available to the Company for making payment due
	to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's control, the Company is entitled to satisfy its obligations to holders of such debt securities by making such payment
	in U.S. dollars in an amount equal to the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amount payable in such other currency, as determined by the trustee as provided in the Indenture. Any payment made under such
	circumstances in U.S. Dollars where the required payment is in a currency other than U.S. Dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Indenture.




	        The
	trustee may file proofs of claim on behalf of holders of securities in any insolvency proceeding relating to us and to receive and collect monies on behalf of holders in connection
	therewith, but is not authorized to consent to, or vote upon, any plan or reorganization without the direction of the requisite holders.




	        The
	Indenture provides that no holder of such series of debt securities may institute any action against the Company under the Indenture unless, among other conditions, holders of not
	less than 25% of the securities of that series have made a written request to institute proceedings and the trustee has not so instituted such proceedings within 60 days after receipt of such
	notice.




	        Subject
	to the duty of the trustee during default to act with the required standard of care, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the
	Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders, unless such holders have offered the trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the trustee. Subject to such indemnification and certain
	other limitations, the




	27











	Table of Contents





	holders
	of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of a particular series will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
	any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee, with respect to the debt securities of such series.






	Modifications and Waiver





	        Unless otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement for a series of debt securities, modifications and amendments of the
	Indenture with respect to any series of debt securities outstanding may be made by the Company and the trustee with the consent of holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such series,
	except that no such modification or amendment may, without the consent of the holder of each outstanding debt security of the applicable series affected
	thereby:






	




	extend the stated maturity date of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any such debt security;








	




	reduce the principal amount of, or the rate (or extend the time for payment) of interest on, or any premium payable upon the
	redemption of, any such debt security;








	




	reduce the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity thereof;








	




	change the place or currency of payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any such debt security;








	




	impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on, or with respect to, any such debt security;








	




	reduce the percentage in aggregate principal amount of such series of outstanding debt securities, the consent of the holders of which
	is required for any amendment, supplemental indenture or waiver provided for in the Indenture;








	




	modify any of the waiver provisions, except to increase any required percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of the
	Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the holder of each outstanding debt security of the series affected thereby;








	




	cause any such debt security to become subordinate in right of payment to any other debt, except to the extent provided in the terms
	of such security; or








	




	if such debt security provides that the holder may require us to repurchase or convert such debt security, impair such holder's right
	to require repurchase or conversion of such debt security on the terms provided therein.






	        Unless
	otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement for a series of debt securities, the Company and the trustee may also modify and amend the Indenture without the consent
	of any holder of debt securities in limited circumstances, such as clarifications and changes that would not adversely affect the holders.




	        The
	holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of any series of outstanding debt securities may, on behalf of the holders of all such debt securities, waive the Company's
	compliance with certain restrictive provisions of the Indenture or such series of debt securities. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable prospectus supplement for a series of debt securities,
	the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of any series of outstanding debt securities may, on behalf of the holders of all such debt securities, waive any past default under the
	Indenture, except a default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, such debt securities or in respect of any provision of the Indenture that cannot be modified or
	amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding debt security of such series affected thereby.

	Defeasance of the Indenture and Securities





	        The following provisions related to Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance, as such terms are defined below, will apply unless
	otherwise provided in an applicable prospectus supplement for a series of debt securities.




	        The
	Indenture provides that the Company may, at its option, elect to discharge its obligations with respect to any series of debt securities ("Legal Defeasance"). If Legal Defeasance
	occurs, the Company will be deemed to have paid and discharged all amounts owed under the applicable series of debt securities, and the Indenture will cease to be of further effect as to such series
	of debt securities, except that:






	




	holders will be entitled to receive timely payments for the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, such series of debt
	securities, from the funds deposited for that purpose (as explained below);








	




	the Company's obligations will continue with respect to the issuance of temporary debt securities, the registration of debt
	securities, and the replacement of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen debt securities of the applicable series;








	




	the trustee will retain its rights, powers, trusts, duties, and immunities, and the Company will retain its obligations in connection
	therewith; and








	




	other Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture will remain in effect.






	        In
	addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to cause the release of its obligations with respect to most of the covenants in the Indenture ("Covenant Defeasance")
	with respect to any series of debt securities. If Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including non-payment events and bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization events) relating to the
	Company described under "Events of Default" will no longer constitute events of default with respect to such series of debt securities. The Company may exercise Legal Defeasance regardless of whether
	it previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.




	        In
	order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance (each, a "Defeasance") with respect to any series of debt securities:





	        (1)   the
	Company must irrevocably deposit with the trustee, in trust, for the benefit of holders of the debt securities of such series, U.S. legal tender, U.S. government
	securities, a combination thereof or other obligations as may be provided with respect to such series of debt securities, in amounts that will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
	firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, the applicable series of debt securities on the stated date for payment or any redemption date
	thereof, and the trustee must have, for benefit of holders of such debt securities, a valid, perfected, exclusive security interest in the trust;




	        (2)   in
	the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the trustee confirming
	that:






	




	the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service, a ruling; or








	




	since the date of the Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law;






	in
	either case to the effect that holders of such series of debt securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the Legal Defeasance and will be
	subject





	29











	Table of Contents






	to
	federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the Legal Defeasance had not occurred;




	        (3)   in
	the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the trustee confirming
	that holders of such series of debt securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax
	on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;




	        (4)   no
	default or event of default may have occurred and be continuing under the Indenture on the date of the deposit with respect to such series of debt securities; in
	addition, no event of default relating to bankruptcy or insolvency may occur at any time from the date of the deposit to the 91st calendar day thereafter;




	        (5)   the
	Defeasance may not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under the Indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company
	or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound;




	        (6)   the
	Company must deliver to the trustee an officers' certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud any
	other of its creditors; and




	        (7)   the
	Company must deliver to the trustee an officers' certificate confirming the satisfaction of conditions in clauses (1) through (6) above, and an opinion
	of counsel confirming the satisfaction of the conditions in clauses (1) (with respect to the validity and perfection of the security interest), (2), (3) and (5) above.





	        The
	Defeasance will be effective on the earlier of (i) the 91st day after the deposit, and (ii) the day on which all the conditions above have been satisfied.




	        If
	the amount deposited with the trustee to effect a Covenant Defeasance is insufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, the applicable series of debt
	securities when due, then the Company's obligations under the Indenture and such series of debt securities will be revived, and such Defeasance will be deemed not to have occurred.






	Registration and Transfer





	        The Company will issue the debt securities only in fully registered form, without interest coupons. Unless provided otherwise in the
	prospectus supplement and the other offering materials relating to a particular series of debt securities, the debt securities will be issued in minimum denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples
	thereof. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of debt securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or government charge
	payable in connection therewith. If any series of the debt securities are to be redeemed in part, the Company will not be required to issue, register the transfer of or exchange such series of the
	debt securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such
	mailing or to register the transfer of or exchange any debt securities so selected for redemption in part, except the unredeemed portion of any debt securities being redeemed in part.




	        The
	Company will cause to be kept at the office of the registrar a register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company will provide for the
	registration of the debt securities and registration of transfers of the debt securities. The Company initially will appoint the trustee at its corporate trust office as paying agent and registrar for
	the debt securities. The Company may vary or terminate the appointment of any paying agent or registrar, or appoint additional or other




	30











	Table of Contents





	such
	agents or approve any change in the office through which any such agent acts. The Company will cause notice of any resignation, termination or appointment of the trustee or any paying agent or
	registrar, and of any change in the office through which any such agent will act, to be provided to holders of the debt securities.






	The Trustee





	        All payments of principal on, premium, if any, and interest on, and all registration, transfer, exchange, authentication and delivery
	of, the debt securities will be effected by the trustee or its agent at an office designated by the trustee at its corporate trust office.




	        The
	Indenture provides that, except during the continuance of an event of default, the trustee will perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Indenture. During the
	existence of an event of default under the Indenture, the trustee will exercise such rights and powers vested in its exercise as a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in the conduct
	of such person's own affairs. Subject to these provisions, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any of the holders of
	the debt securities, unless they shall have offered to the trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to the trustee.




	        The
	Indenture and provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, which we refer to as the Trust Indenture Act, contain limitations on the rights of the trustee, should it
	become a creditor of the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases or to liquidate certain property received by it in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The trustee is
	permitted to engage in other transactions with the Company or any of its affiliates. If the trustee acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict, apply to the SEC for permission
	to continue as trustee with such conflict or resign.




	        The
	trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Event of Default nor shall it have any duty to inquire as to whether an Event of Default exists or otherwise monitor our
	compliance with the terms of the Indenture.




	        Prior
	to taking actions under the Indenture, the trustee may require indemnities and undertakings of costs from us and/or the holders of securities.




	        Affiliates
	of the trustee may serve as agents and lenders under our credit facilities or engage in other transactions with us from time to time.






	Governing Law





	        The Indenture and any Securities issued thereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts
	of laws principles.






	Book-Entry Debt Securities





	        The debt securities of a series may be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more global securities that will be deposited
	with a depositary identified in the prospectus supplement. Global securities may be issued in either registered or bearer form and in either temporary or permanent form. Payments of principal,
	interest and any premium on a series of debt securities represented by a global security will be made to the depositary.




	        We
	anticipate that any global securities will be deposited with The Depository Trust Company, or "DTC," New York, New York, that the global securities will be registered in the name of
	DTC's nominee, and that the following provisions will apply to the depository arrangements with respect to the global securities. The prospectus supplement will describe additional or differing terms
	of the depository arrangement involving any series of debt securities issued in the form of global securities.




	31











	Table of Contents





	        So
	long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security, DTC or its nominee will be considered the sole holder of the debt securities represented by the global
	security for all purposes
	under the indenture. Except as described below, owners of beneficial interests in a global security:






	




	will not be entitled to have debt securities represented by the global security registered in their names;








	




	will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of debt securities in the form of a certificate; and








	




	will not be considered the record owners or holders of debt securities under the indenture.






	        The
	laws of some states require that purchasers of securities take physical delivery of the securities in certificated form. These laws may limit the transferability of beneficial
	interests in a global security.




	        Debt
	securities represented by a global security will be exchangeable for debt securities in certificated form with the same terms in authorized denominations only
	if:






	




	DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository or if DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under
	applicable law and the Company does not appoint a successor depository within 90 days;








	




	an event of default under the indenture with respect to the debt securities has occurred and is continuing and the beneficial owners
	representing a majority in principal amount of the debt securities represented by the global security advise DTC to cease acting as depository; or








	




	the Company determines at any time that all debt securities of a series will no longer be represented by a global security.






	        We
	obtained the following information concerning DTC and its book-entry system from sources, including DTC, that we believe to be reliable, but we take no responsibility for the accuracy
	of this information.




	        DTC
	will act as securities depository for the debt securities. The debt securities will be issued as fully registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co., which
	is DTC's partnership nominee, or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered debt security certificate will be issued for each issue of debt
	securities, each in the aggregate principal amount of such issue, and will be deposited with DTC. If, however, the aggregate principal amount of any issue exceeds $500 million, one certificate
	will be issued with respect to each $500 million of principal amount, and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such issue.




	        DTC
	is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a "banking organization" within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve
	System, a "clearing corporation" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a "clearing agency" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.
	DTC holds securities that its participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities
	through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants' accounts, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct
	participants of DTC include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository
	Trust & Clearing Corporation ("DTCC"). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing
	agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to DTC's system is also available to others, including




	32











	Table of Contents





	securities
	brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. The
	rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC.




	        Purchases
	of debt securities under the DTC system must be made by or through direct participants, which will receive a credit for the debt securities on DTC's records. The ownership
	interest of each actual purchaser of each debt security is in turn to be recorded on the direct and indirect participants' records. A beneficial owner of debt securities will not receive written
	confirmation from DTC of its purchase, but is expected to receive a written confirmation providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of its holdings, from the participant
	through which the beneficial owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in debt securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of participants acting on
	behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the debt securities, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for
	the debt securities is discontinued.




	        To
	facilitate subsequent transfers, any certificate representing debt securities that is deposited with DTC is registered in the name of its nominee, Cede & Co., or such
	other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of the certificate with DTC and its registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do
	not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the certificate representing the debt securities. DTC's records reflect only the identity of the
	direct participants to whose accounts the debt securities are credited, which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on
	behalf of their customers.




	        Conveyance
	of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participants, by direct participants to indirect participants, and by direct and indirect participants to beneficial
	owners, will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.




	        Redemption
	notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the debt securities within an issue are being redeemed, DTC's practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of
	each direct participant in such issue to be redeemed.




	        Neither
	DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the debt securities unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with
	DTC's MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an omnibus proxy to the Company as soon as possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns Cede &Co.'s consenting or voting
	rights to those direct participants identified on a list attached to the omnibus proxy to whose accounts the debt securities are credited on the record date.




	        Redemption
	proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments on the debt securities will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized
	representative of DTC. DTC's practice is to credit direct participants' accounts upon DTC's receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the Company or paying agent, on payable date in
	accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's records. Payments by participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with
	securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in "street name," and will be the responsibility of such participant and not of DTC, the paying agent, or the Company,
	subject to any statutory or
	regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be
	requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of the Company or paying agent, disbursement of such payments to direct participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and
	disbursement of such payments to the beneficial owners will be the responsibility of direct and indirect participants.




	33
























	Table of Contents





	        A beneficial owner will give notice of any option to elect to have its debt securities repaid or redeemed by the Company, through its participant, to the trustee,
	and will effect delivery of the debt securities by causing the direct participant to transfer the participant's interest in the global security or securities representing the debt securities, on DTC's
	records, to the trustee. The requirement for physical delivery of debt securities in connection with a demand for repayment or notice of redemption will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights
	in the debt securities are transferred by direct participants on DTC's records.




	        DTC
	may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to a series of debt securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Company or the paying agent. Under
	such circumstances, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, Security certificates are required to be printed and delivered.




	        The
	Company may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC or a successor securities depository. In that event, debt security certificates will be
	printed and delivered to DTC.




	        Unless
	stated otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, any underwriters, dealers or agents with respect to any series of debt securities issued as global securities will be
	direct participants in DTC.




	        None
	of the Company, any underwriter, dealer or agent, the trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments
	made on account of beneficial interests in a global security, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to these beneficial interests.




	        Any
	additional or different terms of the depositary arrangement with respect to a series of debt securities will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to such series.















	DESCRIPTION OF GUARANTEES OF DEBT SECURITIES






	        The debt securities of any series issued under this prospectus may be guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries. However, the
	indenture will not require that any of our subsidiaries be a guarantor of any series of debt securities. As a result, the guarantors of any series of debt securities may differ from the guarantors of
	any other series of debt securities. If we issue a series of debt securities guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries, the identity of the specific subsidiary guarantors of the debt securities of
	that series will be identified in the applicable prospectus supplement.




	        If
	we issue a series of debt securities, we will describe the particular terms of any guarantees of such series in a prospectus supplement relating to that series, which we will file
	with the SEC.












	PROVISIONS OF OUR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT RELATING TO CASH DISTRIBUTIONS








	Distributions of Available Cash







	General





	        Within 60 days after the end of each quarter, we will distribute all of our available cash (defined below) to unitholders of
	record on the applicable record date.




	34











	Table of Contents







	Definition of Available Cash





	        Available cash generally means, for each fiscal quarter, all cash on hand at the end of that quarter (including our proportionate share
	of cash on hand of subsidiaries we do not wholly own, including the RigCos):






	





	less



	, the amount of cash reserves (including our proportionate share of cash reserves
	of certain subsidiaries we do not wholly own, including the RigCos) established by our Board of Directors to:








	




	provide for the proper conduct of our business (including reserves for future capital expenditures and for anticipated
	future debt service requirements) subsequent to that quarter;








	




	comply with applicable law, any debt instruments or other agreements; and








	




	provide funds for distributions to our unitholders for any one or more of the next four quarters (provided that our Board
	of Directors may not establish cash reserves for distributions if the effect of the establishment of such reserves will prevent us from paying the minimum quarterly distribution on all common units
	and any cumulative arrearages on such common units for the current quarter);










	





	plus



	, all cash on hand on the date of determination of available cash resulting from
	cash distributions received after the end of such quarter on equity interests in any person other than a subsidiary held by us or any of our subsidiaries, which distributions are paid by such person
	in respect of operations conducted by such person during such quarter;








	





	plus



	, if our Board of Directors so determines, all or any portion of the cash on hand
	(including our proportionate share of cash on hand of subsidiaries we do not wholly own, including the RigCos) on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working
	capital borrowings made subsequent to the end of such quarter.






	        The
	purpose and effect of the last bullet point above is to allow our Board of Directors, if it so decides, to use cash from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter
	but on or before the date of determination of available cash for that quarter, to pay distributions to unitholders. Under our limited liability company agreement, working capital borrowings are
	generally borrowings that are made under a credit facility, commercial paper facility or similar financing arrangement, and in all cases are used solely for working capital purposes or to pay
	distributions to members and with the intent of the borrower to repay such borrowings within twelve months with funds other than from additional working capital borrowings.






	Distribution of the Minimum Quarterly Distribution





	        We intend to distribute to the holders of common units and subordinated units on a quarterly basis at least the minimum quarterly
	distribution of $0.3625 per unit, or $1.45 per unit per year, to the extent we have sufficient cash on hand to pay the distribution after we establish cash reserves and pay fees and expenses,
	including reimbursements of expenses to the Transocean Member and its affiliates. Beginning with the third quarter of 2014, we have paid the minimum quarterly distribution amount to holders of our
	common units and subordinated units on November 24, 2014, February 26, 2015 and May 27, 2015. However, there is no guarantee that we will pay the minimum quarterly distribution on
	our units in any quarter. Even if our cash distribution policy is not modified or revoked, the amount of distributions paid and the decision to make any distribution is determined by our Board of
	Directors, taking into consideration the terms of our limited liability company agreement.

	Table of Contents







	Incentive Distribution Rights





	        The Transocean Member currently holds incentive distribution rights that entitle it to receive increasing percentages, up to a maximum
	of 50 percent, of the cash we distribute from operating surplus (as defined below) in excess of $0.416875 per unit per quarter; provided that for any fiscal quarter in which the application of
	our distribution formula would result in the holders of the common units receiving, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter, then the
	distribution to the holders of the incentive distribution rights will be reduced, pro rata, to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate distribution to the holders of the common units to represent
	a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter. The maximum distribution of 50 percent does not include any distributions the Transocean Member or its affiliates
	may receive on common or subordinated units that they own. Please read "Incentive Distribution Rights" below for additional information.






	Operating Surplus and Capital Surplus







	General





	        All cash distributed to unitholders is characterized as either being paid from "operating surplus" or "capital surplus." We treat
	distributions of available cash from operating surplus differently than distributions of available cash from capital surplus.






	Operating Surplus





	        We define operating surplus as:






	




	$50.0 million (as described below);



	plus









	




	all of our cash receipts (or our proportionate share of cash receipts in the case of subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) after the
	closing of our initial public offering, excluding cash from interim capital transactions (as defined below), provided that cash receipts from the termination of a commodity hedge, currency hedge or
	interest rate hedge prior to its stipulated settlement or termination date shall be included in operating surplus in equal quarterly installments over the remaining scheduled life of such commodity
	hedge, currency hedge or interest rate hedge;



	plus









	




	working capital borrowings made after the end of a quarter but on or before the date of determination of operating surplus for that
	quarter;



	plus









	




	cash distributions on equity interests in any entity other than subsidiaries held by us or any of our subsidiaries received after the
	end of the quarter but on or before the date of determination of operating surplus for that quarter in respect of operations of such entity and not from sources that would constitute interim capital
	transactions if paid by us;



	plus









	




	cash distributions (including incremental distributions on incentive distribution rights) paid in respect of equity issued to finance
	all or a portion of expansion capital expenditures in respect of the period from the date that we enter into a binding obligation to commence the construction, development, replacement, improvement or
	expansion of a capital asset and ending on the earlier to occur of the date the capital asset commences commercial service and the date that it is abandoned or disposed of;



	less









	




	cash distributions (including incremental distributions on incentive distribution rights) paid in respect of equity issued to pay
	interest and related fees on debt incurred, or to pay distributions on equity issued, to finance the expansion capital expenditures referred to in the prior bullet point;



	less







	36











	Table of Contents







	




	all of our operating expenditures (as defined below), which includes estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, after
	the closing of our initial public offering;



	less









	




	the amount of cash reserves established by our Board of Directors to provide funds for future operating expenditures;



	less









	




	all working capital borrowings not repaid within twelve months after having been incurred or repaid within such twelve month period
	with the proceeds of additional working capital borrowings;



	less









	




	any cash loss realized on dispositions of assets acquired using investment capital expenditures.






	        As
	described above, operating surplus does not reflect actual cash on hand that is available for distribution to our unitholders and is not limited to cash generated by operations. For
	example, it includes a provision that will enable us, if we choose, to distribute as operating surplus up to $50.0 million of cash we receive in the future from non-operating sources, such as
	asset sales, issuances of securities and long-term borrowings that would otherwise be distributed as capital surplus. In addition, the effect of including, as described above, certain cash
	distributions on equity interests in operating surplus will be to increase operating surplus by the amount of any such cash distributions. As a result, we may also distribute as operating surplus up
	to the amount of any such cash that we receive from non-operating sources.




	        The
	proceeds of working capital borrowings increase operating surplus and repayments of working capital borrowings are generally operating expenditures (as described below) and thus
	reduce operating surplus when repayments are made. However, if working capital borrowings, which increase operating surplus, are not repaid during the twelve-month period following the borrowing, they
	will be deemed repaid at the end of such period, thus decreasing operating surplus at such time. When such working capital borrowings are in fact repaid, they will not be treated as a further
	reduction in operating surplus because operating surplus will have been previously reduced by the deemed repayment.




	        We
	define interim capital transactions as (i) borrowings, refinancings or refundings of indebtedness (other than working capital borrowings and items purchased on open account or
	for a deferred purchase price in the ordinary course of business) and sales of debt securities, (ii) issuances of equity securities, (iii) sales or other dispositions of assets, other
	than sales or other dispositions of inventory, accounts receivable and other assets in the ordinary course of business and sales or other dispositions of assets as part of normal asset retirements or
	replacements and (iv) capital contributions received.




	        We
	define operating expenditures as all of our cash expenditures, including, but not limited to, taxes, reimbursements of expenses of the Transocean Member and its affiliates, officer,
	director and employee
	compensation, interest payments, estimated maintenance capital expenditures, payments made in the ordinary course of business under interest rate hedge contracts, currency hedge contracts and
	commodity hedge contracts (provided that payments made in connection with the termination of any interest rate hedge contract, currency hedge contract or commodity hedge contract prior to the
	stipulated settlement or termination date specified therein will be included in operating expenditures in equal quarterly installments over the remaining scheduled life of such interest rate hedge
	contract, currency hedge contract or commodity hedge contract and amounts paid in connection with the initial purchase of an interest rate hedge contract, currency hedge contract or a commodity hedge
	contract will be amortized over the life of such interest rate hedge contract, currency hedge contract or commodity hedge contract), maintenance and replacement capital expenditures (as discussed in
	further detail below), and repayment of working capital borrowings; provided, however, that operating expenditures will not include:






	




	repayments of working capital borrowings where such borrowings have previously been deemed to have been repaid (as described above);






	37











	Table of Contents







	




	payments (including prepayments and prepayment penalties) of principal of and premium on indebtedness, other than working capital
	borrowings;








	




	expansion capital expenditures, investment capital expenditures or actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures (which are
	discussed in further detail under "Capital Expenditures" below);








	




	payment of transaction expenses (including taxes) relating to interim capital transactions;








	




	distributions to our members; or








	




	repurchases of limited liability company interests (excluding repurchases we make to satisfy obligations under employee benefit
	plans).








	Capital Surplus





	        Capital surplus is defined in our limited liability company agreement as any distribution of available cash in excess of our operating
	surplus. Accordingly, except as described above, capital surplus would generally be generated by:






	




	borrowings other than working capital borrowings;








	




	sales of our equity and debt securities;








	




	sales or other dispositions of assets, other than inventory, accounts receivable and other assets sold in the ordinary course of
	business or as part of ordinary course retirement or replacement of assets; and








	




	capital contributions received.








	Characterization of Cash Distributions





	        Our limited liability company agreement requires that we treat all available cash distributed as coming from operating surplus until
	the sum of all available cash distributed since the closing of our initial public offering equals the operating surplus from the closing of such initial public offering through the end of the quarter
	immediately preceding that distribution. Our limited liability company agreement requires that we treat any amount distributed in excess of operating surplus, regardless of its source, as capital
	surplus. Our limited liability company agreement treats a distribution of capital surplus as the repayment of the consideration for the issuance of units, which is as a return of capital. We do not
	anticipate that we will make any distributions from capital surplus.






	Capital Expenditures





	        Maintenance and replacement capital expenditures are those cash expenditures required to maintain, over the long-term, the operating
	capacity, asset base or operating income of the company. In our limited liability company agreement, we refer to these expenditures as "maintenance capital expenditures." Examples of maintenance and
	replacement capital expenditures include expenditures associated with maintenance, modifying an existing drilling rig or acquiring a new drilling rig to the extent such expenditures are incurred to
	maintain the operating capacity, asset base or operating income of the fleet. Maintenance and replacement capital expenditures will also include interest and related fees (including periodic net
	payments under related interest rate swap agreements) on debt incurred and distributions on equity issued (including the amount of any incremental distributions made to the holders of our incentive
	distribution rights) to finance the construction of a capital improvement and paid in respect of the construction period, which we define as the period beginning on the date that we enter into a
	binding construction contract and ending on the earlier of the date that the capital improvement commences commercial service or the date that the capital improvement is abandoned or




	38











	Table of Contents





	disposed
	of. Debt incurred to pay or equity issued to fund construction period interest payments, and distributions on such equity (including the amount of any incremental distributions made to the
	holders of our incentive distribution rights), will also be considered maintenance and replacement capital expenditures.




	        Expansion
	capital expenditures are cash expenditures incurred to increase, over the long-term, the operating capacity, asset base or operating income of the company. Examples of
	expansion capital expenditures include expenditures associated with acquiring a new drilling rig or improving an existing drilling rig to the extent those expenditures increase, over the long term,
	the operating capacity, asset base or operating income of the company. Expansion capital expenditures will also include interest and related fees (including periodic net payments under related
	interest rate swap agreements) on debt incurred and distributions on equity issued (including the amount of any incremental distributions made to the holders of our incentive distribution rights) to
	finance all or a portion of expansion capital expenditures paid in respect of the construction period.




	        Investment
	capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that are neither maintenance and replacement capital expenditures nor expansion capital expenditures. Investment capital
	expenditures largely will consist of capital expenditures made for investment purposes. Examples of investment capital expenditures include traditional capital expenditures for investment purposes,
	such as purchases of equity securities, as well as other capital expenditures that might be made in lieu of such traditional investment capital expenditures, such as the acquisition of a capital asset
	for investment purposes.




	        Capital
	expenditures that are made in part for maintenance and replacement capital purposes, investment capital purposes and/or expansion capital purposes will be allocated as
	maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, investment capital expenditures or expansion capital expenditures by our Board of Directors.




	        Because
	maintenance and replacement capital expenditures can be very large and vary significantly in timing, the amount of actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures may
	differ substantially from period to period, which could cause similar fluctuations in the amounts of operating surplus, adjusted operating surplus and available cash for distribution to our
	unitholders if we subtracted actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures from operating surplus each quarter. Accordingly, to eliminate the effect on operating surplus of these
	fluctuations, our limited liability company agreement requires that an amount equal to an estimate of the average quarterly maintenance and replacement capital expenditures necessary to maintain the
	operating capacity of or the revenue generated by our capital assets over the long-term be subtracted from operating surplus each quarter, as opposed to the actual amounts spent. In our limited
	liability company agreement, we refer to these estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures to be subtracted from operating surplus as "estimated maintenance capital expenditures." The
	amount of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures deducted from operating surplus is subject to review and change by our Board of Directors at least once a year, provided that any
	change must be approved by our conflicts committee. The estimate will be made at least annually and whenever an event occurs that is likely to result in a material adjustment to the amount of our
	maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, such as a major acquisition or the introduction of new governmental regulations that will affect the fleet. For purposes of calculating operating
	surplus, any adjustment to this estimate will be prospective only. For a discussion of the amounts we have allocated toward estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, please read "Our
	Cash Distribution Policy and Restrictions on Distributions."




	39











	Table of Contents





	        The
	use of estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures in calculating operating surplus will have the following effects:






	




	it will reduce the risk that actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures in any one quarter will be large enough to make
	operating surplus less than the minimum quarterly distribution to be paid on all the units for that quarter and subsequent quarters;








	




	it may reduce the need for us to borrow to pay distributions;








	




	it will be more difficult for us to raise our distribution above the minimum quarterly distribution and pay incentive distributions to
	the Transocean Member; and








	




	it will reduce the likelihood that a large maintenance and replacement capital expenditure in a period will prevent Transocean from
	being able to convert some or all of its subordinated units into common units since the effect of an estimate is to spread the expected expense over several periods, mitigating the effect of the
	actual payment of the expenditure on any single period.








	Subordination Period







	General





	        Our limited liability company agreement provides that, during the subordination period (which we define below), the common units will
	have the right to receive distributions of available cash from operating surplus each quarter in an amount equal to $0.3625 per common unit, which amount is defined in our partnership agreement as the
	minimum quarterly distribution, plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters, before any distributions of available cash from
	operating surplus may be made on the subordinated units. These units are deemed "subordinated" because for a period of time, referred to as the subordination period, the subordinated units will not be
	entitled to receive any distributions until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages from prior quarters. Furthermore, no arrearages will accrue or be
	payable on the subordinated units. The practical effect of the subordinated units is to increase the likelihood that, during the subordination period, there will be available cash to be distributed on
	the common units.






	Subordination Period





	        The subordination period began on the closing date of our initial public offering and, except as described below, will extend until the
	first business day following the distribution of available cash in respect of any quarter beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2019, that each of the following tests are
	met:






	




	aggregate distributions of available cash from operating surplus on the outstanding common units, subordinated units and any other
	outstanding units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the subordinated units with respect to each of the three consecutive, non-overlapping four-quarter periods immediately preceding
	such date equaled or exceeded $1.45 (the annualized minimum quarterly distribution) on all outstanding common units and subordinated units and any other outstanding units that are senior or equal in
	right of distribution to the subordinated units, in each case in respect of such periods;








	




	the adjusted operating surplus for each of the three consecutive, non-overlapping four-quarter periods immediately preceding such date
	equaled or exceeded $1.45 (the annualized minimum quarterly distribution) on all of the common units, subordinated units and any other units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the
	subordinated units that were outstanding during such periods on a fully diluted weighted average basis; and








	




	there are no arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units.






	40











	Table of Contents







	Expiration Upon Removal of the Transocean Member





	        In addition, if the unitholders remove the Transocean Member other than for cause and no units held by the Transocean Member and its
	affiliates voted in favor of the removal:






	




	the subordinated units held by any person will immediately and automatically convert into common units on a one-for-one basis;








	




	all cumulative common unit arrearages on the common units will be extinguished and the subordination period will end; and








	




	the holders of the incentive distribution rights (currently, the Transocean Member) will have the right to convert their incentive
	distribution rights into common units or to receive cash in exchange for those interests.








	Expiration of the Subordination Period





	        When the subordination period ends upon satisfaction of the test described above or upon removal of the Transocean Member as described
	above, each outstanding subordinated unit will convert into one common unit and will thereafter participate pro rata with the other common units in distributions of available cash.






	Adjusted Operating Surplus





	        Adjusted operating surplus is intended to reflect the cash generated from operations during a particular period and therefore excludes
	net drawdowns of reserves of cash established in prior periods. Adjusted operating surplus for any period consists of:






	




	operating surplus generated with respect to that period (excluding any amounts attributable to the item described in the first bullet
	point under the caption "Operating Surplus and Capital SurplusOperating Surplus" above);



	less









	




	any net increase in working capital borrowings with respect to that period;



	less









	




	any net decrease in cash reserves for operating expenditures with respect to that period not relating to an operating expenditure made
	with respect to that period;



	plus









	




	any net decrease in working capital borrowings with respect to that period;



	plus









	




	any net increase in cash reserves for operating expenditures with respect to that period required by any debt instrument for the
	repayment of principal, interest or premium;



	plus









	




	any net decrease made in subsequent periods to cash reserves for operating expenditures initially established with respect to that
	period to the extent such decrease results in a reduction in adjusted operating surplus in subsequent periods.








	Distributions of Available Cash From Operating Surplus During the Subordination Period





	        We make distributions of available cash from operating surplus for any quarter during the subordination period in the following
	manner:






	




	first, 100 percent to the common unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount equal to
	the minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter;








	




	second, 100 percent to the common unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount equal
	to any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for any prior quarters during the subordination period;






	41











	Table of Contents







	




	third, 100 percent to the subordinated unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each subordinated unit an amount equal to
	the minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter; and








	




	thereafter, in the manner described in "Incentive Distribution Rights" below.






	        The
	preceding paragraph is based on the assumption that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities.






	Distributions of Available Cash From Operating Surplus After the Subordination Period





	        We will make distributions of available cash from operating surplus for any quarter after the subordination period in the following
	manner:






	




	first, 100 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each outstanding unit an amount equal to the minimum
	quarterly distribution for that quarter; and








	




	thereafter, in the manner described in "Incentive Distribution Rights" below.






	        The
	preceding paragraph is based on the assumption that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities.






	Transocean Member Interest





	        The Transocean Member owns a transferrable non-economic limited liability company interest in us, which does not entitle it to receive
	cash distributions. However, the Transocean Member owns common units, subordinated units and incentive distribution rights (as further explained below) in us and may in the future own other equity
	securities in us and is, or will be, entitled to receive distributions on any such interests.






	Incentive Distribution Rights





	        Incentive distribution rights represent the right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash from
	operating surplus after the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels have been achieved. The Transocean Member currently holds the incentive distribution rights, however the
	incentive distribution rights may be transferred separately from the Transocean Member interest. Any transfer by the Transocean Member of the incentive distribution rights would not change the
	percentage allocations of quarterly distributions with respect to such rights.




	        If
	for any quarter:






	




	we have distributed available cash from operating surplus to the common and subordinated unitholders in an amount equal to the minimum
	quarterly distribution; and








	




	we have distributed available cash from operating surplus on outstanding common units in an amount necessary to eliminate any
	cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution;






	then,
	we will distribute any additional available cash from operating surplus for that quarter among the unitholders in the following manner:






	




	first, 100 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, until each unitholder receives a total of $0.416875 per unit for that quarter
	(the "first target distribution");








	




	second, 85 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, and 15 percent to the holders of the incentive distribution rights, pro
	rata, until each unitholder receives a total of $0.453125 per unit for that quarter (the "second target distribution");






	42











	Table of Contents







	




	third, 75 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, and 25 percent to the holders of the incentive distribution rights, pro
	rata, until each unitholder receives a total of $0.543750 per unit for that quarter (the "third target distribution"); and








	




	thereafter, 50 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, and 50 percent to the holders of the incentive distribution rights,
	pro rata.






	        In
	each case, the amount of the target distribution set forth above is exclusive of any distributions to common unitholders to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of the
	minimum quarterly distribution. The percentage interests set forth above assume that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any quarter in which
	the application of the formula above would result in the common unitholders receiving, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter, then the
	distribution to the holders of the incentive distribution rights will be reduced, pro rata, to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate distribution to the common unitholders to represent a
	majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter.






	Percentage Allocations of Available Cash From Operating Surplus





	        The following table illustrates the percentage allocations of the additional available cash from operating surplus among the
	unitholders and the holders of the incentive distribution rights up to the various target distribution levels. The amounts set forth under "Marginal Percentage Interest in Distributions" are the
	percentage interests of the unitholders and the holders of the incentive distribution rights in any available cash from operating surplus we distribute up to and including the corresponding amount in
	the column "Total Quarterly Distribution Target Amount," until available cash from operating surplus we distribute reaches the next target distribution level, if any. The percentage interests shown
	for the unitholders and the holders of the incentive distribution rights for the minimum quarterly distribution are also applicable to quarterly distribution amounts that are less than the minimum
	quarterly distribution. The percentage interests set forth below assume that there are no arrearages on common units.

	Distributions From Capital Surplus







	How Distributions From Capital Surplus Will Be Made





	        We make distributions of available cash from capital surplus, if any, in the following
	manner:






	




	first, 100 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, until the minimum quarterly distribution is reduced to zero, as described
	below;








	




	second, 100 percent to the common unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each common unit, an amount of available cash
	from capital surplus equal to any unpaid arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units; and








	




	thereafter, as if such distributions were from operating surplus.






	43











	Table of Contents





	        The
	preceding paragraph is based on the assumption that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities.






	Effect of a Distribution from Capital Surplus





	        Our limited liability company agreement treats a distribution of capital surplus as the repayment of the consideration for the issuance
	of the units, which is a return of capital. Each time a distribution of capital surplus is made, the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reduced in the same
	proportion as the distribution had to the fair market value of the common units prior to the announcement of the distribution. Because distributions of capital surplus will reduce the minimum
	quarterly distribution, after any of these distributions are made, it may be easier for the Transocean Member to receive incentive distributions and for the subordinated units to convert into common
	units. However, any distribution of capital surplus before the minimum quarterly distribution is reduced to zero cannot be applied to the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution or any
	arrearages.




	        Once
	we reduce the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels to zero, we will then make all future distributions 50 percent to the holders of units and
	50 percent to the holders of the incentive distribution rights (provided that for any fiscal quarter in which the application of our distribution formula would result in the holders of the
	common units receiving, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the aggregate distribution of available cash for such quarter, then the distribution to the holders of the incentive distribution
	rights shall be reduced, pro rata, to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate distribution to the holders of the common units to represent a majority of the aggregate distribution of available
	cash for such quarter).






	Adjustment to the Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target Distribution Levels





	        In addition to adjusting the minimum quarterly distribution and target distribution levels to reflect a distribution of capital
	surplus, if we combine our common units into fewer common units or subdivide our common units into a greater number of common units, we will proportionately
	adjust:






	




	the minimum quarterly distribution;








	




	the target distribution levels;








	




	the initial unit price; and








	




	the arrearages per common unit in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units.






	        For
	example, if a two-for-one split of the common units should occur, the minimum quarterly distribution, the target distribution levels and the initial unit price would each be reduced
	to 50 percent of its initial level. If we combine our common units into a lesser number of units or subdivide our common units into a greater number of units, we will combine our subordinated
	units or subdivide our subordinated units, using the same ratio applied to the common units. We will not make any adjustment by reason of the issuance of additional units for cash or property.






	Distributions of Cash Upon Liquidation





	        If we dissolve in accordance with our limited liability company agreement, we will sell or otherwise dispose of our assets in a process
	called liquidation. We will apply the proceeds of liquidation in the manner set forth below.




	44











	Table of Contents





	        If,
	as of the date three trading days prior to the announcement of the proposed liquidation, the average closing price for our common units for the preceding 20 trading days (the
	"current market price") is greater than the sum of:






	




	any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for any prior quarters during the subordination
	period;



	plus









	




	the initial unit price (less any prior capital surplus distributions and any prior cash distributions made in connection with a
	partial liquidation);






	then
	the proceeds of the liquidation will be applied as follows:






	




	first, 100 percent to the common unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount equal to
	the current market price of our common units;








	




	second, 100 percent to the subordinated unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each subordinated unit an amount equal
	to the current market price of our common units; and








	




	thereafter, 50 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, 50 percent to holders of incentive distribution rights.






	        Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, if the application of the formula above would result in the common unitholders receiving, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the aggregate proceeds
	of liquidation, then the application of the proceeds of liquidation to the holders of the incentive distribution rights shall be reduced, pro rata, to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate
	application of the proceeds of liquidation to the common unitholders to represent a majority of the aggregate proceeds of liquidation.




	        If,
	as of the date three trading days prior to the announcement of the proposed liquidation, the current market price of our common units is equal to or less than the sum
	of:






	




	any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for any prior quarters during the subordination
	period;



	plus









	




	the initial unit price (less any prior capital surplus distributions and any prior cash distributions made in connection with a
	partial liquidation);






	then
	the proceeds of the liquidation will be applied as follows:






	




	first, 100 percent to the common unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount equal to
	the initial unit price (less any prior capital surplus distributions and any prior cash distributions made in connection with a partial liquidation);








	




	second, 100 percent to the common unitholders, pro rata, until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount equal
	to any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for any prior quarters during the subordination period;








	




	third, 100 percent to the subordinated unitholders, until we distribute for each outstanding subordinated unit an amount equal
	to the initial unit price (less any prior capital surplus distributions and any prior cash distributions made in connection with a partial liquidation); and








	




	thereafter, 50 percent to all unitholders, pro rata, 50 percent to holders of incentive distribution rights.






	        Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, if the application of the formula above would result in the common unitholders receiving, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the aggregate proceeds
	of liquidation, then the application of the proceeds of liquidation to the holders of the incentive distribution rights shall be reduced, pro rata, to the extent necessary to cause the aggregate
	application of the proceeds of liquidation to the common unitholders to represent a majority of the aggregate proceeds of liquidation.

	SELLING SECURITY HOLDER








	Registration of Securities Held by Transocean





	        Pursuant to this prospectus, Transocean may offer and sell, from time to time, up to 21,254,310 common units, which Transocean acquired
	as part of the consideration for its contribution of certain assets to us in connection with our formation and initial public offering. Information about Transocean is set forth herein and, where
	applicable, will be set forth in a
	prospectus supplement, in a post-effective amendment, or in filings we make with the SEC under the Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus. We are registering the
	securities for sale by Transocean because Transocean is an affiliate of ours and its ability to resell such securities under an exemption from registration, such as Rule 144 under the
	Securities Act, is subject to limitations.




	        The
	prospectus supplement for any offering of our common units by Transocean will set forth the following information with respect to the selling security
	holder:






	




	the nature of any position, office or other material relationship that the selling security holder has had within the last three years
	with us or any of our affiliates;








	




	the number of common units owned by the selling security holder prior to the offering;








	




	the amount of common units to be offered for the selling security holder's account; and








	




	the amount and (if one percent or more) the percentage of common units to be owned by the selling security holder after the completion
	of the offering.

















	CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS AND DUTIES








	Conflicts of Interest





	        Conflicts of interest exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationships between the Transocean Member and its
	affiliates, including Transocean, on the one hand, and us and our unaffiliated members, on the other hand. Our Board of Directors has a duty to manage us in a manner it believes is beneficial to us.
	Certain of our executive officers and directors are also directors and/or officers of Transocean or its affiliates and, as such, they owe fiduciary duties to Transocean that may cause them to pursue
	business strategies that disproportionately benefit Transocean or which otherwise are not in the best interests of us or our unitholders. These officers have fiduciary duties to those entities and not
	to us. As a result of these relationships, conflicts of interest may arise between us and our unaffiliated members on the one hand, and Transocean and its other affiliates, including the Transocean
	Member, on the other hand. Our directors have duties to influence, in our role as controlling owner, the decisions made by the RigCos in a manner beneficial to us. At the same time, the directors and
	officers of the RigCos have a duty to act for the RigCos in a manner beneficial to all of the RigCos' owners, including Transocean. While we will have influence in our role as controlling owner of the
	RigCos, the directors and officers of the RigCos will exercise decisions of the RigCos and they will have a duty to act in the best interests of the RigCos. Our Board of Directors may resolve
	conflicts of interest between Transocean and us and, to the extent acting in our role as the controlling owner of the RigCos, has broad latitude to consider the interests of all parties to the
	conflict. The resolution of these conflicts may not be in the best interest of us or our unitholders.




	        Our
	company affairs are governed by our limited liability company agreement and the Marshall Islands Act. The provisions of the Marshall Islands Act resemble provisions of the limited
	liability company laws of a number of states in the United States, most notably Delaware. We are not aware of any material difference in unitholder rights between the Marshall Islands Act and the
	Delaware




	46











	Table of Contents





	Limited
	Liability Company Act. The Marshall Islands Act also provides that it is to be applied and construed to make it uniform with the laws of the State of Delaware and, so long as it does not
	conflict with the Marshall Islands Act or decisions of certain Marshall Islands courts, the non-statutory law or "case law" of the courts of the State of Delaware is adopted as the law of the Marshall
	Islands. There have been few, if any, court cases in the Marshall Islands interpreting the Marshall Islands Act, in contrast to Delaware, which has a fairly well-developed body of case law
	interpreting its limited liability company statute. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether Marshall Islands courts would reach the same conclusions as courts in Delaware. For example, the rights of
	our unitholders and responsibilities of the Transocean Member and its affiliates and our directors and our officers under Marshall Islands law are not as clearly established as under judicial
	precedent in existence in Delaware. Due to the less-developed nature of Marshall Islands law, our public unitholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests or seeking remedies in the
	face of actions by the Transocean Member, its
	affiliates and our directors and our officers or our controlling unitholders than would unitholders of a limited liability company organized in the United States.




	        Our
	limited liability company agreement contains provisions replacing the fiduciary duties that might otherwise be owed by the Transocean Member and our directors and officers with
	contractual standards governing their duties and the methods of resolving conflicts of interest. Our limited liability company agreement also specifically defines the remedies available to unitholders
	for actions taken by the Transocean Member or our directors or officers that, without these defined liability standards, might constitute breaches of those duties.




	        Our
	Board of Directors will not be in breach of its obligations under our limited liability company agreement or duties to us or the unitholders if the resolution of the conflict
	is:






	




	approved by the conflicts committee, which our limited liability company agreement defines as "special approval," although our Board
	of Directors is not obligated to seek such approval;








	




	approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by the Transocean Member or any
	of its affiliates, although neither the Transocean Member nor our Board of Directors are obligated to seek such approval;








	




	determined by our Board of Directors to be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from
	unrelated third parties, but our Board of Directors is not required to obtain confirmation to such effect from an independent third party; or








	




	determined by our Board of Directors to be fair and reasonable to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships between
	the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us.






	        If
	our Board of Directors seeks or obtains approval from the conflicts committee, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, the conflicts committee acted in good faith, and
	in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any member or the company challenging such determination, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such
	presumption. If our Board of Directors does not seek or obtain approval from the conflicts committee or our unitholders and our Board of Directors determines that the resolution or course of action
	taken with respect to the conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in the third and fourth bullet points above, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, our Board
	of Directors, including board members affected by the conflict, acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any member or the company challenging such determination, the
	person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption. Unless the resolution of a conflict is specifically provided for in our limited liability company
	agreement, our Board of Directors or the conflicts committee of our Board of Directors may consider any factors it determines in good faith to consider when resolving a conflict. When our limited
	liability company




	47











	Table of Contents





	agreement
	requires someone to act in good faith, it requires that person to subjectively believe that he is acting in a manner that is in, or not adverse to, the best interests of the company or that
	the determination to take or not to take action meets the specified standard, for example, a transaction on terms no less favorable to the us than those generally being provided to or available from
	unrelated third parties, or is "fair and reasonable" to us. In taking such action, such person may take into account the totality of the circumstances or the totality of the relationships between the
	parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us. If that person has the required subjective belief, then the decision or action will be
	conclusively deemed to be in good faith for all purposes under our limited liability company agreement.




	        Conflicts
	of interest could arise in the situations described below, among others.






	Actions taken by our Board of Directors may affect the amount of cash available for
	distribution to unitholders or accelerate the right to convert subordinated units.





	        The amount of cash that is available for distribution to unitholders is affected by decisions of our Board of Directors regarding such
	matters as:






	




	the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales;








	




	cash expenditures;








	




	borrowings;








	




	estimates of maintenance and replacement capital expenditures;








	




	the issuance of additional units; and








	




	the creation, reduction or increase of reserves in any quarter.






	        Our
	Board of Directors determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditures and whether a capital expenditure is classified as a maintenance and replacement capital expenditure,
	which reduces operating surplus, or an expansion capital expenditure, which does not reduce operating surplus. These determinations can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders
	and to the Transocean Member and the ability of the subordinated units to convert into common units.




	        In
	addition, our Board of Directors may use an amount, initially equal to $50.0 million, which would not otherwise constitute available cash from operating surplus, in order to
	permit the payment of cash distributions on the units and incentive distribution rights. All of these actions may affect the amount of cash distributed to our unitholders and the Transocean Member and
	may facilitate the conversion of subordinated units into common units.




	        In
	addition, borrowings by us and our affiliates do not constitute a breach of any duty owed by the Transocean Member or our directors or officers to our unitholders, including
	borrowings that have the purpose or effect of:






	




	enabling the Transocean Member or its affiliates to receive distributions on any subordinated units held by them or the incentive
	distribution rights; or








	




	accelerating the expiration of the subordination period.






	        For
	example, in the event we have not generated sufficient cash from our operations to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on our common units and our subordinated units, our limited
	liability company agreement permits us to borrow funds, which would enable us to make this distribution on all outstanding units. Please read "Provisions of Our Limited Liability Company Agreement
	Relating to Cash DistributionsSubordination Period."




	48











	Table of Contents







	Our limited liability company agreement provides that we and our subsidiaries may borrow funds
	from the Transocean Member and its affiliates.





	        Neither our limited liability company agreement nor any other agreement requires Transocean to pursue a business strategy that favors
	us or utilizes our assets or dictates what markets to pursue or grow. Transocean's directors and executive officers have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of Transocean,
	which may be contrary to our interests.




	        Because
	certain of our executive officers and directors are also directors and/or officers of Transocean or its affiliates, such officers and directors have fiduciary duties to
	Transocean that may cause them to
	pursue business strategies that disproportionately benefit Transocean or which otherwise are not in our best interests.






	Our officers face conflicts in the allocation of their time to our business.





	        Our officers, who are employed by Transocean and perform executive officer functions for us pursuant to agreements with Transocean, are
	not required to work full-time on our affairs and also perform services for affiliates of Transocean. Transocean conducts substantial businesses and activities of its own in which we have no economic
	interest. As a result, there could be material competition for the time and effort of our officers who also provide services to Transocean, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
	results of operations and financial condition.






	We will reimburse the Transocean Member and its affiliates for expenses.





	        Pursuant to our limited liability company agreement, we will reimburse the Transocean Member and its affiliates for costs and expenses
	they incur and payments they make on our behalf. Our limited liability company agreement provides that our Board of Directors will determine the expenses that are allocable to us.






	Common unitholders will have no right to enforce obligations of Transocean and its affiliates
	under agreements with us.





	        No agreement between us, on the one hand, and Transocean and its affiliates, on the other, will grant to the unitholders, separate and
	apart from us, the right to enforce the obligations of Transocean and its affiliates in our favor.






	Contracts between us, on the one hand, and Transocean and its affiliates, on the other, will
	not be the result of arm's-length negotiations.





	        Neither our limited liability company agreement nor any of the other agreements, contracts and arrangements between us and Transocean
	and its affiliates are or will be the result of arm's-length negotiations. Our limited liability company agreement generally provides that any affiliated transaction, such as an agreement, contract or
	arrangement between us and Transocean and its affiliates that does not receive unitholder or conflicts committee approval, must be:






	




	determined by our Board of Directors to be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from
	unrelated third parties, but our Board of Directors is not required to obtain confirmation to such effect from an independent third party; or








	




	determined by our Board of Directors to be "fair and reasonable" to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships between
	the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us.






	        Affiliates
	of Transocean, which provides certain management and administrative services to us, may also enter into additional contractual arrangements with any of its affiliates on our
	behalf; however,




	49











	Table of Contents





	there
	is no obligation of the Transocean Member and its affiliates to enter into any contracts of this kind.






	Common units are subject to the Transocean Member's limited call right.





	        The Transocean Member may exercise its right to purchase common units as provided in our limited liability company agreement or assign
	this right to one of its affiliates or to us free of any liability or obligation to us or our members. The Transocean Member is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion, nor shall unitholders have
	dissenters' rights of appraisal, regarding the value of the common units to be purchased by the Transocean Member upon the exercise of this limited call right. As a result, a common unitholder may
	have common units purchased from the unitholder at an undesirable time or price. Please read "Our Limited Liability Company AgreementLimited Call Right."






	We may choose not to retain separate counsel, accountants or others for ourselves or for the
	holders of common units.





	        The attorneys, independent accountants and others who perform services for us have been retained by our Board of Directors. Attorneys,
	independent accountants and others who perform services for us are selected by our Board of Directors or the conflicts committee and may perform services for Transocean and its affiliates. We may
	choose to retain separate counsel, independent accountants or other service providers for ourselves or the holders of common units in the event of a conflict of interest between Transocean and its
	affiliates, on the one hand, and us or the holders of common units, on the other, depending on the nature of the conflict. We do not intend to do so in most cases.






	Except as provided in the omnibus agreement, the Transocean Member's affiliates, including
	Transocean, may compete with us and neither the Transocean Member nor its affiliates nor our directors and officers have any obligation to present business opportunities to us.





	        Under the omnibus agreement, Transocean will not and will cause its controlled affiliates (other than us, our subsidiaries and any
	publicly traded affiliates of Transocean) not to, for so long as Transocean controls us, to agree not to acquire, own, operate or contract for any drilling rig that was constructed in 2009 or later
	and is operating under a contract for five or more years. Affiliates of the Transocean Member are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in
	direct competition with us. Furthermore, the omnibus agreement does not prohibit Transocean from forming a new publicly traded entity that will not be subject to the omnibus agreement and that may
	compete with us. In addition, under our limited
	liability company agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, will not apply to the Transocean Member, its affiliates or our directors and officers. As a result,
	neither the Transocean Member nor any of its affiliates nor any of our directors and officers will have any obligation to present business opportunities to us other than as provided in the omnibus
	agreement.






	Duties





	        The duties owed to unitholders by the Transocean Member and its affiliates and our directors and officers are generally set forth in
	our limited liability company agreement. The Marshall Islands Act provides that Marshall Islands limited liability companies may, in their limited liability company agreements, expand or restrict the
	fiduciary duties owed by members or directors to the company or another member or director.




	        In
	addition, we and our subsidiaries have entered into two master services agreements and one or more support services or secondment agreements, and may enter into additional agreements
	with Transocean and certain of its subsidiaries. In the performance of their obligations under these




	50











	Table of Contents





	agreements,
	Transocean and its subsidiaries are not held to a fiduciary standard of care but rather to the standards of care specified in the relevant agreement.




	        As
	permitted by the Marshall Islands Act, our limited liability company agreement contains various provisions replacing any fiduciary duties that might otherwise be owed by the
	Transocean Member or by our directors and officers with contractual standards governing the duties of the Transocean Member and our directors and officers and the methods of resolving conflicts of
	interest. These provisions, among other things, allow the Transocean Member and our directors and officers to take into account the interests of other parties in addition to our interests when
	resolving conflicts of interest. We believe this is appropriate and necessary because many of our directors and officers have fiduciary duties to Transocean and its affiliates, and might otherwise
	have fiduciary duties to our members as well. Without these provisions, the Transocean Member's and our directors' and officers' ability to make decisions involving conflicts of interest would be
	restricted. We believe these provisions strengthen our ability to attract and retain experienced and capable directors and officers. These provisions disadvantage the common unitholders because, among
	other things, they restrict the rights and remedies available to members for actions that, without these provisions, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty, as described below and permit the
	Transocean Member and our directors and officers to take into account the interests of third parties in addition to our interests when resolving conflicts of interest.




	        The
	following is a summary of:






	




	the duties imposed on the Transocean Member and our directors and officers by the Marshall Islands Act;








	




	material modifications of these duties contained in our limited liability company agreement; and








	




	certain rights and remedies of unitholders contained in our limited liability company agreement and the Marshall Islands Act.








	Marshall Islands law fiduciary duty standards





	        The Marshall Islands Act does not specifically provide that members or directors or officers of limited liability companies have any
	statutory fiduciary duties. Because the Marshall Islands Act provides that it is to be applied and construed to make it uniform with the laws of the State of Delaware and, so long as it does not
	conflict with the Marshall Islands Act or decisions of certain Marshall Islands courts, the non-statutory law or "case law" of the courts of the State of Delaware is adopted as the law of the Marshall
	Islands, it is possible that, in the absence of provisions in the limited liability company agreement to the contrary, a Marshall Islands court or a court interpreting Marshall Islands law could
	determine that certain fiduciary duties would apply to the members and directors and officers of a Marshall Islands limited liability company, in accordance with Delaware case law.






	Limited liability company agreement modified standards





	        Our limited liability company agreement contains provisions that permit or consent to conduct by the Transocean Member and its
	affiliates and our directors and officers that might otherwise raise issues as to compliance with fiduciary duties under the laws of the Marshall Islands. For example, our limited liability company
	agreement provides that, to the extent permitted by law, when the Transocean Member takes actions provided under our limited liability company agreement, it may act without any fiduciary obligation to
	us or the unitholders whatsoever. These provisions may restrict the obligations to which the Transocean Member and our directors and officers might otherwise be held. Our limited liability company
	agreement generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of




	51











	Table of Contents





	interest
	not involving a vote of unitholders and that are not approved by the conflicts committee of our Board of Directors must be:






	




	determined by our Board of Directors to be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from
	unrelated third parties, but our Board of Directors is not required to obtain confirmation to such effect from an independent third party; or








	




	determined by our Board of Directors to be "fair and reasonable" to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships between
	the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us.






	        If
	approval from the conflicts committee is sought, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, the conflicts committee acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by
	or on behalf of any member or the company challenging such determination, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption. If approval from the
	conflicts committee is not sought, and our Board of Directors determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to the conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set
	forth in the bullet
	points above, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, our Board of Directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any member or the company, the person
	bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption. These standards may reduce the obligations to which our Board of Directors might otherwise be held.




	        In
	addition to the other more specific provisions limiting the obligations of the Transocean Member and our directors and officers, our limited liability company agreement further
	provides that the Transocean Member and our officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our members for errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions unless there has
	been a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the Transocean Member or our officers or directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful
	misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that conduct was unlawful. However, this limitation does not apply to any claims made under the federal securities laws.






	Rights and remedies of unitholders





	        The provisions of the Marshall Islands Act resemble the provisions of the limited liability company act of Delaware. For example, like
	Delaware, the Marshall Islands Act favors the principles of freedom of contract and enforceability of limited liability company agreements and allows our limited liability company agreement to contain
	terms governing the rights of our unitholders. The rights of our unitholders, including voting and approval rights and the ability of the company to issue additional units, are governed by the terms
	of our limited liability company agreement. Please read "Our Limited Liability Company Agreement."




	        As
	to remedies of unitholders, the Marshall Islands Act generally provides that a member may institute legal action in the right of the company to recover a judgment in its favor if
	managers or members with the authority to do so have refused to institute the action or where an effort to cause those managers or members to do so is not likely to succeed. In addition, the statutory
	or case law of some jurisdictions may permit a member to institute legal action on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated limited partners to recover damages from the Board of Directors
	for violations of its fiduciary duties to the members.




	        By
	purchasing our common units, each common unitholder will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by the provisions in our limited liability company agreement, including the provisions
	discussed above. Please read "Description of the Common UnitsTransfer of Common Units." This is in accordance with the policy of the Marshall Islands Act favoring the principle of freedom
	of contract and the enforceability of limited liability company agreements. The failure of a member to sign our limited liability company agreement does not render our limited liability company
	agreement unenforceable against that person.

	Table of Contents





	        Under
	our limited liability company agreement, we must indemnify the Transocean Member and our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law, against liabilities, costs
	and expenses incurred by the Transocean Member or these other persons. We must provide this indemnification unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
	jurisdiction determining that these persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. We also must provide this indemnification for criminal proceedings except when the Transocean
	Member or these other persons acted with knowledge that their conduct was unlawful. Thus, the Transocean Member and our directors and officers could, among other things, be indemnified for their
	negligent acts if they met the requirements set forth above. To the extent that these provisions purport to include indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
	in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is contrary to public policy and therefore unenforceable. Please read "Our Limited Liability Company AgreementIndemnification."















	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION






	        We may sell the securities being offered hereby in one or more of the following ways from time to
	time:






	




	to underwriters or dealers for resale to the public or to institutional investors;








	




	directly to institutional investors;








	




	directly to a limited number of purchasers or to a single purchaser;








	




	through agents to the public or to institutional investors; or








	




	through a combination of any of these methods of sale.






	        If
	we use underwriters or dealers in the sale, the securities will be acquired by the underwriters or dealers for their own account and may be resold from time to time in one or more
	transactions, including:






	




	at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed from time to time;








	




	in "at the market offerings" within the meaning of Rule 415(a)(4) of the Securities Act;








	




	at prices related to such prevailing market prices; or








	




	at negotiated prices.






	        For
	each series of securities, the prospectus supplement will set forth the terms of the offering of the securities, including:






	




	the initial public offering price;








	




	the method of distribution, including the names of any underwriters, dealers or agents;








	




	the purchase price of the securities;








	




	our net proceeds from the sale of the securities;








	




	any underwriting discounts, agency fees, or other compensation payable to underwriters or agents;








	




	any discounts or concessions allowed or re-allowed or repaid to dealers; and








	




	the securities exchanges on which the securities will be listed, if any.






	        If
	we use underwriters in the sale, they will buy the securities for their own account. The underwriters may then resell the securities in one or more transactions at a fixed public
	offering price or at varying prices determined at the time of sale or thereafter. The obligations of the underwriters to




	53











	Table of Contents





	purchase
	the securities will be subject to certain conditions. The underwriters will be obligated to purchase all the securities offered if they purchase any securities. Any initial public offering
	price and any discounts or concessions allowed or re-allowed or paid to dealers may be changed from time to time. In connection with an offering, underwriters and selling group members and their
	affiliates may engage in transactions to stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the securities in accordance with applicable law.




	        If
	we use dealers in the sale, we will sell securities to such dealers as principals. The dealers may then resell the securities to the public at varying prices to be determined by such
	dealers at the time of resale. If we use agents in the sale, they will use their reasonable best efforts to solicit purchases for the period of their appointment. If we sell directly, no underwriters
	or agents would be involved. We are not making an offer of securities in any jurisdiction that does not permit such an offer.




	        Underwriters,
	dealers and agents that participate in the securities distribution may be deemed to be underwriters as defined in the Securities Act. Any discounts, commissions or profit
	they receive when they resell the securities may be treated as underwriting discounts and commissions under that Act. We may have agreements with underwriters, dealers and agents to indemnify them
	against certain civil liabilities, including certain liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute with respect to payments that they may be required to make. Underwriters, dealers and agents
	may engage in transactions with, or perform services for, us or our subsidiaries in the ordinary course of their business.




	        We
	may authorize underwriters, dealers or agents to solicit offers from certain institutions whereby the institutions contractually agree to purchase the securities from us on a future
	date at a specific price. This type of contract may be made only with institutions that we specifically approve. Such institutions could include banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment
	companies and educational and charitable institutions. The underwriters, dealers or agents will not be responsible for the validity or performance of these contracts.




	        The
	securities may be new issues of securities with no established trading market and unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will not list any series of
	the securities on any exchange. It has not presently been established whether the underwriters, if any, of the securities will make a market in the securities. If the underwriters make a market in the
	securities, such market making may be discontinued at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the securities.















	LEGAL MATTERS






	        The validity of the securities offered by this prospectus will be passed upon for us by Watson Farley & Williams LLP as
	to matters of Marshall Islands and England & Wales law, by Mourant Ozannes as to matters of Cayman Islands law, and by Alston & Bird LLP as to matters of Delaware and New York
	law. Certain legal matters will be passed upon for any underwriters or agents by counsel named in the applicable prospectus supplement.

	Item 15.    Indemnification of Directors and Officers








	Transocean Partners LLCMarshall Islands Limited Liability Company





	        Section 8 of the Marshall Islands Act empowers a Marshall Islands limited liability company to indemnify and hold harmless any
	member or manager or other persons from and against all claims and demands whatsoever, subject to any standards and restrictions set forth in the company's limited liability company agreement.




	        Under
	the Transocean Partners LLC second amended and restated limited liability company agreement, Transocean Partners must indemnify the persons named below (each an
	"Indemnitee"), to the fullest extent permitted by law, against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses, judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts arising from any
	threatened, pending or completed claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in which any Indemnitee may be involved or threatened to be
	involved by reason of its status as an Indemnitee:






	(1)




	the
	Transocean Member or any successor owning the Transocean Member interest;






	(2)




	any
	departing member owning the Transocean Member interest;






	(3)




	any
	person who is or was an affiliate of the Transocean Member or any departing member owning the Transocean Member interest;






	(4)




	any
	person who is or was an officer, director, member, fiduciary or trustee of any entity described in (1), (2) or (3) above;






	II-1











	Table of Contents







	(5)




	any
	person who is or was serving as a director, officer, member, fiduciary or trustee of another person at the request of the Transocean Partners' board of
	directors, the Transocean Member or any departing member owning the Transocean Member interest;






	(6)




	any
	person designated by the Transocean Partners' board of directors; and






	(7)




	the
	members of the Transocean Partners' board of directors and our officers.






	        Transocean
	Partners must provide this indemnification unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the Indemnitee acted
	in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. Transocean Partners also must provide this indemnification for criminal proceedings unless the Indemnitee acted with knowledge that its conduct
	was unlawful. Thus, an Indemnitee could be indemnified for its negligent or grossly negligent acts if it meets the requirements set forth above. Any provision that includes indemnification for
	liabilities arising under the Securities Act is, according to the SEC, contrary to public policy and therefore unenforceable. Any Indemnitee who is entitled to indemnification is entitled to
	advancement of expenses incurred in participating in or defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by law.




	        Any
	indemnification under these provisions will only be out of Transocean Partners LLC assets. Unless it otherwise agrees, the Transocean Member or any departing member owning the
	Transocean Member interest will not be personally liable for or have any obligation to contribute or lend funds or assets to Transocean Partners to enable it to effectuate indemnification. Transocean
	Partners may purchase insurance against liabilities asserted against and expenses incurred by persons for its activities, regardless of whether Transocean Partners would have the power to indemnify
	the person against liabilities under our limited liability company agreement.






	Delaware Limited Liability Companies





	        Section 18-108 of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act empowers a Delaware limited liability company to indemnify and hold
	harmless any member or other person from
	and against all claims and demands whatsoever, subject to any terms, conditions or restrictions set forth in an operating agreement or limited liability company agreement.




	        The
	limited liability company agreement of each of Transocean RIGP DCL LLC, Transocean RIGP DD3 LLC and Transocean RIGP DIN LLC provides that none of the members,
	managers or officers of the company are liable to it for any act or omission done or omitted in good faith unless such act or omission constitutes gross negligence, willful misconduct or a breach of
	the limited liability company agreement of the company. In addition, the limited liability company agreement of each company requires the company to indemnify any of its members, managers or officers
	to the fullest extent permitted by law against any loss, liability, damage, judgment, demand, claim, cost or expense incurred by or asserted against such persons, including, reasonable attorney's fees
	and disbursements incurred in defense thereof, arising out of any act or omission unless such act or omission constitutes bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such person.






	Cayman Islands Limited Liability Companies





	        The Articles of Association of each of Transocean RIGP DCL Opco Limited, Transocean RIGP DD3 Opco Limited, Transocean RIGP DIN Opco
	Limited, Triton RIGP DCL Holding Limited, Triton RIGP DD3 Holding Limited and Triton RIGP DIN Holding Limited provide that every director and officer of the company or any trustee acting in relation
	to the affairs of the company and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives or successors or assigns (collectively, "Indemnified Persons") shall, in the absence of
	willful default or fraud, be indemnified by the company against all costs, losses, damages and expenses which any such Indemnified Person may incur or




	II-2











	Table of Contents





	become
	liable in respect of by reason of any contract entered into, or act or thing done by such an Indemnified Person or in any way in or about the execution of his duties and the amount for which
	such indemnity is provided shall immediately attach as a lien on the property of the company and have priority as between the members of the company over all other claims. No Indemnified Person shall
	be liable or answerable for the acts, receipts, defaults or fraud of any other Indemnified Person or joining in any receipt or other act for conformity or for any loss or expense happening to the
	company through the insufficiency or deficiency of any security in or upon which any of the monies of the company shall be invested or for any loss of the monies of the company which shall be invested
	or for any loss or damage arising from the bankruptcy, insolvency or tortious act of any person with whom any monies, securities or effects shall be deposited, or for any other loss, damage or
	misfortune whatsoever which shall happen in or about the execution of the duties of his respective office or trust or in relation thereto unless the same happens through his own willful default or
	fraud.






	England & Wales Limited Liability Companies





	        Section 232 of the Companies Act 2006 (the "Act") states that any provision that purports to exempt a director of a company (to
	any extent) from any liability (in connection with any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the company of which he is a director)



	is
	void



	. However, any provision by which a company directly or indirectly provides an indemnity for a director of the company or of any associated company (to any extent) against
	liability (in connection with any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the company of which he is a director)



	is void, unless it is permitted
	by



	(i) a 'qualifying third party indemnity provision', or (ii) a 'qualifying pension scheme indemnity provision' under the Act or there is insurance against such
	liability as permitted by the Act.




	        The
	articles of association of each of Triton RIGP DCL Holdco Limited, Triton RIGP DD3 Holdco Limited and Triton RIGP DIN Holdco Limited (together, the "Holdco Companies") contain a
	'qualifying third party indemnity provision' at article 30 (Indemnity). This allows for each Holdco Company, at its discretion and subject to any policies adopted by the directors from time to
	time, to indemnify every director or other officer of the company (out of the assets of the company) against all costs, charges, losses, expenses and liabilities which he may sustain or incur in
	relation to the company in or about the actual or purported execution of the duties or powers of his office or otherwise in relation thereto, including any liability incurred by him in defending any
	criminal or civil proceedings, provided that no such indemnity shall be provided in respect of any liability incurred by a director to the company or any associated company or in the circumstances
	listed in section 234(3) of the Act.

	(a)   Rule 415 Offering




	.    The undersigned registrants hereby undertake:






	(1)




	To
	file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:






	(i)




	To
	include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act;






	(ii)




	To
	reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective
	amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or








	II-3











	Table of Contents








	decrease
	in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated
	maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than
	a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective registration statement;






	(iii)




	To
	include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change
	to such information in the registration statement;








	provided



	,



	however



	, that paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) do not apply if the
	information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by a registrant pursuant to Section 13 or
	Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of
	the registration statement.






	(2)




	That,
	for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration
	statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial



	bona fide



	offering thereof.






	(3)




	To
	remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the
	offering.






	(4)




	[Intentionally
	omitted]






	(5)




	That,
	for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:






	(A)




	Each
	prospectus filed by a registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed
	prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and






	(B)




	Each
	prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on
	Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii) or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the
	Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first
	contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter,
	such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such
	securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial



	bona fide



	offering thereof.



	Provided



	,



	however



	,
	that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated
	or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such
	effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or the prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately
	prior to such effective date.








	II-4











	Table of Contents







	(6)




	That,
	for the purpose of determining liability of a registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, each
	undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of such undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell
	the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, such undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser
	and will be considered to offer to sell such securities to such purchaser:






	(i)




	Any
	preliminary prospectus or prospectus of such undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;






	(ii)




	Any
	free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of such undersigned registrant or used or referred to such undersigned
	registrant;






	(iii)




	The
	portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about such undersigned registrant or its
	securities provided by or on behalf of such undersigned registrant; and






	(iv)




	Any
	other communication that is an offer in the offering made by such undersigned registrant to the purchaser.








	        




	(b)   Filings Incorporating Subsequent Exchange Act Documents by Reference.




	    Each undersigned registrant hereby
	undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of such registrant's annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the
	Exchange Act (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan's annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is incorporated by reference in the registration
	statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein by such registrant, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the
	initial



	bona fide



	offering thereof.




	        




	(c)   Request for Acceleration of Effective Date or Filing of Registration Statement Becoming Effective Upon
	Filing.




	    Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
	registrants pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, each undersigned registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed
	in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by a registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a
	director, officer or controlling person of such registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with
	the securities being registered, such registrant will, unless in the opinion of their counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the
	question whether such indemnification by them is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.




	        




	(d)   Include the Following in a Registration Statement Permitted by Rule 430A Under the Securities Act of
	1933.




	    Each undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:






	(1)




	For
	purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this
	registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b) (1) or (4) or 497(h) under the
	Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.






	(2)




	For
	the purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be

	SECTION 3.3.


	                                                                 

	EXECUTION, AUTHENTICATION, DELIVERY AND DATING



	 




	The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by an Officer by manual or facsimile signature.




	 




	Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.




	 




	At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of the Company Order, authenticate and deliver such Securities as this Indenture provides and not otherwise.




	 




	If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 2.2 and 3.1, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 9.1) shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,




	 



	13













	 




	(1)


	                                

	if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 2.2, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;



	 




	(2)


	                                

	if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 3.1, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and



	 




	(3)


	                                

	that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles.



	 




	If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustees own rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.




	 




	Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Board Resolution or the Officers Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.1 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of that series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of that series to be issued.




	 




	Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.




	 




	No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual or facsimile signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.12, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.  The authentication of a facsimile transmission of a Security may be effected via authentication of a separate facsimile transmission counterpart of such Security.




	 




	SECTION 3.4.


	                                                                 

	TEMPORARY SECURITIES



	 




	Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are




	 



	14











	 




	issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the Officer or Officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.




	 




	If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of that series, the temporary Securities of that series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of that series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of that series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of that series and tenor.




	 




	SECTION 3.5.


	                                                                 

	HOLDER LISTS



	 




	The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of all Holders of Securities of each series, by series, and shall otherwise comply with TIA §312(a). If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish, or shall cause the Registrar (if other than the Company) to furnish, to the Trustee at least five Business Days before each Interest Payment Date with respect to a series of Securities and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of the Holders of such series, and the Company shall otherwise comply with TIA §312(a).




	 




	SECTION 3.6.


	                                                                 

	REGISTRAR, PAYING AGENT AND DEPOSITARY



	 




	The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (

	Registrar

	) and an office or agency where Securities may be presented for payment (

	Paying Agent

	). The Registrar shall keep a register (the

	Security Register

	) of each series of Securities and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may appoint one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term Registrar includes any co-registrar and the term Paying Agent includes any additional paying agent. The Company may change any Paying Agent or Registrar with respect to the Securities of any series without notice to any Holder. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address of any Agent not a party to this Indenture. If the Company fails to appoint or maintain an entity other than the Trustee as either Registrar or Paying Agent for the affected series of Securities, the Trustee shall act as such. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar. The Company initially appoints The Depository Trust Company to act as Depositary with respect to the Global Securities. The Company initially appoints the Trustee to act as Registrar and Paying Agent and to act as Securities Custodian with respect to the Global Securities.

	SECTION 3.7.


	                                                                 

	REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE



	 




	Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of a series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.




	 




	At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency of the Company. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.




	 




	All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.




	 




	Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.




	 




	No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, Article XI or 3.7 not involving any transfer.




	 




	If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, neither the Company nor the Registrar shall be required (A) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of that series (or of that series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the delivery of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected for redemption under Section 4.3 and ending at the close of business on the day of such delivery, or (B) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.




	 




	The provisions of clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only to Global Securities:




	 




	(1)


	                                

	Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.



	 




	(2)


	                                

	Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, and subject to such applicable provisions, if any, as may be specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, a



	 



	16













	 




	Global Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary, by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or to another nominee of the Depositary, or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary. All Global Securities will be exchanged by the Company for other certificated Securities if (i) the Company delivers to the Trustee written notice from the Depositary that (x) the Depositary is unwilling or unable to continue to act as Depositary for the Global Securities and the Company thereupon fails to appoint a successor Depositary within 90 days or (y) the Depositary is no longer a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, (ii) the Company, in its sole discretion, determines that the Global Securities (in whole but not in part) should be exchanged for other certificated Global Securities and delivers a written notice to such effect to the Trustee or (iii) upon request of the Trustee or Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the applicable series if there shall have occurred and be continuing a Default or Event of Default with respect to such Securities.  If the Company designates a successor Depositary as aforesaid, such Global Security shall promptly be exchanged in whole for one or more other Global Securities registered in the name of the successor Depositary, whereupon such designated successor shall be the Depositary for such successor Global Security or Global Securities and the provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this Section shall continue to apply thereto.




	 




	(3)


	                                

	Subject to Clause (2) above and to such applicable provisions, if any, as may be specified as contemplated by Section 3.1, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.



	 




	(4)


	                                

	Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section, Section 3.4, 3.6, Article XI or 3.7 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.



	 




	SECTION 3.8.


	                                                                 

	MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN SECURITIES



	 




	If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee together with such security or indemnity as may be required by the Company or the Trustee to save each of them harmless, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.




	 




	If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of written notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series




	 



	17













	 




	and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.




	 




	In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.




	 




	Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.




	 




	Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.




	 




	The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.




	 




	SECTION 3.9.


	                                                                 

	PAYMENT OF INTEREST; INTEREST RIGHTS PRESERVED



	 




	Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.1 with respect to any Securities of a series, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.




	 




	Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called 

	Defaulted Interest

	) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:




	 




	(1)


	                                

	The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest payable on any Securities of a series to the Persons in whose names such Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner.  The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each of such Securities and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as provided in this clause (1). The Company shall also fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such



	 



	18













	 




	Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment.  The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee of such Special Record Date and the Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder of such Securities in the manner set forth in Section 13.4, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date.  Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so delivered, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names such Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).




	 




	(2)


	                                

	The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on any Securities of a series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which such Securities may be listed or traded, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange or automated quotation system, if, after written notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.



	 




	Except as may otherwise be provided in this Section 3.9 or as contemplated in Section 3.1 with respect to any Securities of a series, the Person to whom interest shall be payable on any Security that first becomes payable on a day that is not an Interest Payment Date shall be the Holder of such Security on the day such interest is paid.




	 




	Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.




	 




	In the case of any Security which is converted after any Regular Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (other than any Security whose Maturity is prior to such Interest Payment Date), interest whose Stated Maturity is on such Interest Payment Date shall be payable on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding such conversion, and such interest (whether or not punctually paid or duly provided for) shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on such Regular Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Security which is converted, interest whose Stated Maturity is after the date of conversion of such Security shall not be payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of any Security that may be converted may provide that the provisions of this paragraph do not apply, or apply with such additions, changes or omissions as may be provided thereby, to such Security.

	SECTION 3.10.


	                                                          

	PAYING AGENT TO HOLD MONEY IN TRUST



	 




	The Company shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that the Paying Agent will hold in trust for the benefit of Holders of the applicable Securities of any series or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal or any premium or interest on such Securities and will notify the Trustee in writing of any default by the Company in making any such payment. While any such default continues, the Trustee may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment over to the Trustee, the Paying Agent (if other than the Company or a Subsidiary) shall have no further liability for the money. If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities all money held by it as Paying Agent with respect to such Securities. Upon any bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings relating to the Company, the Trustee shall serve as Paying Agent for any Securities.




	 




	SECTION 3.11.


	                                                          

	PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS



	 




	Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 3.9) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.




	 




	SECTION 3.12.


	                                                          

	CANCELLATION



	 




	All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or conversion or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee.  No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture.  All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of in accordance with the Trustees customary procedures (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act).




	 




	SECTION 3.13.


	                                                          

	COMPUTATION OF INTEREST; USURY



	 




	Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.




	 




	The amount of interest (or amounts deemed to be interest under applicable law) payable or paid on any Security shall be limited to an amount which shall not exceed the maximum




	 



	20













	 




	nonusurious rate of interest allowed by the applicable laws of the State of New York, or any applicable law of the United States permitting a higher maximum nonusurious rate that preempts such applicable New York law, which could lawfully be contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received (the 

	Maximum Interest Rate

	).  If, as a result of any circumstances whatsoever, the Company or any other Person is deemed to have paid interest (or amounts deemed to be interest under applicable law) or any Holder of a Security is deemed to have contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received interest (or amounts deemed to be interest under applicable law), in excess of the Maximum Interest Rate, then, ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of validity, and if under any such circumstance, the Trustee, acting on behalf of the Holders, or any Holder shall ever receive interest or anything that might be deemed interest under applicable law that would exceed the Maximum Interest Rate, such amount that would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the applicable Security or Securities and not to the payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid principal balance of any such Security or Securities, such excess shall be refunded to the Company; provided that the Company and not the Trustee shall be responsible for collecting any such refund from the Holders. In addition, for purposes of determining whether payments in respect of any Security are usurious, all sums paid or agreed to be paid with respect to such Security for the use, forbearance or detention of money shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such Security.




	 




	SECTION 3.14.


	                                                          

	CUSIP/ISIN NUMBERS



	 




	The Company in issuing the Securities may use CUSIP and ISIN numbers (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP and/or ISIN numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the CUSIP numbers.

	(a)


	                                

	Each Global Security initially shall (i) be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Security or the nominee of such Depositary, in each case for credit to the account of an Agent Member, (ii) be delivered to the Trustee as custodian for such Depositary and (iii) bear a legend as set forth in Section 2.3.  Neither the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, nor any other agent of the Company shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.



	 




	Members of, or participants in, the Depositary (

	Agent Members

	) shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depositary, or its custodian, or under such Global Security.  The Depositary may be treated by the Company, any other obligor upon the Securities, the Trustee and any agent of any of them as




	 



	21













	 




	the absolute owner of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, any other obligor upon the Securities, the Trustee or any agent of any of them from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a beneficial owner of any Security.  The registered holder of a Global Security may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action that a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities.




	 




	(b)


	                                

	Transfers of a Global Security shall be limited to transfers of such Global Security in whole to the Depositary, its successors or their respective nominees.

	The transfer and exchange of a Global Security or beneficial interests therein shall be effected through the Depositary, in accordance with this Indenture and the procedures of the Depositary therefor.



	 




	(d)


	                                

	The Company, any other obligor upon the Securities or the Trustee, in the discretion of any of them, may treat as the Act of a Holder any instrument or writing of any Person that is identified by the Depositary as the owner of a beneficial interest in the Global Security, provided that the fact and date of the execution of such instrument or writing is proved in accordance with Section 13.3.



	 




	(e)


	                                 

	The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or among Agent Members or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.



	 




	(f)


	                                  

	None of the Company, the Trustee or any Agent shall have any responsibility or liability for any actions taken or not taken by the Depositary.

	APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE



	 




	Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for such Securities) in accordance with this Article.

	SECTION 4.2.


	                                                                 

	ELECTION TO REDEEM; NOTICE TO TRUSTEE



	 




	The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be established in or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for such Securities. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company (including any such redemption affecting only a single Security), the Company shall, at least three Business Days (but no more than 60 days) prior to the date by which the Company is required to give notice to Holders of such redemption (unless a shorter notice shall be agreed to in writing by the Trustee), notify the Trustee in writing of such Redemption Date, of the principal amount of Securities of that series to be redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities (i) prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture or (ii) pursuant to an election of the Company that is subject to a condition specified in the terms of those Securities, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction or condition and if requested by the Trustee under Section 9.2(b) hereof, an Opinion of Counsel.




	 




	SECTION 4.3.


	                                                                 

	SELECTION BY TRUSTEE OF SECURITIES TO BE REDEEMED



	 




	If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all the Securities of that series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed or unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of that series not previously called for redemption, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities are listed or, if the Securities are not listed, then on a pro rata basis or by lot (or, in the case of Securities in global form, the Securities represented thereby will be selected in accordance with the Depositarys prescribed method) and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements; provided that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. If less than all the Securities of that series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of that series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence.




	 




	If any Security selected for partial redemption is converted in part before termination of the conversion right with respect to the portion of the Security so selected, the converted portion of such Security shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for redemption. Securities which have been converted during a selection of Securities to be redeemed shall be treated by the Trustee as Outstanding for the purpose of such selection.




	 




	The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and each Registrar in writing of the Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in case of any Securities selected for partial redemption as aforesaid, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.




	 



	23













	 




	The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of the Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security.




	 




	For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.




	 




	SECTION 4.4.


	                                                                 

	NOTICE OF REDEMPTION



	 




	Notice of redemption shall be delivered not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at such Holders current address appearing in the Security Register.




	 




	All notices of redemption shall identify the Securities to be redeemed (including CUSIP and ISIN numbers, if any) and shall state:




	 




	(1)


	                                

	the Redemption Date,



	 




	(2)


	                                

	the Redemption Price,



	 




	(3)


	                                

	if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of more than a single Security are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of any such Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed and, if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of a single Security are to be redeemed, the principal amount of the particular Security to be redeemed,



	 




	(4)


	                                

	that, subject to the following Clause (8), on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,



	 




	(5)


	                                

	the place or places where each such Security is to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price,



	 




	(6)


	                                

	for any Securities that by their terms may be converted, the terms of conversion, the date on which the right to convert the Security to be redeemed will terminate and the place or places where such Securities may be surrendered for conversion,



	 




	(7)


	                                

	that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case, and



	 




	(8)


	                                

	any conditions precedent to the making of any such redemption (which the Company may, in its sole discretion, include in any such notice of redemption and which the Company may, in its sole discretion, waive the satisfaction thereof).



	 



	24











	 




	Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Companys written request, delivered to the Trustee at least three Business Days prior to the date by which the Company is required to give notice to Holders of such redemption (unless a shorter notice shall be agreed to in writing by the Trustee), in the form of an Officers Certificate requesting that the Trustee give such notice and setting forth the information to be stated in such notice as provided in the preceding paragraph, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.  The failure to give such notice or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security.




	 




	SECTION 4.5.


	                                                                 

	DEPOSIT OF REDEMPTION PRICE



	 




	On or before 11:00 A.M., New York City time on any Redemption Date, and subject to the satisfaction of any conditions precedent for redemption as set forth in any notice of redemption, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 3.10) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date, other than any Securities called for redemption on that date which have been converted prior to the date of such deposit.




	 




	If any Security called for redemption is converted, any money deposited with the Trustee or with any Paying Agent or so segregated and held in trust for the redemption of such Security shall (subject to any right of the Holder of such Security or any Predecessor Security to receive interest as provided in the last paragraph of Section 3.9 or in the terms of such Security) be paid to the Company upon Company Request or, if then held by the Company, shall be discharged from such trust.




	 




	SECTION 4.6.


	                                                                 

	SECURITIES PAYABLE ON REDEMPTION DATE



	 




	Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date;

	provided

	SECTION 5.1.


	                                                                 

	APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE



	 




	The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of any series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for such Securities.




	 




	The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of any Securities is herein referred to as a mandatory sinking fund payment, and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of such Securities is herein referred to as an optional sinking fund payment. If provided for by the terms of any Securities, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 5.2. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities as provided for by the terms of such Securities.




	 




	SECTION 5.2.


	                                                                 

	SATISFACTION OF SINKING FUND PAYMENTS WITH SECURITIES



	 




	The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) and (2) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been converted in accordance with their terms or which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to any Securities of that series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as and to the extent provided for by the terms of such Securities; provided that the Securities to be so credited have not been previously so credited. The Securities to be so credited shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price, as specified in the Securities so to be redeemed (or at such other prices as may be specified for such Securities as contemplated in Section 3.1), for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.

	SECTION 5.3.


	                                                                 

	REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES FOR SINKING FUND



	 




	Not less than 45 days (or such shorter period as shall be agreed to in writing by the Trustee) prior to each sinking fund payment date for any Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for such Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities pursuant to Section 5.2 and will also deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Failure of the Company to timely deliver or cause to be delivered such Officers Certificate and Securities specified in this Section 5.3, if any, shall not constitute a Default but shall constitute the election of the Company (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Company will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section. If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $100,000 (or the equivalent thereof in the applicable currency) or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request with respect to the Securities of any particular series, such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption.  If such amount shall be $100,000 (or the equivalent thereof in the applicable currency) or less and the Company makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $100,000 (or the equivalent thereof in the applicable currency) is available.  Not less than 30 days prior to each such sinking fund payment date, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 4.3 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 4.4. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 4.6 and 4.7.

	PAYMENT OF SECURITIES



	 




	The Company shall pay the principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities of any series on the dates and in the manner provided herein and in the applicable Security. An installment of principal of or interest on any Security of any series shall be considered paid on the date it is due if the Trustee or Paying Agent (other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) holds for the benefit of the Holders of such Security (on or before 10:00 a.m. New York City time to the extent necessary to provide the funds to the Depositary in accordance with the Depositarys procedures) on that date cash deposited and designated for and sufficient to pay the installment.

	MAINTENANCE OF OFFICE OR AGENCY



	 




	The Company shall maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities, an office or agency (which may be an office of the Trustee, of the Registrar or of an agent of the Trustee or the Registrar) where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands; provided, however, no service of legal process may be made on the Company at any office of the Trustee.




	 




	The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.




	 




	With respect to any Global Security, and except as otherwise may be specified for such Global Security as contemplated by Section 3.1, the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee shall be the Place of Payment where such Global Security may be presented or surrendered for payment or for registration of transfer or exchange, or where successor Securities may be delivered in exchange therefor;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that any such payment, presentation, surrender or delivery effected pursuant to the Applicable Procedures of the Depositary for such Global Security shall be deemed to have been effected at the Place of Payment for such Global Security in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

	accordance with its organizational documents and the material rights (charter and statutory) and material corporate franchises of the Company;

	provided, however

	, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer necessary or desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company.

	(b)


	                                

	The Company shall, so long as any Security of any series are Outstanding, deliver to the Trustee, promptly upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default with respect to such Security, an Officers Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default, any Event of Default or any such fact unless one of its Trust Officers receives written notice thereof from the Company or any of the Holders.

	provided

	, that if the SEC has accepted any report filed by the Company as provided in this paragraph and such report has been made available to the public on the SECs EDGAR system (or any similar system), the Company will not be required to furnish such report to the Trustee or Holders 

	provided

	, that the Trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever to determine whether or not such information, documents or reports have been filed pursuant to the EDGAR system (or its successor). The Company shall also comply with the provisions of TIA § 314(a).  Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustees receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Companys compliance with any

	of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers Certificates).

	The Company covenants that if an Event of Default in payment of principal, premium or interest specified in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 8.1 hereof occurs and is continuing with respect to Securities of any series, the Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of Securities of that series, the whole amount then due and payable on Securities of that series for principal, premium (if any), and interest, and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal (and premium, if any), and on any overdue interest, at the rate borne by such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the reasonable costs and expenses of collection, including compensation to, and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee and its agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Trustee under Section 9.7.




	 




	If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust in favor of the Holders of Securities of that series, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated.




	 




	If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of that series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effective to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

	(2)


	                                

	to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

	Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of Securities of any series any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting Securities of that series or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any such Holder in any such proceeding.

	Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in Section 3.8 hereof, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

	provided that





	 




	(1)


	                                

	such direction shall not be in conflict with any applicable rule of law or with this Indenture;



	 



	36













	 




	(2)


	                                

	the Trustee shall not determine that the action so directed would be unduly prejudicial to the Holders not taking part in such direction; and

	the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.



	 




	SECTION 8.12.


	                                                          

	WAIVER OF EXISTING OR PAST DEFAULT

	(A)


	                              

	in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any Security of that series as specified in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 8.1 hereof and not yet cured; or



	 




	(B)


	                              

	with respect to any covenant or provision hereof which, under Article XI, cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of that series affected.



	 




	Upon any such waiver, such Default or Event of Default shall cease to exist, and any other Default or Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default with respect to the Securities of that series or impair the exercise of any right arising therefrom.  The Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers Certificate stating that the requisite percentage of Holders have consented to such waiver and attaching copies of such consents (or other evidence of such consents as may be reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee).




	 




	This Section 8.12 shall be in lieu of TIA §§ 316(a)(1)(A) and 316(a)(1)(B) and such sections of the TIA are hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA.

	UNDERTAKING FOR COSTS



	 




	All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security of any series by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture with respect to the Security of that series, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it as Trustee with respect to that series, any court may in its discretion require the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section 8.13 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder of the Security of that series, or group of Holders of the Security of that series, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Security of that series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder of that series for enforcement of the payment of principal of, or premium (if any), or

	SECTION 8.14.


	                                                          

	RESTORATION OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES



	 




	If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture with respect to any Security of any series and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and all Holders of the Security of that series shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.




	 




	SECTION 8.15.


	                                                          

	WAIVER OF STAY, EXTENSION OR USURY LAWS.



	 




	The Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) shall not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury or other similar law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on the Securities contemplated herein or that may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and shall not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

	38













	 




	(2)

	provided, however

	, in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).

	(e)


	                                 

	The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its sole discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit and shall incur no liability or additional liability of any kind by reason of such inquiry or investigation.



	 




	(f)


	                                  

	The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Holders, pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby.



	 




	(g)


	                                 

	Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this Indenture, any demand, request, direction or notice from the Company shall be sufficient if signed by an Officer of the Company, as applicable.



	 




	(h)


	                                

	The Trustee shall have no duty to inquire as to the performance of the Companys covenants in Article VI hereof or as to the performance by any Agent of its duties hereunder.

	(i)


	                                    

	Whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officers Certificate, an Opinion of Counsel, or both.



	 



	40













	 




	(j)

	SECTION 9.5.


	                                                                 

	NOTICE OF DEFAULT



	 




	If a Default or an Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to Securities of any series and if it is known to the Trustee as provided in Section 9.2(h) hereof, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder of that series notice of the uncured Default or Event of Default within 90 days after such Default or Event of Default occurs.  Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Security (including payments pursuant to the mandatory redemption provisions of any Security, if any), the Trustee may withhold the notice if it in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interest of the Holders.

The Trustee also shall comply with TIA §§ 313(b) and 313(c).




	 




	The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing if the Securities of any series become listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system or of any delisting thereof.




	 




	A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders shall be mailed to the Company and filed with the SEC and each securities exchange, if any, on which any Securities are listed.




	 




	SECTION 9.7.


	                                                                 

	COMPENSATION AND INDEMNITY



	 




	The Company agrees to pay to the Trustee (in its capacity as such) from time to time such compensation for its services as the Company and the Trustee shall from time to time agree in writing. The Trustees compensation shall not be limited by any law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust. In addition to such compensation for services, the Company shall promptly reimburse the Trustee (and any predecessor Trustee with respect to all matters and events existing or alleged to exist on or prior to the date such person ceased to be a Trustee) upon request for all reasonable disbursements, expenses (including costs of collection) and advances actually incurred or made by it in accordance with this Indenture or carrying out its duties hereunder.  Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustees agents, accountants, experts and counsel.




	 




	The Company agrees to indemnify, defend and protect each of the Trustee (in any capacity under this Indenture including as Trustee, Agent or Securities Custodian) and each predecessor Trustee and each of its officers, directors, attorneys-in-fact and agents for, and hold each of them harmless against, any claim, demand, expense (including but not limited to reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustees agents and counsel), loss or liability incurred by it without negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance and the administration of this trust and its rights or duties hereunder, including, without limitation, the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself against any investigation, claim or liability (whether asserted by the Company, any Holder or any other person) in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim asserted against the Trustee for which it may seek indemnity;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that any failure to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its indemnity obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall provide reasonable cooperation at the Companys expense in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel;

	provided

	that the Company will not be required to pay such fees and expenses if it assumes the Trustees defense and if the Trustee is advised by its counsel that there is no conflict of interest between the Company and the Trustee in connection with such defense. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its




	 



	42













	 




	written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability to the extent incurred by the Trustee through its negligence or willful misconduct.




	 




	To secure the Companys payment obligations in this Section 9.7, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities of any series on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay principal of, premium (if any) and interest on particular Securities of any series.




	 




	When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default related to the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.




	 




	The Companys obligations under this Section 9.7 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee, the discharge of the Companys obligations pursuant to Article X of this Indenture and any rejection or termination of this Indenture under any Bankruptcy Law.




	 




	SECTION 9.8.


	                                                                 

	REPLACEMENT OF TRUSTEE



	 




	The Trustee may resign by so notifying the Company in writing. The Holder or Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any series may remove the Trustee with respect to that series by so notifying the Company and the Trustee in writing at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such removal and may appoint a successor trustee with the Companys consent. The Company may remove the Trustee with respect to any series of Securities if:




	 




	(a)


	                                

	the Trustee fails to comply with Section 9.10 hereof;



	 




	(b)


	                                

	the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;



	 




	(c)


	                                 

	a receiver, Custodian or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or



	 




	(d)


	                                

	the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.



	 




	If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason with respect to Securities of any series, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.

	its succession to each Holder of the affected series at the current address of each such Holder as set forth in the Security Register.




	 




	If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed with respect to Securities of any series, the retiring Trustee (at the Companys cost and expense), the Company or the Holder or Holders of at least 10% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of that series may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.




	 




	If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 9.10 hereof, any Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.




	 




	Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 9.8, the Companys obligations under Section 9.7 hereof shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.




	 




	The retiring Trustee shall have no responsibility or liability for any action or inaction of a successor Trustee.

	with such conflict or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the TIA and this Indenture.  To the extent permitted by the TIA, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest by virtue of being a trustee under this Indenture with respect to Securities, or a trustee under any other indenture between the Company and the Trustee.

	SECTION 10.1.


	                                                          

	OPTION TO EFFECT LEGAL DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE



	 




	The Company may elect to have Section 10.2, at the Companys option and at any time, or Section 10.3, at the Companys option and at any time, of this Indenture applied to all Outstanding Securities of any series upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article X.




	 




	SECTION 10.2.


	                                                          

	LEGAL DEFEASANCE AND DISCHARGE



	 




	Upon the Companys exercise under Section 10.1 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 10.2 with respect to the Outstanding Securities of any series, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all Outstanding Securities as to which this option provided in Section 10.1 is exercised and the Guarantors, if any, shall be released from the Guarantees with respect to all such Outstanding Securities, on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter,

	Legal Defeasance

	). For this purpose, such Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Outstanding Securities and this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect as to all such Outstanding Securities, except as to be deemed to be Outstanding only for the purposes of the Sections of this Indenture referred to in (a) and (b) below, and the Company shall be deemed to have satisfied all other of its obligations under such Outstanding Securities and this Indenture with respect to such Securities (and the Trustee, on written demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of Outstanding Securities to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities when such payments are due from the trust described in Section 10.5, (b) the Companys obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.10, 6.2, 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7 hereof, and (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder, and the Companys obligations in connection therewith. Subject to compliance with this Article X, the Company may exercise its option under this Section 10.2 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 10.3 hereof with respect to such Securities.




	 




	SECTION 10.3.


	                                                          

	COVENANT DEFEASANCE



	 




	Upon the Companys exercise under Section 10.1 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 10.3 with respect to the Outstanding Securities of any series, the Company shall be




	 



	45













	 




	released from its obligations under any covenants provided pursuant to Section 3.1(18) and the covenants contained in Sections 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 and Article VII hereof, and the Guarantors, if any, shall be released from the Guarantees, with respect to all Outstanding Securities as to which this option provided in Section 10.1 is exercised, on and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter,

	Covenant Defeasance

	), and such Outstanding Securities shall thereafter be deemed not Outstanding for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed Outstanding for all other purposes hereunder. For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding Securities of any series as to which the Covenant Defeasance has occurred, the Company shall not need to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant with respect to such Securities, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 8.1(iii) with respect to such Securities, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.




	 




	SECTION 10.4.


	                                                          

	CONDITIONS TO LEGAL OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE



	 




	The following shall be the conditions to the application of either Section 10.2 or 10.3 hereof to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, to be defeased:




	 




	(a)


	                                

	(i)  The Company shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities as to which Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will occur, U.S. legal tender, U.S. Government Obligations, a combination thereof, or other obligations as may be provided as contemplated by Section 3.1(15) with respect to such Securities, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities on the stated date for payment thereof or on the redemption date of such principal or installment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Securities, and the Holders of such Securities must have a valid, perfected, exclusive security interest in such trust; (ii) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that: (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by the Internal Revenue Service, a ruling or (B) since the date of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of such Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; (iii) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to such Trustee confirming that the Holders of such Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; (iv) no Default or Event of Default with respect to such Securities shall have occurred



	 



	46













	 




	and be continuing on the date of such deposit or insofar as Events of Default from bankruptcy or insolvency events are concerned, at any time in the period ending on the 91st day after the date of deposit; (v) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under this Indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound; (vi) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders of such Securities over any other creditors of the Company or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any other creditors of the Company or others; and (vii) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that the conditions precedent provided for in, in the case of the Officers Certificate, (i) through (vi) and, in the case of the Opinion of Counsel, clauses (i) (with respect to the validity and perfection of the security interest), (ii), (iii) and (v) of this paragraph have been complied with and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel (which may contain customary qualifications and exceptions, including, without limitation, an assumption that there has been no intervening bankruptcy of the Company between the date of deposit and the 91


	st

	 day following the deposit and an assumption that no Holder of such Securities is an insider of the Company under applicable Federal bankruptcy law), after the 91

	st

	 day following the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect of any applicable Federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and the creation of the defeasance trust does not violate the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Covenant Defeasance or Legal Defeasance will be effective on the earlier of (i) the 91st day after the date of deposit, and (ii) the day on which all the conditions above have been satisfied.



	 




	(b)


	                                

	If the funds deposited with the Trustee to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities to be so defeased when due, then the obligations of the Company under this Indenture with respect to such Securities will be revived and no such defeasance will be deemed to have occurred.



	 




	SECTION 10.5.


	                                                          

	DEPOSITED CASH AND U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS TO BE HELD IN TRUST; OTHER MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS



	 




	Subject to Section 10.6 hereof, all cash and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee or the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 10.4 hereof in respect of any Securities to be defeased shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee or the Paying Agent, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any other Paying Agent as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.




	 




	The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 10.4 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of such Securities.

	SECTION 10.6.


	                                                          

	REPAYMENT TO THE COMPANY



	 




	(a)


	                                

	Anything in this Article X to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee or the Paying Agent shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the written request of the Company any cash or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 10.4 hereof which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section 10.4(a) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.



	 




	(b)


	                                

	Any cash and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Securities and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its written request; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money shall thereupon cease;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, shall at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in the

	New York Times

	and

	The Wall Street Journal

	(national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.



	 




	SECTION 10.7.


	                                                          

	REINSTATEMENT



	 




	If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any cash or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 10.2 or 10.3 hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Companys obligations under this Indenture with respect to such Securities affected and such Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 10.2 or 10.3 hereof until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply such money in accordance with Sections 10.2 and 10.3 hereof, as the case may be;

	provided, however

	, that, if the Company makes any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any such Security following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the cash or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

	(5)


	                                

	if any Security provides that the Holder may require the Company to repurchase or convert such Security, impair such Holders right to require repurchase or conversion of such Security on the terms provided therein.



	 




	A Supplemental Indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of that series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.

	It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 11.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.




	 




	After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall deliver to the Holders affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to deliver such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such Supplemental Indenture or waiver.




	 




	After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 11.2 or under Section 11.4 hereof becomes effective, it shall bind each Holder.




	 




	In connection with any amendment, supplement or waiver under this Article XI, the Company may, but shall not be obligated to, offer to any Holder who consents to such amendment, supplement or waiver, or to all Holders, consideration for such Holders consent to such amendment, supplement or waiver.




	 




	SECTION 11.3.


	                                                          

	COMPLIANCE WITH TIA



	 




	Every amendment, waiver or supplement of this Indenture or the Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.




	 




	SECTION 11.4.


	                                                          

	REVOCATION AND EFFECT OF CONSENTS



	 




	Until an amendment, waiver or supplement becomes effective with respect to any Security of any series, a consent to it by a Holder of that series is a continuing consent by such Holder and every subsequent Holder of such Security or portion of such Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holders Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any such Security. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to such Security or portion of such Security by written notice to the Company or the Person designated by the Company as the Person to whom consents should be sent if such revocation is received by the Company or such Person before the date on which the Trustee receives an Officers Certificate certifying that the Holders of the requisite principal amount of the




	 



	52













	 




	Outstanding Securities affected have consented (and not theretofore revoked such consent) to the amendment, supplement or waiver.




	 




	The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver, which record date shall be the date so fixed by the Company notwithstanding the provisions of the TIA. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date, and only those Persons (or their duly designated proxies), shall be entitled to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date.




	 




	After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder of the Security of the affected series, unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1) through (5) of Section 11.2 hereof, in which case, the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind only each Holder of a Security of that series who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of such Security or portion of such Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holders Security;

	provided

	that any such waiver shall not impair or affect the right of any Holder of that series to receive payment of principal and premium of and interest on such Security, on or after the respective dates set for such amounts to become due and payable expressed in such Security, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates.




	 




	SECTION 11.5.


	                                                          

	NOTATION ON OR EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES



	 




	Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any Supplemental Indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Company, bear a notation in form approved by the Company as to any matter provided for in such Supplemental Indenture. If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security of any series, the Company may require such Holder of the Security of that series to deliver it to the Trustee or require such Holder to put an appropriate notation on such Security. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on such Security about the changed terms and return it to such Holder. Alternatively, if the Company so determines, the Company in exchange for the affected Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security of the same series that reflects the changed terms. Any failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment, supplement or waiver.




	 




	SECTION 11.6.


	                                                          

	TRUSTEE TO SIGN AMENDMENTS, ETC.



	 




	The Trustee shall execute any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article XI;

	provided

	that the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, execute any such amendment, supplement or waiver which affects the Trustees own rights, liabilities, duties or immunities under this Indenture. The Trustee shall receive, and shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article XI is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and that such amendment, supplement or waiver is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar

	laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles).




	 





	ARTICLE XII








	GUARANTEES





	 




	SECTION 12.1.


	                                                          

	GUARANTEES



	 




	Any series of Securities may be guaranteed by one or more of the Subsidiaries of the Company or other Persons. The terms and the form of any such Guarantee will be established in the manner contemplated by Section 3.1 for the particular series of Securities.  Each Guarantor, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, will fully, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee, to each Holder of Securities of such series (including each Holder of Securities of such series issued under the Indenture after the date of this Indenture) and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns (i) the full and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the Securities of such series when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, and all other monetary obligations of the Company under this Indenture (including obligations to the Trustee) with respect to such series of Securities and (ii) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under this Indenture with respect to such series of Securities.




	 




	(a)


	                                

	Each of the Guarantors further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional irrespective of the absence or existence of any action to enforce the same, the recovery of any judgment against the Company or any other Guarantor (except to the extent such judgment is paid) or any waiver or amendment of the provisions of this Indenture or the Securities to the extent that any such action or any similar action would otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor (except that each such waiver or amendment shall be effective in accordance with its terms).



	 




	(b)


	                                

	Each of the Guarantors further agrees that each Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance and not merely of collection.



	 




	(c)


	                                 

	Each of the Guarantors further agrees to waive presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to the Company or any other Person, and also waives diligence, notice of acceptance of its Guarantee, presentment, demand for payment, notice of protest for nonpayment, the filing of claims with a court in the event of merger or bankruptcy of the Company or any other Person and any right to require a proceeding first against the Company or any other Person.  The obligations of the Guarantors shall not be affected by any failure or policy on the part of the Trustee to exercise any right or remedy under this Indenture or the Securities of any series.



	 




	(d)


	                                

	The obligation of each Guarantor to make any payment hereunder may be satisfied by causing the Company or any other Person to make such payment.  If any Holder of any Security or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company or any Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to any of the Company or any Guarantor, any amount paid by any of them to the Trustee or such



	 



	54











	 




	Holder, the Guarantee of such Guarantor, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.




	 




	(e)


	                                 

	Each Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder of Securities in enforcing any of their respective rights under its Guarantees.



	 




	(f)


	                                  

	Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of each of the Guarantees shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Guarantee under this Indenture voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.



	 





	ARTICLE XIII








	MISCELLANEOUS





	 




	SECTION 13.1.


	                                                          

	TIA CONTROLS



	 




	If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies, or conflicts with the duties imposed by operation of the TIA, the imposed duties, upon qualification of this Indenture under the TIA, shall control.  If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the TIA which may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be.




	 




	SECTION 13.2.


	                                                          

	FORM OF DOCUMENTS DELIVERED TO TRUSTEE



	 




	In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.




	 




	Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate or opinion of, or representation by, counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Company stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.




	 



	55













	 




	Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.




	 




	SECTION 13.3.


	                                                          

	ACTS OF HOLDERS; RECORD DATES



	 




	Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the 

	Act

	 of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 9.1) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.




	 




	The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.




	 




	The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.




	 




	Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.




	 




	The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of that series;

	provided

	that the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date;

	provided

	that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of that series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to




	 



	56













	 




	prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be canceled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 13.4.




	 




	The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any notice of default pursuant to Section 9.5, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Article VIII, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Article VIII or (iv) any direction referred to in Article VIII, in each case with respect to Securities of that series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of that series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date;

	provided

	that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of that series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be canceled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Companys expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 13.4.




	 




	With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any day as the 

	Expiration Date

	 and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day;

	provided

	that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 13.4, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date.




	 




	Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.

	SECTION 13.10.


	                                                   

	GOVERNING LAW; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL AND CONSENT TO JURISDICTION



	 




	THIS INDENTURE AND THE SECURITIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AS APPLIED TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED WITHIN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW AND RULE 327(b) OF THE NEW YORK CIVIL PRACTICE LAWS AND RULES, AND WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.




	 




	EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE HOLDERS AND THE TRUSTEE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS INDENTURE, THE SECURITIES OR THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.




	 



	60













	 




	To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any Federal or State court located in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York, New York in any suit, action or proceeding based on or arising out of or relating to this Indenture or any Securities and irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such suit or proceeding may be determined in any such court.  The Company irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in an inconvenient forum.  The Company agrees that final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court shall be conclusive and binding upon the Company, and may be enforced in any courts to the jurisdiction of which the Company is subject by a suit upon such judgment, provided, that service of process is effected upon the Company in the manner specified herein or as otherwise permitted by law.




	 




	The Company has appointed CT Corporation System, 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011 as its authorized agent (the Authorized Agent) upon whom process may be served in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or based upon this Indenture, any Security or the transactions contemplated herein or thereby which may be instituted in any State or Federal court in The City of New York, New York, and expressly accepts the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any such court in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding.  The Company further agrees to take any and all action as may be necessary to maintain such designation and appointment of such agent in full force and effect for a period of ten years from the date of this Indenture.  If for any reason CT Corporation System shall cease to be available to act as such authorized agent for the Company, the Company agrees to designate a new agent in the State of New York on the terms and for the purpose of this Section 13.10.  The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Authorized Agent has accepted such appointment and has agreed to act as said agent for service of process, and the Company agrees to take any and all action, including the filing of any and all documents that may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and effect as aforesaid.  Service of process upon the Authorized Agent shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of process upon the Company.




	 




	To the extent that the Company has or hereafter may acquire any immunity (sovereign or otherwise) from any legal action, suit or proceeding, from jurisdiction of any court or from set off or any legal process (whether service of notice, attachment in aid of or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, it hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim such immunity in respect of its obligations under this Indenture or any Securities.

	(b)


	                                

	The Company agrees to indemnify each Holder against any loss incurred by such Holder as a result of any judgment or order being given or made against the Company for any U.S. dollar amount due under this Indenture and such judgment or order being expressed and paid in a currency (the Judgment Currency) other than U.S. dollars and as a result of any variation as between (i) the rate of exchange at which the U.S. dollar amount is converted into the Judgment Currency for the purpose of such judgment or order and (ii) the then current Exchange Rate.

	Registration Statement on Form S-3: Exhibit 5.1 Opinion





	Ladies
	and Gentlemen:




	        We
	have acted as special counsel as to matters of the law of the Republic of the Marshall Islands ("



	Marshall Islands Law



	") for Transocean
	Partners LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company (the "



	Company



	"), in connection with the preparation and filing with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission (the "



	Commission



	"), pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "



	Securities
	Act



	"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "



	Rules



	"), of a registration statement on Form S-3 (the
	"



	Registration Statement



	") for the registration of the issuance from time to time of (i) common units to be issued by the Company (the
	"



	Common Units



	") each representing limited liability company interests in the Company, (ii) other classes of units to be issued by the Company
	(the "



	General Units



	") each representing limited liability company interests in the Company, (iii) debt securities to be issued by the Company
	(the "



	Debt Securities



	") pursuant to a form of indenture in substantially the form filed as Exhibit 4.4 to the Registration Statement (the
	"



	Indenture



	"), including Debt Securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Units or General Units and (iv) guarantees by subsidiaries of
	the Company of payments of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, one or more series of Debt Securities (the "



	Guarantees



	" and
	collectively with the Common Units, the General Units and the Debt Securities, the "

	forth in the Registration Statement, the prospectus contained therein (the "



	Prospectus



	") and supplements to the Prospectus (the
	"



	Prospectus Supplements



	").




	        In
	rendering this opinion, we have examined originals or photocopies of all such documents, including (i) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, (ii) the Indenture,
	(iii) the certificate of formation of the Company dated February 6, 2014 and the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Company dated as of

	other papers, documents and certificates of public officials and certificates of representatives of the Company

	as
	we have deemed necessary. In such examination, we have assumed (a) the legal capacity of each natural person, (b) the genuineness of all signatures and the authenticity of all
	documents submitted to us as originals, (c) the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as conformed or photostatic copies, (d) that the documents reviewed by
	us in connection with the rendering of the opinion set forth herein are true, correct and complete and (e) the truthfulness of each statement as to all factual matters contained in any document
	or certificate encompassed within the due diligence review undertaken by us. We have also assumed the power, authority and legal right of all parties (other than the Company) to the Registration
	Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto (including any necessary post-effective amendments), and all parties to the Indenture (other than the Company), to enter into and perform their
	respective obligations thereunder, and the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture by all parties thereto. We have further assumed
	the validity and enforceability of all documents under all applicable laws other than Marshall Islands Law. As to any questions of fact material to our opinion, we have, when relevant facts were not
	independently established, relied upon the aforesaid certificates.




	        We
	have also assumed that (i) the Registration Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto (including any necessary post-effective amendments) shall have become effective
	under the Securities Act, (ii) a Prospectus Supplement shall have been prepared and filed with the Commission describing the Securities offered thereby, (iii) the Securities shall be
	issued and sold in compliance with applicable U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and in the manner stated in the Registration Statement and the applicable Prospectus Supplement, (iv) a
	definitive purchase, underwriting or similar agreement with respect to any Securities offered will have been duly authorized and validly executed and delivered by the applicable registrants and the
	other parties thereto, (v) any Securities offered by the Company, including any Securities of the Company issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of any other Security being offered,
	will have been duly authorized and the definitive terms thereof, other than Common Units, will have been duly created and established (including, if necessary, by amending the Organizational Documents
	or by adopting and fixing an appropriate certificate of designations or similar instrument), and, if appropriate, reserved for issuance upon such conversion, exchange or exercise, all in accordance
	with resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Organizational Documents and applicable law and described in a Prospectus Supplement, and (vi) the Securities offered by the
	Company will be issued and delivered against receipt of the consideration approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and the certificates, if any, evidencing the same will be duly executed and
	delivered.




	        With
	respect to the issuance and sale of any Debt Securities or Guarantees of the Company, we have further assumed that (i) the Indenture will have been duly executed and
	delivered by the Company and the trustee named therein (the "



	Trustee



	") substantially in the form examined by us and any applicable supplemental
	indenture will have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and the Trustee in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indenture regarding the creation, execution and delivery of any
	supplemental indenture to the Indenture and (ii) such Debt Securities or Guarantees, when issued, will be executed, authenticated (as applicable), issued and delivered as provided in the
	Indenture with respect thereto.




	        This
	opinion is limited to Marshall Islands Law and is as of the date hereof. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to advise of any development or circumstance of any kind, including
	any change of law or fact that may occur after the date of this opinion letter that might affect the opinion expressed herein.








	Page 3




	        Based
	on the foregoing and having regard to legal considerations which we deem relevant, and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the
	opinion that:






	1.




	The
	Company is validly existing under Marshall Islands Law.






	2.




	The
	Company has the limited liability company power to enter into the Indenture.






	3.




	When
	the terms of the issuance and sale thereof have been duly authorized and approved by the Company, and when issued and delivered against payment therefor
	in accordance with the terms of the Organizational Documents, the applicable purchase, underwriting or similar agreement and the Registration Statement, Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement, the
	Common Units will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.






	4.




	When
	the terms of the issuance and sale thereof have been duly authorized and approved by the Company, and when issued and delivered against payment therefor
	in accordance with the terms of the Organizational Documents, the applicable purchase, underwriting or similar agreement and the Registration Statement, Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement, the
	General Units will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.






	5.




	Upon
	the due execution and delivery of the Indenture by the parties thereto substantially in the form examined by us, when (a) the specific terms of a
	particular Debt Security have been duly authorized by the Company and established in accordance with the Indenture, and (b) such Debt Security has been duly executed, authenticated, issued for
	value and delivered in accordance with the Indenture, and if the Debt Securities are convertible into Common Units or General Units, then such resulting Common Units or General Units will be (subject
	to compliance with the requirements set forth in Paragraphs 3 and 4 above) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.






	        We
	consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, the discussion of this opinion in the Registration Statement and to the references to our firm in
	the Prospectus. In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or related Rules nor do we

	Re:
	Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3




	Ladies
	and Gentlemen:




	        We
	are acting as counsel to Transocean Partners LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (the "Company"), and Transocean
	RIGP DCL LLC, Transocean RIGP DD3 LLC and Transocean RIGP DIN LLC, each a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware and a majority owned
	subsidiary of the Company and each a guarantor of Debt Securities (as defined herein) (the "Subsidiary Guarantors," and together with the Company the "Transocean Entities"), in connection with the
	filing by the Transocean Entities and other subsidiaries of the Company of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
	"Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). This opinion letter is being furnished to you at your request in accordance with the requirements of Item 16
	of Form S-3 and Item 601(b)(5) of the Commission's Regulation S-K.




	        The
	Registration Statement relates to the proposed offer and sale from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of the following
	securities:






	1.




	common
	units of the Company (the "Common Units"), each representing limited liability company interests in the Company and including those initially issuable
	upon exercise, settlement, exchange or conversion of other Securities that are exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into Common Units;






	2.




	other
	classes of units of the Company (the "General Units"), each representing limited liability company interests in the Company and including those
	initially issuable upon exercise, settlement, exchange or conversion of other Securities that are exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into General Units (together with the Common Units, the
	"Units");






	3.




	debt
	securities of the Company, which may be either senior or subordinated, including Debt Securities that are exchangeable for or convertible into Units
	(the "Debt Securities");






	4.




	guarantees
	by one or more of the Subsidiary Guarantors of payments of the principal of, and any premium and interest on, one or more series of the Debt
	Securities (the "Guarantees");

	August 6, 2015

	Page 2






	5.




	guarantees
	by one or more other subsidiaries of the Company of payments of the principal of, and any premiums and interest on, one or more securities of the
	Debt Securities (together with the Units, the Debt Securities and the Guarantees, the "Primary Securities"); and






	6.




	a
	total of 21,254,310 Common Units owned by Transocean Ltd., an affiliate of the Company, as the selling securityholder named in the Registration
	Statement (together with the Primary Securities, the "Securities").






	        The
	Securities will be offered in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined in light of market conditions at the time of sale and to be set forth in supplements to the prospectus
	contained in the Registration Statement (each a "Prospectus Supplement"). Each series of Debt Securities, together with any related guarantees, is to be issued pursuant to an indenture, as amended or
	supplemented from time to time, between the Company and a trustee to be appointed by the Company, with such indenture is to be substantially in the form filed as an exhibit to the Registration
	Statement or as an exhibit to a document subsequently filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and incorporated into the Registration Statement by reference.




	        In
	rendering the opinions set forth below, we have considered such matters of law and of fact, and have examined and relied upon such records and documents of the Transocean Entities,
	including, without limitation, the organizational documents of the Transocean Entities, resolutions adopted by the members, boards of managers or directors or other governing bodies (including duly
	authorized committees thereof) or controlling entities of the Transocean Entities, the form of indenture filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, certificates of officers and other
	representatives of the
	Transocean Entities and certificates of public officials, as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth. In such examinations, we have assumed the genuineness of all
	signatures, the legal competence of all natural persons who execute any documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents
	submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic, electronic or telefacsimile copies, and the proper issuance and accuracy of certificates of public officials and officers and agents of the
	Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors. Except to the extent expressly set forth herein, we have made no independent investigation with regard to matters of fact, and, accordingly, we do not express
	any opinion as to matters that might have been disclosed by independent verification.




	        We
	have assumed with your permission that (i) the Registration Statement (including any post-effective amendment) shall have become effective under the Securities Act and that the
	Primary Securities will be offered and sold in the manner stated in the Registration Statement and the applicable Prospectus Supplement; (ii) the Company at the time of sale of any Units or
	Debt Securities by it, and each Subsidiary Guarantor at the time of issuance of any Guarantee by it, will be duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their respective
	jurisdictions, with the limited liability company power and authority to issue such Units, Debt Securities or Guarantees and to enter into all requisite agreements in connection therewith;
	(iii) all Units and Debt Securities issuable by the Company, including all Units and Debt Securities issuable upon exercise, settlement, exchange or conversion of any other Units or Debt
	Securities being offered, will have been duly authorized, established and reserved for issuance (as appropriate); and (iv) an indenture with respect to any Debt Securities and any related
	Guarantees offered and a purchase, underwriting or similar agreement with respect thereto will have been duly authorized and validly executed and delivered by the Company and any Subsidiary Guarantor,
	as applicable, and the other parties thereto. Further, to the extent that the obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor under any indenture may depend upon such matters, we have assumed
	with your permission that at the time of execution thereof: (v) the trustee

	Partners LLC

	will
	be duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization; (vi) the trustee will have the requisite organizational and legal power and
	authority to
	perform its obligations under the indenture; (vii) the indenture will have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company or Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, and by the trustee
	and will constitute the valid and binding obligation of the trustee, enforceable against the trustee in accordance with its terms; and (viii) the trustee will be in compliance, with respect to
	acting as a trustee under the indenture, with all applicable laws and regulations.




	        We
	express no opinion herein with regard to any laws other than (i) the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and (ii) the laws of the State of New York as they relate to
	the enforceability of documents, agreements and instruments referred to herein, which in all cases are normally applicable in our experience to transactions of the type contemplated by the
	Registration Statement.




	        This
	opinion letter is provided for use solely in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Registration Statement and may not be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise relied
	upon for any other purpose without our express written consent. No opinion may be implied or inferred beyond the opinions expressly stated in numbered paragraphs 1 and 2 below. We note
	specifically that the Debt Securities and the Guarantees may be issued from time to time on a delayed or continuous basis, and our opinions expressed herein are limited to the applicable laws,
	including the related rules and regulations, in effect on the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to advise you of any changes in applicable law or any other matters that may come to our attention
	after the date hereof that may affect our opinions expressed herein.




	        Based
	upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, it is our opinion that:





	        1.



	    Debt Securities.



	    When (a) appropriate limited liability company action has been taken by the Company
	to authorize the form and terms of any series of Debt Securities and to approve the issuance and terms of the offering of the Debt Securities and related matters in accordance with any applicable
	indenture and so as not to violate any applicable law, rule or regulation or result in a default under or breach of any agreement or instrument binding upon the Company and so as to comply with any
	requirement or restriction imposed by any court or governmental body having jurisdiction over the Company, (b) any such Debt Securities have been duly authenticated in accordance with the
	applicable indenture and such Debt Securities have been issued (i) in accordance with the applicable indenture and the applicable definitive purchase, underwriting or similar agreement approved
	by the Board of Directors of the Company or (ii) upon exercise, settlement, exchange or conversion of any Units or other Debt Securities in accordance with the terms thereof or the related
	governing instrument providing for such exercise, settlement, exchange or conversion as approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, and (c) the Company has received the consideration
	approved by the Board of Directors for the Company Debt Securities as provided in the applicable indenture and other applicable agreements, then, upon the happening of such events, such Debt
	Securities will be validly issued and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, moratorium and other laws
	relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and to the limitation that the enforceability thereof (including by means of specific performance) may be subject to certain
	equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which proceedings may be brought, including traditional equitable defenses such as waiver, laches and estoppel; good faith and fair
	dealing; reasonableness; materiality of the breach; impracticability or impossibility of performance; and the effect of obstruction or failure to perform

	or
	otherwise act in accordance with an agreement by any person other than the obligor thereunder (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) (the "Bankruptcy and Equity
	Exception").





	        2.



	    Guarantees.



	    When (a) appropriate limited liability company action has been taken by a Subsidiary
	Guarantor to authorize the form and terms of any series of Guarantees by such Subsidiary Guarantor and to approve the issuance and terms of the offering of such Guarantee and related matters in
	accordance with any applicable indenture and so as not to violate any applicable law, rule or regulation or result in a default under or breach of any agreement or instrument binding upon such
	Subsidiary Guarantor and so as to comply with any requirement or restriction imposed by any court or governmental body having jurisdiction over such Subsidiary Guarantor and (b) such Guarantee
	has been issued in accordance with the applicable indenture and the applicable definitive purchase, underwriting or similar agreement approved by the members, board of managers or other governing body
	(including duly authorized committees thereof) or controlling entities, as applicable, of such Subsidiary Guarantor, then, upon the happening of such events, such Guarantees will be validly issued and
	will constitute valid and binding obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.





	        The
	opinions expressed above are also subject to the following:






	(i)




	The
	possible unenforceability of provisions requiring indemnification for violations of the securities laws;






	(ii)




	The
	possible unenforceability of provisions that waivers or consents by a party may not be given effect unless in writing or in compliance with particular
	requirements or that a person's course of dealing, course of performance or the like or failure or delay in taking action may not constitute a waiver of related rights or provisions or that one or
	more waivers may not under certain circumstances constitute a waiver of other matters of the same kind;






	(iii)




	The
	effect of course of dealing, course of performance or the like that would modify the terms of an agreement or the respective rights or obligations of
	the parties under an agreement;






	(iv)




	The
	possible unenforceability of provisions that determinations by a party or a party's designee are conclusive or deemed conclusive in the absence of
	commercial reasonableness or good faith;






	(v)




	The
	possible unenforceability of provisions permitting modifications or amendments of an agreement only in writing; and






	(vi)




	The
	possible unenforceability of provisions that the provisions of an agreement are severable.

	Dear
	Sirs






	Re: Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3





	        We are acting as counsel to Transocean Partners LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Republic of the
	Marshall Islands (the



	Company



	), and Transocean RIGP DCL Opco Limited, Transocean RIGP DD3 Opco Limited, Transocean RIGP DIN Opco Limited, Triton RIGP
	DCL Holding Limited, Triton RIGP DD3 Holding Limited and Triton RIGP DIN Holding Limited, each an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands of which the
	Company owns 51% of the equity interests and each a guarantor of Debt Securities (as defined herein) (the



	Subsidiary Guarantors



	and together with the
	Company, the



	Transocean Entities



	) in connection with the filing by the Transocean Entities and other subsidiaries of the Company of a Registration
	Statement on Form S-3 (the



	Registration Statement



	) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the



	Commission



	) under the United States
	Securities Act
	of 1933, as amended (the



	Securities Act



	). This opinion letter is being furnished to you at your request in connection with such filing.




	        The
	Registration Statement relates to the proposed offer and sale from time to time of certain securities (the



	Securities



	), including debt
	securities of the Company, which may be either senior or subordinated, including debt securities that are exchangeable for or convertible into limited liability company interests of the Company (the



	Debt
	Securities



	), and guarantees by one or more of the Subsidiary Guarantors of payments of the principal of, and any premium and interest on, one or
	more series of the Debt Securities (the



	Guarantees



	).




	        The
	Securities will be offered in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of sale and to be set forth in supplements to the prospectus contained in the Registration
	Statement (each a



	Prospectus Supplement



	). Each series of Debt Securities, together with any related Guarantees, is to be issued pursuant to an
	indenture, as amended or supplemented from time to time, between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, with such indenture to be substantially in the form filed as an
	exhibit to the Registration Statement.




	        In
	rendering the opinion set forth below, we have considered such matters of law and of fact as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinion hereinafter set forth herein. We
	have also examined a copy of the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association of each Subsidiary Guarantor as adopted on 24 July 2014 (the



	M&A



	), a copy of the Registration
	Statement and the form of indenture to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. In such examinations, we










	have
	assumed (and have not independently verified) the genuineness and completeness of all documents (and all signatures, initials, stamps or seals on them) and the conformity to original documents of
	all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic, electronic or telefacsimile copies and that the M&A of each Subsidiary Guarantor are, and at the time of issuance by any Guarantee
	by it, will be, in full force and effect and have not been and will not be amended or supplemented. We have also conducted a search of the Register of Writs and Other Originating Process maintained by
	the Clerk of the Court of the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands in respect of each Subsidiary Guarantor.




	        We
	have assumed with your permission that (i) the Registration Statement (including any post-effective amendment) shall have become effective under the Securities Act and that the
	Securities will be offered and sold in the manner stated in the Registration Statement and the applicable Prospectus Supplement; (ii) the Company at the time of sale of any Debt Securities by
	it, and each Subsidiary Guarantor at the time of issuance of any Guarantee by it, will be duly organized, validly existing and in
	good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions, with the power and authority to issue such Debt Securities or Guarantees and to enter into all requisite agreements in connection
	therewith; (iii) all Debt Securities issuable by the Company will have been duly authorized and established; (iv) an indenture with respect to any Debt Securities and any related
	Guarantees offered and a purchase, underwriting or similar agreement with respect thereto will have been duly authorized and validly executed and delivered by the Company and any Subsidiary Guarantor,
	as applicable, and the other parties thereto; (v) each party to the indenture and/or such purchase, underwriting or similar agreement will have entered into and delivered and will perform such
	documents in good faith, for commercial purposes, on arms length terms, for the purpose of carrying on its business and as principal on its own behalf and not on behalf of any other person or in any
	other capacity; and (vi) the opinion set out below will not be affected by any law or public policy of any foreign jurisdiction. Further, to the extent that the obligations of the Company or
	any Subsidiary Guarantor under any indenture may depend upon such matters, we have assumed with your permission that at the time of execution thereof: (vii) the trustee will be duly organized,
	validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization; (viii) the trustee will have the requisite organizational and legal power and authority to perform its
	obligations under the indenture; (ix) the indenture will have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company or Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, and by the trustee and will
	constitute the valid and binding obligation of the trustee, enforceable against the trustee in accordance with its terms; and (x) the trustee will be in compliance, with respect to acting as a
	trustee under the indenture, with all applicable laws and regulations.




	        This
	opinion is to be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Cayman Islands in force on the date of this opinion. This opinion is limited to the matters expressly
	stated in it. We have made no investigation and express no opinion with respect to the laws of any other jurisdiction.




	        This
	opinion is provided for use solely in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Registration Statement and may not be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise relied upon
	for any other purpose without our express written consent. No opinion may be implied or inferred beyond the opinion expressly stated in the following paragraph. Our opinion expressed herein is as of
	the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to advise you of any changes in applicable law or any other matters that may come to our attention after the date hereof that may affect our opinion
	expressed herein.




	        Based
	upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, it is our opinion that when (a) appropriate corporate action
	has been taken by a Subsidiary Guarantor to authorize the form and terms of any series of Guarantees by such Subsidiary Guarantor and to approve the issuance and terms of the offering of such
	Guarantee and related matters in accordance with any applicable indenture and so as not to violate any applicable law, rule or regulation or result in a default under or breach of any agreement or
	instrument binding upon such Subsidiary Guarantor and so as to comply with any requirement or restriction imposed by any court or governmental body having jurisdiction over such Subsidiary Guarantor
	and (b) such Guarantee has




	2










	been
	issued in accordance with the applicable indenture and the applicable definitive purchase, underwriting or similar agreement approved by the board of directors of such Subsidiary Guarantor,
	then, upon the happening of such events, such Guarantees will be validly issued and will constitute valid, binding and enforceable obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor, subject to all laws
	relating to bankruptcy, dissolution, insolvency, re-organisation, winding up, liquidation, moratorium and other laws of general application affecting the rights of creditors generally and to the
	following qualification regarding enforceability. The term



	enforceable



	in the context of this opinion means that the obligations are of a type which the
	courts of the Cayman Islands will enforce. It does not mean that those obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances or in accordance with their terms. In particular, but without
	limitation:






	(a)




	enforcement
	may be limited by general principles of equity;






	(b)




	some
	claims may become time barred or may be or become subject to rights and defences of set off, counterclaim, estoppel and similar defences;






	(c)




	where
	obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands, they may not be enforceable in the Cayman Islands to the extent that
	performance would be illegal under the laws of that jurisdiction;






	(d)




	obligations
	that may be regarded as penalties may not be enforceable;






	(e)




	the
	courts of the Cayman Islands may decline to exercise jurisdiction in relation to substantive proceedings brought under or in relation to any document in
	matters where they determine that such proceedings may be tried in a more appropriate forum;






	(f)




	any
	provision in any document that purports to fetter any statutory power may be unenforceable; and






	(g)




	enforcement
	of obligations may be invalidated by reason of mistake, frustration, fraud, duress, misrepresentation and/or undue influence.






	        For
	the purposes of this opinion, we have only examined the documents listed, and carried out the searches specified, in the fourth paragraph hereof. We have not examined any term or
	instrument incorporated by reference, or otherwise referred to, in any such document and we offer no opinion on any such term or instrument.




	        We
	offer no opinion: (a) on the commercial terms of any document or whether those terms reflect the intentions of the parties; (b) on any representation or warranty made or
	given in any document; (c) as to whether the parties will be able to perform their obligations under any document; or (d) the accuracy or reasonableness of any fact, statement and/or
	assumption in any document.




	        We
	consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the heading "Legal Matters" in the prospectus constituting a
	part thereof. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and
	regulations of the Commission thereunder.

	Dear
	Sirs






	Registration Statement on Form S-3: Exhibit 5.5 Opinion





	        We have acted as special counsel for Transocean Partners LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company (the
	"



	Company



	") and, at the Company's request, its indirect subsidiaries Triton RIPG DCL Holdco Limited, Triton RIPG DD3 Holdco Limited and Triton RIPG DIN
	Holdco Limited, each an English private limited company (each an "



	English Subsidiary



	" and together the "



	English
	Subsidiaries



	"), on matters of the law of England and Wales ("



	English Law



	"), in relation to the issue of this opinion in
	connection with the issue of guarantees by the English
	Subsidiaries relating to the preparation and filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "



	U.S. Commission



	"), pursuant to the
	United States Securities Act of 1933 as amended (the "



	Securities Act



	") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
	"



	Rules



	"), of a registration statement on Form S-3 (the "



	Registration Statement



	").







	   





















	Page 2





	        We
	understand that the Registration Statement is being prepared and filed for the registration of the issue from time to time of: (i) common units to be issued by the Company (the
	"



	Common Units



	") each representing limited liability company interests in the Company; (ii) other classes of units to be issued by the Company
	(the "



	General Units



	") each representing limited liability company interests in the
	Company; (iii) debt securities to be issued by the Company (the "



	Debt Securities



	") pursuant to a form of indenture in substantially the form
	filed as Exhibit 4.4 to the Registration Statement (the "



	Indenture



	"), including Debt Securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Units
	or General Units; and (iv) guarantees by the subsidiaries of the Company of payments of the principal of, and interest and premium (if any) on, one or more series of Debt Securities (the
	"



	Guarantees



	" and collectively with the Common Units, the General Units and the Debt Securities, the
	"



	Securities



	"). We further understand that the Securities will be issued from time to time as set forth in the Registration Statement, the prospectus
	contained therein (the "



	Prospectus



	") and supplements to the Prospectus (the "



	Prospectus Supplements



	").




	        This
	opinion is being delivered to you in relation to the English Subsidiaries, further details of which are set out in Schedule 1.




	        As
	such counsel and solely for the purposes of this opinion, we have examined the documents set out in paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 (the
	"



	Documents



	") and carried out the searches and enquiries referred to in paragraph 2 of Schedule 2 (the
	"



	Searches



	").




	        In
	this opinion references to "



	insolvency proceedings



	" include a winding-up, the appointment of a provisional liquidator, an
	administration (whether appointed by the court or out of court), a voluntary arrangement, a moratorium, and a scheme of arrangement, including any form of territorial, secondary or ancillary
	insolvency proceeding; also any form of receivership, whether the receiver is appointed by the court or otherwise; and any proceedings or procedure under the laws of a country other than England which
	is comparable to any of the foregoing.




	        On
	the basis of the assumptions set out in Schedule 3 and other matters set out herein and in reliance on the Documents and the Searches and subject to the qualifications set out
	in Schedule 4, we are of the opinion, so far as English Law is concerned, that:





	(a)




	based
	only on our inspection of the Searches and the Documents, each English Subsidiary is a private limited company incorporated with limited liability and
	is validly existing as a private limited company under English Law;






	(b)




	the
	Searches do not reveal that any English Subsidiary is in liquidation or administration or that a winding-up petition has been presented against any
	English Subsidiary;






	(c)




	when
	(i) the Board of Directors of each English Subsidiary has duly passed appropriate resolutions and obtained sufficient approval from the holders
	of the entire issued share capital of such English Subsidiary (the "



	Members



	") to authorise the form and terms of any series of Guarantees to be entered
	into by the English Subsidiary and to approve the issue and terms of the offering of such Guarantee and related matters in accordance with any applicable indenture and so as not to violate any
	applicable law, rule or regulation or result in a default under or breach of any agreement or instrument binding upon the relevant English Subsidiary and so as to comply with any requirement or
	restriction imposed by any court or governmental body having jurisdiction over such English Subsidiary and (ii) such Guarantee has been issued in accordance with the applicable indenture and
	the applicable definitive purchase, underwriting or similar agreement approved by the Members, Board of Directors (including duly authorised committees and/or attorneys thereof) of such English
	Subsidiary, then, upon the happening of such events, such Guarantees will be validly issued and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the relevant English Subsidiary.

	        Our
	responsibilities with regard to this opinion shall arise under English Law exclusively. We are providing this opinion on the strict understanding and condition
	that:





	(a)




	this
	opinion may be relied upon only for purposes directly connected with the Registration Statement and in relation to the subject matter of this opinion;






	(b)




	we
	are acting exclusively for the Company and the English Subsidiaries and we are not acting as legal advisers to any other person and no solicitor client
	relationship shall be established between any other person on the one hand, and us on the other; and






	(c)




	our
	sole and exclusive duty in providing this opinion to the Company and the English Subsidiaries is a duty to take reasonable care in ensuring that the
	opinions (based upon the assumptions and subject to the qualifications set out herein) in this opinion reflect the current English law position.





	        We
	are only providing this opinion on the strict understanding and condition that we will only be liable for any loss or damage to the extent that such loss or damage results directly
	and exclusively from our negligence but not otherwise.




	        All
	matters relating to this opinion will be governed by and construed in accordance with English law. The English courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to all disputes
	arising out of or in connection with this opinion.




	        We
	consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, the discussion of opinion in the Registration Statement and to the references to our firm in
	the Prospectus. In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or related Rules, nor do we
	admit that we are experts with respect to any part of the Registration Statement within the meaning of the term "expert" as used in the Securities Act or the related Rules.

	SCHEDULE 4


	QUALIFICATIONS






	        The following qualifications are not a comprehensive list of all relevant matters, but rather are representative of those issues
	generally considered to be within the purview of opinions of this type issued by English law firms in London. The qualifications to which this opinion is subject are as
	follows:





	(a)




	this
	opinion relates solely to matters of English Law in force on the date of this opinion, and is based on legislation published, and cases fully reported,
	before that date, and we assume no responsibility to update or supplement this opinion to reflect any developments or changes of law which may occur after the date of this opinion;






	(b)




	for
	the purposes of this opinion, we have not examined or reviewed any of the corporate or other records of the English Subsidiaries, other than the
	Documents, nor have we made any other enquiries concerning the English Subsidiaries or any other person apart from the Searches;






	(c)




	the
	Searches are not conclusive about the status of the English Subsidiaries or the existence of any insolvency proceedings. The reasons for this include,
	without limitation:






	(i)




	Companies
	House and the Central Registry are reliant on third parties to provide them with information;






	(ii)




	there
	may be a delay between the occurrence of an event (such as the passing of a resolution) and its notification to, and subsequent appearance on the
	public records of, Companies House and the Central Registry;






	(iii)




	records
	of certain insolvency proceedings (including, without limitation, an application for an administration order made to a County Court and certain
	proceedings relating to the appointment of an administrator out of court) are not kept by the Central Registry or Companies House; and






	(iv)




	insolvency
	proceedings commenced in a jurisdiction other than England will not be revealed by the Searches;








	(d)




	the
	jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which a company may be made subject to insolvency proceedings will be determined, where applicable, by European Union
	Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 (as amended). The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030; the Cross-Border Regulations), implementing in English law the UNCITRAL
	Model Law on cross-border insolvency, provide for recognition in England of foreign insolvency proceedings and co-operation between the English courts and foreign courts. A foreign company can be made
	subject to insolvency proceedings in England in certain circumstances. Finally, Section 426 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides for the English courts to assist foreign courts in specified
	jurisdictions in insolvency proceedings;






	(e)




	an
	administrator may be appointed on the application of a company, its directors or one or more creditors; and an administrator may also be appointed by a
	company or its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (the holder of security which includes a floating charge and which covers the whole or substantially all of a company's property)
	filing a notice of appointment with the court. One effect of an administration is a moratorium which precludes the commencement or continuation of legal proceedings against the company or any of its
	assets, or the taking of any step to enforce security over any asset of the company, without the administrator's consent or the court's permission. However, the moratorium does not apply to a
	financial collateral arrangement, as defined in Regulation 3 of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No 2) Regulations 2002.

	Ratio of earnings to fixed charges(d)

	(a)




	As
	a company with less than $1 billion in revenues during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart
	Our Business Startups Act of 2012. As an emerging growth company, we may, for up to five years, take advantage of specified exemptions from reporting and other regulatory requirements that are
	otherwise applicable generally to public companies. Among other exemptions, these include the presentation of only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management's
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the registration statement of an initial public offering of common equity securities and the reporting of incremental years
	in the succeeding years for purposes of providing selected financial data and earnings to fixed charges ratios.






	(b)




	For
	the periods prior to August 5, 2014, the date we completed our formation transactions and initial public offering, the ratio of earnings to fixed
	charges is calculated based on the combined financial information of the Transocean Partners LLC Predecessor (the "Predecessor"). The Predecessor represents 100 percent of the combined
	results of operations, assets and liabilities of the drilling units in the fleet (the "Predecessor Business"). Such combined financial information was derived from Transocean Ltd.'s accounting
	records and has been prepared as if the Predecessor Business had been combined for all such periods presented. The Predecessor did not incur fixed charges for any period prior to August 5,
	2014.












	(c)




	Interest
	expense excludes interest on unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, as such amounts are recognized in income tax expense and
	we did not recognize any such interest expense in the periods presented.






	(d)




	The
	ratio of earnings to fixed charges is calculated by dividing earnings by fixed charges. For this purpose, "earnings" is the amount resulting from adding
	(a) income from continuing operations before income tax expense, (b) fixed charges, (c) amortization of capitalized interest, and (d) distributed earnings of unconsolidated
	affiliates; and then subtracting (a) capitalized interest, (b) equity in earnings or losses of unconsolidated affiliates, and (c) the noncontrolling interest in pre-tax income of
	subsidiaries that have not incurred fixed charges. "Fixed charges" is the amount resulting from adding (a) interest expense, (b) amortization of debt discount or premium,
	(c) capitalized interest and (d) an estimate of the interest component of rent expense.
