Biography and contributions[edit]
James J. Jenkins (July 29, 1923 – November 17, 2012[1]), American psychology professor, played a significant role in the development of cognitive psychology.[2] Trained as an industrial psychologist, his early career was shaped by his Fellowship at the Social Science Research Council’s 1953 summer meeting that established the discipline of psycholinguistics.[3] He initially attempted to apply a modified version of behaviorism to the problems of language behavior, and while his “mediational” approach was very influential, he became convinced that it could not provide an adequate account of the structural nature of language as articulated by Noam Chomsky.[2][4][5] He continued research on language and cognition, eventually focusing on topics concerning speech perception (in collaboration with his wife, Winifred Strange). His research was marked by an interest in new and even radical ideas (e.g., those advocated by James J. Gibson), a keen appreciation of the value of studying real-world problems (as in his early research on aphasia[6]), and a willingness to give up cherished theories when the facts drove him to do so.[7] "If you're not making any progress toward understanding the problem," he said, "you've got to change."[2] He had an infectious enthusiasm for both research and teaching, and his impact on young psychologists was tremendous. He supervised 46 PhD students in his first academic position at the University of Minnesota[8] and through his career served as advisor or co-advisor of 82 PhD’s.[9][10] He is beloved by his students, whom he encouraged to follow their own diverse interests. His students made many important contributions to psychological research (as just one example, the influential work on abstraction in memory done by his students John Bransford and Jeffrey Franks[2][11]).
Academic career[edit]
Jenkins enlisted in the Army in 1942 and was trained as a meteorologist, receiving a B.S. in physics from the University of Chicago in 1944. After serving as a weatherman in the Army Air Forces in the U.S and the South Pacific, he returned to William Jewell College to earn an A.B. in psychology in 1947. He then earned a Ph.D. in psychology at the University of Minnesota in 1950, studying industrial psychology under Donald G. Paterson (who trained even more Ph.D.’s in his career than Jenkins did[8]). He remained at the University of Minnesota as a professor in the Psychology Department from 1950 to 1982. From 1965 to 1973, he was founding Director of the newly established Center for Research in Human Learning of the University of Minnesota, where he remained as Director of Training until 1982. In that year, he moved to the University of South Florida, first as Chair of the Department of Psychology, and then as Distinguished Research Professor until he became Emeritus in 2000. He served as an Adjunct Research Professor at the City University of New York from 2000 through 2008. He was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 1957–58 and 1964–65 (where he and a group of distinguished scholars ended a night-long celebration of their year together by attempting to watch the sun rise over the Pacific Ocean), and a Visiting Professor at the University of Colorado, Yale University, and the City University of New York.
Honors and professional activities[edit]
Jenkins is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Psychological Society/Association for Psychological Science, the American Psychological Association and the Acoustical Society of America. He is a member of the Society of Experimental Psychologists and the Psychonomic Society, the Midwestern and Southeastern Psychological Associations, the Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology, and the International Society for Ecological Psychology. He served as Chairman of the Society of Experimental Psychologists (1972–73), Chairman of the Psychonomic Society Board of Governors (1978–79), Chairman of the Board of Scientific Affairs of the American Psychological Association (1969–1971), President of the Midwestern Psychological Association (1967–68), President of Division 3 (Experimental) of the American Psychological Association (1973–74), among other contributions to professional societies. He was Consulting Editor, Associate Editor, or Editor of several major professional journals and member of several NIH and NIE grant panels, member of the National Research Council for four years, and Chairman of the Social Science Research Council Committee on Linguistics and Psychology (1960–1962). His academic honors include the previously mentioned Fellowships at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and the Social Science Research Council Fellowship at the seminal 1953 Social Science Research Council Summer Institute in Psycholinguistics, as well as an SSRC Faculty Fellowship, a Ford Foundation Faculty Grant, a Citation for Achievement from William Jewell College (1968), a Phi Kappa Phi (University of South Florida Chapter) Artist/Scholar Award (1985), a Sigma Xi (USF Chapter) Outstanding Research Award (1987), and an Outstanding Alumni Achievement Award from the University of Minnesota (2001).[12]

Gibson), a keen appreciation of the value of studying real-world problems (as in his early research on aphasia[6]), and a willingness to give up cherished theories when the facts drove him to do so.[7] "If you're not making any progress toward understanding the problem," he said, "you've got to change."[2] He had an infectious enthusiasm for both research and teaching, and his impact on young psychologists was tremendous. He supervised 46 PhD students in his first academic position at the University of Minnesota[8] and through his career served as advisor or co-advisor of 82 PhD’s.[9][10] He is beloved by his students, whom he encouraged to follow their own diverse interests. His students made many important contributions to psychological research (as just one example, the influential work on abstraction in memory done by his students John Bransford and Jeffrey Franks[2][11]).
Academic career[edit]
Jenkins enlisted in the Army in 1942 and was trained as a meteorologist, receiving a B.S. in physics from the University of Chicago in 1944. After serving as a weatherman in the Army Air Forces in the U.S and the South Pacific, he returned to William Jewell College to earn an A.B. in psychology in 1947. He then earned a Ph.D. in psychology at the University of Minnesota in 1950, studying industrial psychology under Donald G. Paterson (who trained even more Ph.D.’s in his career than Jenkins did[8]). He remained at the University of Minnesota as a professor in the Psychology Department from 1950 to 1982. From 1965 to 1973, he was founding Director of the newly established Center for Research in Human Learning of the University of Minnesota, where he remained as Director of Training until 1982. In that year, he moved to the University of South Florida, first as Chair of the Department of Psychology, and then as Distinguished Research Professor until he became Emeritus in 2000. He served as an Adjunct Research Professor at the City University of New York from 2000 through 2008. He was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 1957–58 and 1964–65 (where he and a group of distinguished scholars ended a night-long celebration of their year together by attempting to watch the sun rise over the Pacific Ocean), and a Visiting Professor at the University of Colorado, Yale University, and the City University of New York.
Honors and professional activities[edit]
Jenkins is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Psychological Society/Association for Psychological Science, the American Psychological Association and the Acoustical Society of America. He is a member of the Society of Experimental Psychologists and the Psychonomic Society, the Midwestern and Southeastern Psychological Associations, the Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology, and the International Society for Ecological Psychology. He served as Chairman of the Society of Experimental Psychologists (1972–73), Chairman of the Psychonomic Society Board of Governors (1978–79), Chairman of the Board of Scientific Affairs of the American Psychological Association (1969–1971), President of the Midwestern Psychological Association (1967–68), President of Division 3 (Experimental) of the American Psychological Association (1973–74), among other contributions to professional societies. He was Consulting Editor, Associate Editor, or Editor of several major professional journals and member of several NIH and NIE grant panels, member of the National Research Council for four years, and Chairman of the Social Science Research Council Committee on Linguistics and Psychology (1960–1962). His academic honors include the previously mentioned Fellowships at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and the Social Science Research Council Fellowship at the seminal 1953 Social Science Research Council Summer Institute in Psycholinguistics, as well as an SSRC Faculty Fellowship, a Ford Foundation Faculty Grant, a Citation for Achievement from William Jewell College (1968), a Phi Kappa Phi (University of South Florida Chapter) Artist/Scholar Award (1985), a Sigma Xi (USF Chapter) Outstanding Research Award (1987), and an Outstanding Alumni Achievement Award from the University of Minnesota (2001).[12]

He then earned a Ph.D. in psychology at the University of Minnesota in 1950, studying industrial psychology under Donald G. Paterson (who trained even more Ph.D.’s in his career than Jenkins did[8]). He remained at the University of Minnesota as a professor in the Psychology Department from 1950 to 1982. From 1965 to 1973, he was founding Director of the newly established Center for Research in Human Learning of the University of Minnesota, where he remained as Director of Training until 1982. In that year, he moved to the University of South Florida, first as Chair of the Department of Psychology, and then as Distinguished Research Professor until he became Emeritus in 2000. He served as an Adjunct Research Professor at the City University of New York from 2000 through 2008. He was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 1957–58 and 1964–65 (where he and a group of distinguished scholars ended a night-long celebration of their year together by attempting to watch the sun rise over the Pacific Ocean), and a Visiting Professor at the University of Colorado, Yale University, and the City University of New York.

J.S.B. Jenkins Announces Retirement from Tandy Brands Board of Directors | Business Wire


























































J.S.B. Jenkins Announces Retirement from Tandy Brands Board of 
      Directors




McGeachy Will Succeed Jenkins as Chairman of the Board






May 12, 2009 10:39 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ARLINGTON, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tandy Brands Accessories (Nasdaq: TBAC) announced today that J.S.B. 
      (Britt) Jenkins, Chairman of the Board, has announced his retirement as 
      an officer and director of the company, effective May 12, 2009, 
      concluding nearly 20 years of service at Tandy Brands.
    


      Mr. Jenkins served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Tandy 
      Brands from the company’s inception in 1990 until October 2008. Mr. 
      Jenkins has served as a member of the board of directors since 1990 and 
      has been Chairman of the Board since February 2008.
    

      The company announced that Mr. Rod McGeachy, President and Chief 
      Executive Officer of Tandy Brands, will succeed Mr. Jenkins as Chairman 
      of the Board. Mr. Grady Rosier will continue to serve as Tandy Brands’ 
      lead independent director.
    

      “I have learned a lot from Britt since joining the company in October 
      and I sincerely appreciate all that he has done to facilitate a smooth 
      leadership transition,” said Mr. McGeachy. “Furthermore, I feel 
      fortunate to have Grady as our lead independent director. His industry 
      experience and management wisdom make him an invaluable partner for me.”
    

      Mr. Jenkins’ career with Tandy companies started in 1971, when he joined 
      the Tex Tan Welhausen Division of Tandy Corporation, as an Assistant 
      Purchasing Manager. In 1978, he became President of Tex Tan Welhausen, 
      at that time a division of The Bombay Company. He served in that role 
      until becoming Vice President and then Executive Vice President of The 
      Bombay Company until Tandy Brands Accessories was spun off in 1990. At 
      the time of the spin-off in 1990, the company had net sales of $27 
      million and less than 275 employees. By fiscal 2008, Tandy Brands had 
      grown to net sales of approximately $150 million and had more than 900 
      employees.
    

      “It has been a distinct honor to serve as an executive and board member 
      for Tandy Brands since its founding, and I am truly humbled to have had 
      the opportunity to lead such a great company,” said Mr. Jenkins. “Over 
      the past 20 years, we have seen a lot of changes, we have met a number 
      of challenges, and we have emerged as one of the leading companies in 
      our industry.”
    

      “The shareholders and employees of Tandy Brands are greatly appreciative 
      of Britt’s long-term dedication and leadership,” said Dr. James 
      Gaertner, past Chairman of the Board and fellow board member of Mr. 
      Jenkins since 1990. “The board sincerely thanks Britt for his service, 
      and wishes him the best of success in the next stage of his life.”
    

      “With my confidence in Rod’s leadership and the new management team now 
      firmly in place, complemented by our strong product portfolio and retail 
      partners, the future is bright for Tandy Brands,” said Mr. Jenkins. “I 
      look forward to following the progress the company makes over the next 
      20 years.”
