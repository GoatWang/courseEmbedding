Charlie is an accomplished and distinguished leader, with a record of profitably growing businesses, driving innovation and managing complex, large-scale global financial services organizations."

Before joining Visa, Mr. Scharf served as Managing Director of One Equity Partners, JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s private investment arm, and previously served as the Chief Executive Officer of Retail Financial Services, one of JPMorgan Chase's six lines of business.

The Board and I want to thank Gerald for his career-long dedication to BNY Mellon and congratulate him on his numerous achievements. As CEO, he refreshed the company's strategy and successfully executed against a publicly-stated 2014 to 2017 three-year Investor Day plan designed to create value for the firm's clients, investors and employees. Gerald restructured the management team, improved talent in key positions, accelerated cultural change and increased employee engagement. Overall, under Gerald's leadership, the company has delivered strong financial results and superior shareholder returns."
Mr. Hassell added, "It has been a privilege to lead BNY Mellon over the past six years. During this period, we have strengthened our position as a global leader in investment management and investment services and have delivered consistently against our 2014 Investor Day goals. I am enormously proud of our team and what we have achieved together. With Charlie at the helm, I know the future of the company is in good hands, and I look forward to working with him to ensure a seamless transition." 
Charles W. Scharf said, "I am honored to have been selected and am looking forward to working with the senior management team, the Board of Directors, and all of the employees at BNY Mellon. I am especially honored to follow Gerald as I have great respect for him as a person and as a leader. I look forward to his advice and counsel and will work closely with him to ensure a smooth transition. "
Mr. Scharf continued, "I have long admired BNY Mellon and believe there is great opportunity to build on the momentum Gerald and the team have created. We will continue to put our clients first, remain a strong and trusted partner, and continue on our journey of defining ourselves as the premier technology platform our clients turn to for our capabilities, advice and leadership. We will work to continue to build the company for the long term while delivering in the short term.  I couldn't be more excited to be part of the company's future."

Early life[edit]
Scharf received a B.A. from Johns Hopkins University and an M.B.A. from New York University. In 1987, barely out of college, Scharf was the youngest professional employee at Commercial Credit Corp. The first person the company had hired directly from college in years, Scharf was in fact still a senior at Johns Hopkins University when he started working there part-time, having sent his résumé to Jamie Dimon through family connections. Six months into the job he was named Dimon’s assistant and “included in every meeting, learning broadly about business and how decisions get made.
As much as Scharf has been mentored by the leading lights of his industry, he has developed a philosophy of his own. In part, that was shaped by his Executive MBA from Stern, which he completed in 1991 and, he said, helped put his work experience into perspective. “In my experience,” he reflected, “good business is all about stepping back, asking questions, and accumulating the expertise to make the best decisions, whether those are business decisions or people decisions.[3]
Early career[edit]
Prior to joining Visa in November of 2012,[4] Scharf was the CEO of Retail Financial Services for JPMorgan Chase & Co. for nine years from July 2004 until June of 2011. He was also the managing director of One Equity Partners, JPMorgan's private investment section.[2] He was the CEO and CFO at Bank One Corp. prior to his work at JPMorgan Chase & Co from 2000 to 2002. From 1999 to 2000, he was the CFO of the Global Corporate and Investment Bank division at Citigroup, Inc. From 1995 to 1999 he was the CFO at Salomon Smith Barney. He began his career as Mr. Dimon's assistant at Commercial Credit in the late 1980s.[5]
Career[edit]
Scharf, at age 48, took over as the company's CEO in November 2012, succeeded Joseph Saunders. He was also appointed as a board member after increasing the size of the board to eleven members from ten. He has more than 25 years of financial services, payments systems and leadership experience. He was also a director of Visa and its predecessor, Visa U.S.A., from 2003 to 2011. Payments technology company Visa, Inc. (V) revealed in a regulatory filing on Friday that Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf received a 2013 total compensation of $24.20 million, including base salary, stock grants and incentives in 2013.[6]
Scharf is earning praise from analysts and insiders for breaking with tradition. He has made Visa, No. 238 on the Fortune 500 with $11.8 billion in revenue, more open to merchants and tech innovation. He oversees a network with 2.2 billion cards accepted by 36 million merchants globally. And he has done it with little flash: He mostly avoids press; sources describe him as “all-business.”[4]
Nonprofit leadership[edit]
Scharf is on the board of trustees for Johns Hopkins University and he is on the board of directors for the Financial Services Roundtable.[2]
On February 26, 2014 President Barack Obama announced his intent to nominate individuals to key Administration posts amongst which was Charles W. Scharf, Appointee for Member, President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans.
He is currently on the Executive Council for UCSF Health and the Board of Directors for Microsoft Corp.
On October 17, 2016, Scharf advised his Board of Directors that he can no longer spend enough time in San Francisco "to do the job effectively". He announced that he would step down on December 1.</https://www.reuters.com/article/us-visa-moves-ceo-idUSKBN12H2EV>

Early life[edit]
Scharf received a B.A. from Johns Hopkins University and an M.B.A. from New York University. In 1987, barely out of college, Scharf was the youngest professional employee at Commercial Credit Corp. The first person the company had hired directly from college in years, Scharf was in fact still a senior at Johns Hopkins University when he started working there part-time, having sent his résumé to Jamie Dimon through family connections. Six months into the job he was named Dimon’s assistant and “included in every meeting, learning broadly about business and how decisions get made.
As much as Scharf has been mentored by the leading lights of his industry, he has developed a philosophy of his own. In part, that was shaped by his Executive MBA from Stern, which he completed in 1991 and, he said, helped put his work experience into perspective. “In my experience,” he reflected, “good business is all about stepping back, asking questions, and accumulating the expertise to make the best decisions, whether those are business decisions or people decisions.[3]
Early career[edit]
Prior to joining Visa in November of 2012,[4] Scharf was the CEO of Retail Financial Services for JPMorgan Chase & Co. for nine years from July 2004 until June of 2011. He was also the managing director of One Equity Partners, JPMorgan's private investment section.[2] He was the CEO and CFO at Bank One Corp. prior to his work at JPMorgan Chase & Co from 2000 to 2002. From 1999 to 2000, he was the CFO of the Global Corporate and Investment Bank division at Citigroup, Inc. From 1995 to 1999 he was the CFO at Salomon Smith Barney. He began his career as Mr. Dimon's assistant at Commercial Credit in the late 1980s.[5]
Career[edit]
Scharf, at age 48, took over as the company's CEO in November 2012, succeeded Joseph Saunders. He was also appointed as a board member after increasing the size of the board to eleven members from ten. He has more than 25 years of financial services, payments systems and leadership experience. He was also a director of Visa and its predecessor, Visa U.S.A., from 2003 to 2011. Payments technology company Visa, Inc. (V) revealed in a regulatory filing on Friday that Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf received a 2013 total compensation of $24.20 million, including base salary, stock grants and incentives in 2013.[6]
Scharf is earning praise from analysts and insiders for breaking with tradition. He has made Visa, No. 238 on the Fortune 500 with $11.8 billion in revenue, more open to merchants and tech innovation. He oversees a network with 2.2 billion cards accepted by 36 million merchants globally. And he has done it with little flash: He mostly avoids press; sources describe him as “all-business.”[4]
Nonprofit leadership[edit]
Scharf is on the board of trustees for Johns Hopkins University and he is on the board of directors for the Financial Services Roundtable.[2]
On February 26, 2014 President Barack Obama announced his intent to nominate individuals to key Administration posts amongst which was Charles W. Scharf, Appointee for Member, President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans.
He is currently on the Executive Council for UCSF Health and the Board of Directors for Microsoft Corp.
On October 17, 2016, Scharf advised his Board of Directors that he can no longer spend enough time in San Francisco "to do the job effectively". He announced that he would step down on December 1.</https://www.reuters.com/article/us-visa-moves-ceo-idUSKBN12H2EV>

 Bank of NY Mellon Names Former Visa Head Charles Scharf New CEO
Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  announced that former Visa Inc.  CEO Charles W. Scharf will be taking over as CEO of the bank effective immediately and will take over as chairman of the board of directors starting Jan. 1, 2018. Scharf, 52, will replace Gerald L. Hassell, 65, who will continue to serve as the bank's board chairman until Scharf takes over next year. "Today's announcement is the culmination of the Board of Directors' robust and long-term succession planning process. Charlie is an accomplished and distinguished leader, with a record of profitably growing businesses, driving innovation and managing complex, large-scale global financial services organizations," Hassell said in a statement Monday. What's Hot on TheStreetAmazon wants to upend every business, or so it seems: New day, a new business Amazon  wants to dip its toes in. The latest looks to be the meal kit space, TheStreet reports.In a July 6 trademark application, Amazon subsidiary Amazon Technologies Inc. revealed it's planning "prepared food kits composed of meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruit and/or and [sic] vegetables...ready for cooking and assembly as a meal," as well as primarily grain-based offerings.The product's tagline: "We do the prep. You be the chef." Amazon already sells other companies' meal kits, including Tyson Foods Inc.'s  Tyson Tastemakers. Martha Stewart is even offering meal kits on Amazon Fresh, the company's grocery delivery service. But, this may be the first hint of something bigger for Amazon, which would put it in direct competition with newly minted IPO Blue Apron  .Elon Musk keeping it real for a change: Tesla's  Elon Musk just gave the obsessed bulls on his company's future something to strongly consider, TheStreet reports.Speaking at the National Governors Association Summer Meeting in Rhode Island on Saturday, Musk reiterated that shares of Tesla are trading at a level "higher than we have any right to deserve" based on optimism about the company's future."Those expectations sometimes get out of control," Musk added. Meanwhile, TheStreet reports Tesla could be at risk of a nasty surprise soon: the end of tax credits for electric cars in the U.S.Procter & Gamble under siege: Peltz's Trian Fund Management plans to launch a fight for a board seat at Procter & Gamble  , making it the largest company to face a proxy battle, TheWall Street Journalreported Monday.Trian, which owns about $3.3 billion of P&G stock, is said to be seeking a single board seat for Peltz at the company's annual meeting that could take place in October. P&G have reportedly been in talks for five months, but the company is said to have rejected to name Peltz as a director last week.Sales at P&G -- and its stock price -- have stalled due to pricing pressure and competition.As TheStreet's Ron Orol reported in June, look for the consumer packaged goods company to announce plans for spin-offs, sales or even a swap out of business units. If major M&A doesn't come soon, a Trian director-battle or white paper chock full of activist demands could be next.And Trian likely will demand significant M&A activity. Spinoffs and other major deals often follow when the activist investor acquires a large stake. Trian and other activist fund managers often push to have large companies break themselves up with the goal of extracting value by focusing the market on various parts of a business that might be hiding inside confusing conglomerate structures.Visit here for the latest business headlines.

Bank of NY Mellon Names Former Visa Head Charles Scharf New CEO









Tony Owusu




Jul 17, 2017 8:07 AM EDT













 














































































 Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) announced that former Visa Inc. (V) CEO Charles W. Scharf will be taking over as CEO of the bank effective immediately and will take over as chairman of the board of directors starting Jan. 1, 2018.  Scharf, 52, will replace Gerald L. Hassell, 65, who will continue to serve as the bank's board chairman until Scharf takes over next year.  "Today's announcement is the culmination of the Board of Directors' robust and long-term succession planning process. Charlie is an accomplished and distinguished leader, with a record of profitably growing businesses, driving innovation and managing complex, large-scale global financial services organizations," Hassell said in a statement Monday.  What's Hot on TheStreet Amazon wants to upend every business, or so it seems: New day, a new business Amazon (AMZN) wants to dip its toes in. The latest looks to be the meal kit space, TheStreet reports. In a July 6 trademark application, Amazon subsidiary Amazon Technologies Inc. revealed it's planning "prepared food kits composed of meat, poultry, fish, seafood, fruit and/or and [sic] vegetables...ready for cooking and assembly as a meal," as well as primarily grain-based offerings. The product's tagline: "We do the prep. You be the chef." Amazon already sells other companies' meal kits, including Tyson Foods Inc.'s (TSN) Tyson Tastemakers. Martha Stewart is even offering meal kits on Amazon Fresh, the company's grocery delivery service. But, this may be the first hint of something bigger for Amazon, which would put it in direct competition with newly minted IPO Blue Apron (APRN) .

Charles Scharf

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Charles W. Scharf (born 24 April 1965, New York City) is an American businessman who was the chief executive officer of Visa Inc.,[1] and is a member of the Microsoft board of directors.[2]

Early life[edit]
Scharf received a B.A. from Johns Hopkins University and an M.B.A. from New York University. In 1987, barely out of college, Scharf was the youngest professional employee at Commercial Credit Corp. The first person the company had hired directly from college in years, Scharf was in fact still a senior at Johns Hopkins University when he started working there part-time, having sent his résumé to Jamie Dimon through family connections. Six months into the job he was named Dimon’s assistant and “included in every meeting, learning broadly about business and how decisions get made.
As much as Scharf has been mentored by the leading lights of his industry, he has developed a philosophy of his own. In part, that was shaped by his Executive MBA from Stern, which he completed in 1991 and, he said, helped put his work experience into perspective. “In my experience,” he reflected, “good business is all about stepping back, asking questions, and accumulating the expertise to make the best decisions, whether those are business decisions or people decisions.[3]
Early career[edit]
Prior to joining Visa in November of 2012,[4] Scharf was the CEO of Retail Financial Services for JPMorgan Chase & Co. for nine years from July 2004 until June of 2011. He was also the managing director of One Equity Partners, JPMorgan's private investment section.[2] He was the CEO and CFO at Bank One Corp. prior to his work at JPMorgan Chase & Co from 2000 to 2002. From 1999 to 2000, he was the CFO of the Global Corporate and Investment Bank division at Citigroup, Inc. From 1995 to 1999 he was the CFO at Salomon Smith Barney. He began his career as Mr. Dimon's assistant at Commercial Credit in the late 1980s.[5]
Career[edit]
Scharf, at age 48, took over as the company's CEO in November 2012, succeeded Joseph Saunders. He was also appointed as a board member after increasing the size of the board to eleven members from ten. He has more than 25 years of financial services, payments systems and leadership experience. He was also a director of Visa and its predecessor, Visa U.S.A., from 2003 to 2011. Payments technology company Visa, Inc. (V) revealed in a regulatory filing on Friday that Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf received a 2013 total compensation of $24.20 million, including base salary, stock grants and incentives in 2013.[6]
Scharf is earning praise from analysts and insiders for breaking with tradition. He has made Visa, No. 238 on the Fortune 500 with $11.8 billion in revenue, more open to merchants and tech innovation. He oversees a network with 2.2 billion cards accepted by 36 million merchants globally. And he has done it with little flash: He mostly avoids press; sources describe him as “all-business.”[4]
Nonprofit leadership[edit]
Scharf is on the board of trustees for Johns Hopkins University and he is on the board of directors for the Financial Services Roundtable.[2]
On February 26, 2014 President Barack Obama announced his intent to nominate individuals to key Administration posts amongst which was Charles W. Scharf, Appointee for Member, President’s Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans.
He is currently on the Executive Council for UCSF Health and the Board of Directors for Microsoft Corp.
On October 17, 2016, Scharf advised his Board of Directors that he can no longer spend enough time in San Francisco "to do the job effectively". He announced that he would step down on December 1.</https://www.reuters.com/article/us-visa-moves-ceo-idUSKBN12H2EV>

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
