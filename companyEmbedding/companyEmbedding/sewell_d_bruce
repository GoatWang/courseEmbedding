FTC Notice


Pursuant to 16 CFR Part 255, the Federal Trade Commission's Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, please note:  (1) iPhone software and hardware developers routinely send me free versions of their products to review.  I sometimes keep and continue to use these products that I did not pay for after posting my review, which might be considered a form of compensation for my review, but I do not believe that I let that color my review.  (2) When I post links to product pages on certain stores, including but not limited to Amazon and the iTunes App Store, my links include a referral code so that when products are purchased after clicking on the link, I often receive a very small percentage of the sale.  This helps to defray some of the cost of running this site, and gives me a small vested interest in having readers of iPhone J.D. purchase products using these links.  Again I do not believe that I let that color my review of products.  (3) Some of the ads that run on this website are selected by others such as Amazon or Google.  If one of these ads comes from the seller of a product reviewed on iPhone J.D., that is a coincidence and I do not believe that it colors my review of that product.  Other ads are from paid advertisers, and if I discuss a product from a company that is a current advertiser, I will note that.  (4) Some of the ads that run on this website are from monthly sponsors of iPhone J.D.  When I discuss products from these companies on iPhone J.D., I do so to pass along information provided to me by the sponsor.  Often, I will also provide my own commentary on the product, and while my goal is to be honest, please keep in mind that I was compensated to promote the product.  If you have any questions about this, just send me an e-mail or post a comment on a specific product review.

Apple hires Bruce Sewell as new General Counsel


 Apple announced yesterday that current Senior VP and General Counsel Daniel Cooperman is retiring at the end of September and that he will be replaced by Bruce Sewell.D. Bruce Sewell (the "D" standards for Durward) becomes the fourth
General Counsel to be hired at Apple since the return of Steve Jobs.  Eighteen months after Apple purchased NeXT in March of 1996 and brought Steve Jobs back to the Apple, Apple hired Nancy Heinen to serve as General Counsel and Secretary, a job Heinen had also held at NeXT.  Heinen held the position until May of 2006, when she resigned shortly before Apple admitted to some irregularities in the backdating of stock options.  Heinen eventually settled claims brought by the SEC for about $2.2 million, without admitting to any of the SEC's charges.Six months after Heinen left Apple, Donald Rosenberg became Apple's Senior Vice President and General Counsel in November of 2006.  Rosenberg had previously held the same position at IBM, where he had worked for over 30 years.  But Rosenberg did not stay at Apple very long, leaving after only 10 months to take the General Counsel position at Qualcomm, a position he still holds today.In September of 2007, the same time that Apple announced the departure of Rosenberg, Apple hired Daniel Cooperman to serve as its Senior Vice President and General Counsel.  Cooperman had previously served as General Counsel for Oracle for 11 years
and before that was a partner in the San Francisco office of the firm
now known as Bingham McCutchen.  Apple announced yesterday that Cooperman will retire at the end of this month, which is presumably the reason that Apple sought and hired Sewell.  [UPDATE 3/17/10:  After taking a break for a few months, Cooperman returned to Bingham on March 16, 2010, as reported in this Law.com article.] Sewell thus becomes the third Apple GC in as many years.  Sewell comes to Apple from Intel, where he has worked since
1995 and where, since 1994, he served as General Counsel overseeing Intel's 600
in-house attorneys and policy professionals.  Here is an interview with Sewell on the Intel website in which he discusses the importance of IP when establishing standards.  And here is a link to a short clip on YouTube if you want to hear Sewell speak.  Before Intel, Sewell
worked at Brown & Bain, which became a part of Perkins Coie
in 2004, and before that he was an associate at the firm now known as Schnader.  Sewell graduated from George Washington Law School in D.C. in 1986.This is not the first time that Sewell will work on Apple's legal matters.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, legendary tech IP attorney Jack Brown of Brown & Bain represented Apple in the lawsuit Apple filed
against Microsoft alleging that Microsoft had improperly copied the
"look and feel" of Apple’s Macintosh operating system for
Microsoft’s Windows 2.03 and 3.0 programs.  Sewell worked on this litigation under Jack Brown while he was at the firm.  Apple lost that case, in
part because of a provision in a 1985 licensing agreement between Apple
and Microsoft.  Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.,
35 F.3d 1435 (9th Cir. 1994).  One wonders how different Windows might
be today if Apple had won.  I'm sure that one of the best perks of Bruce Sewell's new job is that he
gets a free iPhone.  Perhaps Sewell will become one of the many attorneys who regularly reads iPhone J.D.  (Just in case:  Welcome, Bruce!)
