HIP Network delivered another packed Sessions in the City event on Thursday, November 17th at the newly-renovated Washington Marriott Georgetown. Influential event organizers and suppliers converged to hear the emerging trends within the meetings and events industry.The day began with the CEO & Founder of HIP Network, Dan Sherman, announcing the acquisition of Convene Green from ASAE and encouraging attendees to sign the Convene Green pledge. Sherman also informed attendees of HIP Network's re-branding and the new focus towards launching the industry's first business intelligence platform to be featured at PCMA’s Convening Leaders Technology Lounge in Austin. “Our inclusive BI Platform will provide unbiased guidance on Event Impact, History, Sustainability and Security to both Planners and Suppliers alike” said Sherman.Sarah Weller with Steelcase Event Experiences presented the latest trends within event design and why space matters. “If you really want to design for learning at your event, give people choice and variety of their seating,” said Weller. Steelcase has executed several examples of fostering learning environments for their clients which Weller showcased to the audience.The topic of event marketing was front and center during Erin Lee’s presentation. Erin is the Managing Director of Marketing at the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) and spoke on growing attendance and meeting registration goals for BIO’s International Convention. “As event marketers we are really challenged. Not only do we need to retain our attendees every year, but we must also drive new ones,” said Lee.Joe Colangelo, CEO and Co-Founder of BEAR Analytics, delighted the crowd on the future of data in the industry and forecasted it’s impact. “Our events are dealing with more information than ever before and emerging technology is beginning to support it,” said Colangelo. Event technology’s emergence within the marketplace and its connection to data resonated throughout Colangelo’s session.







An event planner panel discussion comprised of Allison Wachter at ASAE, Stacey Chattman of 2U and Yvonne Butters at the International Association for the Study of Pain rounded out the first half of the event. The conversation focused on what planners are experiencing during the deal cycle of selecting meeting locations to finding innovative ways to showcase new technology such as interactive attendee bracelets.After a brief break in the action, the audience returned to hear about the $25 million renovation recently completed at the Washington Marriott Georgetown from General Manager Kori Johnson. The event’s premiere destination sponsor, Experience Grand Rapids, then showcased their destination during a fireside chat with Sherman and VP of Sales and Services, Tom Bennett. “Our arts scene is booming with ArtPrize, the world’s largest collective art competition with $500,000+ in prize money given away,” said Bennett. “Also, our craft beer culture which has led to Grand Rapids being named ‘Beer City USA’ and being named by USA Today as the best beer town in the country.”Freeman’s Vice President of Business Development, Tom Miller, then took the stage for another discussion, this one centered around what Freeman’s clients are now asking for. This included the use of mobile technology, communicating with younger audiences and creating more engaging learning environments. “Our new brand is central to the themes I’ve heard discussed today,” said Miller. “Forward design-thinking and the use of data is what we’re focusing on now.”







The event wrapped up with an inspiring discussion on event sustainability from Eric Ricaurte, Founder and CEO of Greenview. Ricaurte touched on the sustainability movement for events and making it a conversation that is much easier to have. “If you love this industry, then shouldn’t you love what this industry can do for the planet?” asked Ricaurte. “We can watch these trends pass by and then be affected by them at some point, or we can start a movement ourselves.”Mark Korsak’s graphic illustrations of the key event topics are showcased:

Hip Innovation Technology, LLC
Hip Innovation Technology, LLC (HIT) is a privately held company formed in 2011 to provide market-leading orthopaedic device solutions. Our company commitment is to deliver innovative technologies that provide meaningful product differentiation and features that advance the quality of life and quality of care for the patients and the health care providers we are dedicated to serving.
Our lead product technology currently in development is a Hip Replacement System (HRS). The HRS was rationally designed to optimize currently marketed hip system benefits and provide additional solutions to unmet clinical need. The HRS is a unique hip implant design that we believe represents breakthrough technology and a significant advancement for Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA). 
World Class device design along with rigorous research and development work has been ongoing for over four years. 
Our family of HRS device offerings includes component and 	monoblock hip implant systems featuring differentiated 	features and benefits vs. currently marketed systems. 	State-of-the-art surgical instruments support HRS implant 	systems. Our instruments combine best in class 	designs 	along with novel, patented enhancements that are 	cleverly constructed and provide ease of use.
Extensive bench testing included over 70 standard and uniquely designed tests. Many of these tests were designed to aggressively challenge a completely assembled HRS system. Typically, regulatory bodies require approximately 20 standard tests and only individual components are tested. The HRS demonstrated excellent performance with all tests including tribology (wear), durability, and validation of structural design criteria, structural integrity and effects of limit loads. 
Additionally, a series of Cadaver Studies were performed to assess, among other objectives, the HRS Range of Motion and Stability at normal and mal-positioned acetabular cup placement. In both normal and extreme mal-positioned acetabular cup positions, with various Flexion, Internal and External positions, the HRS was stable and did not impinge or dislocate. 
Between December 2011 and November 2014, the company has commissioned market research studies1 for both the U.S. and Top 5 E.U. Countries. The independent market research totaled 309 Orthopaedic Surgeons (206 U.S. and 103 E.U.). As anticipated, survey participants supported wide acceptance of the HRS and the potential patient treatment population was determined to be quite extensive. 

Greater than 83% of U.S. respondents and 88% of E.U. respondents believe the HRS is an Improvement, a Significant Improvement or a Revolutionary Step Forward versus currently marketed designs.
U.S. surgeons reported that the HRS could capture a U.S. market share of 32.8% and E.U. surgeons reported a 25.2% E.U. share.

The company's HRS Intellectual Property Portfolio contains five granted patents, including U.S. and European patents that provide patent protection through July 2030. In addition, five U.S. patent applications and market-targeted International counterpart applications provide greater portfolio strength and key country protection.
Additional information regarding these summary topics can be found in their respective sections on this site.
Corporate headquarters are located in Boca Raton, Florida. Hip Innovation Technology, LLC is a subsidiary of Joint Innovation Technology, LLC.The HRS is currently not available for sale.
