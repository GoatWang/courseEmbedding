Van Kampen Investments

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Van Kampen Investments, Inc. (also Van Kampen Funds, Inc. or Van Kampen American Capital) was an American mutual fund company. Formerly independent, it was acquired by Morgan Stanley[1] in 1996. Most of Morgan Stanley's asset management activities were principally conducted under the Morgan Stanley and Van Kampen brands.
On October 19, 2009, Morgan Stanley announced that Van Kampen would be sold to Invesco for $1.5 billion.[2] After the acquisition, Invesco ceased using the Van Kampen name except in relation to its component mutual funds.
History[edit]
The company was established in 1974 by Robert Van Kampen in Chicago. He developed a niche bond product when he pioneered insurance coverage for tax-exempt bond funds. After New York City’s near-default in 1975, investors flocked to Van Kampen’s insured unit investment trusts. In 1982, the company broke records in the industry by introducing a $125 million Insured Municipal Income Trust (IMIT), soon followed by an even larger $128.5 IMIT. By 1983, the company now known as Van Kampen Merritt, Inc. had sold nearly $7 billion of trusts and was the nation’s third-largest firm in that arena.[3]
In 1984, Van Kampen sold the firm to Xerox Corporation for about $200 million. However, after eight years, in 1992 Xerox decided to shed all its financial-services units starting with Van Kampen. Xerox had initially planned to offer stock in Van Kampen to the public. However the investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice made a better offer and bought 80% of Van Kampen from Xerox for approx $360 million. The remaining shares were held by Xerox and staff of the firm.[4]
In 1996 Morgan Stanley bought Van Kampen American Capital Inc from Clayton for $745 million to help it build its money management business. Morgan Stanley merged the business with its own money management business but continued to use the Van Kampen name.[5]
In 2009, Morgan Stanley announced that Van Kampen would be sold to Invesco for $1.5 billion.[2]

Insured Income Trust, Series 157

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Insured Income Trust, Series 157 invests in a portfolio of long-term bonds.
The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve       
capital. The Trust is a unit investment trust included in Van Kampen Unit       
Trusts, Taxable Income Series 120.

Estimated Current Return:          5.27%                    5.31%

CUSIP:                          92116E-82-6 92116E-81-8

Estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each 
year divided by the Unit price. Estimated long term return shows the estimated  
return over the estimated life of your Trust. These estimates are as of the     
opening of business on the Date of Deposit and will vary thereafter. We base    
this estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life. This  
estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses. We derive the   
average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bond's yield by its value and
estimated life. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long term return     
accounts for maturities, discounts and premiums of the bonds. These estimates   
show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns. No return calculation can
predict your actual return. Your actual return may vary from these estimates.

Van Kampen
Investments                                                                     

Investment Objective. The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current  
income and to preserve capital.                                                 

Principal Investment Strategy. The Trust invests in a portfolio of long-term
bonds. Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and
interest on the bonds in the Trust has been obtained from a bond insurance      
company. In selecting bonds for the Trust, the Sponsor considered the following 
factors, among others:                                                          

   o    the bonds must have a Standard & Poor's rating of "AAA" or a Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. rating of "Aaa";                    

    o    the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality
and maturity;                                               

o    the current income provided by the bonds;                        

  o    the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of
issuer; and                                                 

  o    the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event
risk.                                                       

The portfolio generally consists of bonds maturing approximately 15 to 40 
years from the Date of Deposit.                                                 

Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
the Trust. The Trust also might not perform as well as you expect. This can     
happen for reasons such as these:                                               

     o    Bond prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall over
time.                                                       

o    The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in 
         general, rise. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or
fall in the future.                                         

o    A bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest and/or   
principal payment in the future.                            

    o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
       may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
         may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering
period.                                                     

o    A bond issuer might prepay or "call" a bond before its stated    
         maturity. If this happens, the Trust will distribute the principal to
        you but future interest distributions will fall. A bond's call price
       could be less than the price the Trust paid for the bond. If enough
      bonds are called, the Trust could terminate earlier than expected.

   o     The Trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This
     makes the Trust less diversified and subject to greater risk than a
    more diversified portfolio. The types of bond in the portfolio are
listed under "Portfolio Diversification" on the next page.    

     o    The Trust is considered to be concentrated in bonds of issuers located
 in California. These issuers make up approximately 34% of the
        principal amount of the bonds. The financial condition of California
   is affected by various national and local, economic, social and
       environmental policies and conditions and may have an effect on the
value of Units.                                             

o    We do not actively manage the portfolio. Except in limited       
        circumstances, the Trust will hold the same bonds even if the market
value declines.

(1) Some bonds may mature or be called or sold during your Trust's life. This   
    could include a call or sale at a price below par value. We cannot guarantee
 that the value of your Units will equal the principal amount of bonds per
Unit when you redeem them or when your Trust terminates.                

(2) After the first settlement date (November 9, 2007), you will pay accrued    
    interest from this date to your settlement date less interest distributions.

(3) We base this amount on estimated cash flows per Unit. This amount will vary 
with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call or sale of  
bonds. The Information Supplement includes the estimated cash flows.    

(4) This shows estimated expenses in the first year other than insurance        
expenses. Estimated expenses are expected to fluctuate periodically.    

(5) Your Trust assesses this fee per $1,000 principal amount of bonds. Your     
Trust assesses other fees per Unit.                                     

(6)  During the first year the Trustee will reduce its fee by approximately $.08
per Unit (which is the estimated interest to be earned prior to the   
expected delivery dates for the "when, as and if issued" or "delayed  
    delivery" bonds). Should the interest exceed this amount, the Trustee will
  reduce its fee up to its annual fee. After the first year, the Trustee's
fee will be the amount indicated above. Estimated interest income will
 increase to $55.11. Estimated expenses will increase to $2.67 and $2.24
under the monthly and semi-annual distribution plans, respectively.   
Estimated net interest income will remain as shown.

Notes to Portfolio                                                              

(1) The bonds are represented by "regular way" or "when issued" contracts for   
  the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit, obtained from an
   affiliate of the Trustee, has been deposited with the Trustee. Contracts to
   acquire the bonds were entered into during the period from October 10, 2007
to November 5, 2007.                                                    

(2) Other information regarding the bonds is as follows:

  ---------------      ---------------
$    7,054,549        $     69,632    

  The breakdown of the preinsured bond insurers is as follows: AMBAC Assurance
22%, Financial Guaranty 8%, MBIA 39%, FSA 4% and XL Capital Assurance 27%.      

The Sponsor may have entered into contracts which hedge interest rate     
fluctuations on certain bonds. The cost of any such contracts and the           
corresponding gain or loss as of the evaluation time of the bonds is included in
the Cost to Sponsor. Bonds marked by "##" following the maturity date have been 
purchased on a "when, as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. Interest on
these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of Unitholders on their respective   
dates of delivery. Delivery is expected to take place at various dates after the
first settlement date.                                                          

"#" prior to the coupon rate indicates that the bond was issued at an     
original issue discount. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in Prospectus Part II.  
The tax effect of bonds issued at an original issue discount is described in    
"Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II.                                     

(3) All ratings are by Standard & Poor's unless otherwise indicated. "*"        
   indicates that the rating of the bond is by Moody's. "o" indicates that the
rating is contingent upon receipt by the rating agency of a policy of   
insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds. "NR" indicates that the  
rating service did not provide a rating for that bond. For a brief      
  description of the ratings see "Description of Ratings" in the Information
Supplement.                                                             

(4) This is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and  
the call price for that year. Each bond continues to be callable at     
 declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
    issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price
    plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus,
   if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent
years. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an
   issue of bonds. The bonds may also be subject to redemption without premium
  at any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if
   certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in Prospectus Part II.

Tax Status. The Trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment company"
under the Federal tax laws. For a discussion of the Federal tax status of income
earned on Units, see "Federal Tax Status--Regulated Investment Companies" in    
Prospectus Part II.                                                             

Underwriting. The Underwriters named below have purchased Units in the    
following amounts from the Sponsor, the sole and exclusive principal            
underwriter. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" in     
Prospectus Part II.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Unitholders of Insured Income Trust, Series 157 (included in Van   
Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 120):                                 

We have audited the accompanying statement of condition including the     
portfolio of Insured Income Trust, Series 157 (included in Van Kampen Unit      
Trusts, Taxable Income Series 120) as of November 6, 2007. The statement of     
condition is the responsibility of the Sponsor. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on such statement of condition based on our audit.                   

   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statement
of condition is free of material misstatement. The Trust is not required to     
have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over      
financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over  
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are          
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an      
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial     
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes      
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the statement of condition, assessing the accounting principles used and        
significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall    
statement of condition presentation. Our procedures included confirmation with  
The Bank of New York, Trustee, of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit       
deposited for the purchase of securities as shown in the statement of condition 
as of November 6, 2007. We believe that our audit of the statement of condition 
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.                                    

   In our opinion, the statement of condition referred to above presents fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Insured Income Trust, Series
157 (included in Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 120) as of       
November 6, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

THE TRUSTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Your Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York   
pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the  
date of this prospectus (the "Date of Deposit") among Van Kampen Funds Inc., as 
Sponsor, Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, Van      
Kampen Asset Management, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York, as Trustee.   

Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to       
participate in a portfolio of taxable bonds with greater diversification than   
they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust's assets 
will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds.  
For a breakdown of your Trust's portfolio, see "Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I.
In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the portfolio of a Trust  
are often not available in small amounts and may, in the case of any privately  
placed bonds, be available only to institutional investors.                     

  On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee the aggregate
principal amount of bonds indicated in the "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" in Prospectus Part I. The bonds initially consist of delivery      
statements relating to contracts for their purchase and cash, cash equivalents  
and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued by a financial institution.         
Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds, delivered to the Sponsor    
evidence of ownership of the number of Units indicated under "Summary of
Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I. A Trust that holds       
primarily long-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is   
referred to herein as a "Long-Term Trust". A Trust that holds primarily         
intermediate-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is     
referred to herein as an "Intermediate-Term Trust". A Trust that holds a        
portfolio of bonds with "laddered" maturities, as described on the cover of     
Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a Trust". Trusts that hold only     
insured bonds are referred to herein as "Insured Trusts". Unless otherwise      
terminated as provided herein, the Trust Agreement will terminate at the end of 
the calender year prior to the fiftieth anniversary of its execution in the case
of a Long-Term Trust and at the end of the calender year prior to the twentieth 
anniversary of its execution in the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust.         

   Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in the
principal and net income of the Trust. To the extent that any Units are redeemed
by the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in the Trust represented by   
each Unit will increase, although the actual interest in the Trust will remain  
unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or until 
the termination of the Trust Agreement.                                         

Objective and Bond Selection. The objective of a Long-Term Trust is to    
provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a
portfolio primarily consisting of long-term bonds. The objective of an          
Intermediate-Term Trust is to provide a high level of current income and to     
preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of            
intermediate-term bonds. The objective of a Laddered Trust is to provide a high 
level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio     
consisting of bonds with laddered maturities of approximately 10, 15, 20, 25 and
30 years from the Date of Deposit. There is, of course, no guarantee that a     
Trust will achieve its objective. Your Trust may be an appropriate investment   
vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income  
bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire           
individually.                                                                   

In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following   
factors, among others: (a) with respect to Insured Trusts, the bonds must have a
Standard & Poor's rating of AAA or a Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") 
rating of Aaa and with respect to all other trusts, the bonds must have a       
Standard & Poor's rating of at least "BBB-", a Moody's rating of at least "Baa3"
or, if not rated, credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of       
comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a    
Trust in the opinion of the Sponsor, (b) the prices of the bonds relative to    
other bonds of comparable quality and maturity, (c) the current income provided 
by the bonds; (d) the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and       
location of issuer; (e) the probability of early return of principal or high    
legal or event risk. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or 
its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit. 
Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be considered 
in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct the Trustee to    
dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration"). In  
particular, the ratings of the bonds in a Long-Term Investment Grade Trust or an
Investment Grade Trust could fall below "investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-"  
or "Baa3") during the Trust's life and the Trust could continue to hold the     
bonds. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors".                                          

Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and 
interest on the bonds in an Insured Trust has been obtained from a bond         
insurance company. For information relating to insurance on the bonds, see      
"Insurance on the Bonds in an Insured Trust". Neither the Public Offering Price 
nor any evaluation of Units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects 
any element of value for the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust unless bonds
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of    
such default. See "Public Offering--Unit Price".                                

In order for bonds to be eligible for insurance, they must have credit    
characteristics which would qualify them for at least the Standard & Poor's     
rating of "BBB-" or at least the Moody's Investors Service, Inc. rating of      
"Baa3", which in brief represent the lowest ratings for securities of investment
grade (see "Description of Ratings" in the Information Supplement). Insurance is
not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer, but supplements the existing
credit and provides additional security. If an issue is accepted for insurance, 
a non-cancelable policy for the prompt payment of interest and principal on the 
bonds, when due, is issued by the insurer. A monthly premium is paid by a Trust 
for the insurance obtained by it. The Trustee has the right to obtain permanent 
insurance from a Portfolio Insurer in connection with the sale of a bond insured
under the insurance policy obtained from the respective Portfolio Insurer by an 
Insured Trust upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from 
the proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust
is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. All bonds insured by a Portfolio    
Insurer or by a Preinsured Bond Insurer receive a "AAA" rating by Standard &    
Poor's. Standard & Poor's describes securities it rates "AAA" as having "the    
highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt obligation. Capacity to  
pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong." See "Insurance on the
Bonds in an Insured Trust".                                                     

Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main
risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand   
these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of    
your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one   
can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment
return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement, which is   
available upon request, contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to 
your investment.                                                                

Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will    
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original 
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to   
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the    
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or 
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your       
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust   
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a  
managed fund.                                                                   

  Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest
rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise 
in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity are
often more sensitive to interest rate changes.                                  

   Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet its
obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.                            

Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond
pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original 
purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to 
you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to  
reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less   
than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par   
value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your 
Units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate     
early. Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or
mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain changes in tax   
laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the    
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and various other events.
The call provisions are described in general terms in Prospectus Part I.        
Additional discussion of call provisions appears in the Information Supplement. 

Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating  
agency decreases the bond's rating. Bond concentration risk is the risk that    
your Trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of  
bond. When a certain type of bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is 
considered to be "concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are 
described in the following sections.                                            

  Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller
and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could        
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.           

 Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market
will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the              
over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange).         

Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or     
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. Litigation could challenge an 
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.                          

 Taxable Municipal Bonds. Your Trust may invest significantly or exclusively
in taxable municipal bonds. States, municipalities and public authorities issue 
these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes. In selecting bonds, the   
Sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose. This section briefly 
describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment.   
The types of bonds in your portfolio are listed in Prospectus Part I. These     
bonds are also described in greater detail in the Information Supplement.       

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the    
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or  
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.                          

 Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

 Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease     
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments  
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to 
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a          
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not 
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                              

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from     
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on
bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services,
competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce
costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and claims, and    
government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).                

 Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number of
college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,         
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

   Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or improving
industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these projects. The   
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as
the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project, revenues         
generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or other    
regulatory restrictions.                                                        

Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing
projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally         
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their   
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage
default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies.    

Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from  
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or 
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and
demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate         
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

 Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

 Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.                   

 Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on
variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from     
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air, rail
and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation modes
and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers
that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                         

Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from 
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

   Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to make    
payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for     
electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government regulation and
rate approvals.                                                                 

 Consumer Product and Retail Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in
companies that manufacture or sell various consumer products. General risks of  
these companies include the general state of the economy, intense competition   
and consumer spending trends. A decline in the economy which results in a       
reduction of consumers' disposable income can negatively impact spending habits.
Competitiveness in the retail industry will require large capital outlays for   
the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory, track the
sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns. Retailers who sell their
products over the Internet have the potential to access more consumers, but will
require sophisticated technology to remain competitive.                         

Financial Services Companies. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by financial services companies. Any negative impact on this industry    
will have a greater impact on the value of Units than on a portfolio diversified
over several industries. You should understand the risks of this industry before
you invest. Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the     
adverse effects of economic recession; volatile interest rates; portfolio       
concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real     
estate loans; and competition from new entrants in their fields of business. In 
addition, banks and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both   
the federal and state level and may be adversely affected by increased          
regulations.                                                                    

  Banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as
regulatory changes, such as the recently enacted Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial   
services overhaul legislation, permit new entrants to offer various financial   
products. Technological advances such as the Internet allow these nontraditional
lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer   
data. Banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage 
firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish       
services that were traditionally offered by banks.                              

 Companies engaged in investment management and broker-dealer activities are
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the 
volatility of the securities markets in general. Adverse changes in the         
direction of the securities markets, investor confidence, equity transaction    
volume, the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging   
markets could adversely affect the financial stability of these companies.      
Additionally, competitive pressures, including increased competition with new   
and existing competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses 
and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could         
adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management   
and brokerage industries. Companies involved in investment management and       
broker-dealer activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government 
agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or 
rules, or in the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could       
adversely affect such companies.                                                

   Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many  
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,      
including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium rate caps, a       
misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings, competition and   
pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other disasters and the   
effects of client mergers. Already extensively regulated, insurance companies'  
profits may be adversely affected by increased government regulations or tax law
changes.                                                                        

Telecommunications Companies. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by telecommunications companies. These companies are subject to          
substantial governmental regulation. For example, the United States government  
and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of       
services that a company may offer. This industry has experienced substantial    
deregulation in recent years. Deregulation may lead to fierce competition for   
market share and can have a negative impact on certain companies. Recent federal
legislation governing the United States telecommunications industry remains     
subject to judicial review and additional interpretation, which may adversely   
affect the companies whose securities are held by your Trust. Competitive       
pressures are intense and telecommunications stocks can experience rapid        
volatility. Certain telecommunications products may become outdated very        
rapidly. A company's performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace  
with technological advances.                                                    

Several recent high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications      
companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of                
telecommunications companies. High debt loads that were accumulated during the  
industry growth spurt of the 1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt
and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications      
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.  
At the same time, demand for some telecommunications services has fallen        
sharply, as several key markets have become oversaturated, some local customers 
have switched to substitute providers and technologies, and corporate profits   
and the economy generally remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies
may have to commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new  
products and services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have  
been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing,           
consolidating and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling      
product lines. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the   
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of    
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased             
substantially and may continue to rise.                                         

Certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than  
larger, established issuers. Smaller companies may have limited product lines,  
markets or financial resources. Their securities may trade in lower volumes than
larger companies. As a result, the prices of these securities may fluctuate more
than the prices of other issuers.                                               

More About the Bonds. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds, 
other information about the bonds is also listed in the "Portfolio" in          
Prospectus Part I. This information relates to other characteristics of the     
bonds. This section briefly describes some of these characteristics.            

Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than       
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable      
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase    
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach      
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before
its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.         

  Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type of
bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's par   
value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during     
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current   
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a   
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par    
value.                                                                          

  "When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually
issued. This means that the Sponsor can only deliver them to your Trust "when,  
as and if" the bonds are actually issued. Delivery of these bonds may be delayed
or may not occur. Interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your Trust 
until the Sponsor delivers the bond to the Trust. You may have to adjust your   
tax basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery
date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you   
purchased your Units and the delivery of the bonds to your Trust. This could    
lower your first year estimated current return. You may experience gains or     
losses on these bonds from the time you purchase Units even though your Trust   
has not yet received them.                                                      

 No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

ESTIMATED CURRENT                                                               
AND LONG-TERM RETURNS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Estimated Current Returns and the Estimated Long-Term Returns as of the
Date of Deposit are set forth on the cover of Prospectus Part I. Estimated      
Current Return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest      
income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest 
income per Unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your Trust and   
with the principal prepayment, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds. 
The Public Offering Price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds.     
Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present Estimated Current Return    
will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a
formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors in the   
relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into account the 
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated          
retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales      
charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated retirements of the  
bonds and the expenses of your Trust will change, there is no assurance that the
present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in the future. The Estimated
Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are expected to differ because the
calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated date and amount
of principal returned while the Estimated Current Return calculation includes   
only net annual interest income and Public Offering Price.                      

In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the Sponsor or 
Trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the  
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the Sponsor on   
the Date of Deposit. This cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the
First Settlement Date. The Trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary  
to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from     
interest payments on the related bonds.                                         

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. During the initial
offering period the Public Offering Price is based on the aggregate offering    
price of the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the      
Principal Account and accrued interest, if any. The sales charge for an         
Intermediate-Term Trust is equal to 3.0% of the public offering price per Unit  
(3.093% of the aggregate offering price of the bonds), the sales charge for a   
Laddered Trust is equal to 3.90% of the public offering price per Unit (4.058%  
of the aggregate offering price of the bonds) and the sales charge for a        
Long-Term Trust is equal to 4.9% of the public offering price per Unit (5.152%  
of the aggregate offering price of the bonds). After the initial public offering
period, the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of
the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the Principal     
Account and accrued interest, if any. The actual sales charge that may be paid  
by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to   
rounding that occurs in the calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the 
number of Units purchased. The minimum purchase in the primary and secondary    
market is one Unit. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order 
handling fee for processing Unit purchases.                                     

 The secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following
table based upon the estimated long-term return life ("ELTR Life") of your      
Trust's portfolio:

The ELTR Life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's     
portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return. 
See "Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns". The sales charges in the above   
table are expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid prices of the bonds.   

 Reducing Your Sales Charge. The Sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to
reduce the sales charge that you pay. It is your financial professional's       
responsibility to alert the Sponsor of any discount when you purchase Units.    
Before you purchase Units you must also inform your broker-dealer of your       
qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for a
reduced sales charge.                                                           

  Large Quantity Purchases. You can reduce your sales charge by increasing the
size of your investment. If you purchase the amount of Units shown in the table 
below during the initial offering period, your sales charge will be as follows: 

  Sales Reduction per Unit
  ----------------------------------
Aggregate                Intermediate-Term                                      
Number of                  and Laddered        Long-Term                        
Units Purchased               Trusts            Trusts                          
-----------------          ------------      ------------                       
100-249 Units              $        4.00    $        4.00                       
250-499 Units                       6.00             6.00                       
500-999 Units                       9.00            14.00                       
1,000 or more Units                11.00            19.00                       

Except as described below, these quantity discount levels apply only to   
purchases of a single Trust made by the same person on a single day from a      
single broker-dealer. We apply these sales charges as a percent of the Public   
Offering Price per Unit at the time of purchase. We also apply the different    
purchase levels on a dollar basis using a $1,000 Unit equivalent. For example,  
if you purchase between $250,000 and $499,999, your sales charge discount per   
Unit for a Long-Term Trust will be $6.                                          

  Aggregated Purchases--For purposes of achieving these levels you may combine
purchases of Units of a Trust offered in this prospectus with purchases of units
of any other Van Kampen-sponsored unit investment trust in the initial offering 
period (including other Trusts offered in this prospectus). In addition, Units  
purchased in the name of your spouse or children under 21 living in the same    
household as you will be deemed to be additional purchases by you for the       
purposes of calculating the applicable quantity discount level. The reduced     
sales charge levels will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary     
purchasing Units for a single trust, estate (including multiple trusts created  
under a single estate) or fiduciary account. To be eligible for aggregation as  
described in this paragraph, all purchases must be made on the same day through 
a single broker-dealer or selling agent. You must inform your broker-dealer of  
any combined purchases before your purchase to be eligible for a reduced sales  
charge.                                                                         

Letter of Intent--For purposes of calculating the reduced sales charge for
quantity purchases in the table above, purchasers who have entered into a letter
of intent with the Sponsor prior to February 20, 2007 to purchase a specified   
amount of Units of Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series or Van Kampen  
Unit Trusts, Municipal Series unit investment trusts during the initial offering
period will be eligible to receive a reduced sales charge according to the      
quantity discount table above based on the amount of intended aggregate         
purchases as expressed in the letter of intent. New letters of intent are no    
longer being offered. By establishing a letter of intent, a Unitholder agrees   
that the first purchase of Units following the execution of such letter of      
intent will be at least 5% of the total amount of the intended aggregate        
purchases expressed in the Unitholder's letter of intent. Further, through the  
establishment of the letter of intent, the Unitholder agrees that Units         
representing 5% of the total amount of the intended purchases will be held in   
escrow by the Trustee pending completion of these purchases. All distributions  
on Units held in escrow will be credited to the Unitholder's account. If total  
purchases prior to the expiration of the letter of intent period equal or exceed
the amount specified in a Unitholder's letter of intent, the Units held in      
escrow will be transferred to the Unitholder's account. A Unitholder who        
purchases Units during the letter of intent period in excess of the number of   
Units specified in a Unitholder's letter of intent, the amount of which would   
cause the Unitholder to be eligible to receive an additional sales charge       
reduction, will be allowed such additional sales charge reduction on the        
purchase of Units which caused the Unitholder to reach such new breakpoint level
and on all additional purchases of Units during the letter of intent period. If 
the total purchases are less than the amount specified, the Unitholder involved 
must pay the Sponsor an amount equal to the difference between the amounts paid 
for these purchases and the amounts which would have been paid if the higher    
sales charge had been applied; the Unitholder will, however, be entitled to any 
reduced sales charge qualified for by reaching any lower breakpoint level. If   
the Unitholder does not pay the additional amount within 20 days after request  
by the Sponsor or the Unitholder's securities representative, the Sponsor will  
instruct the Trustee to redeem an appropriate number of the escrowed Units to   
meet the required payment. By establishing a letter of intent, a Unitholder     
irrevocably appoints the Sponsor as attorney to give instructions to redeem any 
or all of the Unitholder's escrowed Units, with full power of substitution in   
the premises. A Unitholder or his securities representative must notify the     
Sponsor whenever the Unitholder makes a purchase of Units that he wishes to be  
counted towards the intended amount.                                            

Fee Accounts. A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts
described in this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject only to the
portion of the sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer to the
section called "Fee Accounts" for additional information on these purchases.    
Units may be purchased in the primary or secondary market at the Public Offering
Price less the concession the Sponsor typically allows to brokers and dealers   
for purchases by investors who purchase Units through registered investment     
advisers, certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers who in each
case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning,    
investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in   
connection with the establishment of an investment account for which a          
comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is imposed ("Fee Accounts") if the 
Units are purchased for a Fee Account and the Trust is subject to a Wrap Fee    
(i.e. the Trust is "Wrap Fee Eligible"). The Sponsor reserves the right to limit
or deny purchases of Units described in this paragraph by investors or selling  
firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental to a      
Trust.                                                                          

  Exchanges. During the initial offering period of a Trust, unitholders of any
Van Kampen-sponsored unit investment trust and unitholders of unaffiliated unit 
investment trusts may utilize their redemption or termination proceeds from such
a trust to purchase Units of a Trust offered in this prospectus at a reduced    
sales charge. The reduced sales charge will be equal to the lesser of $35 per   
Unit or 3.50% of the Public Offering Price per Unit for a Long-Term Trust and   
will be equal to the lesser of $25 or 2.50% of the Public Offering Price per    
Unit for an Intermediate-Term or Laddered Trust. In order to be eligible for the
sales charge discounts applicable to Unit purchases made with redemption or     
termination proceeds from other unit investment trusts, the termination or      
redemption proceeds used to purchase Units of a Trust must be derived from a    
transaction that occurred within 30 days of your Unit purchase. In addition, the
discounts will only be available for investors that utilize the same            
broker-dealer (or a different broker-dealer with appropriate notification) for  
both the Unit purchase and the transaction resulting in the receipt of the      
termination or redemption proceeds used for the Unit purchase. You may be       
required to provide appropriate documentation or other information to your      
broker-dealer to evidence your eligibility for these reduced sales charge       
discounts.                                                                      

Employees. Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses and 
children under 21 living in the same household, and trustees, custodians or     
fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons (collectively referred to herein as 
"related purchasers")) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its affiliates and          
Underwriters and their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public Offering     
Price less the applicable underwriting commission or less the applicable dealer 
concession in the absence of an underwriting commission. Employees, officers and
directors (including related purchasers) of dealers and their affiliates may    
purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the applicable dealer          
concession. All employee discounts are subject to the policies of the related   
selling firm. Only employees, officers and directors of companies that allow    
their employees to participate in this employee discount program are eligible   
for the discounts.                                                              

Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts 
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I  
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The price of Units  
on the Date of Deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales charge to  
the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the number of 
Units outstanding. This price determination was made on the basis of an         
evaluation of the bonds prepared by the Evaluator. During the initial offering  
period, the Evaluator will value the bonds as of the Evaluation Time on days the
New York Stock Exchange is open for business and will adjust the Public Offering
Price of Units accordingly. The "Evaluation Time" is the close of trading on the
New York Stock Exchange on each day that the Exchange is open for trading,      
provided, however, on the Date of Deposit the Evaluation Time will be the close 
of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the time the registration  
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission becomes effective,  
if later. The secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit will be equal to  
the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales 
charge and dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. For secondary   
market purposes, this computation will be made by the Evaluator as of the       
Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is tendered for redemption and as
necessary. The offering price of bonds may be expected to average approximately 
0.35-1% more than the bid price. The Public Offering Price per Unit will be     
effective for all orders received prior to the Evaluation Time on each business 
day. Orders received by the Sponsor prior to the Evaluation Time and orders     
received by authorized financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that
are properly transmitted to the Sponsor by the time designated by the Sponsor,  
are priced based on the date of receipt. Orders received by the Sponsor after   
the Evaluation Time, and orders received by authorized financial professionals  
after the Evaluation Time or orders received by such persons that are not       
transmitted to the Sponsor until after the time designated by the Sponsor, are  
priced based on the date of the next determined Public Offering Price per Unit  
provided they are received timely by the Sponsor on such date. It is the        
responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit orders received
by them to the Sponsor so they will be received in a timely manner.             

  The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices or
offering prices, as is appropriate, (a) on the basis of current market prices   
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to    
those held by your Trust; (b) if these prices are not available, on the basis of
current market prices for comparable bonds; (c) by causing the value of the     
bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation, quoting 
or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any combination of the above. Market  
prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest    
rates. Unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in    
significant risk of default, the Evaluator will not attribute any value to the  
insurance obtained by your Trust.                                               

 The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default
in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in significant
risk of default (the "Defaulted Bonds") the value of any insurance guaranteeing 
interest and principal payments. The value of the insurance will be equal to the
difference between (i) the market value of Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise
of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premiums and     
related expenses attributable to the purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii)  
the market value of Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. In      
addition, the Evaluator will consider the ability of a Portfolio Insurer to meet
its commitments under any insurance policy, including commitments to issue      
Permanent Insurance. No value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by your   
Trust, if any, as of the date of this prospectus.                               

A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to 
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's   
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the       
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                             

 Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid semi-annually, although your Trust accrues   
interest daily. Because of this, your Trust always has an amount of interest    
earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with respect to   
sales settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate share of      
accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering Price of
Units. Unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their    
Units on the next distribution date. In an effort to reduce the accrued interest
which would have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee will advance the amount 
of accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of the First  
Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the Public Offering
Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement Date
to the date of settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account     
after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying interest payment dates  
of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the    
amount of interest actually received by your Trust and distributed to           
Unitholders. If a Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he 
will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from
the purchaser of his Units.                                                     

Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by Underwriters,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest.  
The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. During the 
initial offering period, the Sponsor and Underwriters will sell Units to        
non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price  
(net of any sales charge discount) less the concession or agency commission     
described in the following sections.                                            

Intermediate-Term Trusts. During the initial offering period, the Sponsor 
will sell Units of Intermediate-Term Trusts to non-Underwriter broker-dealers   
and selling agents at the Public Offering Price (net of any sales charge        
discount) less the gross concession or agency commission set forth in the       
following table.

Non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other selling agents who purchase an   
aggregate of 250 or more Units from the Sponsor during the initial offering     
period will receive a net concession equal to the concession allowed to         
Underwriters described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below. The  
Sponsor will offer a rebate per Unit equal to the difference between the        
applicable gross broker-dealer concession and the related Underwriter concession
so that the broker-dealer or selling agent receives the appropriate net         
concession or agency commission. The Sponsor will pay this rebate after the end 
of the initial offering period.                                                 

  For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other unit
investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase  
Units of a Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed by the    
Sponsor to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $17.50 per Unit   
for an Intermediate-Term Trust.                                                 

 Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers
and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency     
commission not in excess of the concession allowed to the Underwriter by the    
Sponsor as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below.        

Laddered Trusts. During the initial offering period, the Sponsor will sell
Units of Laddered Trusts to non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at
the Public Offering Price (net of any sales charge discount) less the gross     
concession or agency commission set forth in the following table.

   Notwithstanding the preceding table, non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other
selling agents that purchase 100 or more Units of a Trust from the Sponsor on   
the Date of Deposit ("Qualifying Broker-Dealers") will be allowed a concession  
or agency commission on such Units equal to the regular concession allowed to   
Underwriters described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below. In   
addition, Qualifying Broker-Dealers will be allowed a concession or agency      
commission equal to $27 per Unit on subsequent Unit purchases from the Sponsor  
throughout the remainder of the initial offering period, provided, however, that
a Qualifying Broker-Dealer will be allowed a concession or agency commission    
equal to the concession or agency commission allowed to such firm on the Date of
Deposit for subsequent purchases on a single day equal to the lesser of (a)     
1,000 Units of a Trust (or all remaining Units if the sponsor has less than     
1,000 unsold Units available for sale) or (b) the number of Units of a Trust    
purchased on the Date of Deposit.                                               

Non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other selling agents (other than       
Qualifying Broker-Dealers) who purchase an aggregate of 250 or more Units from  
the Sponsor during the initial offering period will receive a net concession    
equal to $27 per Unit. This net concession will be paid by allowing the regular 
gross concession at the time of purchase and the Sponsor will offer a rebate per
Unit equal to the difference between the applicable gross broker-dealer         
concession and $27 per Unit so that the broker-dealer or selling agent receives 
the appropriate net concession or agency commission. The Sponsor will pay this  
rebate after the end of the initial offering period.                            

  For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other unit
investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase  
Units of a Laddered Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed  
by the Sponsor to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $17.50 per 
Unit for the Trust.                                                             

 Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers
and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency     
commission not in excess of the concession allowed to the Underwriter by the    
Sponsor as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below.        

Long-Term Trusts. During the initial offering period, the Sponsor will sell
Units of Long-Term Trusts to non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents  
at the Public Offering Price (net of any sales charge discount) less the gross  
concession or agency commission set forth in the following table.

   Notwithstanding the preceding table, non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other
selling agents that purchase 100 or more Units of a Long-Term Trust from the    
Sponsor on the Date of Deposit ("Qualifying Broker-Dealers") will be allowed a  
concession or agency commission on such Units equal to the regular concession   
allowed to Underwriters described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation"  
below. In addition, Qualifying Broker-Dealers will be allowed a concession or   
agency commission equal to $35 per Unit on subsequent Unit purchases from the   
Sponsor throughout the remainder of the initial offering period, provided,      
however, that a Qualifying Broker-Dealer will be allowed a concession or agency 
commission equal to the concession or agency commission allowed to such firm on 
the Date of Deposit for subsequent purchases on a single day equal to the lesser
of (a) 1,000 Units of a Trust (or all remaining Units if the Sponsor has less   
than 1,000 unsold Units available for sale) or (b) the number of Units of such  
Trust purchased on the Date of Deposit.                                         

Non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other selling agents (other than       
Qualifying Broker-Dealers) who purchase an aggregate of 250 or more Units from  
the Sponsor during the initial offering period will receive a net concession    
equal to $35 per Unit. This net concession will be paid by allowing the regular 
gross concession at the time of purchase and the Sponsor will offer a rebate per
Unit equal to the difference between the applicable gross broker-dealer         
concession and $35 per Unit so that the broker-dealer or selling agent receives 
the appropriate net concession or agency commission. The Sponsor will pay this  
rebate after the end of the initial offering period.                            

  For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other unit
investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase  
Units of a Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed by the    
Sponsor to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $25 per Unit for a
Long-Term Trust.                                                                

 Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers
and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency     
commission not in excess of the concession allowed to the Underwriter by the    
Sponsor as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below.        

General. The breakpoint concessions or agency commissions above are also  
applied on a dollar basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit  
and will be applied on whichever basis is more favorable to the distributor. The
breakpoints above will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders   
stated in dollars which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement   
that only whole Units be issued.                                                

 In addition to the concession or agency commission and rebates described in
the sections above, all broker-dealers and other selling firms (including       
Underwriters) will be eligible to receive additional compensation based on total
initial offering period sales of all eligible Van Kampen unit investment trusts 
during a Quarterly Period as set forth in the following table:                  

                  Additional
Initial Offering Period Sales                Volume                       
During Quarterly Period                  Concession                       
-------------------------------------------------------                         
$2 million but less than $5 million         0.025%                        
$5 million but less than $10 million         0.050                        
$10 million but less than $50 million        0.075                        
$50 million or more                          0.100                        

  "Quarterly Period" means the following periods: December - February; March -
May; June - August; and September - November. Broker-dealers and other selling  
firms will not receive these additional volume concessions on the sale of units 
which are not subject to a transactional sales charge (as defined in applicable 
prospectuses), however, such sales will be included in determining whether a    
firm has met the sales level breakpoints set forth in the table above. Secondary
market sales of all unit investment trusts are excluded for purposes of these   
volume concessions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wachovia Securities, LLC will
receive the maximum volume concession set forth in the table above for all      
eligible unit sales. The Sponsor will pay these amounts out of the transactional
sales charge received on units within a reasonable time following each Quarterly
Period. For a trust to be eligible for this additional compensation for         
Quarterly Period sales, the trust's prospectus must include disclosure related  
to this additional compensation; a trust is not eligible for this additional    
compensation if the prospectus for such trust does not include disclosure       
related to this additional compensation.                                        

  Certain commercial banks may be making Units available to their customers on
an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these customers (equal to
the agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted to the      
banks. Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or
agent. For secondary market transactions, the Sponsor will sell Units to        
broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession
or agency commission of 80% of the applicable sales charge. Dealers other than  
the Sponsor may sell Units in the secondary market to other broker-dealers and  
selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency         
commission not in excess of the secondary market concession allowed to the      
dealer. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or agency  
commission to dealers and others from time to time.                             

Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation. The Sponsor will sell Units to      
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a gross         
concession described in the sections below. For a list of the Underwriters that 
have purchased Units from the Sponsor, see "Underwriting" in Prospectus Part I. 

Intermediate-Term Trusts. The Sponsor will sell Units of Intermediate-Term
Trusts to Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a     
concession of $22 per Unit underwritten.                                        

In connection with Underwriter sales of Units which are sold in sufficient
size to qualify for quantity discounts, Underwriters are eligible to receive a  
rebate from the Sponsor. This rebate applies only to Units sold out of the      
Underwriter's inventory and will equal the amount by which the sum of the       
related broker-dealer concession and the sales charge discount exceeds the      
regular Underwriter concession. In addition, if a firm commits to act as an     
Underwriter for an Intermediate-Term Trust, the concessions or agency           
commissions allowed will equal the amounts shown above on all Units of such     
Trust distributed during the initial offering period and purchased directly from
the Sponsor rather than the broker-dealer concessions described under "Unit
Distribution", provided, however, that an Underwriter will be allowed a         
concession equal to the Underwriter concession allowed to such firm on the Date 
of Deposit for subsequent purchases equal to at least 1,000 Units of a Trust    
(including any additional compensation described in the next paragraph).        

  Each Underwriter who underwrites 1,000 or more Units in an Intermediate-Term
Trust will receive additional compensation from the Sponsor of $1.00 for each   
Unit it underwrites.                                                            

Laddered Trusts. The Sponsor will sell Units of Laddered Trusts to        
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less the concession  
per Unit underwritten set forth in the following table.                         

               Underwriter

Less than 500 Units                           $27                         
500 Units - 999 Units                          28                         
1,000 Units - 1,999 Units                      29                         
2,000 Units - 2,999 Units                      30                         
3,000 Units or more                            31                         

   In addition, Underwriters of these Trusts will be allowed a concession or
agency commission equal to $27 per Unit on subsequent Unit purchases throughout 
the remainder of the initial offering period rather than the broker-dealer      
concessions described under "Unit Distribution," provided, however, that an     
Underwriter will be allowed a concession equal to the Underwriter concession    
allowed to such firm on the Date of Deposit for subsequent purchases on a single
day equal to the lesser of (a) 1,000 Units of a Trust (or all remaining Units if
the Sponsor has less than 1,000 unsold Units available for sale) or (b) the     
number of Units of a Trust purchased on the Date of Deposit.                    

In connection with Underwriter sales of Units to non-Underwriter      
broker-dealers and other selling agents which Units in turn are sold to         
investors in sufficient size to qualify for quantity discounts, Underwriters are
eligible to receive a rebate from the Sponsor. This rebate is intended to       
reimburse Underwriters for discounts provided to such broker-dealers and agents,
and on these transactions will equal the amount by which the sum of the related 
broker-dealer concession and the sales charge discount exceeds the total        
Underwriter concession.                                                         

Long-Term Trusts. The Sponsor will sell Units of Long-Term Trusts to  
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less the concession  
per Unit underwritten set forth in the following table.

 In addition, Underwriters of a Long-Term Trust will be allowed a concession
or agency commission equal to $35 per Unit on subsequent Unit purchases         
throughout the remainder of the initial offering period rather than the         
broker-dealer concessions described under "Unit Distribution," provided,        
however, that an Underwriter will be allowed a concession equal to the          
Underwriter concession allowed to such firm on the Date of Deposit for          
subsequent purchases on a single day equal to the lesser of (a) 1,000 Units of a
Trust (or all remaining Units if the Sponsor has less than 1,000 unsold Units   
available for sale) or (b) the number of Units of such Trust purchased on the   
Date of Deposit.                                                                

In connection with Underwriter sales of Units to non-Underwriter          
broker-dealers and other selling agents which Units in turn are sold to         
investors in sufficient size to qualify for quantity discounts, Underwriters are
eligible to receive a rebate from the Sponsor. This rebate is intended to       
reimburse Underwriters for discounts provided to such broker-dealers and agents,
and on these transactions will equal the amount by which the sum of the related 
broker-dealer concession and the sales charge discount exceeds the regular      
Underwriter concession.                                                         

General. The breakpoints listed herein will also be applied on a dollar basis
utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied on     
whichever basis is more favorable to the Underwriter. The breakpoints will be   
adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which     
cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be  
issued.                                                                         

In addition, the Sponsor and certain Underwriters will realize a profit or
loss, as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the 
Sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a Trust. See "Portfolio" and "Notes to
Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I. The Sponsor and the Underwriters may also      
realize profits or losses with respect to bonds which were acquired by the      
Sponsor from underwriting syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has
not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the        
underwriting syndicates from which the bonds were acquired. Underwriters may    
further realize profit or loss during the initial offering period as a result of
possible fluctuations in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds       
received from purchasers of Units (excluding dealer concessions or agency       
commissions allowed, if any) will be retained by the Underwriters. Affiliates of
an Underwriter are entitled to the same dealer concessions or agency commissions
that are available to the Underwriter. In addition to any other benefits        
Underwriters may realize from the sale of Units, the Sponsor will share on a pro
rata basis among senior Underwriters (those who underwrite at least 250 Units)  
50% of any gain (less deductions for accrued interest and certain costs)        
represented by the difference between the cost of the bonds to the Sponsor and  
the evaluation of the bonds on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor and certain of  
the other Underwriters will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any 
difference between the price at which Units are purchased and the price at which
Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for Units and
will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased  
Units at a price above or below the purchase price.                             

We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional 
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of the Trust and our 
other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of  
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past   
sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related         
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail        
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or         
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the Trust and our other products. Fees may      
include payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection  
with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars 
of a business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for  
your Units.                                                                     

Market for Units. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to,
and certain of the other Underwriters may, maintain a market for Units and offer
to purchase Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the      
aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal cash  
on hand, less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges      
payable out of your Trust and less any accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of 
Units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it, the Sponsor  
and/or the Underwriters may either discontinue all purchases of Units or        
discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not maintained   
and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will be able to  
dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at the         
Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A Unitholder
who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as to current   
market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in excess of  
the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will notify the
Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the      
secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit,  
it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would       
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.                                    

FEE ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As described above, Units may be available for purchase by investors in Fee
Accounts where the Portfolio is Wrap Fee Eligible. You should consult your      
financial professional to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts.
For these purchases you generally only pay the portion of the sales charge that 
is retained by your Trust's Sponsor, Van Kampen Funds Inc. You should consult   
the "Public Offering--General" section for specific information on this and     
other sales charge discounts. That section governs the calculation of all sales 
charge discounts. The Sponsor reserves the right to limit or deny purchases of  
Units in Fee Accounts by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading      
activity is determined to be detrimental to a Portfolio.                        

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributions of Interest and Principal. Interest received by a Trust, pro
rated on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly unless a Unitholder elects
to receive semi-annual distributions. The amount and time of the first          
distribution is described under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in 
Prospectus Part I. The plan of distribution selected by a Unitholder will remain
in effect until changed. Unitholders who purchase Units in the secondary market 
will receive distributions in accordance with the election of the prior owner.  
Unitholders may change their distribution plan by indicating the change on a    
card which may be obtained from the Trustee and return the card to the Trustee  
with their certificates and other documentation required by the Trustee.        
Certificates should be sent by registered or certified mail to avoid their being
lost or stolen. If the card and certificate are properly presented to the       
Trustee, the change will become effective on the first day after the next       
semi-annual record date and will remain effective until changed.                

Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any  
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the      
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal   
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee, without
interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of 
record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be distributed on
each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date.
All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. Funds in the Principal     
Account will be distributed on each semi-annual distribution date to Unitholders
of record as of the preceding semi-annual record date. The Trustee is not       
required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or Interest Account (but
may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these   
funds) nor to make a distribution from the Principal Account unless the amount  
available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit. However,
should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account equal or  
exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution from the   
Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders of record
on the related monthly record date.                                             

Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate  
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount 
credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose of      
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized to 
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately    
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the   
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a  
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the
second distribution date after the purchase, under the applicable plan of       
distribution.                                                                   

Reinvestment Option. Unitholders may elect to have distributions on their 
Units automatically reinvested in shares of certain Van Kampen mutual funds     
which are registered in the Unitholder's state of residence (the "Reinvestment  
Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment objectives that differ from those
of your Trust. The prospectus relating to each Reinvestment Fund describes its  
investment policies and the procedures to follow to begin reinvestment. A       
Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds from Van Kampen   
Funds Inc.                                                                      

  After becoming a participant in a reinvestment plan, each Trust distribution
will automatically be applied on the applicable distribution date to purchase   
shares of the applicable Reinvestment Fund at a net asset value computed on such
date. Unitholders with an existing Planned Reinvestment Option (PRO) Program    
account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on distribution reinvestments) may   
transfer their existing account into a new PRO account which allows purchases of
Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value. Confirmations of all reinvestments 
will be mailed to the Unitholder by the Reinvestment Fund. A participant may    
elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive future distributions
in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing at least five days before the next  
distribution date. Each Reinvestment Fund, its sponsor and investment adviser   
have the right to terminate its reinvestment plan at any time. Each reinvestment
plan is subject to availability or limitation by each broker-dealer or selling  
firm. Broker-dealers may suspend or terminate the offering of a reinvestment    
plan at any time. Please contact your financial professional for additional     
information.                                                                    

Redemption of Units. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by
tender to the Trustee, at Unit Investment Trust Division, 111 Sanders Creek     
Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, of the certificates representing the    
Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of     
transfer with signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity, such
as in connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of 
applicable governmental charges, if any. Redemption of Units cannot occur until 
certificates representing the Units or satisfactory indemnity have been received
by the Trustee. No later than seven calendar days following satisfactory tender,
the Unitholder will receive an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption     
Price per Unit next computed after receipt by the Trustee of the tender of      
Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received
by the Trustee, except that as regards Units received after the Evaluation Time 
on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the    
next day on which that Exchange is open and the Units will be deemed to have    
been tendered to the Trustee on that day for redemption at the Redemption Price.
Redemption requests received by the Trustee after the Evaluation Time, and      
redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals after the    
Evaluation Time or redemption requests received by such persons that are not    
transmitted to the Trustee until after the time designated by the Trustee, are  
priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price provided they  
are received timely by the Trustee on such date. It is the responsibility of    
authorized financial professionals to transmit redemption requests received by  
them to the Trustee so they will be received in a timely manner. Certain        
broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing 
redemption requests. Units redeemed directly through the Trustee are not subject
to such fees.                                                                   

Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, the Trustee is required to    
withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not     
received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such         
regulations. Any amount withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service 
and may be recovered by the Unitholder only when filing a return. Under normal  
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number    
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender     
Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number 
to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding".           

The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public     
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption    
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price  
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in a Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the   
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, except for cases in which the value 
of insurance has been included, (iii) accrued interest, less (a) amounts        
representing taxes or other governmental charges and (b) the accrued Trust      
expenses. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Unit Price". In determining the      
Redemption Price per Unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance  
maintained on the bonds in a Trust unless the bonds are in default in payment of
principal or interest or in significant risk of default. For a description of   
the situations in which the Evaluator may value the insurance obtained by a     
Trust, see "Public Offering--Unit Price". Accrued interest paid on redemption   
shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if the balance therein is      
insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other amounts will be withdrawn   
from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be cancelled.               

   The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid by
the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented by   
the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When bonds 
are sold, the size and diversity of your Trust will be reduced. Sales may be    
required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result in   
lower prices than might otherwise be realized.                                  

The Trustee reserves the right to satisfy any redemption of 1,000 or more 
Units with an aggregate redemption price of $1,000,000 or more in an in-kind    
distribution of bonds. An in-kind distribution of bonds will be made by the     
Trustee through the distribution of each of the bonds in the Trust in bookentry 
form to the account of the Unitholder's broker-dealer at Depository Trust       
Company. Amounts representing fractional portions of a bond will be distributed 
in cash. The Trustee may adjust the bonds included in a Unitholder's in-kind    
distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole bonds. Special tax         
consequences will result if a Unitholder receives an in-kind distribution.      

   The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for customary    
weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that trading on
that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of which        
disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for other 
periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme circumstances the 
Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full or partial          
suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.                   

Exchange Option. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust   
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Van Kampen
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your financial        
professional for more information about trusts currently available for          
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new 
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this 
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment    
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to dis-cuss tax         
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time.                       

   Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book entry form unless a Unitholder
makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in certificate form.   
Units are transferable by making a written request to the Trustee and, in the   
case of Units in certificate form, by presentation and surrender of the         
certificate to the Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written        
instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the written       
request, or certificate transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears on the 
records of the Trustee and on the face of any certificate with the signature    
guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program 
("STAMP") or a signature guaranty program accepted by the Trustee. The Trustee  
may require additional documents such as, but not limited to, trust instruments,
certificates of death, appointments as executor or administrator or certificates
of corporate authority. Certificates will be issued in denominations of one Unit
or any multiple thereof. Although no such charge is now made, the Trustee may   
require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee for each certificate re-issued or  
transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, stolen, mutilated or lost         
certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the Trustee of satisfactory      
indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses incurred. Mutilated    
certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.                

  Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and other
receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems it to 
be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of your Trust will be      
audited annually by independent registered public accounting firm and the report
of the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within a      
reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will furnish  
to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a statement     
describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual Trust       
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust information. 
Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the bonds upon     
request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your    
Portfolio, please contact your financial adviser or the Trustee. The Sponsor    
does not have access to individual account information.                         

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS 
IN AN INSURED TRUST 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insurance has been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and   
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in an Insured Trust. An insurance  
policy obtained by an Insured Trust is non-cancelable and will continue in force
so long as the Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is still 
in business and the bonds described in the policy continue to be held by the    
Trust. Any portfolio insurance premium for an Insured Trust is paid by the Trust
on a monthly basis. The premium for any Preinsured Bond insurance has been paid 
by the issuer, by a prior owner of the bonds or the Sponsor and any policy is   
non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are   
outstanding and the Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. The Portfolio  
Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are described in "Portfolio" for each 
Insured Trust and the notes thereto in Prospectus Part I. More detailed         
information regarding insurance on the bonds and the Preinsured Bond and        
Portfolio Insurers is included in the Information Supplement. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

The portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust guarantees the timely
payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they fall due. For this     
purpose, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of 
principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer defaults in the     
payment of principal or interest, (b) an issuer enters into a bankruptcy        
proceeding or (c) the maturity of the bond is accelerated, the affected         
Portfolio Insurer has the option to pay the outstanding principal amount of the 
bond plus accrued interest to the date of payment and thereby retire the bond   
from an Insured Trust prior to the bond's stated maturity date. The insurance   
does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units. The 
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy has 
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the bond (i.e.,         
insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of the holder) (the
"Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance     
premium and expenses from the proceeds of the sale of the bond. It is expected  
that the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if 
upon exercise an Insured Trust would receive net proceeds in excess of the sale 
proceeds if the bonds were sold on an uninsured basis.                          

Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of      
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform on 
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made. At the date      
hereof, it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be 
submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which would materially impair the    
ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of  
insurance. The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished
by such companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio     
Insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and
is subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made   
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

Portfolio, please contact the Trustee at its principal unit investment trust    
division offices or your financial adviser. The Sponsor does not have access to 
individual account information. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision  
and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured  
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.    
Additional information regarding the Trustee is set forth in the Information    
Supplement, including the Trustee's qualifications and duties, its ability to   
resign, the effect of a merger involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability  
to remove and replace the Trustee. See "Additional Information".                

Portfolio Administration. Your Trust is not a managed fund and, except as 
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.  
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited          
situations to protect your Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These     
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds or
other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of certain 
legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated by the    
Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The          
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold   
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited     
circumstances, the Trustee must reject any offer by an issuer to issue bonds in 
exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or refinancing      
plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange or          
substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed description of
circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

  If a Trust is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax
purposes, the Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of    
bonds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, 
in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the bonds detrimental to 
the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the 
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for
inclusion in the trust on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also instruct the
Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that such a Trust continues to       
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company and to avoid       
imposition of tax on undistributed income of the Trust.                         

Replacement Bonds. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its 
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from  
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not be
reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been         
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be 
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of 
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must 
(i) be long-term or intermediate term, as applicable, bonds, debentures, notes  
or other straight debt obligations (whether secured or unsecured and whether    
senior or subordinated) without equity or other conversion features, with fixed 
maturity dates substantially the same as those of the Failed Bonds having no    
warrants or subscription privileges attached; (ii) be payable in United States  
currency; (iii) not be when, as and if issued obligations or restricted         
securities; (iv) be issued after July 18, 1984 if the interest is United States 
source income; (v) be issued or guaranteed by an issuer subject to or exempt    
from the reporting requirements under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities     
Exchange Act of 1934 (or similar provisions of law) or guaranteed, directly or  
indirectly, by means of a lease agreement, agreement to buy securities, services
or products, or other similar commitment of the credit of such an issuer to the 
payment of the substitute bonds; (vi) maintain the Standard & Poor's AAA rating 
for an Insured Trust; and (vii) be eligible for (and when acquired be insured   
under) the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust. The Trustee shall notify all 
Unitholders of a Trust within five days after the acquisition of a Replacement  
Bond and shall make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the 
cost of the Failed Bond exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued  
interest. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales   
charge attributable to the Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of a Trust and       
distribute the principal and accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed 
Bonds to the date of removal from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds   
within 30 days after removal. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated   
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current  
Return and Estimated Long-Term Return might be lowered. Unitholders may not be  
able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in   
excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.                                        

   Amendment of Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the Trust
Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision which may 
be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely     
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the      
Sponsor and the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the
number of Units or to permit the acquisition of bonds in addition to or in      
substitution for any of the bonds initially deposited in a Trust, except for the
substitution of certain refunding bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders of 
any amendment.                                                                  

Termination of Trust Agreement. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A Trust may also  
be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 75% of the Units then    
outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% of   
the original principal amount of bonds. A Trust will be liquidated by the       
Trustee in the event that a sufficient number of Units of the Trust not yet sold
are tendered for redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust  
would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time    
they were deposited in the Trust. The Trustee will notify each Unitholder of any
termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any remaining      
bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower amount than     
might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that time. For this 
reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination may  
be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at the time of     
purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share of the       
balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs,        
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution       
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion       
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will    
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains    
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

Limitation on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee 
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful       
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the       
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless      
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be   
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of
any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the   
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for any 
action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not  
liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as     
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be        
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the    
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by
the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information
available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be under no        
liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in judgment.        

FEDERAL TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning Units of a Trust. This section is current as of the date of this      
prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries 
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For example, these
summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation, a  
non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special circumstances. 
In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax    
consequences.                                                                   

  This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions   
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review, and
has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of
the assets to be deposited in the Trust. This may not be sufficient for you to  
use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law.                

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Trust Status. The Trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment     
company" under the federal tax laws. If the Trust qualifies as a regulated      
investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law, the   
Trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.                              

Distributions. Trust distributions are generally taxable. After the end of
each year, you will receive a tax statement that separates your Trust's         
distributions into two categories: ordinary income distributions and capital    
gains dividends.                                                                

  Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate.
Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains
regardless of how long you have owned your shares. To determine your actual tax 
liability for your capital gains dividends, you must calculate your total net   
capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other       
taxable transactions, as described below. In addition, the Trust may make       
distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will 
generally not be taxable to you. The tax status of your distributions from your 
Trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional  
shares or receive them in cash. The income from your Trust that you must take   
into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to  
pay a deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws may require you to treat      
distributions made to you in January as if you had received them on December 31 
of the previous year.                                                           

Dividends Received Deduction. A corporation that owns Units generally will
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends   
received from the Trust because the dividends received deduction is generally   
not available for distributions from regulated investment companies.            

Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your Units, you will   
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain
or loss, you must subtract your tax basis in your Units from the amount you     
receive in the transaction. Your tax basis in your Units is generally equal to  
the cost of your Units, generally including sales charges. In some cases,       
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your Units.   

Capital Gains and Losses. If you are an individual, the maximum marginal  
federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally 15% (generally 5% for certain
taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). These capital gains rates are       
generally effective for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011. For     
later periods, if you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate  
for net capital gain is generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 
15% tax brackets). The 20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to
8% for long-term capital gains from most property acquired after December 31,
2000 with a holding period of more than five years.                             

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term   
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a 
capital gain dividend from your Trust and sell your Unit at a loss after holding
it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as long-term capital
loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received. The tax rates for     
capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the  
same as for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code treats certain capital   
gains as ordinary income in special situations.                                 

Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over 
into a future series of the Trust, the exchange would generally be considered a 
sale for federal income tax purposes.                                           

In-Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this  
prospectus, you may receive an inkind distribution of Trust Assets when you     
redeem your Units. This distribution will be treated as a sale for federal      
income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss, generally    
based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash        
received. The Internal Revenue Service could however assert that a loss could   
not be currently deducted.                                                      

   Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Expenses incurred and deducted by your Trust
will generally not be treated as income taxable to you. In some cases, however, 
you may be required to treat your portion of these Trust expenses as income. In 
these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses. However,    
certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses, may be  
deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  
2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.                                   

EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account and,
to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,     
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts. The Trustee also may       
withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to     
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts.     
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until   
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the    
appropriate Accounts. All costs and expenses incurred in creating and           
establishing the Trusts, including the cost of the initial preparation, printing
and execution of the Trust Agreement and the certificates, legal and accounting 
expenses, advertising and selling expenses, expenses of the Trustee, initial    
evaluation fees and other out-of-pocket expenses have been borne by the Sponsor 
at no cost to the Trusts.                                                       

 Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated     
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for     
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio   
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of  
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts will not exceed the     
total cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will   
receive the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's         
portfolio. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under    
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be 
reduced as described therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its       
services is expected to result from the use of the funds being held in the      
Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses   
and redemptions since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders.   
These fees are based on the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on  
the Date of Deposit for the first year and as of the close of business on       
January 1 for each year thereafter.                                             

   Insurance. Premiums for any portfolio insurance are obligations of an Insured
Trust and are payable monthly by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. As bonds   
covered by a portfolio insurance policy in an Insured Trust are redeemed by     
their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the amount of the premium  
will be reduced in respect of those bonds. If the Trustee exercises the right to
obtain permanent insurance, the premiums payable for such permanent insurance   
will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of the related bonds.         

Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be    
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b) 
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel  
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and   
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights   
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,  
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any special        
custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds in a     
Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of  
the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for advancing funds  
to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may be adjusted      
periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest rates). Each    
Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration statement    
each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trusts.
When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee, they are       
secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the balances in  
the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts     
payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such amounts.

Risk Factors

The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the               
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. Neither the Sponsor nor
the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any
of the bonds.                                                                   

Consumer Product and Retail Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in
issuers that manufacture or sell consumer products. The profitability of these  
companies will be affected by various factors including the general state of the
economy and consumer spending trends. In the past, there have been major changes
in the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the   
major corporations involved in the retail industry, particularly the department 
store segment. The continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the
industry's ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social      
conditions, to attract and retain capable management, and to finance expansion. 
Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a recessionary economic climate
with the consequent slowdown in employment growth, less favorable trends in     
unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth 
could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer       
confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending habits. In addition,          
competitiveness of the retail industry will require large capital outlays for   
investment in the installation of automated checkout equipment to control       
inventory, to track the sale of individual items and to gauge the success of    
sales campaigns. Increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an 
adverse effect on the industry. In many sectors of the retail industry,         
competition may be fierce due to market saturation, converging consumer tastes  
and other factors. Because of these factors and the recent increase in trade    
opportunities with other countries, American retailers are now entering global  
markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies, 
difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research   
costs.                                                                          

   Financial Services Companies. The Trust may invest in issuers within the bank
and financial services sector in general.                                       

Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse   
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and  
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Banks are highly     
dependent on net interest margin. Recently, bank profits have come under        
pressure as net interest margins have contracted, but volume gains have been    
strong in both commercial and consumer products. There is no certainty that such
conditions will continue. Banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee  
income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets. As initial    
home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing     
interest rates and other factors, this income diminished. Economic conditions in
the real estate markets, which have been weak in the past, can have a           
substantial effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their    
assets invested in loans secured by real estate. Banks and their holding        
companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and, when such            
institutions are state-chartered, to state regulation as well. Such regulations 
impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of  
business activities that banks may pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a  
wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement   
authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a        
particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of  
such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory
actions, such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to    
banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks  
and thrifts to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), can          
negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends.       
Neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations, however,    
insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies, or   
insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such         
institutions.                                                                   

  The statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks
and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone     
substantial change in recent years. To a great extent, these changes are        
embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act;    
enacted in August 1989, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement   
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. Many of the      
regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been finalized
and their impact on the business, financial condition and prospects of the      
Securities in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The     
recently enacted Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial-services overhaul legislation will
allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to form one-stop financial
conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors.
This legislation will likely result in increased merger activity and heightened 
competition among existing and new participants in the field. Legislation to    
liberalize interstate banking has recently been signed into law. Under the      
legislation, banks will be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any
state, one year after the legislation's enactment. Since mid-1997, banks have   
been allowed to turn existing banks into branches. Consolidation is likely to   
continue. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting   
Standards Board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and
have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in
trading accounts or available for sale. Adoption of additional such rules may   
result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry, and      
mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems. Additional           
legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For example, the bank    
regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the Community       
Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and there can be 
no certainty as to the effect, if any, that such changes would have on the bonds
in the Trust's portfolio. In addition, from time to time the deposit insurance  
system is reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and proposed reforms of  
that system could, among other things, further restrict the ways in which       
deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of  
deposits insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce profitability, as 
investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and 
as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits. Banks face     
significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds, 
credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance companies, and increased
competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national     
interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such legislation allows banks  
and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines  
and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit. Neither the   
Sponsor nor any Underwriter makes any prediction as to what, if any, manner of  
bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such
actions might have on the Trust's portfolio.                                    

The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank   
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the 
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding  
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)   
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or      
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to   
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,     
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the        
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting         
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the        
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve, 
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community    
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective      
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing         
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal    
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the     
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.                                                      

The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by 
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view that
a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash     
dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that
would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also may impose
limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of       
certain applications, including applications for approval of mergers and        
acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor any Underwriter makes any prediction as to
the effect, if any, such laws will have on the bonds or whether such approvals, 
if necessary, will be obtained.                                                 

Companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the
adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and competition 
from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes in the direction 
of the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level  
and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could       
adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these 
companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including increased competition 
with new and existing competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional   
businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology    
could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment        
management and brokerage industries. Companies involved in the investment       
management industry are also subject to extensive regulation by government      
agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or 
rules, or in the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could       
adversely affect such companies.                                                

   Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many  
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,      
including but not limited to interest rate movements, the imposition of premium 
rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings,      
competition and pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other     
disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual companies may be exposed
to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from
reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental 
regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate levels, which may not be   
adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or potential tax law changes may  
also adversely affect insurance companies' policy sales, tax obligations and    
profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit margins of these companies  
continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses, new    
competitors, capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete 
globally.                                                                       

In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the    
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors, 
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:           

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
       property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
         could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
  material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;                                                  

o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be   
          expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
         have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;                                

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
   property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;          

  o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
        appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
  light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
         insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;        

    o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;

    o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
   value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and              

     o    the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables.         

   The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come under
increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have considered or   
enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate
insurance companies and insurance holding company systems. Further, the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and state insurance regulators  
are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on        
insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new
laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the  
condition of the insurance industry in the United States to determine whether to
promulgate additional federal regulation. The Sponsor is unable to predict      
whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or
scope of regulation of the insurance industry, or what effect, if any, such     
legislation would have on the industry.                                         

All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that    
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of  
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws 
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as         
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some    
instances, would require divestiture.                                           

 Telecommunications Issuers. Because your Trust may be concentrated in bonds
issued by telecommunications companies, the value of the Units may be           
susceptible to factors affecting the telecommunications industry. The           
telecommunications industry is subject to governmental regulation, and the      
products and services of telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid   
obsolescence. These factors could affect the value of Units. Telephone companies
in the United States, for example, are subject to both state and federal        
regulations affecting permitted rates of returns and the kinds of services that 
may be offered. Certain types of companies represented in a portfolio are       
engaged in fierce competition for a share of the market of their products. As a 
result, competitive pressures are intense and the stocks are subject to rapid   
price volatility.                                                               

Several recent high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications      
companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of                
telecommunications companies. High debt loads that were accumulated during the  
industry growth spurt of the 1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt
and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications      
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.  
At the same time, demand for some telecommunications services has fallen        
sharply, as several key markets have become oversaturated, some local customers 
have switched to substitute providers and technologies, and corporate profits   
and the economy generally remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies
may have to commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new  
products and services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have  
been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing,           
consolidating and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling      
product lines. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the   
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of    
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased             
substantially and may continue to rise.                                         

  While a portfolio may concentrate on the securities of established suppliers
of traditional telecommunication products and services, a Trust may also invest 
in bonds of smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the     
development of new products and services. These smaller companies may present   
greater opportunities for capital appreciation, and may also involve greater    
risk than large, established issuers. Such smaller companies may have limited   
product lines, market or financial resources, and their securities may trade    
less frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger, more       
established companies. As a result, the prices of the securities of such smaller
companies may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of securities of    
other issuers.                                                                  

In addition, recent federal legislation governing the United States       
telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional   
interpretation, which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are   
held by a Trust.                                                                

Taxable Municipal Issues. Certain bonds in a Trust may consist of taxable 
obligations of municipal issuers. Obligations of municipal issuers can be either
general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing power  
of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or
authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes.            

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the    
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or  
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.                          

 Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

 Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease     
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments  
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to 
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a          
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not 
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                              

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from     
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on
bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services,
competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce
costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and claims, and    
government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).                

 Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number of
college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,         
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

   Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or improving
industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these projects. The   
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as
the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project, revenues         
generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or other    
regulatory restrictions.                                                        

Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing
projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally         
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their   
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage
default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies.    

Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from  
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or 
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and
demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate         
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

 Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

 Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.                   

 Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on
variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from     
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air, rail
and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation modes
and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers
that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                         

Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from 
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

   Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to make    
payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for     
electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government regulation and
rate approvals.                                                                 

Zero Coupon Bonds. Certain of the bonds in a Trust may be "zero coupon"   
bonds. Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer     
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond  
and does not receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep  
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero    
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original          
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such  
income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount bond,
but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at higher rates
in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially  
greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than
are securities of comparable quality which pay interest.                        

Insurance on the Bonds in an Insured Trust

  Insurance has been obtained by each Insured Trust, by the issuer of bonds in
each Insured Trust, by a prior owner of such bonds, or by the Sponsor prior the 
deposit of such bonds guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal,    
when due, in respect of the bonds in such Insured Trust. See "The
Trusts--Objective and Bond Selection" in the prospectus. Each insurance policy  
obtained by an Insured Trust, is non-cancelable and will continue in force so   
long as such Insured Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is 
still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by 
such Insured Trust (see "Portfolio" for the Trust in the Prospectus Part I).    
Non-payment of premiums on a policy obtained by an Insured Trust will not result
in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take action      
against the Trustee to recover premium payments due it. The Trustee in turn will
be entitled to recover such payments from such Insured Trust. Premium rates for 
each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by an Insured Trust are    
fixed for the life of an Insured Trust. The premium for any insurance policy or 
policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer, and any   
such policy or policies are non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as
the bonds so insured are outstanding and the Portfolio Insurer remains in       
business. If the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to 
meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the         
claims-paying ability of any such insurer deteriorates, the Portfolio Insurers  
have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above
described events.                                                               

   The aforementioned Trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of principal
and interest on the bonds as they fall due. For the purposes of the Portfolio   
Insurance, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the payment  
of principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer of a bond        
defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond, (b) such issuer  
enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of such bond is         
accelerated, the Portfolio Insurer involved has the option, in its sole         
discretion, for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest 
to occur of such a default, bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the    
outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of  
such payment and thereby retire the bond from an Insured Trust prior to such    
bond's stated maturity date. The insurance does not guarantee the market value  
of the bonds or the value of the Units. Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust  
is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such Insured Trust. In the   
event of a sale of any such bond by the Trustee, such insurance terminates as to
such bond on the date of sale.                                                  

   Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the Portfolio Insurers, the Trustee,
upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy obtained by  
an Insured Trust, has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to   
such bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of the identity  
of the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single 
predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from the       
proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust is 
eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that the Trustee would  
exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such exercise an  
Insured Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of bond proceeds less the        
insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the Permanent Insurance) 
from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold on an     
uninsured basis.The insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible for    
Permanent Insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each bond
as of the Date of Deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any change
in the creditworthiness of each bond.                                           

The Sponsor believes that the Permanent Insurance option provides an      
advantage to an Insured Trust in that each bond insured by an Insured Trust     
insurance policy may be sold out of the Insured Trust with the benefits of the  
insurance attaching thereto. Thus, the value of the insurance, if any, at the   
time of sale, can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold (which is 
not the case in connection with any value attributable to such Insured Trust's  
portfolio insurance). See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the Prospectus   
Part II. Because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of
the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the Permanent Insurance option, 
the Sponsor anticipates that (a) in the event an Insured Trust were to be       
comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of
default, it is much less likely that the Insured Trust would need at some point 
in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of Units than if the Insured Trust  
were to have no such option (see "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in
the Prospectus Part II) and (b) at the time of termination of an Insured Trust, 
if the Insured Trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk  
of default, the Insured Trust would not need to hold such bonds until their     
respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the Insured Trust's   
portfolio insurance. (See "Trust Administration--Termination of Trust Agreement"
in the Prospectus Part II.)                                                     

Except as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no  
effect on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention of
the Evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance (including the right to   
obtain Permanent Insurance) for the purpose of computing the price or redemption
value of Units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment 
of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default. The value of   
the insurance will be equal to the difference between (i) the market value of a 
bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant  
risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent     
Insurance (less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the  
purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such bond not     
covered by Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the    
Prospectus Part II for a more complete description of an Insured Trust's method 
of valuing defaulted bonds which have a significant risk of default.            

Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Effective July 14, 1997, 
AMBAC Indemnity Corporation changed its name to Ambac Assurance Corporation. The
Insurance Policy of Ambac Assurance obtained by an Insured Trust is             
noncancelable and will continue in force for so long as the bonds described in  
the Insurance Policy are held by an Insured Trust. A monthly premium is paid by 
an Insured Trust for the Insurance Policy obtained by it. The Trustee will pay, 
when due, successively, the full amount of each installment of the insurance    
premium. Pursuant to a binding agreement with Ambac Assurance, in the event of a
sale of a bond covered by the Ambac Assurance Insurance Policy, the Trustee has 
the right to obtain permanent insurance for such bond upon payment of a single  
predetermined premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond.               

   Under the terms of the Insurance Policy, Ambac Assurance agrees to pay to the
Trustee that portion of the principal of and interest on the bonds insured by   
Ambac Assurance which shall become due for payment but shall be unpaid by reason
of nonpayment by the issuer of the bonds. The term "due for payment" means, when
referring to the principal of a bond so insured, its stated maturity date or the
date on which it shall have been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption   
and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call
for redemption (other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration  
or other advancement of maturity and means, when referring to interest on a     
bond, the stated date for payment of interest.                                  

 Ambac Assurance will make payment to the Trustee not later than thirty days
after notice from the Trustee is received by Ambac Assurance that a nonpayment  
of principal or of interest on a bond has occurred, but not earlier that the    
date on which the bonds are due for payment. Ambac Assurance will disburse to   
the Trustee the face amount of principal and interest which is then due for     
payment but is unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer in exchange for     
delivery of bonds, not less in face amount than the amount of the payment in    
bearer form, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and uncancelled. In   
cases where bonds are issuable only in a form whereby principal is payable to   
registered holders or their assigns, Ambac Assurance shall pay principal only   
upon presentation and surrender of the unpaid bonds uncancelled and free of any 
adverse claim, together with an instrument of assignment in satisfactory form,  
so as to permit ownership of such bonds to be registered in the name of Ambac   
Assurance or its nominee. In cases where bonds are issuable only in a form      
whereby interest is payable to registered holders or their assigns, Ambac       
Assurance shall pay interest only upon presentation of proof that the claimant  
is the person entitled to the payment of interest of the bonds and delivery of  
an instrument of assignment, in satisfactory form, transferring to Ambac        
Assurance all right under such bonds to receive the interest of which the       
insurance payment was made.

   Financial Guaranty Insurance Company. Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, a
New York stock insurance corporation ("Financial Guaranty"), is a direct,       
wholly-owned subsidiary of FGIC Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and        
provides financial guaranty insurance for public finance and structured finance

On December 18, 2003, an investor group consisting of The PMI Group, Inc. 
("PMI"), affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. ("Blackstone"), affiliates of  
The Cypress Group L.L.C. ("Cypress") and affiliates of CIVC Partners L.P.       
("CIVC") acquired FGIC Corporation (the "FGIC Acquisition") from a subsidiary of
General Electric Cap[ital Corporation ("GE Capital"). PMI, Blackstone, Cypress  
and CIVC acquired approximately 42%, 23%, 23% and 7%, respectively, of FGIC     
Corporation's common stock. FGIC Corporation paid GE Capital approximately      
$284.3 million in pre-closing dividends from the proceeds of dividends it, in   
turn, had received from Financial Guaranty, and GE Capital retained             
approximately $234.6 million in liquidation preference of FGIC Corporation's    
convertible participating preferred stock and approximately 5% of FGIC          
Corporation's common stock. Neither FGIC Corporation nor any of its shareholders
is obligated to pay any debts of Financial Guaranty or any claims under any     
insurance policy issued by Financial Guaranty.                                  

Financial Guaranty is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the
State of New York, where it is domiciled, including Article 69 of the New York  
Insurance Law ("Article 69"), a comprehensive financial guaranty insurance      
statue. Financial Guaranty is also subject to the insurance laws and regulations
of all other jurisdictions in which it is licensed to transact insurance        
business. The insurance laws and regulations, as well as the level of           
supervisory authority that may be exercised by the various insurance regulators,
vary by jurisdiction, but generally require insurance companies to maintain     
minimum standards of business conduct and solvency, to meet certain financial   
tests, to comply with requirements concerning permitted investments and the use 
of policy forms and premium rates and to file quarterly and annual financial    
statements on the basis of statutory accounting principles ("SAP") and other    
reports. In addition, Article 69, among other things, limits the business of    
each financial guaranty insurer, including Financial Guaranty, to financial     
guaranty insurance and certain related lines.

31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, Financial Guaranty had written directly or      
assumed through reinsurance, guaranties of approximately $43.5 billion, $42.4   
billion and $47.9 billion par value of securities, respectively (of which       
approximately 57%, 79% and 80%, respectively, constituted guaranties of         
municipal bonds), for which it had collected gross premiums of approximately    
$250.7 million, $260.3 million and $232.6 million, respectively. For the nine   
months ended September 30, 2004, Financial Guaranty had reinsured, through      
facultative arrangements, approximately 0.1% of the risks it had written.       

As of September 30, 2004, Financial Guaranty had net admitted assets of   
approximately $3.015 billion, total liabilities of approximately $1.877 billion,
and total capital and policyholders' surplus of approximately $1.138 billion,   
determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or      
permitted by insurance regulatory authorities.

XL Capital Assurance Inc. (formed September 13, 1999) with and into London, with
London as the surviving entity. London immediately changed its name to XL       
Capital Assurance Inc. All previous business of London was 100% reinsured to    
Royal Indemnity Company, the previous owner at the time of acquisition.         

   XLCA has entered into a facultative quota share reinsurance agreement with XL
Financial Assurance Ltd ("XLFA"), an insurance company organized under the laws 
of Bermuda, and an affiliate of XLCA. Pursuant to this reinsurance agreement,   
XLCA expects to cede up to 90% of its business to XLFA. XLCA may also cede      
reinsurance to third parties on a transaction-specific basis, which cessions may
be any or a combination of quota share, first loss or excess of loss. Such      
reinsurance is used by XLCA as a risk management device and to comply with      
statutory and rating agency requirements and does not alter or XLCA's           
obligations under any financial guaranty insurance policy. With respect to any  
transaction insured by XLCA, the percentage of risk ceded to XLFA may be less   
than 90% depending on certain factors including, without limitation, whether    
XLCA has obtained third party reinsurance covering the risk. As a result, there 
can be no assurance as to the percentage reinsured by XLFA of any given         
financial guaranty insurance policy issued by XLCA, including the Certificate   
Insurance Policy.                                                               

Based on the audited financials of XLFA, as of December 31, 2003, XLFA had
total assets, liabilities, redeemable preferred shares and shareholders' equity 
of $831,762,000, $401,123,000, $39,000,000 and $391,639,000, respectively,      
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the   
United States. XLFA's insurance financial strength is rated "Aaa" by Moody's and
"AAA" by S&P and Fitch Inc. In addition, XLFA has obtained a financial          
enhancement rating of "AAA" from S&P.                                           

The obligations of XLFA to XLCA under the reinsurance agreement described 
above are unconditionally guaranteed by XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd ("XLI"), a   
Bermuda company and one of the world's leading excess commercial insurers. XLI  
is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of XL Capital Ltd. In addition to A.M.    
Best's rating of "A+" (Negative Outlook), XLI's insurance financial strength    
rating is "Aa2" by Moody's, "AA-" by Standard & Poor's and "AA" by Fitch.       

XLCA's insurance financial strength is rated "Aaa" by Moody's and "AAA" by
Standard & Poor's and Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"). In addition, XLCA has obtained a   
financial enhancement rating of "AAA" from Standard & Poor's. These ratings     
reflect Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch's current assessment of XLCA's     
creditworthiness and claims-paying ability as well as the reinsurance           
arrangement with XLFA described above.                                          

 Based on the audited statutory financial statements for XLCA as of December
31, 2002 filed with the State of New York Insurance Department, XLCA has total  
admitted assets of $180,993,189, total liabilities of $58,685,217 and total     
capital and surplus of $122,307,972 determined in accordance with statutory     
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities
("SAP"). Based on the audited statutory financial statements for XLCA as of     
December 31, 2003 filed with the State of New York Insurance Department, XLCA   
has total admitted assets of $329,701,823, total liabilities of $121,635,535 and
total capital and surplus of $208,066,288 determined in accordance with SAP.    

XLCA is regulated by the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New  
York. In addition, XLCA is subject to regulation by the insurance laws and      
regulations of the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed. As a financial  
guaranty insurance company licensed in the State of New York, XLCA is subject to
Article 69 of the New York Insurance Law, which, among other things, limits the 
business of each insurer to financial guaranty insurance and related lines,     
prescribes minimum standards of solvency, including minimum capital             
requirements, establishes contingency, loss and unearned premium reserve        
requirements, requires the maintenance of minimum surplus to policyholders and  
limits the aggregate amount of insurance which may be written and the maximum   
size of any single risk exposure which may be assumed. XLCA is also required to 
file detailed annual financial statements with the New York Insurance Department
and similar supervisory agencies in each of the other jurisdictions in which it 
is licensed.                                                                    

The extent of state insurance regulation and supervision varies by        
jurisdiction, but New York and most other jurisdictions have laws and           
regulations prescribing permitted investments and governing the payment of      
dividends, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions  
or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings.                

  The information relating to XLCA and its affiliates contained above has been
furnished by XLCA. No representation is made herein as to the accuracy or       
adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any adverse changes in  
such information subsequent to the date hereof.                                 

CDC IXIS Financial Guaranty North America, Inc. ("CFIGNA") is a monoline  
financial guaranty insurance company incorporated under the laws of the State of
New York, with its principal place of business in New York City.                

The claims-paying ability (also referred to as its financial strength) of 
CIFGNA is rated "AAA" by Fitch, "Aaa" by Moody's, and "AAA" by Standard and     
Poor's, the highest rating assigned by each such rating agency. Each rating of  
CIFGNA should be evaluated independently. The ratings reflect the respective    
rating agency's current assessment of the creditworthiness of CIFGNA and its    
ability to pay claims on its policies of insurance based upon, among other      
factors, the adequacy of the net worth maintenance and reinsurance agreements   
provided by CIFGNA described below. Any further explanation as to the           
significance of the above ratings may be obtained only from the applicable      
rating agency. The above ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold   
CIFGNA insured bonds, and such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal 
at any time by the Rating Agencies. Any downward revision or withdrawal of any  
of the above ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price of the      
CIFGNA insured bonds. CIFGNA does not guarantee the market price of bonds nor   
does it guaranty that the ratings on bonds will not be revised or withdrawn.    

CIFGNA is licensed and subject to regulation as a financial guaranty      
insurance corporation under the laws of the State of New York, its state of     
domicile, and is licensed to do business in over 40 jurisdictions. CIFGNA is    
subject to Article 69 of the New York Insurance Law which, among other things,  
limits the business of such insurers to financial guaranty insurance and related
lines, requires that each such insurer maintain a minimum surplus to            
policyholders, establishes contingency, loss and unearned premium reserve       
requirements for each such insurer, and limits the size of individual           
transactions ("single risks") and the volume of transactions ("aggregate risks")
that may be underwritten by such insurers. Other provisions of the New York     
Insurance Law applicable to non-life insurance companies such as CIFGNA         
regulate, among other things, permitted investments, payment of dividends,      
transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions or sales of 
assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings. CIFGNA is required to file 
quarterly and annual statutory financial statements with the New York State     
Insurance Department ("NYSID") and is subject to statutory restrictions         
concerning the types and quality of its investments and the filing and use of   
policy forms and premium rates. Additionally, CIFGNA's accounts and operations  
are subject to periodic examination by the NYSID.                               

THE INSURANCE PROVIDED BY CIFGNA IS NOT COVERED BY THE PROPERTY/CASUALTY  
INSURANCE SECURITY FUND SPECIFIED BY THE INSURANCE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW     
YORK.                                                                           

In addition to its capital and surplus as set forth below, CIFGNA is      
supported by a net worth maintenance agreement from its indirect parent, CDC    
IXIS Financial Guaranty, a French reinsurance corporation ("CIFG"). The net     
worth maintenance agreement provides that CIFG will maintain CIFGNA's U.S.      
statutory capital and surplus at no less than $80 million. In addition, through 
a facultative reinsurance agreement, CIFGNA may cede up to 90% of its exposure  
on each transaction to CIFG; however, the facultative reinsurance agreement does
not require that CIFG reinsure its exposure under any transaction. CIFG's       
claims-paying ability is rated "Aaa" by Moodys, "AAA" by Standard & Poor's and  
"AAA" by Fitch, the highest rating assigned by each such Rating Agency.         
Notwithstanding these net worth maintenance and reinsurance agreements, the     
holders of bonds insured by CIFGNA will have direct recourse against CIFGNA     
only, and neither CIFG nor any other affiliate of CIFGNA will be directly liable
to the holders of such bonds.                                                   

 The following table sets forth the capitalization of CIFGNA as of September
30, 2004, on the basis of accounting principles prescribed or permitted by the

The extent of state insurance regulation and supervision varies by        
jurisdiction, but New York and most other jurisdictions have laws and           
regulations prescribing permitted investments and governing the payment of      
dividends, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions  
or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings.                

  In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due, in respect of
a bond, a Portfolio Insurer shall make such payment after the respective insurer
has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened (but not   
earlier than the date such payment is due). The insurer, as regards any payment 
it may make, will succeed to the rights of the Trustee in respect thereof. All  
policies issued by the Portfolio Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are  
substantially identical insofar as obligations to an Insured Trust are          
concerned.                                                                      

   The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished by such
companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio Insurer     
appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is     
subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made      
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

Portfolio Administration

   The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units tendered
by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may not be   
available, such of the bonds designated by the Supervisor as the Trustee in its 
sole discretion may deem necessary. The Supervisor, in designating such bonds,  
will consider a variety of factors, including (a) interest rates, (b) market    
value and (c) marketability. To the extent that bonds are sold which are current
in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption requests and   
defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve the related  
insurance protection applicable to said bonds, if any, the overall quality of   
the bonds remaining in a Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish. The Sponsor is
empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to dispose of bonds in the  
event of an advanced refunding.                                                 

 The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution for
any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except that the Sponsor   
may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take any other 
action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if (1) the issuer is 
in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written opinion of the       
Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the       
reasonably foreseeable future. Any bond so received in exchange or substitution 
will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the Trust    
Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder. Within   
five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for      
underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each        
Unitholder, identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor.
Except as stated herein and under "Trust Administration--Replacement Bonds" in  
the Prospectus Part II regarding the substitution of Replacement Bonds for      
Failed Bonds, the acquisition by a Trust of any bonds other than the bonds      
initially deposited is not permitted.                                           

   If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bond occurs and
no provision for payment is made therefor either pursuant to the portfolio      
insurance, or otherwise, within 30 days, the Trustee is required to notify the  
Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the Trustee to sell or to hold
such bonds within 30 days after notification by the Trustee to the Sponsor of   
such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted Bond and not 
be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred.

available by the Sponsor upon request.)                                         

  Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring
Van Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to  
report personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid    
potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct   
with respect to your Trust.                                                     

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust    
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as      
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

Trustee Information

   The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under the laws
of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal unit investment trust       
division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217,       
telephone (800) 221-7668. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision and    
examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the     
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured  
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.    

The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not 
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.  
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of  
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such       
records shall include the name and address of, and the certificates issued by   
the Trusts to, every Unitholder of the Trusts. Such books and records shall be  
open to inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual   
business hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from 
time to time be required under any applicable state or Federal statute, rule or 
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the bonds held in the Trusts.                   

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an  
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or      
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all          
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in  
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving 
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.
If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and has      
accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring Trustee
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a         
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and bonds of the original trustee shall 
vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes effective
only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or when a court 
of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any corporation into    
which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any      
corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which a Trustee shall 
be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee must be a banking       
corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state and      
having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not  
less than $5,000,000.                                                           

Taxation

The prospectus contains a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax   
issues concerning your Trust and the purchase, ownership and disposition of     
Trust Units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and is  
qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion. Prospective investors   
should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax            
consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of Trust Units, as well 
as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality, non-U.S. 
country, or other taxing jurisdiction.                                          

 The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part
on the advice of counsel to your Trust. The Internal Revenue Service could      
disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. In addition, our  
counsel was not asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect  
to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be held by your Trust. This
may not be sufficient for prospective investors to use for the purpose of       
avoiding penalties under federal tax law.                                       

 Your Trust intends (i) to elect and (ii) to qualify annually as a regulated
investment company under the Code and to comply with applicable distribution    
requirements so that it will not pay federal income tax on income and capital   
gains distributed to its Unitholders.                                           

To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally  
accorded to regulated investment companies, your Trust must, among other things,
(a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or  
other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or other income    
derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or  
currencies, and net income from certain publicly traded partnerships; (b)       
diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of the taxable year, 
(i) at least 50% of the market value of the Trust's assets is represented by    
cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government securities, the    
securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with   
such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of   
this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Trust's   
total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of   
such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is     
invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the        
securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or two or
more issuers which the Trust controls and are engaged in the same, similar or   
related trades or businesses, or the securities of certain publicly traded      
partnerships; and (c) distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable 
income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and net          
short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses but excludes 
net capital gain, if any) and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income
each taxable year.                                                              

 As a regulated investment company, your Trust generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that    
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends  
paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net   
short-term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to Unitholders. Your Trust
intends to distribute to its Unitholders, at least annually, substantially all  
of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain. If your Trust    
retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income, it will      
generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the    
amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely basis in      
accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a       
nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, your Trust distributes during    
each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its        
ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the   
calendar year, (2) at least 98% of its capital gains in excess of its capital   
losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending    
October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains  
for previous years that were not distributed during those years. To prevent     
application of the excise tax, your Trust intends to make its distributions in  
accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement. Further, if your    
Trust retains any net capital gain, the Trust may designate the retained amount 
as undistributed capital gains in a notice to Unitholders who, if subject to    
federal income tax on long-term capital gains (i) will be required to include in
income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their share  
of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit their         
proportionate share of the tax paid by the Trust against their federal income   
tax liabilities if any, and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds   
such liabilities. A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of the  
current calendar year if it is declared by your Trust in October, November or   
December with a record date in such a month and paid by your Trust during       
January of the following calendar year. These distributions will be taxable to  
Unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared, rather
than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.                 

 If your Trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Trust would
be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such income  
were distributed to its Unitholders) and all distributions out of earnings and  
profits would be taxed to Unitholders as ordinary dividend income.              

Termination of the Trust Agreement

  A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders representing
75% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding or by the Trustee when the value 
of the Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% of the   
original principal amount of bonds.                                             

A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient  
number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the Underwriters,   
including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would be reduced to   
less than 40% of the initial principal amount of the Trust. If a Trust is       
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the Underwriters, the   
Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by  
such purchaser.                                                                 

The Trust Agreement provides that a Trust shall terminate upon the        
redemption, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust, but in
no event shall it continue beyond the end of the year preceding the fiftieth    
anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of a Long-Term Trust and at the  
end of the calender year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its execution in 
the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust. In the event of termination of a Trust, 
written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to each Unitholder at his    
address appearing on the registration books of the Trust maintained by the      
Trustee, such notice specifying the time or times at which the Unitholder may   
surrender his certificate or certificates for cancellation. Within a reasonable 
time thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate any bonds then held in a Trust and  
shall deduct from the funds of the Trust any accrued costs, expenses or         
indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of
the Trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to   
provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other governmental charges. The  
sale of bonds in a Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than     
might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time. For    
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination 
may be less than the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the 
Units held by such Unitholder. The Trustee shall then distribute to each        
Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts. With
such distribution the Unitholders shall be furnished a final distribution       
statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the Trustee in its sole  
discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer       
necessary, it shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.

Description of Ratings

Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. A Standard &  
Poor's long-term debt obligation credit rating is a current opinion of the      
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This 
opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of 
guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.    

The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are not a recommendation to  
purchase, sell or hold the debt obligation, inasmuch as they do not comment as  
to market price or suitablility for a particular investor.                      

   The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based on current information
furnished by the obligor or obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it 
considers reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit in connection   
with any credit rating and may, on occasion, rely on unaudited financial        
information. Credit ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result  
of changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or based on other        
circumstances.                                                                  

 The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based, in varying degrees,
on the following considerations:                                                

     I.   Likelihood of payment--capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet
          its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms
of the obligation.                                          

II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.                      

  III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
          the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangement under the
  laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.

The credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As  
such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are   
typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in  
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has    
both senior and subordinate obligations, secured and unsecured obligations or   
operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of 
junior debt, the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.   

  AAA--An obligation rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by Standard &
Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the          
obligation is extremely strong.                                                 

  AA--An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations only
in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the 
obligation is very strong.                                                      

   A--An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of
changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in            
higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial  
commitment on the obligation is still strong.                                   

BBB--An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.   
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely  
to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment  
on the obligation.                                                              

Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC" and "C" are regarded as having   
significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the least degree of     
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

  Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major     
rating categories.                                                              

r--This symbol is attached to the ratings of instruments with significant 
non-credit risks. It highlights risks to principal or volatility of expected    
returns which are not addressed in the credit rating.                           

N.R.--This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is     
insufficient information on which to base a rating or that Standard & Poor's    
does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.                    

Moody's Investors Service. Municipal long-term rating scale. Moody's      
municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of issuers and issues  
in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate  
Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers
and issues. The default and loss content for Moody's municipal long-term rating 
scale differs from Moody's general long-term rating scale.                      

Municipal ratings are based upon the analysis of four primary factors     
relating to municipal finance: economy, debt, finances, and                     
administration/management strategies. Each of the factors is evaluated          
individually and for its effect on the other factors in the context of the      
municipality's ability to repay its debt.                                       

 Aaa--Issuers or issues rated Aaa demonstrate the strongest creditworthiness
relative to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.                 

Aa--Issuers or issues rated Aa demonstrate very strong creditworthiness   
relative to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.                 

  A--Issuers or issues rated A present above-average creditworthiness relative
to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.                          

  Baa--Issuers or issues rated Baa represent average creditworthiness relative
to other US municipal or tax- exempt issuers or issues.                         

Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," Ca" and "C" are regarded as having    
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of     
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating    
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or       
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the  
lower end of that generic rating category.                                      

General Long-term rating scale. Moody's long-term obligation ratings are  
opinions of the relative credit risk of fixed-income obligations with an        
original maturity of one year or more. They address the possibility that a      
financial obligation will not be honored as promised. Such ratings reflect both 
the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered in the event of       
default.                                                                        

Aaa--Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with  
minimal credit risk. Aa--Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality  
and are subject to very low credit risk. A--Obligations rated A are considered  
upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk. Baa--Obligations rated   
Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are considered medium-grade and as
such may possess certain speculative characteristics.                           

Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," Ca" and "C" are regarded as having    
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of     
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating    
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or       
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the  
lower end of that generic rating category.                                      

Estimated Cash Flows to Unitholders

The tables below set forth the per Unit estimated monthly and semi-annual 
distributions of interest and principal to Unitholders. The tables assume no    
changes in expenses, no changes in the current interest rates, no exchanges,    
redemptions, sales or prepayments of the underlying bonds prior to maturity or  
expected retirement date and the receipt of principal upon maturity or expected 
retirement date. To the extent the foregoing assumptions change actual          
distributions will vary.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0037)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. Certain trusts are unmanaged and their portfolios are not intended to change during the trusts' lives except in limited circumstances. Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




To the Unitholders of Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Series 740 (Central Equity
Trust, Diversified Income Series 30):

We have audited the accompanying statement of condition (including the
analysis of net assets and the related portfolio schedule) of Central Equity
Trust, Diversified Income Series 30 (the "Trust," included in Van Kampen Unit
Trusts, Series 740) as of February 28, 2009, and the related statements of
operations and changes in net assets for the period from March 5, 2008 (Initial
Date of Deposit) through February 28, 2009, and the financial highlights for the
period from March 5, 2008 (Initial Date of Deposit) through February 28, 2009.
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Trust
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned at February 28, 2009 by correspondence with The Bank of New
York Mellon, Trustee. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Central Equity Trust, Diversified Income Series 30 (included in Van Kampen Unit
Trusts, Series 740) as of February 28, 2009, and the results of its operations
and changes in net assets for the period from March 5, 2008 (Initial Date of
Deposit) through February 28, 2009, and the financial highlights for the period
from March 5, 2008 (Initial Date of Deposit) through February 28, 2009, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

VAN KAMPEN UNIT TRUSTS, SERIES 740





Notes to Financial Statements

February 28, 2009





NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


Security Valuation - The value of portfolio securities is based on the
securities' market prices when available. When a market price is not readily
available, including circumstances under which the Trustee determines that a
security's market price is not accurate, a portfolio security is valued at its
fair value, as determined under procedures established by the Trustee or an
independent pricing service used by the Trustee. In these cases, the Trust's net
asset value will reflect certain portfolio securities' fair values rather than
their market prices. With respect to securities that are primarily listed on
foreign exchanges, the value of such portfolio securities may change on days
when the U.S. markets are closed. The value of any foreign securities is based
on the applicable currency exchange rate as of the Evaluation Time, which is the
close of the New York Stock Exchange on each business day. The Sponsor will
provide price dissemination and oversight services to the Trust.


Security Cost - The cost of the Securities is determined based on the actual
price paid by the Trust on the various dates of deposit.


Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each
Unit based upon (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or monies in the process of
being collected, (2) the Securities in the Trust based on the value as described
in Note 1, and (3) accumulated dividends thereon, less accrued expenses of the
Trust, if any.


Federal Income Taxes - The Trust has elected and intends to qualify on a
continuous basis for special federal income tax treatment as a "regulated
investment company" under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"). If the Trust so qualifies and timely distributes to Unitholders 90% or
more of its taxable income (without regard to its net capital gain, i.e., the
excess of its net long-term capital gain over its net short-term capital loss),
it will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of its taxable
income (including any net capital gain) that it distributes to Unitholders.


The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") has issued Interpretation
No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109 ("FIN 48"), clarifying the appropriate method of accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial
statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, and providing related guidance. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a
material effect on the net asset value, financial condition or results of
operations of the Trust.


Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of
accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are
reported on an identified cost basis.



NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO


Fair Value Measurement - Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,
"Fair Value Measurements", establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
expands disclosure about fair value measurements in financial statements for the
Trust for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The various inputs
that may be used to determine the value of the Trust's investments are
summarized in the three levels presented below. The inputs or methodologies used
for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated
with investing those securities.


Level 1 - Quoted price in active markets for identical securities.


Level 2 - Prices determined using other significant observable inputs.
Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing
a security, which may include quoted prices for similar securities, interest
rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk.


Level 3 - Prices determined using significant unobservable inputs. In certain
situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable,
unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trust's own
assumptions about the factors market participants would use in pricing an
investment, and would be based on the best information available.

The following table summarizes your Trust's investments as of February 28,
2009 based on the inputs used to value them:

NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO (continued)


Unrealized appreciation and depreciation - An analysis of net unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) at February 28, 2009 is as follows:






Unrealized Appreciation                        $         40,075
Unrealized Depreciation                              (4,824,026)

"+" indicates that the security was issued by a foreign company.



NOTE 3 - OTHER


Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to
maintain a market for Units and to continuously offer to purchase Units at
prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the value of the Securities in
the Trust valued as described in Note 1. If the supply of Units exceeds demand,
or for other business reasons, the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at
such prices. In the event that a market is not maintained for the Units, a
Unitholder desiring to dispose of his Units may be able to do so only by
tendering such units to the Trustee for redemption at the redemption price.


Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on the
underlying value of the Securities per Unit on the date of an investor's
purchase, plus an amount equal to the maximum sales charge of 4.50% of the
public offering price which is equivalent to 4.712% of the aggregate underlying
value of the Securities. On each March 5, the secondary market sales charge will
decrease by .5 of 1% to a minimum sales charge of 2.30%.


Compensation of Sponsor and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for
providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust. The Sponsor receives an
annual fee for performing bookkeeping and administrative services for the Trust.
Both fees may be adjusted for increases under the category "All Services Less
Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index.



NOTE 4 - REDEMPTION OF UNITS


During the period from March 5, 2008 (Initial Date of Deposit) through
February 28, 2009, 107,793 Units were presented for redemption.

VAN KAMPEN

INVESTMENTS                     Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P.




THE TRUST





The Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a
Trust Indenture and Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the Initial
Date of Deposit, among Van Kampen Funds Inc., as Sponsor, Van Kampen Asset
Management, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee and, in
certain cases, as Evaluator, or their predecessors. Effective April 23, 2001,
American Portfolio Evaluation Services, a division of Van Kampen Investment
Advisory Corp., resigned as Evaluator and The Bank of New York Mellon was
appointed successor Evaluator.


The Trust offers the opportunity to purchase Units representing proportionate
interests in a portfolio of equity securities. The Trust may be an appropriate
medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of common stocks
with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually.


On the Initial Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited delivery statements
relating to contracts for the purchase of the Securities and an irrevocable
letter of credit in the amount required for these purchases with the Trustee. In
exchange for these contracts the Trustee delivered to the Sponsor documentation
evidencing the ownership of Units of the Trust. Unless otherwise terminated as
provided in the Trust Agreement, the Trust will terminate on the Mandatory
Termination Date and any remaining Securities will be liquidated or distributed
by the Trustee within a reasonable time. As used in this prospectus the term
"Securities" means the securities (including contracts to purchase these
securities) listed in the "Portfolio" in Part One and any additional securities
deposited into the Trust.


Additional Units may be issued at any time by depositing in the Trust (i)
additional Securities, (ii) contracts to purchase Securities together with cash
or irrevocable letters of credit or (iii) cash (or a letter of credit or the
equivalent) with instructions to purchase additional Securities. As additional
Units are issued by the Trust, the aggregate value of the Securities will be
increased and the fractional undivided interest represented by each Unit will be
decreased. The Sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into the Trust
following the Initial Date of Deposit, provided that the additional deposits
will be in amounts which will maintain, as nearly as practicable, the same
percentage relationship among the number of shares of each Security in the
Trust's portfolio as existed immediately prior to the subsequent deposit.
Investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in
their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the Securities
between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the Securities and because
the Trust will pay the associated brokerage or acquisition fees.


Each Unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the Trust. To
the extent that any Units are redeemed by the Trustee or additional Units are
issued as a result of additional Securities being deposited by the Sponsor, the
fractional undivided interest in the Trust represented by each unredeemed Unit
will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual interest in the Trust
will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender
to the Trustee by Unitholders, which may include the Sponsor, or until the
termination of the Trust Agreement.


The Trust consists of (a) the Securities (including contracts for the
purchase thereof) listed under the "Portfolio" in Part One as may continue to be
held from time to time in the Trust, (b) any additional Securities acquired and
held by the Trust pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement and (c) any
cash held in the related Income and Capital Accounts. Neither the Sponsor nor
the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the Securities.






OBJECTIVE AND SECURITIES SELECTION





The objective of the Trust is to provide capital appreciation and dividend
income. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of
stocks of companies which may include United States domestic electric utilities,
natural gas utilities, water utilities, telecommunications companies, real
estate investment trusts, technology companies, health care companies, consumer
products companies, consumer cyclicals companies, consumer staples companies,
energy companies, industrials companies or financial services companies. The
portfolio consists of securities selected by research analysts at Edward D.
Jones & Co., L.P. (the "Underwriter") and approved by the Sponsor. In selecting
the Securities, the following factors, among others, were considered: dividend
yield, geographic diversification, earnings growth rates, regulatory climate and
stock valuation. At the time the Securities were selected, the Underwriter's
research analysts were currently covering all the issuers of the Securities and
had published favorable recommendations for each of them. There can be no
assurance that such coverage will continue for any issuer during the life of the
Trust or that the report on any such issuer will continue to be favorable. A
downgrade in an analyst's recommendation for an issuer, or the termination of
such coverage, could negatively affect the performance of the Trust.


You should note that the selection criteria were applied to the Securities
for inclusion in the Trust as of the Initial Date of Deposit. After this date,
the Securities may no longer meet the selection criteria. Should a Security no
longer meet the selection criteria, we will generally not remove the Security
from the portfolio. In offering the Units to the public, neither the Sponsor nor
any broker-dealers are recommending any of the individual Securities but rather
the entire pool of Securities, taken as a whole, which are represented by the
Units.


Financial Services. The Trust may invest significantly in financial services
companies. As a large and integral part of the economy, financial services are
like the oil that lubricates the economic engine. Nearly all consumers and
businesses are customers of financial companies that provide services like
savings and investment products, loans, transaction and payment processing, and
insurance products that help protect against death and disaster. Secular drivers
affecting financial-services business and profits include demographic trends and
retirement needs, industry consolidation, technological advancements, and
globalization of economies and markets. Economic and interest-rate cycles
continuously affect the shorter-term prospects for financial businesses.
Financial companies generally exist in the banking, consumer finance, insurance,
investment management and securities industries.


Health Care. The Trust may invest significantly in health care companies.
These issuers include companies involved in advanced medical devices and
instruments, drugs and biotec hnology, managed care, hospital management/health
services and medical supplies. An aging population, new drug development and
product innovation should drive growth for this industry. Additionally, foreign
demand for health care, particularly from developing nations, continues to
increase. The industry has historically grown at a rate faster than the overall
economy and that trend should continue. Research and development spending,
supported by strong demand, should lead to new products. Health care companies
have traditionally paid part of earnings as dividends, which is expected to
continue. Given the growth prospects for the industry, dividend growth should be
meaningful as well.


Industrials. The industrials industry includes capital goods, commercial
services and transportation companies. Generally, growth prospects for the
industry are tied to economic factors such as consumer, business and government
spending, U.S. Gross Domestic Product and exports to foreign nations. The
increasingly global economy should increase the demand for industrial products
made by U.S. firms. Within capital goods, defense and electronics are some of
the fastest growing areas, given the political support for higher government
spending on defense initiatives. Many industrials companies are well-established
and have demonstrated a track record of paying dividends and increasing the
amount of dividends paid over time.


Consumer Cyclicals. The Trust may invest in companies that manufacture or
sell products or services, the demand for which is easily influenced by general
economic conditions. Industries within this segment include advertising, auto
parts, auto manufacturing, broadcasting, casinos, clothing and fabrics, consumer
electronics, entertainment, footwear, furnishings and appliances, home
construction, lodging, publishing, recreational products and services,
restaurants, apparel retailers, broadline retailers, drug-based retailers,
specialty retailers, tires and toys. These companies would be expected to
perform well during an improving economy but may lag during a declining economy.
Industries within this group that may hold potential for above-average growth
include niche retailing, entertainment and media. Many companies within this
sector are becoming more dividends-focused, and may increase their dividends
going forward.


Consumer Staples. Consumer staples is a relatively mature industry, with
growth in line with population growth. Recent waves of consolidation in the
industry have reduced the number of competitors, which has enabled product price
increases in some sectors. Additionally, product innovation has proven key to
growth and should lead to above-industry growth rates for successful companies.
The industry is characterized primarily by stable, high-profit margin companies,
several of which pay attractive dividends.


Utilities. Compared to the traditional government mandated monopolies, many
states have pursued utility deregulation, which provides both opportunities and
risk. While this could provide incremental growth for some, it may also increase
the level of competition for others. As a whole, the fundamentals of the utility
sector has improved as those companies that strayed in recent years into
unrelated businesses have generally refocused on their core business of
providing regulated electricity, natural gas and water service to their
customers. This "return to basics" strategy has helped increase cash flow,
strengthen balance sheets and solidify credit quality for many companies. It has
also allowed many utilities to continue their long track records of paying
dividends while providing increases in the dividend on a frequent and consistent
basis.


Energy. As the world economy grows, energy use is also expected to rise. The
companies that produce oil and natural gas are finding and developing new
sources worldwide to satisfy this growing need. Oil companies also refine crude
oil into useful products such as gasoline and jet fuel, as well as provide the
raw materials for a wide variety of plastics. Investors should benefit from the
diversity of their businesses, their global reach, and their ability to find
attractive opportunities in the changing energy marketplace.


Technology. The Trust may invest in technology companies. Technology
companies generally include companies involved in the development, design,
manufacture and sale of computers, computer related equipment, computer
networks, communications systems, telecommunications products, electronic
products, and other related products, systems and services. Technology is a
cyclical industry, driven by corporate and consumer spending on technology
products, services and software. New technologies have the potential to increase
productivity and enable new applications. Stable spending on traditional
technology platforms such as personal computers, plus spending on new
technologies, should enable the industry to grow faster than the economy.
Several technology companies are generating substantial excess cash, which they
have used to begin paying dividends. These companies have the potential to
increase their dividends on a regular basis.


Real Estate Investment Trusts. A real estate investment trust, or REIT, is a
company that buys, develops, finances and/or manages income-producing real
estate such as apartments, shopping centers, offices and warehouses. A REIT can
be a good way to invest in commercial real estate. Compared to traditional
direct investments in real estate, which may be difficult to sell and value,
REITs are traded on major stock exchanges, making them relatively liquid. REIT
investors can also gain the advantage of skilled management since REIT
management teams tend to be experts within their specific property or geographic
niches. Many believe that the attractive features of property ownership and
stock ownership are combined in this investment vehicle. REITs can provide
investors with current income, as they are currently required to distribute 90%
of taxable income annually, and can have the potential for attractive returns.
They have historically had low relative volatility and may provide inflation
protection.


Telecommunications. The emergence of a global, networked economy appears to
be changing the face of the telecommunications industry. Telecommunications
companies provide local, long distance and wireless telephone, as well as
television and internet services and information systems, manufacture
telecommunications products, and operate voice, data and telecommunications
networks. Innovations, such as wireless and Internet applications, are
experiencing rapid demand. While the industry is characterized by intense
rivalry, heavy regulation and overcapacity in some markets, telecommunications
companies may be well-positioned to deliver these new technologies to consumers
and businesses.


Underwriter Activities. The Underwriter may recommend or effect transactions
in the Securities in its day to day brokerage activities. This may have an
adverse effect on the prices of the Securities. This also may have an impact on
the price the Trust pays for the Securities and the price received upon Unit
redemptions or Trust termination.


The Underwriter, in its day to day activities, may act as a broker, agent,
principal or market maker in connection with the purchase and sale of equity
securities, including the Securities. The Underwriter may also provide
investment banking services to the issuers of, or issue reports and make
recommendations on, the Securities. For any of these brokerage, market-making or
investment banking activities, the Underwriter may receive additional
compensation. The Underwriter may also receive compensation based on commissions
generated by sales of Units in addition to its concession or agency commission.
See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation".






RISK FACTORS





All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of your Units. You should understand these risks before you
invest. If the value of the Securities falls, the value of your Units will also
fall. We cannot guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that
your investment return will be positive over any period.


Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your
Trust will fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below
your original purchase price. Market value fluctuates in response to various
factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial
condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or ratings on a
security of the issuer. Even though your Trust is supervised, you should
remember that we do not manage your Trust. Your Trust will not sell a security
solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund.


Dividend Payment Risk. Dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a
security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security. Stocks represent
ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers.
Common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has
provided for payment of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when
declared by an issuer's board of directors, and the amount of any dividend may
vary over time. If dividends received by the Portfolio are insufficient to cover
expenses, redemptions or other Portfolio costs, it may be necessary for the
Portfolio to sell Securities to cover such expenses, redemptions or other costs.
Any such sales may result in capital gains or losses to you. See "Taxation."


Financial Services Issuers. The Trust invests significantly in banks,
insurance companies and other financial services companies. Banks and their
holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic
recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations in geographic
markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and competition
from new entrants in their fields of business. In addition, banks and their
holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and state level
and may be adversely affected by increased regulation.


The effects of the global financial crisis that began to unfold in 2007
continue to manifest in nearly all the sub-divisions of the financial services
industry. Financial losses and write downs among investment banks and similar
institutions reached significant levels in 2008. The impact of these losses
among traditional banks, investment banks, broker/dealers and insurers has
forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation or
combination, while drastically increasing the credit risk, and possibility of
default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles. Many of
the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance
their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital. In
some cases, U.S. and foreign governments have acted to bail out or provide
support to select institutions, however the risk of default by such issuers has
nonetheless increased substantially.


While the U.S. and foreign governments, and their respective government
agencies, have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with
financial institutions, there can be no assurance that the risks associated with
investment in financial services company issuers will decrease as a result of
these steps.


Banks face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as
regulatory changes, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act financial services
overhaul legislation, permit new entrants to offer various financial products.
Technological advances such as the Internet allow these nontraditional lending
sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data.
Banks continue to face tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage firms
and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services
that were traditionally offered by banks. Bank profitability is largely
dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds, and can fluctuate
significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition.


Companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the
volatility of the equity market in general. Adverse changes in the direction of
the stock market, investor confidence, the financial health of customers, equity
transaction volume, the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of
emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the
stock prices, of these companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including
increased competition with new and existing competitors, the ongoing
commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital
expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of
companies in the investment management and brokerage industries. Companies
involved in investment management and brokerage activities are also subject to
extensive regulation by government agencies and self-regulatory organizations,
and changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in the interpretation of such
laws, regulations and rules, could adversely affect the stock prices of such
companies.


Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,
including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium rate caps, a
misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings, competition and
pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other natural or man-made
disasters and the effects of client mergers. Already extensively regulated,
insurance companies' profits may be adversely affected by increased government
regulation or tax law changes.


Utility Companies. Many utility companies, especially electric and gas and
other energy related utility companies, are subject to various uncertainties,
including:


o    risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs;


o    restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result
of environmental, nuclear safety and other regulations;


o    regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale
costs along to the retail and business customer;


o    coping with the general effects of energy conservation;


o    technological innovations which may render existing plants, equipment
or products obsolete;


o    the effects of unusual, unexpected or normal local weather, maturing
markets and difficulty in expanding to new markets due to regulatory
and other factors;


o    the potential impact of natural or man-made disasters;


o    difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital, even if
frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions;


o    the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation;


o    difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and
equity securities; and


o    increased competition.


Any of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could affect the
supply of or demand for energy, such as electricity or natural gas, or water, or
the ability of the issuers to pay for such energy or water which could adversely
affect the profitability of the issuers of the Securities and the performance of
the Trust.


Utility companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal and
state levels in the United States. At the federal level, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (the "FERC"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"),
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (the "NRC") have authority to oversee electric and combination
electric and gas utilities. The value of utility company stocks may decline
because governmental regulation affecting the utilities industry can change.
This regulation may prevent or delay the utility company from passing along cost
increases to its customers, which could hinder the utility company's ability to
meet its obligations to its suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures,
including the acceleration of obligations or the institution of involuntary
bankruptcy proceedings, by its creditors against such utility company.
Furthermore, regulatory authorities, which may be subject to political and other
pressures, may not grant future rate increases, or may impose accounting or
operational policies, any of which could adversely affect a company's
profitability and its stock price. Certain utility companies have experienced
full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are
frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to
greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside
of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business.
These opportunities may permit certain utility companies to earn more than their
traditional regulated rates of return. Some companies, however, may be forced to
defend their core business and may be less profitable. Mergers in the utility
industry may require approval from several federal and state regulatory
agencies, including FERC, the FTC, and the SEC. These regulatory authorities
could, as a matter of policy, reverse the trend toward deregulation and make
consolidation more difficult, or cause delay in the merger process, any of which
could cause the prices of these stocks to fall.


Real Estate Investment Trusts. Many factors can have an adverse impact on the
performance of a particular REIT, including its cash available for distribution,
the credit quality of a particular REIT or the real estate industry generally.
The success of REITs depends on various factors, including the quality of
property management, occupancy and rent levels, appreciation of the underlying
property and the ability to raise rents on those properties. Economic recession,
overbuilding, tax law changes, environmental issues, higher interest rates or
excessive speculation can all negatively impact REITs and their future earnings
and share prices.


Risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate include, among
other factors,


o    general U.S. and global as well as local economic conditions;


o    decline in real estate values;


o    possible lack of availability of mortgage funds;


o    the financial health of tenants;


o    overbuilding and increased competition for tenants;


o    oversupply of properties for sale;


o    changing demographics;


o    changes in interest rates, tax rates and other operating expenses;


o    changes in government regulations;


o    changes in zoning laws;


o    the ability of the owner to provide adequate management, maintenance
and insurance;


o    faulty construction and the ongoing need for capital improvements;


o    the cost of complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act;


o    regulatory and judicial requirements, including relating to liability
for environmental hazards;


o    natural or man-made disasters;


o    changes in the perception of prospective tenants of the safety,
convenience and attractiveness of the properties;


o    the ongoing financial strength and viability of government sponsored
enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac;


o    changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand; and


o    the unavailability of construction financing or mortgage loans at
rates acceptable to developers.


Variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in terms
of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate generally and
REITs in particular. Properties owned by a REIT may not be adequately insured
against certain losses and may be subject to significant environmental
liabilities, including remediation costs.


You should also be aware that REITs may not be diversified and are subject to
the risks of financing projects. The real estate industry may be cyclical, and,
if the Trust acquires REIT Securities at or near the top of the cycle, there is
increased risk of a decline in value of the REIT Securities and therefore the
value of the Units. REITs are also subject to defaults by borrowers and the
market's perception of the REIT industry generally.


Because of their structure, and the legal requirement that they distribute at
least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders annually, REITs require
frequent amounts of new funding, through both borrowing money and issuing stock.
Thus, REITs historically have frequently issued substantial amounts of new
equity shares (or equivalents) to purchase or build new properties. This may
have adversely affected REIT equity share market prices. Both existing and new
share issuances may have an adverse effect on these prices in the future,
especially when REITs continue to issue stock when real estate prices are
relatively high and stock prices are relatively low.


Consumer Staples. The Trust may invest significantly in companies that
manufacture or sell various consumer staples. General risks of these companies
include the general state of the economy, intense competition and consumer
spending trends. A decline in the economy or other change (such as rising food
and fuel costs) which results in a reduction of consumers' disposable income can
negatively impact spending habits. Furthermore, the failure to continue
developing new products, lack of or reduced market acceptance of new and
existing products, increased raw materials costs, an inability to raise prices,
increased or changed regulation and product liability claims or product recalls
could also adversely impact the performance and stock prices of the issuers of
Securities in this industry group.


Industrials. The Trust may invest significantly in industrials companies.
General risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy,
intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international politics, excess
capacity and consumer spending trends. Capital goods companies may also be
significantly affected by overall capital spending levels, economic cycles,
technical obsolescence, delays in modernization, limitations on supply of key
materials, labor relations, government regulations, government contracts and
e-commerce initiatives. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry
have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led
to the overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the
industry may face similar scrutiny.


Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or
retain government contracts, or changes in government budget priorities, changes
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall
construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment
manufacturers.


Health Care Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in health care
companies. These issuers include companies involved in advanced medical devices
and instruments, drugs and biotec hnology, managed care, hospital
management/health services and medical supplies. These companies face
substantial government regulation and approval procedures. Congress and the
President have proposed, and in some cases approved, a variety of legislative
changes concerning health care issuers from time to time, including, but not
limited to, cost and prescription drug price controls and more rigorous approval
processes for new pharmaceuticals and devices. Additional government regulation,
or any change in existing regulation, including reductions in government
funding, can have a significantly unfavorable effect on the price and
availability of products and services.


Drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing
competition from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of
patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a
product will never come to market. The research and development costs of
bringing a new drug or medical product to market are substantial. This process
involves lengthy government review with no guarantee of approval. These
companies may have losses and may not offer proposed products for several years,
if at all. The failure to gain approval for a new drug or product can have a
substantial negative impact on a company and its stock.


The goods and services of health care issuers are also subject to risks of
product liability litigation. Health care facility operators face risks related
to demand for services, the ability of the facility to provide required
services, confidence in the facility, management capabilities, competition,
efforts by insurers and government agencies to limit rates, expenses, the cost
and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance, and termination or
restriction of government financial assistance (such as Medicare, Medicaid or
similar programs).


Energy Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in energy companies.
Energy companies are subject to legislative or regulatory changes, adverse
market conditions and/or increased competition affecting the energy sector. The
prices of the securities of energy companies may fluctuate widely due to changes
in value and dividend yield, which depend largely on the price and supply of
energy fuels, international political events relating to oil producing
countries, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects, and tax and
other governmental regulatory policies.


Energy companies depend on their ability to find and acquire additional
energy reserves. The exploration and recovery process involves significant
operating hazards and can be very costly. An energy company has no assurance
that it will find reserves or that any reserves found will be economically
recoverable. The industry also faces substantial government regulation,
including environmental regulation. These regulations have increased costs and
limited production and usage of certain fuels. Furthermore, certain companies
involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting
irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial
results, and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny.


In addition, energy companies face risks related to political conditions in
oil producing regions (such as the Middle East), the actions of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the price and worldwide supply of oil
and natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels, operating
hazards, government regulation and the level of consumer demand. Political
conditions of some oil producing regions have been unstable in the past.
Political instability or war in these regions could have a negative impact on
your investment. Oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile. OPEC
controls a substantial portion of world oil production. OPEC may take actions to
increase or suppress the price or availability of oil. Various domestic and
foreign government authorities and international cartels also impact these
prices. Any substantial decline in these prices could have an adverse effect on
energy companies.


Technology Companies. Technology companies face risks related to rapidly
changing technology, rapid product obsolescence, cyclical market patterns,
evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. An
unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on a
technology company. The failure of a technology company to introduce new
products or technologies or keep pace with rapidly changing technology, can have
a negative impact on the company's results. Technology stocks tend to experience
substantial price volatility and speculative trading. Announcements about new
products, technologies, operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock
prices to fluctuate dramatically. At times, however, extreme price and volume
fluctuations may occur in the Securities of companies in this industry group
that are unrelated to the operating performance of the company.


The market for certain products may have only recently begun to develop, is
rapidly evolving or is characterized by an increase in suppliers. Key components
of some technology products are available only from limited sources. This can
impact the cost of and ability to acquire these components. Some technology
companies service highly concentrated customer bases of only a limited number of
large companies. Any failure to meet the standards of these customers could
result in a significant loss or reduction in sales. Many products and
technologies are incorporated into other products. As a result, some companies
are sometimes highly dependent on the performance of other technology companies.
We cannot guarantee that these customers will continue to place additional
orders or will place orders in similar quantities as in the past.


The life cycle of a new technology product or service tends to be short,
resulting in volatile sales, earnings and stock prices for many technology
companies. Additionally, with the rapid evolution of technologies, competitive
advantages tend to be short lived and product pricing usually falls.
Historically, many of the benefits from new technologies have gone to the
consumer, as their creators have been unable to retain differentiation or
pricing power. Some of the large technology companies have been involved in
antitrust litigation and may continue to be in the future. A slowdown in
corporate or consumer spending on technology will likely hurt technology company
revenues. Technology companies rely on international sales for a meaningful part
of their revenues. Any economic slowdown could hurt revenues.


Consumer Cyclicals. The success of companies in the consumer cyclicals sector
depends heavily on consumer spending and disposable household income and is
subject to severe competition. Therefore, the success of consumer cyclicals
companies is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international
economy, interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. A slowdown in the
economy would likely hurt the consumer cyclicals industry. The success of
companies in the consumer cyclicals segment is also strongly affected by changes
in demographics and consumer tastes.


Consumer Products. The Trust may invest significantly in companies that
manufacture or sell various consumer products. General risks of these companies
include the general state of the economy, intense competition and consumer
spending trends. A decline in the economy which results in a reduction of
consumers' disposable income can negatively impact spending habits. Furthermore,
the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or reduced market
acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials costs, an
inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product liability
claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance and stock
prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.


Telecommunications Companies. The Trust may invest significantly in
telecommunications companies. These companies are subject to substantial
governmental regulation. For example, the United States government and state
governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a
company may offer. The products and services of telecommunications companies may
become outdated very rapidly. A company's performance can be hurt if the company
fails to keep pace with technological advances. These factors could affect the
value of Units. Certain types of companies represented in a portfolio are
engaged in fierce competition for a share of the market of their products and
may have higher costs, including liabilities associated with the medical,
pension and postretirement expenses of their workforce, than their competitors.
As a result, competitive pressures are intense and the stocks are subject to
rapid price volatility.


Several high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies in
the past have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of the
telecommunications industry. High debt loads that were accumulated during the
industry growth spurt of the 1990s caught up to the industry, causing debt and
stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies
and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment. At the same
time, demand for some telecommunications services remains weak, as several key
markets are oversaturated and many customers can choose between several service
providers and technology platforms. To meet increasing competition, companies
may have to commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new
products and services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have
been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing,
consolidating and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling
product lines. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry
may face similar scrutiny. Moreover, some companies have begun the process of
emerging from bankruptcy and may have reduced levels of debt and other
competitive advantages over other telecommunications companies. Due to these and
other factors, the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications
companies has increased substantially and may continue to rise.


Federal legislation governing the United States telecommunications industry
may become subject to judicial review and additional interpretation, which may
adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by the Trust. Moreover,
continued consolidation in this industry could create integration expenses and
delay, and consequent management diversion of attention away from ongoing
operations and related risks, among other factors, could result in the failure
of these companies to realize expected cost savings or synergies.


Legislation/Litigation. From time to time, various legislative initiatives
are proposed in the United States and abroad which may have a negative impact on
certain of the issuers whose Securities are held by the Trust. In addition,
litigation regarding any of these issuers or of the industries represented by
these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of their Securities, or on
the tax treatment of your Trust or of your investment in the Trust. No one can
predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation will have on the share
prices of the Securities, which may adversely affect the value of your Units.


No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in the Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.



PUBLIC OFFERING





General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price which includes the
underlying value of the Securities, the sales charge, and cash, if any, in the
Income and Capital Accounts. The maximum sales charge assessed to each
Unitholder is set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in
Part One. The secondary market sales charge will reduce annually by 0.5% to a
minimum of 2.30% as set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information"
in Part One. The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ
slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the
calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased.


Reducing Your Sales Charge. The Sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to
reduce the sales charge that you pay. It is your financial professional's
responsibility to alert the Sponsor of any discount when you purchase Units.
Before you purchase Units you must also inform your financial professional of
your qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible
for a reduced sales charge. You may not combine discounts.


Employees. Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses and
children under 21 living in the same household, and trustees, custodians or
fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its
affiliates, and dealers and their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public
Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession. All employee discounts set
forth under are subject to the policies of the related selling firm. Only
employees, officers and directors of companies that allow their employees to
participate in this employee discount program are eligible for the discounts.


The minimum purchase is 200 Units but may vary by selling firm.


Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part One
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying Securities in
the Trust. The initial price of the Securities was determined by the Trustee.
The Trustee will generally determine the value of the Securities as of the
Evaluation Time on each business day and will adjust the Public Offering Price
of Units accordingly. The Evaluation Time is the close of the New York Stock
Exchange on each business day. The term "business day", as used herein and under
"Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units", excludes Saturdays, Sundays and
holidays observed by the New York Stock Exchange. The Public Offering Price per
Unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the Evaluation Time on
each business day. Orders received by the Sponsor prior to the Evaluation Time
and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the
Evaluation Time that are properly transmitted to the Sponsor by the time
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of receipt. Orders
received by the Sponsor after the Evaluation Time, and orders received by
authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or orders received
by such persons that are not transmitted to the Sponsor until after the time
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of the next determined
Public Offering Price per Unit provided they are received timely by the Sponsor
on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to
transmit orders received by them to the Sponsor so they will be received in a
timely manner.


The value of portfolio securities is based on the securities' market price
when available. When a market price is not readily available, including
circumstances under which the Trustee determines that a security's market price
is not accurate, a portfolio security is valued at its fair value, as determined
under procedures established by the Trustee or an independent pricing service
used by the Trustee. In these cases, the Trust's net asset value will reflect
certain portfolio securities' fair value rather than their market price. With
respect to securities that are primarily listed on foreign exchanges, the value
of the portfolio securities may change on days when you will not be able to
purchase or sell Units. The value of any foreign securities is based on the
applicable currency exchange rate as of the Evaluation Time. The Sponsor will
provide price dissemination and oversight services to the Trust.


Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by the Sponsor and
the Underwriter at the Public Offering Price.


The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. The
Underwriter will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with
the distribution of Units as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter
Compensation".


Except as provided in this section, any discount provided to investors will
be borne by the selling dealer or agent as indicated under "General" above.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no case shall the total of
any concessions, agency commissions and any additional compensation allowed or
paid to any broker, dealer or other distributor of Units with respect to any
individual transaction exceed the total sales charge applicable to such
transaction. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any
order for the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or
agency commission to dealers and others from time to time.


The Sponsor may provide, at its own expense and out of its own profits,
additional compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of the
Trusts and the Sponsor's other products. This compensation is intended to result
in additional sales of the Sponsor's products and/or compensate broker-dealers
and financial advisors for past sales. The Sponsor may make these payments for
marketing, promotional or related expenses, including, but not limited to,
expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisors, advertising,
sponsorship of events or seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms
and similar activities designed to promote the sale of the Trust and the
Sponsor's other products. Fees may include payment for travel expenses,
including lodging, incurred in connection with trips taken by invited registered
representatives for meetings or seminars of a business nature. These
arrangements will not change the price you pay for your Units.


Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation. The Sponsor will receive a gross sales
commission equal to the total sales charge applicable to each transaction. The
Underwriter will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with
the distribution of Units equal to 65% of the sales charge applicable to the
transaction. Any sales charge discount provided to investors will be borne by
the selling dealer or agent. In addition, the Sponsor will realize a profit or
loss as a result of the difference between the price paid for the Securities by
the Sponsor and the cost of the Securities to the Trust on the Initial Date of
Deposit as well as on subsequent deposits. The Sponsor has not participated as
sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicate or
as an agent in a private placement for any of the Securities. The Underwriter
may benefit from, or receive compensation in connection with, activities
described under "Objectives and Securities Selection". The Sponsor may realize
profit or loss as a result of the possible fluctuations in the market value of
the Securities, since all proceeds received from purchasers of Units are
retained by the Underwriter. In maintaining a secondary market, the Underwriter
will realize profits or losses in the amount of any difference between the price
at which Units are purchased and the price at which Units are resold (which
price includes the applicable sales charge) or from a redemption of repurchased
Units at a price above or below the purchase price. Cash, if any, made available
to the Sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be
used in the Sponsor's business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor,
subject to the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


The Sponsor, the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may have
participated in a public offering of one or more of the Securities. The Sponsor,
the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them or their employees may have a
long or short position in these Securities or related securities. The Sponsor,
the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may act as a specialist or
market maker for these Securities. An officer, director or employee of the
Sponsor, the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may be an officer or
director for issuers of the Securities.


Purchases and sales of Securities by the Trust may impact the value of the
Securities. This may especially be the case during the initial offering of
Units, upon Trust termination and in the course of satisfying large Unit
redemptions. Any publication of a list of Securities, or a list of anticipated
Securities, to be included in the Trust may also cause increased buying activity
in certain Securities. Once this information becomes public, investors may
purchase individual Securities appearing in such a publication and may do so
during or prior to the initial offering of Units. It is possible that these
investors could include investment advisory and brokerage firms of the Sponsor,
the Underwriter or the affiliates of either of them or firms that are
distributing Units. This activity may cause the Trust to purchase stocks at a
higher price than those buyers who effect purchases prior to purchases by the
Trust.


Market for Units. Although it is not obligated to do so, the Underwriter may
maintain a market for Units and purchase Units at the secondary market
repurchase price, which is described under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of
Units". The Underwriter may discontinue purchases of Units or discontinue
purchases at this price at any time. In the event that a secondary market is not
maintained, a Unitholder will be able to dispose of Units by tendering them to
the Trustee for redemption at the Redemption Price. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Redemption of Units". Unitholders should contact their broker to
determine the best price for Units in the secondary market. The Trustee will
notify the Underwriter of any Units tendered for redemption. If the
Underwriter's bid in the secondary market equals or exceeds the Redemption Price
per Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which Units would
have been redeemed by the Trustee. The Underwriter may sell repurchased Units at
the secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit.



RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS





Units are available for purchase in connection with certain types of
tax-sheltered retirement plans, including Individual Retirement Accounts for
individuals, Simplified Employee Pension Plans for employees, qualified plans
for self-employed individuals, and qualified corporate pension and profit
sharing plans for employees. The purchase of Units may be limited by the plans'
provisions and does not itself establish such plans.



RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS





Distributions. With respect to a Trust structured as a regulated investment
company, dividends and interest, pro rated on an annual basis and net of
expenses, and any net proceeds from the sale of Securities received by your
Trust will generally be distributed to Unitholders on each Distribution Date to
Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date. With respect to a Trust
structured as a grantor trust, the Trustee will generally distribute the cash
held in the Income and Capital Accounts of your Trust, net of expenses, on each
Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date,
provided that the total cash held for distribution equals at least 0.1% of your
Trust's net asset value. These dates are listed under "Essential Information" in
Part One. In addition, a Trust taxed as a regulated investment company will
generally make required distributions at the end of each year because it is
structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax purposes.
Unitholders will also receive a final distribution of income when a Trust
terminates. A person becomes a Unitholder of record on the date of settlement
(generally three business days after Units are ordered).


Dividends received by the Trust are credited to the Income Account of the
Trust. Other receipts (e.g., capital gains, proceeds from the sale of
Securities, etc.) are credited to the Capital Account. Proceeds received on the
sale of any Securities, to the extent not used to meet redemptions of Units or
to pay fees or expenses, will be distributed to Unitholders. Proceeds received
from the disposition of any Securities after a Record Date and prior to the
following Distribution Date will be held in the Capital Account and not
distributed until the next Distribution Date. Any distribution to Unitholders
consists of each Unitholder's pro rata share of the available cash in the Income
and Capital Accounts as of the related Record Date.


The income distribution to the Unitholders as of each Record Date will be
made on the following Distribution Date or shortly thereafter and shall consist
of an amount substantially equal to such portion of each Unitholder's pro rata
share of the estimated net annual income distributions in the Income Account.
Because income payments are not received by the Trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, such distributions to Unitholders may be more or less than
the amount credited to the Income Account as of the Record Date. For the purpose
of minimizing fluctuation in the distributions from the Income Account, the
Trustee is authorized to advance such amounts as may be necessary to provide
income distributions of approximately equal amounts. The Trustee shall be
reimbursed, without interest, for any such advances from funds in the Income
Account on the ensuing Record Date.


Reinvestment Option. Unitholders may have distributions automatically
reinvested in additional Units under the Automatic Reinvestment Option (to the
extent Units may be lawfully offered for sale in the state in which the
Unitholder resides). To participate in this reinvestment option, a Unitholder
must file with the Trustee a written notice of election, together with any
certificate representing Units and other documentation that the Trustee may then
require, at least five days prior to the related Record Date. A Unitholder's
election will apply to all Units owned by the Unitholder and will remain in
effect until changed by the Unitholder. The reinvestment option is not offered
during the 30 days prior to termination. If Units are unavailable for
reinvestment or this reinvestment option is no longer available, distributions
will be paid in cash. Distributions will be taxable to Unitholders whether paid
in cash or reinvested in additional Units. See "Taxation."


A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive
future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing no later than
five days before a Distribution Date. The Sponsor shall have the right to
suspend or terminate the reinvestment plan at any time. The reinvestment plan is
subject to availability or limitation by each broker-dealer or selling firm.
Broker-dealers may suspend or terminate the offering of a reinvestment plan at
any time. Please contact your financial professional for additional information.


Redemption of Units. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by
tender to the Trustee at Unit Investment Trust Division, 111 Sanders Creek
Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057. Certificates must be tendered to the
Trustee, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer with
signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity in connection with
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of applicable
governmental charges, if any. No later than the seventh day following the
tender, the Unitholder will be entitled to receive in cash an amount for each
Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed on the date of tender.
The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received by the
Trustee, except that with respect to Units received by the Trustee after the
Evaluation Time or on a day which is not a Trust business day, the date of
tender is deemed to be the next business day. Redemption requests received by
authorized financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that are
properly transmitted to the Trustee by the time designated by the Trustee, are
priced based on the date of receipt. Redemption requests received by the Trustee
after the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by authorized
financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption requests
received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until after the
time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the next
determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the Trustee on
such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to
transmit redemption requests received by them to the Trustee so they will be
received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge
an order handling fee for processing redemption requests. Units redeemed
directly through the Trustee are not subject to such fees.


Unitholders tendering 2,500 or more Units (or $25,000) of the Trust for
redemption may request an in kind distribution of Securities equal to the
Redemption Price per Unit on the date of tender. Unitholders may not request an
in kind distribution within thirty days of the Trust's termination. An in kind
distribution will be made by the Trustee through the distribution of each of the
Securities in book-entry form to the account of the Unitholder's broker-dealer
at Depository Trust Company. Amounts representing fractional shares will be
distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the number of shares of any Security
included in a Unitholder's in kind distribution to facilitate the distribution
of whole shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Unitholder requesting an
in kind distribution is the Sponsor or an affiliated person of the Portfolio,
the Trustee may make an in kind distribution to such Unitholder provided that no
one with a pecuniary incentive to influence the in kind distribution may
influence selection of the distributed securities, the distribution must consist
of a pro rata distribution of all portfolio securities (with limited exceptions)
and the in kind distribution may not favor such affiliated person to the
detriment of any other Unitholder.


The Trustee may sell Securities to satisfy Unit redemptions. To the extent
that Securities are redeemed in kind or sold, the size of the Trust will be, and
the diversity of the Trust may be, reduced. Sales may be required at a time when
Securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than might
otherwise be realized. The price received upon redemption may be more or less
than the amount paid by the Unitholder, depending on the value of the Securities
at the time of redemption. Special federal income tax consequences will result
if a Unitholder requests an in kind distribution. See "Taxation".


The Redemption Price per Unit and the secondary market repurchase price per
Unit are equal to the pro rata share of each Unit in the Trust, determined on
the basis of (i) the cash on hand in the Trust, (ii) the value of the Securities
in the Trust and (iii) dividends receivable on the Securities in the Trust
trading ex-dividend as of the date of computation, less (a) amounts representing
taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the Trust and (b) the accrued
expenses of the Trust. For these purposes, the Evaluator or Trustee will
determine the value of the Securities in the manner set forth under "Public
Offering--Unit Price".


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for customary
weekend and holiday closings, or any period during which the SEC determines that
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of
which disposal or evaluation of the Securities is not reasonably practicable, or
for other periods as the SEC may permit.


Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form unless a Unitholder
makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in certificate form.
Units are transferable by making a written request to the Trustee and, in the
case of Units in certificate form, by presentation of the certificate to the
Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments
of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the written request, and certificate or
transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears on the records of the Trustee
and on the face of any certificate with the signature guaranteed by a
participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program ("STAMP") or a
signature guarantee program accepted by the Trustee. In certain instances the
Trustee may require additional documents, including but not limited to, trust
instruments, certificates of death, appointments as executor or administrator or
certificates of corporate authority. Fractional certificates will not be issued.
The Trustee may require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee for each
certificate reissued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, stolen,
mutilated or lost certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the Trustee of
satisfactory indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses incurred.
Mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.


Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of dividends and other
amounts received by the Trust for each distribution. Within a reasonable time
after the end of each year, each person who was a Unitholder during that year
will receive a statement describing dividends and capital received, actual Trust
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the Securities and other Trust
information. Unitholders may obtain evaluations of the Securities upon request
to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your Trust,
please contact your financial advisor or the Trustee. The Sponsor does not have
access to individual account information.



TRUST ADMINISTRATION





Trust Administration. The Trust is not an actively managed fund and, except
as provided in the Trust Agreement, Securities generally will not be sold or
replaced after the initial deposit. The Sponsor may, however, direct that
Securities be sold in certain limited circumstances to protect the Trust based
on advice from the Supervisor. These situations may include events such as the
issuer having defaulted on payment of any of its outstanding obligations or the
price of a Security having declined to such an extent, or other credit factors
exist, so that in the opinion of the Supervisor retention of the Security would
be detrimental to the Trust. If a public tender offer has been made for a
Security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a Security, the
Trustee may either sell the Security or accept an offer if the Supervisor
determines that the sale or exchange is in the best interest of Unitholders
(only offers for cash if a Trust has not elected to be traded as a regulated
investment company for federal tax purposes). The Trustee will distribute any
cash proceeds to Unitholders. In addition, the Trustee may sell Securities to
redeem Units or pay Trust expenses or deferred sales charges. With respect to a
Portfolio structured as a grantor trust for federal tax purposes, the Trustee
must reject any offer for securities or property other than cash in exchange for
the Securities. If securities or property are nonetheless acquired by the Trust,
the Sponsor may direct the Trustee to sell the securities or property and
distribute the proceeds to Unitholders or to accept the securities or property
for deposit in the Trust. Should any contract for the purchase of any of the
Securities fail, the Sponsor will (unless substantially all of the moneys held
in the Trust to cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute Securities in
accordance with the Trust Agreement) refund the cash and sales charge
attributable to the failed contract to all Unitholders on or before the next
Distribution Date.


With respect to a Trust that is structured as a regulated investment company
for federal tax purposes, the Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of
the sale of Securities if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse
credit factors which, in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the
Securities detrimental to the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not
obligated to, direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities
that meet the criteria for inclusion in the Trust on the Initial Date of
Deposit. The Sponsor may also instruct the Trustee to take action necessary to
ensure that certain Trusts continue to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated
investment company and to avoid imposition of tax on undistributed income of the
Trust.


When the Trust sells Securities, the composition and diversity of the
Securities in the Trust may be altered. In order to obtain the best price for
the Trust, it may be necessary for the Supervisor to specify minimum amounts
(generally 100 shares) in which blocks of Securities are to be sold. In
effecting purchases and sales of portfolio securities, the Sponsor may direct
that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid to brokers,
including brokers which may be affiliated with the Trust, the Sponsor, the
Underwriter or dealers participating in the offering of Units. In addition, in
selecting among firms to handle a particular transaction, the Sponsor may take
into account whether the firm has sold or is selling units of unit investment
trusts which it sponsors.


Pursuant to an exemptive order, when each Trust terminates, it may be
permitted to sell Securities to a new trust series if those Securities meet the
investment strategy of the new trust. The exemption may enable each Trust to
eliminate commission costs on these transactions. The price for those securities
will be the closing sale price on the sale date on the exchange where the
Securities are principally traded, as certified by the Sponsor.


Amendment of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee and the Sponsor may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially
adversely affect Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the Sponsor and the
Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of Units
or permit acquisition of securities in addition to or substitution for the
Securities (except as provided in the Trust Agreement). The Trustee will notify
Unitholders of any amendment.


Termination. Each Trust will terminate on the Mandatory Termination Date or
upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security held in the Trust. A
Trust may be terminated at any time with consent of Unitholders representing
two-thirds of the outstanding Units or by the Trustee when the value of the
Trust is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Trust has exceeded
$15,000,000) (the "Minimum Termination Value"). Unitholders will be notified of
any termination. The Trustee may begin to sell Securities in connection with a
Trust termination nine business days before, and no later than, the Mandatory
Termination Date. Approximately forty-five days before this date, the Trustee
will notify Unitholders of the termination and provide a form enabling qualified
Unitholders to elect an in kind distribution of Securities. You are qualified to
elect an in kind distribution of Securities, provided that Unitholders may not
request an in kind distribution of Securities within thirty days of the Trust's
termination. Any in kind distribution of Securities at termination will be made
in the manner and subject to the restrictions described under "Rights of
Unitholders--Redemption of Units". Unitholders will receive a final cash
distribution within a reasonable time after the Mandatory Termination Date. All
distributions will be net of Trust expenses and costs. Unitholders will receive
a final distribution statement following termination. The Information Supplement
contains further information regarding termination of the Trust. See "Additional
Information".


Limitations on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Underwriter, Supervisor Evaluator,
if any, and Trustee are under no liability for taking any action or for
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee is not liable
for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of any of
the Securities. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and is not liable for any action
taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not liable
for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed on the Securities, on it as
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on the Trust, which the Trustee may be
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the
Trustee. The Sponsor, Underwriter, and Supervisor may rely on any evaluation
furnished by the Evaluator, if any, or the Trustee and have no responsibility
for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by the Trustee shall be made in good
faith upon the basis of the best information available to it.


Sponsor. Van Kampen Funds Inc. is the Sponsor of the Portfolio. The Sponsor
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Van Kampen Investments Inc. ("Van Kampen
Investments"). Van Kampen Investments is a diversified asset management company

The Sponsor and the Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring Van
Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to
report personal securities transactions. This code is intended to avoid
potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct
with respect to the Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional
information about the Sponsor.


If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the SEC, (ii) terminate the
Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust as provided therein or (iii) continue to
act as Trustee without terminating the Trust Agreement.


Underwriter. Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P., a Missouri limited partnership, is

compensation for underwriting services in the next three months from, some of
the issuers of the Securities. Principals of the Underwriter may serve as a
member of the board of directors of one or more issuers of the Securities or of
affiliates of such issuers. Furthermore, the Underwriter may issue reports and
make recommendations on the Securities. For any of these brokerage, specialist,
market-making or investment banking activities, the Underwriter may receive
additional compensation. The Underwriter may also receive compensation based on
commissions generated by sales of Units in addition to its concession or agency
commission. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation".


Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of the State of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon
has its principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th

TAXATION - GRANTOR TRUSTS





This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning Units of a Trust taxed as a grantor trust as of the date
of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these
summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For
example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a tax-exempt entity, or other
investor with special circumstances. In addition, this section does not describe
your state, local or foreign tax consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.


Assets of the Trust. The Trust is expected to hold one or more of the
following: (i) shares of stock in corporations (the "Stocks") that are treated
as equity for federal income tax purposes, and (ii) equity interests in real
estate investment trusts (the "REIT Shares") that constitute interests in
entities treated as real estate investment trusts for federal income tax
purposes.


It is possible that the Trust will also hold other assets, including assets
that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences
different from or in addition to those described in this section. All of the
assets held by the Trust constitute the "Trust Assets". Neither our counsel nor
we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets.


Trust Status. If the Trust is at all times operated in accordance with the
documents establishing the Trust and certain requirements of federal income tax
law are met, the Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., dividends and capital gains, if any)
from each Trust Asset when such income would be considered to be received by you
if you directly owned the Trust Assets. This is true even if you elect to have
your distributions reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income
from Trust Assets that you must take into account for federal income tax
purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or Trust expenses.


Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss Upon Disposition. If your Trust disposes of
Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of your
Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain or
loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your
adjusted tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total
amount received in the transaction. You can generally determine your initial tax
basis in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units, including
sales charges, among the Trust Assets ratably according to their values on the
date you acquire your Units. In certain circumstances, however, you may have to
adjust your tax basis after you acquire your Units (for example, in the case of
certain dividends that exceed a corporation's accumulated earnings and profits,
or in the case of certain distributions with respect to REIT Shares that
represent a return of capital, as discussed below).


If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net
capital gain is generally 15% (zero for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax
brackets). These capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years
beginning before January 1, 2011. For later periods, if you are an individual,
the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally 20% (10%
for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). The 20% rate is reduced
to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term capital gains from most
property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding period of more than
five years.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as
for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
however, treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations.
Capital gain received from assets held for more than one year that is considered
"unrecaptured section 1250 gain" (which may be the case, for example, with some
capital gains attributable to the REIT Shares) is taxed at a maximum stated tax
rate of 25%. In the case of capital gains dividends, the determination of which
portion of the capital gains dividend, if any, is subject to the 25% tax rate,
will be made based on rules prescribed by the United States Treasury.


Dividends From Stocks. Certain dividends received with respect to the Stocks
may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain (as
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied.
These special rules relating to the taxation of dividends at capital gains rates
generally apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011.


Dividends From REIT Shares. Some dividends on the REIT Shares may be
designated as "capital gain dividends," generally taxable to you as long-term
capital gains. If you hold a Unit for six months or less or if your Trust holds
a REIT Share for six months or less, any loss incurred by you related to the
disposition of such REIT Share will be treated as a long-term capital loss to
the extent of any long-term capital gain distributions received (or deemed to
have been received) with respect to such REIT Share. Distributions of income or
capital gains declared on the REIT Shares in October, November or December will
be deemed to have been paid to you on December 31 of the year they are declared,
even when paid by the REIT during the following January. Other dividends on the
REIT Shares will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income, although in
limited circumstances, some of the ordinary income dividends from a REIT may
also qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gains (as
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied.
These special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from
real estate investment trusts generally apply to taxable years beginning before
January 1, 2011.


Dividends Received Deduction. A corporation that owns Units generally will
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many
dividends received by the Trust, because the dividends received deduction is not
available for dividends from most foreign corporations or from REITs.


In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances as described in this
prospectus, you may request an in kind distribution of Trust Assets when you
redeem your Units. By electing to receive an in kind distribution, you will
receive Trust Assets, plus, possibly, cash. You will not recognize gain or loss
if you only receive whole Trust Assets in exchange for the identical amount of
your pro rata portion of the same Trust Assets held by your Trust. However, if
you also receive cash in exchange for a Trust Asset or a fractional portion of a
Trust Asset, you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference
between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such Trust Asset or
fractional portion.


Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over
into a future series of the Trust, it is considered a sale for federal income
tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and, in
general, any loss will be treated as a capital loss. However, any loss you incur
in connection with the exchange of your Units of your Trusts for units of the
next series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and
subsequent deemed repurchase, to the extent the two trusts have substantially
identical Trust Assets under the wash sale provisions of the Code.


Limitations on the Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of your
Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses. You
may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your Trust to the same
extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may be required to treat some or
all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions.
Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the
extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.


Foreign Taxes. Distributions by your Trust that are treated as U.S. source
income (e.g., dividends received on Stocks of domestic corporations) will
generally be subject to U.S. income taxation and withholding in the case of
Units held by nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations or other
non-U.S. persons, subject to any applicable treaty.


Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you may not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including
withholding taxes, on some of the income from your Trust or gain from the sale
or redemption of your Units, provided that certain conditions are met. You
should consult your tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in
order to be exempt for U.S. tax purposes. You should also consult your tax
advisor with respect to other U.S. tax withholding and reporting requirements.


Some distributions by your Trust may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
Any income withheld will still be treated as income to you. Under the grantor
trust rules, you are considered to have paid directly your share of any foreign
taxes that are paid. Therefore, for U.S. tax purposes, you may be entitled to a
foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes.


New York Tax Status. Under the existing income tax laws of the State and City
of New York, your Trust will not be taxed as a corporation, subject to the New
York State franchise tax and the New York City general corporation tax. You
should consult your tax advisor regarding potential federal, foreign, state or
local taxation with respect to your Units based on your individual
circumstances.



TAXATION - REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANIES





This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning Units of the Trust taxed as a regulated investment
company as of the date of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change
frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to
all taxpayers. For example, these summaries generally do not describe your
situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a
tax-exempt entity, or other investor with special circumstances. In addition,
this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.


Trust Status. The Trust intends to elect and to qualify annually as a
"regulated investment company" under the federal tax laws. If the Trust
qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as
required by the tax law, the Trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.


Distributions. Trust distributions are generally taxable. After the end of
each year, you will receive a tax statement that separates your Trust's
distributions into two categories, ordinary income distributions and capital
gains dividends. Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your
ordinary tax rate, however, as further discussed below, for individual
Unitholders certain ordinary income distributions received from the Trust may be
taxed at the capital gains tax rates for taxable years beginning before January
1, 2011. Certain ordinary income dividends on Units that are attributable to
qualifying dividends received by the Trust from certain corporations may be
designated by the Trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction
for corporate Unitholders, provided certain holding period requirements are met.
Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains
regardless of how long you have owned your Units. In addition, the Trust may
make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus
will generally not be taxable to you. The tax status of your distributions from
your Trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in
additional Units or receive them in cash. The income from your Trust that you
must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts
used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws may require you to
treat distributions made to you in January as if you had received them on
December 31 of the previous year.


Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your Units, you will
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain
or loss, you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your Units from the amount
you receive in the transaction. Your initial tax basis in your Units is
generally equal to the cost of your shares, generally including sales charges.
In some cases, however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase
your Units.


Capital Gains and Losses and Certain Ordinary Income Dividends. If you are an
individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is
generally 15% (zero for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets).
These capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning
before January 1, 2011. For later periods, if you are an individual, the maximum
marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally 20% (10% for certain
taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). The 20% rate is reduced to 18% and
the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term capital gains from most property
acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding period of more than five years.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a
capital gain dividend from your Trust and sell your Units at a loss after
holding it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as long-term
capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received. The tax rates
for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally
the same as for ordinary income. The Code treats certain capital gains as
ordinary income in special situations.


In certain circumstances, ordinary income dividends received by an individual
shareholder from a regulated investment company such as the Trust may be taxed
at the same rates that apply to net capital gain (as discussed above), provided
certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are
attributable to qualified dividend income received by the Trust itself. These
special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from
regulated investment companies generally apply to taxable years beginning before
January 1, 2011. The Trust will provide notice to its Unitholders of the amount
of any distribution which may be taken into account as qualified dividend income
which is eligible for these capital gains tax rates.


In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this
prospectus, you may receive an in kind distribution of Trust Assets when you
redeem your Units. In general, this distribution will be treated as a sale for
federal income tax purposes and you will recognize gain or loss, based on the
value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received. The
Internal Revenue Service could however assert that a loss could not be currently
deducted.


Rollovers and Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust
rolled over into a future trust, it is considered a sale for federal income tax
purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and, in
general, any loss will be treated as a capital loss. However, any loss realized
on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that Units disposed of
are replaced (including through reinvestment of dividends) within a period of 61
days beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after disposition of Units or
to the extent that the Unitholder, during such period, acquires or enters into
an option or contract to acquire, substantially identical stock or securities.
In such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the
disallowed loss.


Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, expenses incurred by your Trust
will be deducted from the gross income received by your Trust and only your
share of the Trust's net income will be paid to you and reported as taxable
income to you. However, if the Units of your Trust are held by fewer than 500
Unitholders at any time during a taxable year, your Trust will generally not be
able to deduct certain expenses from income, thus resulting in your reported
share of the Trust's taxable income being increased by your share of those
expenses, even though you do not receive a corresponding cash distribution. In
this case you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses; however,
certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses, may be
deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed
2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.


Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax treaties,
distributions from your Portfolio will be characterized as dividends for federal
income tax purposes (other than dividends which your Portfolio designates as
capital gain dividends) and will be subject to U.S. income taxes, including
withholding taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below. However
distributions received by a foreign investor from your Portfolio that are
properly designated by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to
U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that your
Portfolio makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met.


Foreign Tax Credit. If your Trust invests in any foreign securities, the tax
statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your Trust
paid to other countries. In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your
share of the taxes your Trust paid to other countries. You may be able to deduct
or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes if your Trust meets
certain requirements for passing through such deductions or credits to
Unitholders.


Investors should consult their advisors concerning the federal, state, local
and foreign tax consequences of investing in a Trust.



TRUST OPERATING EXPENSES





General. The fees and expenses of the Trust will accrue on a daily basis. The
fees and expenses are generally paid out of the Capital Account of the Trust. It
is expected that Securities will be sold to pay these amounts, which will result
in capital gains or losses to Unitholders. See "Taxation". The Sponsor's,
Evaluator's, Supervisor's and Trustee's fees may be increased without approval
of the Unitholders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the
category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index or, if
this category is not published, in a comparable category.


Trustee's Fee. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee from the
Trust set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One.
The Trustee benefits to the extent there are funds in the Capital and Income
Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders and the
amounts earned by the Trustee are retained by the Trustee. Part of the Trustee's
compensation for its services to the Trust is expected to result from the use of
these funds.


Compensation of Sponsor, Evaluator and Supervisor. The Sponsor and the
Supervisor, which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee
for providing bookkeeping and administrative services and portfolio supervisory
services set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part
One. These fees may exceed the actual costs of providing these services to the
Trust but at no time will the total amount received for these services rendered
to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts in any calendar year exceed the
aggregate cost of providing these services in that year. The Evaluator will
receive the annual fee for providing evaluation services set forth under
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One.


Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by the Trust: (a) normal expenses (including the cost of mailing
reports to Unitholders) incurred in connection with the operation of the Trust,

(b) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (c) expenses of the Trustee
(including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel designated by the
Sponsor, (d) various governmental charges, (e) expenses and costs of any action
taken by the Trustee to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of
Unitholders, (f) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or
expenses incurred in the administration of the Trust without negligence, bad
faith or wilful misconduct on its part, (g) foreign custodial and transaction
fees, (h) costs associated with liquidating the securities held in the Trust,

(i) any offering costs incurred after the end of the initial offering period and

(j) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of the
Trust. The Trust may pay the expenses of updating its registration statement
each year.

Investments






RISK FACTORS



Price Volatility. Because the Trust invests in common stocks, you should
understand the risks of investing in common stocks before purchasing Units.
These risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the
general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value of the stocks
(and therefore Units) will fall. Common stocks are especially susceptible to
general stock market movements. The value of common stocks often rises or falls
rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies
change. These perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding
government economic policies, inflation, interest rates, economic expansion or
contraction, political climates and economic or banking crises. The value of
Units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in the Trust and may be more
or less than the price you originally paid for your Units. As with any
investment, we cannot guarantee that the performance of the Trust will be
positive over any period of time. Because the Trust is not actively managed, the
Trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in
managed investments.


Dividends. Common stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are
not obligations of the company. Accordingly, common stockholders have a right to
receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of
creditors, bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company. This means that
common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a company's board
of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all
of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders. If a company issues
additional debt securities or preferred stock, the owners of these securities
will have a claim against the company's assets before common stockholders if the
company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common
stock was issued first. As a result, the company may be less willing or able to
declare or pay dividends on its common stock.


Financial Services Issuers. An investment in Units of the Trust should be
made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the bank,
insurance and financial services sector in general.


The effects of the global financial crisis that began to unfold in 2007
continue to manifest in nearly all the sub-divisions of the financial services
industry. Financial losses and write downs among investment banks and similar
institutions reached significant levels in 2008. The impact of these losses
among traditional banks, investment banks, broker/dealers and insurers has
forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation or
combination, while drastically increasing the credit risk, and possibility of
default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles. Many of
the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance
their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital. In
some cases, U.S. and foreign governments have acted to bail out or provide
support to select institutions, however the risk of default by such issuers has
nonetheless increased substantially.


While the U.S. and foreign governments, and their respective government
agencies, have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with
financial institutions, there can be no assurance that the risks associated with
investment in financial services company issuers will decrease as a result of
these steps.


Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Banks are highly
dependent on net interest margin. Bank profitability is largely dependent on the
availability and cost of capital funds, and can fluctuate significantly when
interest rates change or due to increased competition. Banks had received
significant consumer mortgage fee income as a result of activity in mortgage and
refinance markets. As initial home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided
as a result of increasing interest rates and other factors, this income
diminished. Economic conditions in the real estate markets, which have been weak
in the past, can have a substantial effect upon banks because they generally
have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real estate. Banks
and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and,
when such institutions are state-chartered, to state regulation as well. Such
regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and
extent of business activities that banks may pursue. Furthermore, bank
regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory
and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible
activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to
the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance
fund. Regulatory actions, such as increases in the minimum capital requirements
applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be
paid by banks and thrifts to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"),
can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends.
Neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations, however,
insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies, or
insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such
institutions.


The statutory requirements applicable to, and regulatory supervision of,
banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have
undergone substantial change in recent years. To a great extent, these changes
are embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act,
enacted in August 1989; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. The impact of
these laws on the business, financial condition and prospects of the Securities
in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act financial services overhaul legislation allows banks,
securities firms and insurance companies to form one-stop financial
conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors
and permits new entrants to offer various financial products. This legislation
has resulted in increased merger activity and heightened competition among
existing and new participants in the field. Technological advances such as the
Internet allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit
the more efficient use of customer data. Banks continue to face tremendous
pressure from mutual funds, brokerage firms and other financial service
providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered
by banks. Legislation to liberalize interstate banking has been enacted in
recent years. Under the legislation, banks are able to purchase or establish
subsidiary banks in any state. Since mid-1997, banks have been allowed to turn
existing banks into branches. Consolidation may continue. The Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the Financial Accounting Standards Board
require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed
rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading
accounts or available for sale. Adoption of additional such rules may result in
increased volatility in the reported health of the industry, and mandated
regulatory intervention to correct such problems. Additional legislative and
regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For example, the bank regulatory
authorities have proposed substantial changes to the Community Reinvestment Act
and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and there can be no certainty as
to the effect, if any, that such changes would have on the Securities in the
Trust's portfolio. In addition, from time to time the deposit insurance system
is reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and proposed reforms of that
system could, among other things, further restrict the ways in which deposited
moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits
insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce profitability, as
investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and
as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits. Banks face
significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds,
credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance companies, and increased
competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national
interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such legislation allows banks
and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines
and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit. Neither the
Sponsor nor the Underwriter makes any prediction as to what, if any, manner of
bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such
actions might have on the Trust's portfolio.


The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve,
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.


The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view that
a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash
dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that
would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also may impose
limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of
certain applications, including applications for approval of mergers and
acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor the Underwriter makes any prediction as to
the effect, if any, such laws will have on the Securities or whether such
approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.


Companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are
subject to the adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates,
and competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes
in the direction of the stock market, investor confidence, the financial health
of customers, equity transaction volume, the level and direction of interest
rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial
stability, as well as the stock prices, of these companies. Additionally,
competitive pressures, including increased competition with new and existing
competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need
for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the
profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage
industries. Companies involved in investment management and brokerage activities
are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and
self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in
the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could adversely affect
the stock prices of such companies.


Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,
including but not limited to interest rate movements, the imposition of premium
rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings,
competition and pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other
natural or man-made disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual
companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the
inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject
to extensive governmental regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate
levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or
potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies' policy
sales, tax obligations and profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit
margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of
traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new technology
and the pressure to compete globally.


In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors,
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:


o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing
property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;


o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be
expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;


o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing
property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;


o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;


o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;


o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and


o    the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables.


The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come under
increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have considered or
enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate
insurance companies and insurance holding company systems. Further, the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and state insurance regulators
are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on
insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new
laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the
condition of the insurance industry in the United States to determine whether to
promulgate additional federal regulation. The Sponsor is unable to predict
whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or
scope of regulation of the insurance industry, or what effect, if any, such
legislation would have on the industry.


All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some
instances, would require divestiture.


Utility Issuers. An investment in Units of the Trust should be made with an
understanding of the characteristics of the public utility industry and the
risks which such an investment may entail. General problems of the public
utility industry include the difficulty in obtaining an adequate return on
invested capital despite frequent increases in rates which have been granted by
the public service commissions having jurisdiction, the difficulty in financing
large construction programs during an inflationary period, the restrictions on
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental, nuclear
safety and other regulatory considerations, the difficulty of the capital
markets absorbing utility debt and equity securities, the difficulty in
obtaining fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices, regulatory
restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the
retail and business customer, and the effects of energy conservation. There is
no assurance that public service commissions will grant rate increases in the
future or that any such increases will be timely or adequate to cover operating
and other expenses and debt service requirements. All of the public utilities
which are issuers of the Securities have been experiencing many of these
problems in varying degrees. Furthermore, utility stocks are particularly
susceptible to interest rate risk, generally exhibiting an inverse relationship
to interest rates. As a result, electric utility stock prices may be adversely
affected as interest rates rise. Similarly, the success of certain companies is
tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies with
intense competition between companies. There can be no assurance that these
customers will place additional orders, or that an issuer of Securities will
obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other customers.
Accordingly, a decline in demand of such products, technologies or from such
customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of the Securities.


Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility
commissions which, for example, establish the rates which may be charged and the
appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base, which must be approved by
the state commissions. Certain utilities have had difficulty from time to time
in persuading regulators, who are subject to political pressures, to grant rate
increases necessary to maintain an adequate return on investment. Any unexpected
limitations could negatively affect the profitability of utilities whose budgets
are planned far in advance. In addition, gas pipeline and distribution companies
have had difficulties in adjusting to short and surplus energy supplies,
enforcing or being required to comply with long-term contracts and avoiding
litigation with their customers, on the one hand, or suppliers, on the other.
Furthermore, regulatory authorities, which may be subject to political and other
pressures, may not grant future rate increases, or may impose accounting or
operational policies, any of which could adversely affect a company's
profitability and its stock price.


Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in
recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial
companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been
permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic
regions and their traditional lines of business. These opportunities may permit
certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates of
return. Some companies, however, may be forced to defend their core business and
may be less profitable.


Certain of the issuers of the Securities may own or operate nuclear
generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review
existing, and impose additional, requirements governing the licensing,
construction and operation of nuclear power plants. In the past, nuclear
generating projects in the electric utility industry have experienced
substantial cost increases, construction delays and licensing difficulties.
These have been caused by various factors, including inflation, high financing
costs, required design changes and rework, allegedly faulty construction,
objections by groups and governmental officials, limits on the ability to
finance, reduced forecasts of energy requirements and economic conditions. This
experience indicates that the risk of significant cost increases, delays and
licensing difficulties remain present until completion and achievement of
commercial operation of any nuclear project. Also, nuclear generating units in
service have experienced unplanned outages or extensions of scheduled outages
due to equipment problems or new regulatory requirements sometimes followed by a
significant delay in obtaining regulatory approval to return to service. A major
accident at a nuclear plant anywhere could cause the imposition of limits or
prohibitions on the operation, construction or licensing of nuclear units.


In view of the uncertainties discussed above, there can be no assurance that
any utility company's share of the full cost of nuclear units under construction
ultimately will be recovered in rates or the extent to which a company could
earn an adequate return on its investment in such units. The likelihood of a
significantly adverse event occurring in any of the areas of concern described
above varies, as does the potential severity of any adverse impact. It should be
recognized, however, that one or more of such adverse events could occur and
individually or collectively could have a material adverse impact on a company's
financial condition, the results of its operations, its ability to make interest
and principal payments on its outstanding debt or to pay dividends.


Other general problems of the electric, gas and water utility industries
(including state and local joint action power agencies) include rising costs of
rail transportation to transport fossil fuels, the uncertainty of transmission
service costs for both interstate and intrastate transactions, changes in tax
laws which adversely affect a utility's ability to operate profitably, increased
competition in service costs, recent reductions in estimates of future demand
for electricity and gas in certain areas of the country, restrictions on
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental
considerations, uncertain availability and increased cost of capital,
unavailability of fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices, including
the steady rise in fuel costs and the costs associated with conversion to
alternate fuel sources such as coal, availability and cost of natural gas for
resale, technical and cost factors and other problems associated with
construction, licensing, regulation and operation of nuclear facilities for
electric generation, including, among other considerations, the problems
associated with the use of radioactive materials and the disposal of radioactive
wastes, and the effects of energy and environmental conservation efforts. Each
of the problems referred to could adversely affect the ability of the issuers of
any Securities to make dividend payments and the value of such Securities on
redemption of your Units.


Real Estate Investment Trusts. The Trust will invest in shares issued by
REITs, domestic corporations or business trusts which invest primarily in income
producing real estate or real estate related loans or mortgages. REITs are
financial vehicles that have as their objective the pooling of capital from a
number of investors in order to participate indirectly in real estate ownership
or financing. Thus, an investment in the Trust will be subject to risks similar
to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate, in addition to
securities markets risks, because of the Trust's investment in the securities of
companies in the real estate industry. These risks include:


o    declines in the value of real estate;


o    illiquidity of real property investments;


o    risks related to general U.S. and global as well as local economic
conditions;


o    dependency on management skill;


o    heavy cash flow dependency;


o    possible lack of availability of mortgage funds;


o    excessive levels of debt or overleveraged financial structure;


o    overbuilding;


o    extended vacancies, or obsolescence, of properties;


o    increase in competition;


o    increases in property taxes and operating expenses;


o    changes in zoning laws;


o    losses due to costs resulting from the clean-up of environmental
problems;


o    liability to third parties for damages resulting from environmental
problems;


o    casualty or condemnation losses;


o    natural or man-made disasters;


o    economic or regulatory impediments to raising rents;


o    changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand;


o    the ongoing financial strength and viability of government sponsored
enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac;


o    changes in the appeal of properties to tenants; and


o    changes in interest rates, tax rates or operating expenses.


In addition to these risks, equity REITs may be more likely to be affected by
changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trusts. Further,
REITs are dependent upon the management skills of the issuers and generally may
not be diversified.


The above factors may also adversely affect a borrower's or lessee's ability
to meet its obligations to the REIT. In the event of a default by a borrower or
lessee, the REIT may experience delays in enforcing its rights as a mortgagee or
lessor and may incur substantial costs associated with protecting its
investments.


A significant amount of the assets of a REIT may be invested in investments
in specific geographic areas or in specific property types, e.g., hotels,
shopping malls, residential complexes, and office buildings. The impact of
economic conditions on REITs also varies with geographic location and property
type. Variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in
terms of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate
generally and REITs in particular. In addition, you should be aware that REITs
may not be diversified and are subject to the risks of financing projects. REITs
are also subject to


o    defaults by borrowers,


o    the market's perception of the REIT industry generally,


o    the possibility of failing to qualify for tax-free pass-through of
income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), and


o    the possibility of failing to maintain exemption from the Investment
Company Act of 1940.


A default by a borrower or lessee may cause the REIT to experience delays in
enforcing its rights as mortgagee or lessor and to incur significant costs
related to protecting its investments.


Some REITs in the Trust may be structured as UPREITs. An UPREIT owns an
interest in a partnership that owns real estate. This can result in a potential
conflict of interest between (1) shareholders of the REIT who may want to sell
an asset and (2) other partnership interest holders who would be subject to tax
liability if the REIT sells the property. In some cases, REITs have entered into
"no sell" agreements, which are designed to avoid taxing the holders of
partnership units by preventing the REIT from selling the property. This
arrangement may mean that the REIT would refuse a lucrative offer for an asset
or be forced to hold on to a poor asset. Since parties to "no sell" agreements
often do not disclose them, the Sponsor does not know whether any of the REITs
in the Trust have entered into this kind of arrangement.


A REIT generally maintains comprehensive insurance on presently owned and
subsequently acquired real property assets, including (1) liability, (2) fire
and (3) extended coverage. However, there are certain types of losses, generally
of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes and floods, that may be
uninsurable or not economically insurable, as to which the REIT's properties are
at risk in their particular locales. The management of a REIT uses its
discretion in determining (1) amounts, (2) coverage limits and (3) deductibility
provisions of insurance. They generally aim to acquire appropriate insurance on
their investments at reasonable costs and on suitable terms. This may result in
insurance coverage that, in the event of a substantial loss, would not be
sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of
the lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances,
environmental considerations, and several other factors might make it unfeasible
to use insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or
destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds that a REIT receives
might not be adequate to restore its economic position with respect to that
property.


Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be
liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances
on, under or in such property. Such laws often impose liability (1) whether or
not the owner or operator caused or knew of the presence of the hazardous or
toxic substances and (2) whether or not the storage of the substances was in
violation of a tenant's lease. In addition, (1) the presence of hazardous or
toxic substances, or (2) the failure to remediate the property properly, may
hinder the owner's ability to borrow using that real property as collateral. We
cannot give any assurance that one or more of the REITs in the Trust may not be
currently liable or potentially liable for any of these costs in connection with
real estate assets they presently own or subsequently acquire while the shares
of those REITs are held in the Trust.


Consumer Staples. Your Trust may invest significantly in issuers that
manufacture or sell consumer staples. The profitability of these companies will
be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and
consumer spending trends. Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a
recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth,
less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real
disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both
consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending
habits. Furthermore, the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or
reduced market acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials
costs, an inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product
liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance
and stock prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.


Industrials Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in industrials
companies. General risks of industrials companies include the general state of
the economy, intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international
politics, excess capacity and consumer spending trends. In addition, capital
goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending
levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in modernization,
limitations on supply of key materials, labor relations, government regulations,
government contracts and e-commerce initiatives. Furthermore, certain companies
involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting
irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial
results, and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny.


Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or
retain government contracts, or changes in government budget priorities, changes
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall
construction spending may adversely affect construction equipment manufacturers.


Health Care Issuers. An investment in Units of your Trust should be made with
an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the health care industry
in general. Health care companies involved in advanced medical devices and
instruments, drugs and biotech, managed care, hospital management/health
services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the
health care field. These companies are subject to substantial governmental
regulation of their products and services, a factor which could have a
significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of
such products or services. Furthermore, such companies face the risk of
increasing competition from new products or services, generic drug sales,
termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the
risk that technological advances will render their products obsolete. The
research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial, and
include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product
will ever come to market. Many of these companies may have losses and not offer
certain products for several years, if at all. Such companies may also have
persistent losses during a new product's transition from development to
production, and revenue patterns may be erratic. The goods and services of
health care issuers are also subject to risks of product liability litigation.
The failure to gain approval for a new drug or product or to maintain existing
approval and related litigation can have a substantial negative impact on a
company and its stock.


Legislative proposals concerning health care are proposed in Congress from
time to time. These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription
drugs), national health insurance, incentives for competition in the provision
of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare
insurance premiums and promotion of pre-paid healthcare plans. The government
could also reduce funding for health care related research. The Sponsor and the
Underwriter are unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals, if
enacted, on the issuers of Securities in the Trust.


Health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services, the
ability of the facility to provide required services, confidence in the
facility, management capabilities, competition, efforts by insurers and
government agencies to limit rates, expenses, the cost and possible
unavailability of malpractice insurance, and termination or restriction of
government financial assistance (such as Medicare, Medicaid or similar
programs).


Energy Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in energy companies.
Energy companies are subject to legislative or regulatory changes, adverse
market conditions and/or increased competition affecting the energy sector. The
prices of the securities of energy companies may fluctuate widely due to changes
in value and dividend yield, which depend largely on the price and supply of
energy fuels, international political events relating to oil producing
countries, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects, and tax and
other governmental regulatory policies.


Energy companies depend on their ability to find and acquire additional
energy reserves. The exploration and recovery process involves significant
operating hazards and can be very costly. An energy company has no assurance
that it will find reserves or that any reserves found will be economically
recoverable. The industry also faces substantial government regulation,
including environmental regulation. These regulations have increased costs and
limited production and usage of certain fuels. Furthermore, certain companies
involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting
irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial
results, and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny.


In addition, energy companies face risks related to political conditions in
oil producing regions (such as the Middle East), the actions of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the price and worldwide supply of oil
and natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels, operating
hazards, government regulation and the level of consumer demand. Political
conditions of some oil producing regions have been unstable in the past.
Political instability or war in these regions could have a negative impact on
your investment. Oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile. OPEC
controls a substantial portion of world oil production. OPEC may take actions to
increase or suppress the price or availability of oil. Various domestic and
foreign government authorities and international cartels also impact these
prices. Any substantial decline in these prices could have an adverse effect on
energy companies.


Technology Companies. The market for technology products and services,
especially those related to the Internet, is characterized by rapidly changing
technology, rapid products obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving
industry standards and frequent new product introductions. The success of
technology companies depends in substantial part on the timely and success
introduction of new products. An unexpected change in one or more of the
technologies affecting an issuer's products or in the market for products based
on a particular technology could have a material adverse affect on an issuer's
operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that companies will be
able to respond timely to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace.


The market for certain technology products and services may have only
recently begun to develop, is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an
increasing number of market entrants. Additionally, certain technology companies
may have only recently commenced operations or offered equity securities to the
public. Such companies are in the early stage of development and have a limited
operating history on which to analyze future operating results. It is important
to note that following its initial public offering, a security is likely to
experience substantial stock price volatility and speculative trading.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, upon redemption of your Units or
termination of the Trust, you will receive an amount greater than or equal to
your initial investment.


Based on trading history, factors such as announcements of new products or
development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have
caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to
fluctuate substantially. In addition, technology company stocks have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the
operating performance of such companies. This market volatility may adversely
affect the market price of the securities and therefore your ability to redeem
your Units, or roll over your Units into a new trust, at a price equal to or
greater than the original price paid for such Units.


Some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently
available only from a single source. There can be no assurance that in the
future suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and
cost effective manner. Accordingly, an issuer's operating results and customer
relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for, or
any interruption or reduction in supply of, any key components. Additionally,
many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base
consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product
vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly developing industry standards.
Any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or
reduction of sales. Because many products and technology are incorporated into
other related products, certain companies are often highly dependent on the
performance of other computer, electronics and communications companies. There
can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders, or that
an issuer of securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders
from other customers. Similarly, the success of certain companies is tied to a
relatively small concentration of products or technology with intense
competition between companies. Accordingly, a decline in demand for such
products or technology from such customers could have a material adverse impact
on issuers of the securities.


The life cycle of a new technology product or service tends to be short,
resulting in volatile sales, earnings and stock prices for many technology
companies. Additionally, with the rapid evolution of technologies, competitive
advantages tend to be short lived and product pricing usually falls.
Historically, many of the benefits from new technologies have gone to the
consumer, as their creators have been unable to retain differentiation or
pricing power. Some of the large technology companies have been involved in
antitrust litigation and may continue to be in the future. A slowdown in
corporate or consumer spending on technology will likely hurt technology company
revenues. Technology companies rely on international sales for a meaningful part
of their revenues. Any slowdown in international economies could hurt revenues.


Consumer Cyclicals. The success of companies in the consumer cyclicals sector
depends heavily on consumer spending and disposable household income and is
subject to severe competition. Weakness in the banking or real estate industry,
a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment
growth, less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real
disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both
consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending
habits. The success of companies in the consumer cyclicals segment are also
strongly affected by changes in demographics and consumer tastes.


Consumer Products. Your Trust may invest significantly in issuers that
manufacture or sell consumer products. The profitability of these companies will
be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and
consumer spending trends. Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a
recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth,
less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real
disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both
consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending
habits. Furthermore, the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or
reduced market acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials
costs, an inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product
liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance
and stock prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.


Telecommunications Issuers. As your Trust may invest significantly in the
telecommunications industry, the value of the Units may be susceptible to
factors affecting the telecommunications industry. The telecommunications
industry is subject to governmental regulation. For example, the United States
government and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the
kinds of services that a company may offer. The products and services of
telecommunications companies may become outdated very rapidly. A company's
performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace with technological
advances. These factors could affect the value of Units. Certain types of
companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in fierce competition for a
share of the market of their products and may have higher costs, including
liabilities associated with the medical, pension and postretirement expenses of
their workforce, than their competitors. As a result, competitive pressures are
intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility.


Several high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies in
the past have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of the
telecommunications industry. High debt loads that were accumulated during the
industry growth spurt of the 1990s caught up to the industry, causing debt and
stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies
and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment. At the same
time, demand for some telecommunications services remains weak, as several key
markets are oversaturated and many customers can choose between several service
providers and technology platforms. To meet increasing competition, companies
may have to commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new
products and services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have
been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing,
consolidating and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling
product lines. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry
may face similar scrutiny. Moreover, some companies have begun the process of
emerging from bankruptcy and may have reduced levels of debt and other
competitive advantages over other telecommunications companies. Due to these and
other factors, the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications
companies has increased substantially and may continue to rise.


Federal legislation governing the United States telecommunications industry
may become subject to judicial review and additional interpretation, which may
adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by the Trust. Moreover,
the continued consolidation in this industry could create integration expenses
and delay, and consequent management diversion of attention away from ongoing
operations and related risks, among other factors, could result in the failure
of these companies to realize expected cost savings or synergies.


Liquidity. Whether or not the stocks in the Trust are listed on a stock
exchange, the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in an
over-the-counter market. As a result, the existence of a liquid trading market
could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks. We cannot
guarantee that dealers will maintain a market or that any market will be liquid.
The value of the stocks could fall if trading markets are limited or absent.


Voting. Only the Trustee may sell or vote the stocks in the Trust. While you
may sell or redeem your Units, you may not sell or vote the stocks in the Trust.
The Sponsor will instruct the Trustee how to vote the stocks. The Trustee will
vote the stocks in the same general proportion as shares held by other
shareholders if the Sponsor fails to provide instructions.


No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in the Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.

TRUSTEE INFORMATION



The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company organized under
the laws of the State of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its principal
unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn,
New York 11217, (800) 856-8487. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits

TAXATION




Regulated Investment Companies



The prospectus contains a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
issues concerning the Trust and the purchase, ownership and disposition of Trust
Units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and is
qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion. Prospective investors
should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of Trust Units, as well
as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality, non-U.S.
country, or other taxing jurisdiction.


The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part
on the advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could
disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. In addition, the
Sponsor's counsel was not asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion with
respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be held by the
Trust.


Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually as a regulated
investment company under the Code and to comply with applicable distribution
requirements so that it will not pay federal income tax on income and capital
gains distributed to its Unitholders.


To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally
accorded to regulated investment companies, the Trust must, among other things,

(a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or
other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or other income
derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or
currencies, and net income from qualified publicly traded partnerships; (b)
diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of the taxable year,

(i) at least 50% of the market value of the Trust's assets is represented by
cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government securities, the
securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with
such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of
this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Trust's
total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of
such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is
invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the
securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or two or
more issuers which the Trust controls (by owning at least 20% of such issuer's
outstanding voting securities) and which are engaged in the same, similar or
related trades or businesses, or the securities of qualified publicly traded
partnerships; and (c) distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable
income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and net
short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses but excludes
net capital gain, if any) and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt interest
income, if any, each taxable year.


As a regulated investment company, the Trust generally will not be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that term
is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends paid)
and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net
short-term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to Unitholders. The Trust
intends to distribute to its Unitholders, at least annually, substantially all
of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain. If the Trust
retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income, it will
generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the
amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely basis in
accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a
nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, the Trust distributes during each
calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its ordinary
income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar
year, (2) at least 98% of its capital gains in excess of its capital losses
(adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31
of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains for previous
years that were not distributed or taxed during those years. To prevent
application of the excise tax, the Trust intends to make its distributions in
accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement. Further, if the
Trust retains any net capital gain, the Trust may designate the retained amount
as undistributed capital gains in a notice to Unitholders who, if subject to
federal income tax on long-term capital gains (i) will be required to include in
income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their share
of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit their
proportionate share of the tax paid by the Trust against their federal income
tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds
such liabilities. A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of the
current calendar year if it is declared by the Trust in October, November or
December with a record date in such a month and paid by the Trust during January
of the following calendar year. These distributions will be taxable to
Unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared, rather
than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.


If the Trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed to
satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Trust would be
taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such income were
distributed to its Unitholders) and all distributions out of earnings and
profits would be taxed to Unitholders as ordinary dividend income.


Investors should consult their tax advisors concerning the federal, state,
local, and foreign tax consequences of investing in a Trust based on their
individual circumstances.



TRUST TERMINATION



The Trust may be liquidated at any time by consent of Unitholders
representing 66 2/3% of the Units of such Trust then outstanding or by the
Trustee when the value of the Securities owned by the Trust, as shown by any
evaluation, is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Trust has
exceeded $15,000,000). The Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event
that a sufficient number of Units of the Trust not yet sold are tendered for
redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of such Trust would be reduced
to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time they were deposited
in the Trust. If the Trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold
Units by the Sponsor, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the
entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust Agreement will terminate
upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security held thereunder, but in
no event will it continue beyond the Mandatory Termination Date.


Commencing during the period beginning nine business days prior to, and no
later than, the Mandatory Termination Date, Securities may begin to be sold in
connection with the termination of the Trust. The Sponsor will determine the
manner, timing and execution of the sales of the Securities. The Sponsor shall
direct the liquidation of the Securities in such manner as to effectuate orderly
sales and a minimal market impact. In the event the Sponsor does not so direct,
the Securities shall be sold within a reasonable period and in such manner as
the Trustee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. At least 45 days before
the Mandatory Termination Date the Trustee will provide written notice of any
termination to all Unitholders of the appropriate Trust. Unitholders will
receive a cash distribution from the sale of the remaining Securities within a
reasonable time following the Mandatory Termination Date. Regardless of the
distribution involved, the Trustee will deduct from the funds of the Trust any
accrued costs, expenses, advances or indemnities provided by the Trust
Agreement, including estimated compensation of the Trustee, costs of liquidation
and any amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable
taxes or other governmental charges. Any sale of Securities in the Trust upon
termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if
such sale were not required at such time. The Trustee will then distribute to
each Unitholder of each Trust his pro rata share of the balance of the Income
and Capital Accounts.


Within 60 days of the final distribution Unitholders will be furnished a
final distribution statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the
Trustee in its sole discretion will determine that any amounts held in reserve
are no longer necessary, it will make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the
same manner.
