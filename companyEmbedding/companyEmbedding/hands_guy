Beeswax     BandageStop bleeding quickly without any sting! 
Traveling-Camping-Working

A must for those who
bleed easily, are on blood thinners like Coumadin or have fragile skin. 
Stop bleeding quickly without any sting! Reduces
bruising too! It is a heavy beeswax cream which will literally plug the hole.  It is so heavy the blood can't push through.  Just wipe the wound to dry it and quickly apply a heavy band of Beeswax Bandage over the area.  After 2 or 3 minutes you will have coagulated under the cream.  Just wipe it off and unless you need stitches, you are done!  It does not sting and usually soothes any discomfort that is present.  If you leave a little on the wound it will heal much more rapidly.  If you bruise easily rub Beeswax Bandage into the bruise.  It will disappear much more rapidly than it would normally.  Keep a pocket size in your purse or pocket so you are ready for that next unexpected bump and bleed!  Great for shaving mishaps too!     
Great for outdoors &
work - its like having a box of bandages in your pocket! 
And It's Waterproof! "My jar of Beeswax Bandage has blisters and froth on top!"  Beeswax Bandage is a very heavy beeswax cream.  It will often have a frothy or blistery looking film on top due to air that has been introduced while the product was being mixed.  When the product cools after mixing the air bubbles are trapped on the surface.  The product is not defective and the bubbles will not affect how it works.

Enjoy the Outdoors Again with


Honey Guy® Bite Free® Skin Cream or spray


Safe for Pets and People of all ages 


 





Honey Guy BITE FREE skin cream has the same Safe, Pure and Natural ingredients as our Waterblocker Skin Cream with added natural, cosmetic grade Citronella which repels* mosquitoes! No chemical stabilizers or preservatives. NO DEET, no harsh or dangerous chemicals. For more information on Waterblocker Skin Cream see 
	
WATERBLOCKER FAQS
	.





Greaseless, Odorless (after 15 minutes) - One easy application to exposed skin - Waterproof - LASTS-ALL-DAY! 

Great for anyone who loves the outdoors!...(And swears they hear a dinner bell ringing every time they step outside) 


WEST NILE VIRUS IS HERE!


Fight Back with Pure, Handmade, Beeswax BITE FREE® Skin Cream and  citronella based BITE FREE® Spray or Flea, Tick and Chigger Spray.


Bite Free®     Spray


Handmade! Naturally!BITE FREE® Spray works in conjunction with BITE FREE®
	cream as added protection! Use the cream on exposed skin, use the spray
on clothing, hats, shoes and socks, strollers, doors, outdoor furniture
( table edges and chair arms & backs for outdoor dining without
pesky mosquitoes!) and surrounding surfaces to keep mosquitoes
	away.
Of course, the Bite Free spray is safe for direct use on the skin. It
just isn't waterproof like Bite Free skin cream, so it could wash off
in the pool or sweat off.
	




Honey Guy® BITE FREE® Spray is made    of food grade alcohol combined with the same safe cosmetic grade citronella oil used in    BITE FREE® Cream. BITE FREE® Spray comes in a 4oz brushed aluminum pump spray bottle.  Refill it for less with our 16oz BITE FREE® Spray Refill.

If you are dealing with fleas, ticks and/or chiggers in addition to flying insects, try Honey Guy Flea, Tick and Chigger Repellant.  These
pests require more persuasion than mosquitoes. Flea, Tick and Chigger
Repellant is formulated for these bad bugs and has a little mineral oil
to help the product adhere to skin and fur for longer periods. Use on
pets or people. It is safe for all ages and sizes. Lasts about 3 days
on a dog or cat.
			FLEA, TICK AND CHIGGER Spray    comes in a tough 4oz brushed aluminum spray bottle for outdoor use. Re-fill the bottle for a lot less with our 16oz Flea, Tick and Chigger Spray Refill.


*A word about    repellants:  		







Most
repellants don't actually "repel" insects. Rather, they mask the scent
or pheromones insects are looking for so they can't find their target.
Most repellants- even the most highly effective one, DEET, does not do
the job perfectly for everybody. People give off many different
pheromones, most of which human noses cannot detect - but insects and
animals can! Many repellants use chemicals to mask those pheromones-
chemicals which may be worse for one's health than the biting insects.
Honey Guy
			® Bite Free®     Skin Cream and Bite Free® Spray use safe ingredients    even for babies and small animals.  It has been our experience that Honey Guy®
			repellants work well for MOST people MOST of the time. Yet we
occasionally hear of an individual for whom our repellants did not
work or did not work consistently. This is usually because the insects
are sensing a pheromone that our product cannot mask well. Everyone is
different and a few individuals may find Honey Guy
			® repellants to be less than    satisfactory.  The Honey Guy® is dedicated to    making his Customers happy.  The Honey Guy 

UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE
insures that anyone who is dissatisfied with a Honey Guy®
			product for any reason will, at least, not have wasted his or her money
for trying the product. Return the product to Honey Guy
			®
			with a copy of the receipt and receive a full refund including the cost
of shipping. This Guarantee extends to customers of our many Retailers
nationwide. No matter where you bought the Honey Guy
			® product, you are protected by the Honey Guy Unconditional Guarantee! 






One
more thing - people can be allergic to just about anything. A few folks
are allergic to Citronella and a few others cannot tolerate the scent.
So, before you use Honey Guy repellents, especially on babies, try a
little on a very small area of skin. If any redness or swelling occurs
within a few minutes, don't use the product. If, when they catch the
scent, they look at you like you are the Wicked Witch of the West, they
would probably rather you didn't use it on them. 
			












...but What about CHIGGERS???






Chiggers (Red Bugs) are the meanest, toughest, most irritating little varmints you will ever come across...but Honey Guy® repellents are up to the challenge!  We recommend...from experience...that you put Bite Free® Cream liberally
			from the top of your foot up to your knee, including the crease behind
the knee where those nasty jokers like to dig in...then spray your
shoes (boots are 
			really recommended) and pants legs liberally with Honey Guy® Flea and Tick Spray.  Doesn't hurt to put some spray around the belt line too.






If you have already been bitten, use Honey Guy® WaterblockerÔ Skin Cream or Beeswax Bandage liberally over the bite.  This will stop the itch and smother the little devil to death.

	Above: 3rd Generation beekeeper, Don Johnson and grandson Samson Grunwald working the bees at Johnson's Bee Farm in East Texas.





	OUR STORY by Don Johnson



	The story began when my father, Ralph Johnson was a young boy in Missouri. He learned to keep bees with his father in the 1920's. Actually they did more "robbing" than "keeping" as they would follow bees from their water source into the forest and find their hives. Then, with little more protection than a thin veil, they would proceed to rob these wild bees. Sometimes they would capture the hives and put them in makeshift boxes they could more easily work with. With time and circumstance my father stopped beekeeping but never forgot the fun and entertainment the bees afforded him. In 1989, at age 70 he decided to start keeping bees again. At first he just had a few hives but then, in 1993, my brother Jim joined him in a big way! Jim bought over 100 hive boxes and stocked them with new bees. The two of them were instantly overwhelmed by the size of the operation. It was at this time that I joined them in their new "Hobby".

	Together, we worked our hives, during a time when, it seems, Pandora's Box was opened and every possible problem bees could have was poured out upon our bees. Of course, we were not the only beekeepers affected - the entire United States beekeeping industry suffered during the mid-late nineties. In fact the entire "wild" honeybee population in the US was virtually wiped out by the "Varroa" mite. Only the domesticated honeybee survived with much effort on the part of Professional and Hobbyist beekeepers.

	But survive we and our bees did, and we produced a lot of honey, selling most of it wholesale to local health food stores and road-side vegetable stands under the name "Johnson's Honey". Our East Texas Wildflower Honey is among the best for health purposes because of it's high pollen content and because we do not destroy it's healthful qualities by heating. Using only coarse filtering, our honey is the next best thing to having your own beehive in your backyard!

	Now, it should be mentioned that selling honey at wholesale prices is a losing proposition unless you have very large numbers of hives - say a minimum of 500! By year 2000 it was clear to me that retailing was the only way to make a profit with our honeybees. And not only honey but also another product I had been experimenting with for several years - Beeswax Skin Cream. 

	I had heard that in frontier days beekeepers used beeswax for a myriad of purposes including making an effective skin cream. On one occasion I observed another beekeeper making a beeswax cream and I became interested in the process. Working in my basement, I experimented with age-old methods of making beeswax cream. The basic steps were simple but there are literally an infinite number of variations! I wanted a cream that was enjoyable to feel (silky smooth), healthful to wear and completely natural. I settled on a light weight version of beeswax cream with enough beeswax to produced the desired effects on the skin but not too heavy that it would not absorb readily.

	The light weight version is silky smooth, absorbs quickly, seals the skin from water and any other exterior antagonist. It helps to moisturize the skin and promotes healing of rough, dry skin - hands, heals, face, etc. It lasts much longer when exposed to water the regular skin creams because it is not water soluble - one application is usually enough for all day!!. It protects the skin and lips from chapping and cracking in cold and wet winter conditions. As a bonus it has the ability to relieve the discomfort of most irritated skin conditions - mosquito bites, fire ant bites, eczema, psoriasis, hives, poison ivy, oak and sumac, even bee stings!

	As mentioned earlier, retailing is the best way for a small beekeeping operation to make a profit. Having a regular full time job, I began searching for a way to sell our products on the weekends. In June of 2000 I began to sell locally at 'THE MARKET at Cedar Creek Lake', an open air farmer's market and outlet for handmade goods in Seven Points, Texas which was operated by Ms. Ardy Stuart.  The Beeswax Skin Cream instantly became the best seller at The Market, with customers coming back for more and even with repeat orders coming in by phone and fax. Often visitors would come to the market after being referred by friends. They would ask "Where is 'the Honey guy' that has that wonderful beeswax skin cream?" and that was the start of Honey Guy. Customers would tell us they found our cream useful for dry itchy skin, rashes, insect bites, diaper rash, and persistent dry skin conditions. They called it a "miracle cream." I don't make any medical claims concerning beeswax skin cream; however, science is proving that beeswax and most other products of the hive DO have many healthful qualities. And being completely natural, my new Waterblocker Skin Cream had none of the preservative chemicals that cause painful reactions to the skin of so many people.

	The immediate success of our Waterblocker Skin Cream in particular, and the repeat business it brought, convinced us of the need to set up a Website to make our products available to the World Wide Market and to facilitate those customers who wanted to be able to quickly order and re-order our products. To that end, I retained Ms. Ardy Stuart (a lady of many talents) to design my first website. As a result, Honey Guy has shipped many products - Waterblocker Skin Cream in particular - all over the USA and to many different countries including Ecuador, Ireland, Spain and Mexico, England and Canada.

	With the aid of Ardy's marketing expertise, our Honey Guy line of products has expanded from the initial two - East Texas Honey and Beeswax Skin Cream - to include flavored honeys, creamed honey, honey-butter, fruit 'n honey, old-time beeswax furniture polish, bars of pure beeswax and unique gift baskets which include various combinations of my products. But Waterblocker Skin Cream remains the king-pin of our products. 

	Ms. Stuart - now my Queen Bee, Mrs. Johnson - and I teamed up in the summer of 2001 to operate a joint booth at the world famous Canton First Monday Trade Days in Canton, Texas. We attended this  event monthly and participated in dozens of other shows all over the United States until December 2015 when we decided we would no longer participate in road shows of any kind but would, instead, concentrate on producing and shipping our products to our many wholesale and retail customers.

                  This waterblocker product is an excellent natural skin protector safe for anyone to use.  I use it for my dogs feet pads as well.  Chicago weather can also take a toll on the hands, I have sensitive skin and this cream protects my hands all day.  I apply in the morning and at night.  My hands and wrists have shown a huge improvement.  No cracks or chafing.  Does not contain any overpowering perfumes as well; just a natural subtle sweet fragrance.  Very nice.  Thanks Honey Guy for providing this excellent product.

Tough Guy Hand Cleaner
ALL-NATURAL INDUSTRIAL HAND SOAP
CLEANS AND CONDITIONS TOUGH, DRY, DAMAGED HANDS 

Tough Guy is a concentrated, water-based hand cleaner formulated to clean the toughest grease and grime while at the same time promoting healthy skin care. Tough Guy liquefies to remove stubborn industrial soils, grease, oil, tar, ink, paint and more.
How Does It Work?
The secret behind Tough Guy is that it's made from crushed almond shells!
The crushed almond shells give Tough Guy the cleaning power of pumice. However, unlike pumice which can dry out your skin, the rich oils that naturally occur in almonds baby your skin making it smooth, soft, supple and pliant.
What's more, Tough Guy is not just another "green" product – it's REALLY environmentally friendly. Think about it... Normally these almond shells, which are the by-product of commercial nut packing factories, would go straight to a landfill. With Tough Guy, this valuable resource is captured and converted into a product fine enough for a 5-star resort or spa, but at a price that's mere pennies per use.
FREE DISPENSER with your first purchase of a 120 oz. refill / container.
DIRECTIONS
Apply to hands. Spread over knuckles, palms and fingers. Then add a small amount of water and lather. Rinse thoroughly with water.
or
Wet hands and then apply Tough Guy, spreading the product over knuckles, palms and fingers. Work into a lather and rinse thoroughly with water.

 






Available in a 16 oz. squeeze bottle as well as the 120 oz. industrial dispenser and refill.

The Best Hand Lotion for Men – Check out Our TOP 5!














































Skin Care For Men ExplainedSkin Care Advice and Product Reviews For MenThe Best Hand Lotion for Men – Our TOP 5!

No matter what you do as a guy your hands are always going to be front and centre. So what better reason to take as good a care of them as you can with the best hand lotion for men.
Although guys are generally known for their rough and tough hands, using mens hand lotion does not mean you have to end up with “girly hands”.
Keep Your Hands Looking Manly
In fact, taking care of the skin on your hands with an appropriate mens hand cream may actually mean that your hands continue to look like “man hands” free of cracks, redness and other irritations that aren’t necessarily particularly manly.
Avoid ‘Dirty Looking’ Hands
People also often dissociate rough and damaged hands with being ‘dirty’. And although this is quite often not the case, why take the risk on even letting people subconsciously think this about you and your hands.
Hand Lotion Keeps Your Hands in Healthy Condition
The best hand lotion for men will work with the natural oils and texture of your skin to repair damaged skin cells and hydrate your hands while not leaving them overly greasy.
This can help to heal cracked and dry skin while also evening out the skin tone of your hands.
And let’s face it healthy looking hands are a lot more appealing than ones covered in red, blotchy and possibly even flaky skin.
Picking the best hand moisturizer for men
Although using a more general man’s moisturizer on your hands is better than using nothing, you’re going to see far greater results if you use a specific mens hand lotion.
This is because the skin on the hands tends to be tougher than the skin on other parts of your body.
Also as your hands are more exposed to general use they are perhaps more likely to also suffer the effects of this.
This means they are likely going to need something a bit more intense to keep them in their best condition.
Pick a Hand Lotion Suited to Your Skin
By choosing a really good hand lotion for men rather than a general moisturiser, you will also give yourself the opportunity to pick something that is particularly suited to the skin type of your hands.
You will also be able to pick a lotion that will help deal with any specific skin issues that you may suffer from on just your hands (e.g. over dryness blotchy skin tone, etc).
The Daily Effects of Hand Washing
Even if you don’t spend a lot of your time outside for work or recreation, your hands can still take a pounding just from the daily effects of hand washing.
Although some of the standard hand soaps you find these days are definitely getting better, unless you use a specifc soap formulated for men, for we all know the drying and irritating effect the ordinary hand soaps can still have on your hands over the course of the day.
Even if for nothing else, using a mens hand lotion to provide your hands some relief from these effects of washing is well worth it. And if this is a particular concern for you, there are even some hand lotions you can find that will be particularly more resistant to lot of ongoing contact with water.
Guard Against Sun Damage
If you think about it, your hands are probably the one part of your body, even more than your face, that is the most exposed on a daily basis to the damaging effects of the sun.
This is another area where hand lotion for men can also be of benefit.
You can in fact get mens hand lotion that will provide some protection against the sun’s harmful rays.

Not only will this help to guard against skin cancer, but can also work to combat the harsh drying effects that prolonged exposure to the sun can have on your hands.
Product Reviews
Jack Black Industrial Strength Hand Healer
As the name suggests this powerful product from jack black is particularly great at looking after hands that have taken a beating. Whether it’s from the effects of your job or your hobbies or even if you just suffer from particularly dry skin, this mens hand cream could be the extra help you’ve been looking for. With some great ingredients like macadamia oil this product gets rave reviews from users for its healing and moisturising abilities while not leaving your hands over greasy.
+++
Vaseline for Men Hand Lotion, Extra Strength
Vaseline has got a great pedigree for turning out very skin friendly and dependable products. Sitting at a very reasonable price point in the market this particular mens hand lotion certainly doesn’t disappoint. With great skin repair and moisturising properties as well as a masculine but not overbearing smell, this is definitely up there if you’re looking for the best hand moisturizer for men.
O’Keeffe’s Working Hands Cream
This supercharged mens hand cream is particularly formulated for those guys who really give their hands a thrashing. This handcream prides its self on repairing and looking after hands that take a beating day in and day out. Designed to be odourless this handcream is perhaps one of the best choices for men who work a lot with their hands and just want to look after them without any unnecessary bells and whistles.
+++

Nivea For Men Maximum Hydration Nourishing Lotion for Dry Skin
Although this product from Nivea is billed as a three in one product (hands, body and face), it will still do a fantastic job of just looking after hands particularly if your hands are otherwise generally in pretty good shape. If however you have particularly dry or damaged skin you might want to consider a hand lotion more specifically formulated for just the hands.
+++
+++
Burt’s Bees Hand Salve
Burt’s Bees Hand Slave is definitely aimed at those guys who have more damaged or harder to repair skin on their hands. And although it does a great job at this, it’s perhaps not going to be best if you’re after something a bit more subtle. Users note that it does have quite a pronounced eucalyptus aroma which although definitely manly, may not suit those of us guys who prefer less scented skin care products. Because of its bees wax base some users do note it can also be a bit greasy after use. However what is particularly great about this product is its focus on more natural ingredients. So if you are someone who tries to find more organic or herbal based products for your skin, this could be just what you’re after.
Best Hand Lotion for Men
Hand lotion definitely deserves a place in every man’s skin care regime alongside other staples such as daily body wash and top quality face wash. If you’re not using it already you should definitely consider adding the best hand lotion for men to your daily skin care routine!

Honey Guy Products produces East Texas Wildflower Honey.  We operate bee hives on our farm and on other East Texas farms and ranches, producing natural, unprocessed RAW honey.  Our bees work many different types of wildflowers to produce a flavorful, darker honey loaded with healthy pollens.  Excellent for use with allergies - even if the user is NOT LOCAL to East Texas.  Researchers agree that WILDFLOWER honey which has many pollens is better for allergies than a local honey which may often include only one pollen.  Honey Guy Products also produces natural beeswax skin creams. Our flagship product is Water Blocker Skin Cream.  It is great for dry, cracked, split hands and feet.  It is also WATERPROOF, protecting hands exposed to water, antiseptic soaps, grease, dirt and chemicals during the work day.  It penetrates the skin quickly so it is NOT sticky or greasy and it has no scent other than natural beeswax.  Because it is waterproof, it lasts all day for most people - doctors, nurses, beauticians, florists, etc.,  who are in water all day find Waterblocker Skin Cream very effective for all-day protection against drying, cracking and raw hands.  It is safe for use on children, for diaper rash.  It also STOPS itch, burn and sting!  Natural antihistamines in beeswax will stop itching, burning amd stinging from insect bites, plant born allergies (poison ivy) and from burns (sunburn, burns from fire and hot objects, even chemical burns).  Use Water Blocker on animals as well for hot spots that itch, dry, cracked pads, and to treat injuries that won't heal because the animal won't stop licking or chewing.  Waterblocker stops the discomfort so the animal will leave the wound alone and it seals and protects the injury.We make another great cream using Waterblocker Skin Cream as the base and adding the natural insect repellent CITRONELLA.  Our trade-marked name is Bite Free Skin Cream.  The Citronella is cosmetic grade and is safe for use on anyone - adults, children and animals.  Because the citronella is embedded in our waterproof cream, it lasts all day - even when swimming or sweating!For people who are prone to nicks and scrapes or who take medicine which causes them to bleed easily, we make a heavy beeswax cream called Beeswax Bandage.  It is heavy enough to seal off a minor bleeding wound and will stay on in awkward places where a bandage may not.  It can also be used where a really heavy barrier is needed to protect the skin - concrete workers, etc.

I first picked up Honey Guy Waterblocker at the Dallas Quilt Show in 2009.
