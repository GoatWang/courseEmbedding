Artist's Statement

Snake oil and sideshows are normal to me.  My father’s family was involved in early 20th Century Coney Island; my grandfather was acting battalion chief of the Coney Island District and Uncles Harry and Guy were at Dreamland the night of the fire. My Uncle Lester and my father worked at the  Dreamland Circus Sideshow in the 1920’s.
Coney is so peopled with ghosts and memories, there is no place in Coney Island that is totally mine, except for Coney Island USA.  
That not for profit arts center is a haven where both sides of my life can co exist – the academic and the sideshow.  It is the only place in the earth where I feel back at home, with my relatives (deceased) gathered around.  Coney Island USA lets me paint as much as I want.  Making the corner of West 12th and Surf beautiful is a testament to my family, and a challenge to my present as an artist.

Born in Brooklyn, lives and works in Brooklyn. Studied painting & drawing at CUNY: BA Brooklyn College & MFA Queens College.
Exhibiting since the 1980's.

You gotta love the design.....


      This radio looks amazing which , I have to say, was the first reason for choosing it.However, being a Roberts Radio it was really a no brainer .

It is much smaller than anticipated but that is no bad thing - it is small but perfectly formed. 
I love the styling and the sound is great. Love it way more than my previous RD60 :-)

Lovely Radio


      Absolutely brilliant radio. Was concerned about the black looking too heavy and dark, but it doesn't look as dark in real life.

Very easy to set up. Sound is great.

There is a "favorites" button, but you can only save one station to this button. However, this is not an issue as there is a button that allows you to 'love' certain stations, so that when this button is pressed, you are only scrolling through your 'loved' stations and not through the whole selection of about 30 stations!
