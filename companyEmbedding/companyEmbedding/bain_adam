Twitter COO Adam Bain is stepping down and being replaced by CFO Anthony Noto

Twitter's Adam Bain




Twitter chief operating officer Adam Bain is stepping down in the latest shake-up at the troubled internet company.
Twitter CFO Anthony Noto will replace Bain, who Twitter said is leaving to¬†"explore¬†opportunities outside the company."
The departure of Bain, who was once on the shortlist to be Twitter‚Äôs CEO, leaves Twitter without one of the online ad industry‚Äôs most respected execs at a time when the company is facing mounting pressure to increase its revenue.
And the move¬†elevates Noto to the most powerful¬†figure inside the company after Jack Dorsey, whose time is divided between CEO jobs leading Twitter and online payments company Square.
Noto will relinquish his duties overseeing Twitter's finances and will take over all of the company's revenue-generating products and business partnerships.¬†Twitter is looking for a new CFO to replace Noto, the company said,¬†
Shares of Twitter, which announced plans to cut hundreds of jobs last month, slid as much as¬†4% in after hours trading on Wednesday.

No compete and no severance

"After 6 years and a once-in-a-lifetime run, I let Jack know that I am ready to change gears and do something new outside the company," Bain said in a tweet.
Bain notified Twitter of his decision to leave on November 7, accoring to the company. And he has agreed not to work for competitors such as Facebook, the New York Times reported.
Bain will not get any severance compensation as he is leaving of his own accord, a Twitter spokesperson told Business Insider.
The executive shuffle is the latest chapter in Twitter's¬†tumultuous history, which has included a string of CEO changes and seemingly constant infighting among the founders. And it consolidates the 48-year old Noto's power at the company.
A former Wall Street banker and ex-Army Ranger, Noto joined Twitter in 2014 and quickly caused ripples internally with a lavish, $73 million compensation¬†package¬†that was out of step with the company's past pay practices.
Noto has increasingly expanded his role beyond finance, spearheading the company's recent¬†push into live video of sporting events like the deal with the NFL. But with Twitter's user growth stuck in the mud and speculation swirling that the company could be acquired, Noto will now have to prove he can revitalize the company. Or find someone to buy it.



			Can't tell you how much I will miss U my friend.  Couldn't imagine that last 3 yrs w/out U. U have had a tremendous impact on Twitter TY üôè https://t.co/GqRUvNGhv6 ‚Äî Anthony Noto  (@anthonynoto) November 9, 2016



Bain was instrumental in building Twitter's advertising business, and his departure comes after the company shut down Vine and laid off 9% of its workforce last month in an effort to cut costs and work toward profitability in 2017.
"Since joining Twitter in 2010, Adam has built an amazing team and a global business from the ground up," Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said in a statement. "I'm grateful to Adam for everything he's done for Twitter, and for his leadership and friendship over the years. I can't wait to see what he does next!"
Here are Bain's tweets announcing his departure:

        LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORESAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî Adam Bain has 75,000 followers on Twitter, but that doesn't begin to describe his following.He's so well-liked inside Twitter headquarters that the hashtag #AdamBainIsSoNice¬†recently trended on the social media service.Bain,¬†the company's president¬†of global revenue and partnerships, is just as popular in the worlds of advertising, media, sports and entertainment, where he has connections that are the envy of the tech industry."He's like Sara Lee. Nobody doesn't like Adam Bain," said Michael Kassan, founder and CEO¬†of¬†advisory firm¬†MediaLink, which¬†acts as a consultant to many tech companies including Twitter.Bain, who hailed from News Corp.'s Fox Sports and Fox Interactive Media unit, joined Twitter in 2010, when it had a small sales team and¬†few ad products. On his watch, Twitter increased revenues from $28.3 million in 2010 to more than $1.4 billion in 2014 and is expected to surpass $2 billion this year.But¬†now that revenue growth rates are slowing ‚Äî¬†in July,¬†Twitter reported its smallest quarterly revenue growth as a publicly traded company ‚Äî¬†user growth has stalled and the stock (TWTR) is flirting with historic lows, pressure on Bain is growing."The single biggest reason why Adam Bain is important to Twitter is because he has been able to keep the revenue stream going even in the face of all of Twitter's challenges," says Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at research firm¬†eMarketer.And that puts Bain in contention for a more prominent role. He and founder Jack Dorsey¬†are front-runners to be the new CEO of Twitter following previous CEO Dick Costolo's departure earlier this summer.Dorsey is filling the position temporarily during a¬†search that is looking inside and outside of Twitter. (Another possibility being floated: Bain will be promoted to president and chief operating officer under¬†Dorsey.)The knock on Bain: He's not a founder and he¬†may be too nice to¬†challenge Dorsey for the top job. Another concern on Wall Street:¬†He may have the makings of a CEO, but he¬†has no CEO experience, which could be a major challenge as¬†Twitter faces¬†an increasingly uncertain future.The San Francisco company said last month that 316 million people signed in to use the service at least once a month during the second quarter, making it one-fifth the size of rival Facebook, which has nearly 1.5 billion users.Twitter beat Wall Street estimates with¬†$502 million in second-quarter revenue, a 61% year-over-year jump. That¬†followed¬†an unexpected revenue¬†shortfall when Twitter blew Wall Street's and its own projections. Twitter has yet to post a profit."We know Adam Bain can build an ad business. But does that mean he can build a company?" Williamson said. "It's a good question to ask."For now, Bain isn't speaking publicly about it."From my perspective, I'm doing the one thing that I know how to do, which is scale the revenue for the company," he recently told CNBC.That's the kind of grounded¬†response people who know Bain expect.¬†The 41-year-old executive¬†gives¬†conflict and controversy a wide berth.A¬†happy-go-lucky workaholic who barely sleeps at night, he cranks¬†out emails at 3 a.m. On his Twitter profile he describes himself as "dad of 2 under 7, insomniac."Bain oversees more than half of Twitter's 4,100-strong¬†workforce while¬†crisscrossing¬†the country each year in a quest to spread the Twitter gospel, hopping red eyes and pulling all-nighters with the vigor of a college kid."He isn't human when it comes to being able to go with minimal sleep," says Ravi Narasimhan, who worked with Bain at Fox and at Twitter, and now works at Google.¬†(Photo: Jeff Chiu, Associated Press)The relentlessly energetic¬†Bain can't sleep because "his mind is always active," says Chris Blandy, Fox Networks Group's executive vice president of technology solutions. "He's always searching for something new and interesting."At Fox Sports, where he was vice president of production and development,¬†Bain¬†teamed with Blandy¬†to broadcast one of the first webcasts of a college football game after¬†the networks passed on it. They also experimented with ways to deliver novel digital experiences, such as¬†creating online games that used¬†live pitch data from Major League Baseball so that people could try to hit the same pitch they had just seen thrown¬†on the television broadcast."We did a lot of out-of-the-box thinking, taking advantage of stuff in the broadcast and coming up with digital manifestations of it," Blandy says. "Every day was a brainstorming session with him."That pluck caught the attention of the News Corp.¬†honchos who tapped Bain to become executive vice president of product and technology at¬†Fox Interactive Media, which spearheaded the acquisitions of MySpace and IGN.While overseeing the technology used across News Corp.'s portfolio of companies, Bain developed¬†one of the first hyper-targeted¬†ad technologies¬†by buying¬†Narasimhan's¬†company Strategic Data Corp.Narasimhan recalls Bain demonstrating the volume of data MySpace had gathered from people's profiles. Realizing it was an abstract concept for people to grasp, Bain would go into presentations with a couple hundred-thousand shotgun pellets, each representing 1,000 data points. He'd have the audience close their¬†eyes while he poured the pellets into a massive tin bucket."With the sound of all those pellets falling into the bucket, I can't tell you how quickly the whole audience grokked that this was a lot,"¬†Narasimhan said.In 2009, Twitter had privately¬†set the goal of reaching more than $1 billion in annual revenue, but had done little in the way of building an advertising business. Most of the major brands were on Twitter, but they were not paying to be there.¬†(Photo: USATODAY.com)When Twitter began heavily courting him,¬†Bain was president of the Fox Audience Network, running a division that included¬†one of the Web's largest advertising platforms and a team that made money from News Corp.'s Web properties and third-party online publishers.Bain met Dick Costolo in 2007 when he tried to¬†buy Costolo's former company Feedburner, but Google snapped it up. Nonetheless, Bain stayed close to Costolo. In early 2010, Costolo, Twitter's CEO, sought out Bain to get¬†advice on how Twitter could make money.Bain was intrigued by the idea of building advertising that was not in-your-face banner ads but something native to the Twitter experience. Yet he¬†was reluctant to uproot his family from Los Angeles. He¬†had just bought a new house and had a¬†second child.Twitter was persistent and ultimately¬†persuasive. The day Bain¬†was handed¬†the keys to the new¬†house was the same day he accepted the job.¬†On his first day working for Twitter in September 2010,¬†he was told he had three days to present his plan to the board of directors for turning hashtags into dollars. He had fewer than a dozen people¬†on his staff and close to zero revenue.Bain presented two options: traditional banner ads that¬†would take off quickly, or a slower path, which was developing a¬†new, more user-friendly form of advertising, called promoted tweets, where marketers pay to have their tweets shown to users. The board seized on the latter.Twitter hits 52-week low on warning turnaround will take timeWith his family still in L.A., Bain fell into the rhythm of long-distance commuting¬†for six months, rousing¬†himself at 4 a.m. on Mondays to head to¬†San Francisco, where he lived out of a hotel all week. He flew home Friday nights. He also embarked on¬†a listening tour of 140 chief marketing officers of major corporations in 140 days to sell advertisers on Twitter.That year, a group of Unilever executives traveled to Silicon Valley to sit down with the likes of Facebook and Google. Twitter was not on the dance card of one of the world's largest advertisers.¬†So Bain hit a Unilever¬†luncheon, "bouncing around like a jumping bean," spending 15 minutes at each table to pitch all of the executives, Kassan recalls."He didn't have 140 characters. He had 140 seconds to tell the Twitter story and he did," Kassan said. "That was five years ago. He's nobody's speed dater anymore."Bain leads Twitter's business efforts around the globe.¬†He cuts deals with mobile carriers, cable companies, app stores, game consoles and wearable companies. He's also responsible for the company's strategic relationships with technology giants such as Apple, Samsung, Microsoft and, importantly, Google. Earlier this year Twitter cinched a deal to give Google access to its stream of data, making it easier for tweets to appear in search results.¬†(Photo: Twitter)But Bain's¬†main achievement is the company's advertising business.¬†Twitter now can place ads on Twitter and off Twitter, serving as a middle man to match advertisers with ad space on other mobile apps.¬†Its mobile ad business accounted for 88% of ad revenue in the second quarter.¬†Twitter is also¬†very focused on small- and medium-sized businesses, which has emerged as its¬†fastest-growing business line."He knows what advertisers want and he knows how to deliver what advertisers want. And that is what he has been doing in a steady way throughout everything swirling around Twitter," Williamson¬†says. "Ad revenue is still growing. Advertisers are still very intrigued about what they can do on Twitter."Bain was instrumental in closing the National Football League‚Äôs recent multi-year deal with Twitter, as well as¬†acquisitions of TellApart, mobile ad exchange MoPub and others.Part of his secret: Bain positions Twitter as a collaborator, not a competitor.When Kobe Bryant visited the company's offices, Bain showed off¬†NBA game clips on Twitter courtesy of Twitter's Amplify business, which lets Twitter sell ads with media partners. Bryant asked how many hundreds of millions of dollars those clips cost and¬†Bain explained that Twitter did not pay to license the content; instead it split the ad revenue with the NBA."Kobe's head exploded," recalls longtime Twitter investor Chris Sacca. "Adam personally knows all of the big sports leagues, he cherishes the fans who want to watch that stuff, and he is loved by the advertisers who want to be in front of those users.¬†Each constituency feels they have a friend in Adam. So he can build products and do deals that no one else can."A key constituent is Dorsey, Twitter's chairman. Even before Dorsey took on the interim CEO role,¬†Bain met with him each week¬†to discuss the state of the company's business, product direction and its future.¬†(Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images)But the constituency Bain¬†knows perhaps best of all are¬†the people who work for him.People close to him say he's laser focused on building culture inside Twitter and it has paid off. His team has some of the¬†lowest churn in the company and his management team¬†has been stable for five years. He¬†has recruited¬†executives¬†from Google, YouTube and¬†Facebook, even some CEOs, including Nathan Hubbard from Ticketmaster.A big part of retaining people amid the Silicon Valley talent wars is¬†getting them to believe¬†they are part of a larger mission.¬† One of his mantras to his team:¬†"Build the business in a way that makes us proud.""He inspires people.¬†He makes people be willing to walk through the valley of¬†the shadow of death. He makes them willing to take risks," says Hollywood producer Peter Guber, the onetime CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment and co-owner of the Golden State Warriors, who is a mentor to Bain. "They don't feel like they are being punished. They feel like they are being rewarded for it."Each year Bain¬†puts on¬†a sales¬†conference and includes Kevin Weil, who runs product, and¬†Alex Roetter, who runs engineering, so that it's an opportunity for the whole company to¬†create a shared vision.That's unusual¬†in an industry that prizes engineers and¬†sometimes treats business people as second-class citizens. Google founder¬†Larry Page famously referred to his sales team as "collectors,"¬†as in "they collect the money for Google."Bain held the first¬†conference in 2010 when the business team had fewer than 30 people. It took place¬†in Twitter's lunchroom, the only space big enough at the time, and Bain put up a divider so the rest of the company could get lunch during the program.¬†This year, Twitter rented out the¬†Bill Graham Auditorium in San Francisco..He¬†is famous for his stunts at these conferences. This year, to mock the use of flames¬†in sales presentations, he used real pyrotechnics.Astronaut @Cmdr_Hadfield visited the Twoffice today! Hint: He's NOT the guy in the space suit. CC @adambainpic.twitter.com/mQlkaFtQSf‚Äî Michael Sabes (@MikeSabes) July 27, 2013In 2013, he¬†walked on stage in a space¬†suit with a tinted visor and sporting a fake bushy¬†mustache.
