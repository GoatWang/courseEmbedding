						 from   Glacier Peak U.S. Value Fund, L.P. 











 
















































 

 




















 


BELLEVUE, Wash., Dec. 9, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Glacier Peak U.S. Value Fund, L.P. ("Glacier Peak" and, together with its affiliates and director nominees, the "Concerned Shareholders of VOLT" or "CSV"), a long term shareholder of Volt Information Sciences, Inc. (NYSE MKT: VISI) ("Volt" or the "Company"), has nominated four highly qualified director candidates for election to the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") at Volt's 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "2015 Annual Meeting").  Citing the continued underperformance of the Company, poor shareholder returns, poor corporate governance practices, and a desperate need for fresh perspectives on the Board, the Concerned Shareholders of Volt believe that Volt shareholders should be given the opportunity to vote for new directors whose interests are fully aligned with all shareholders.  The Concerned Shareholders of Volt beneficially own, in the aggregate, 2,189,876 shares of the Company's common stock and hold an irrevocable proxy over an additional 2,472,130 shares, constituting approximately 22.3% of Volt's outstanding common stock.  
The Concerned Shareholders of Volt believe adding new talent to the Board is necessary to maximize shareholder value and improve corporate governance.  CSV believes that the addition of four highly experienced and successful business executives as well as direct shareholder representation will bring much needed focus and discipline to the Company.  It is CSV's intention to drive consensus with the remaining Board members and management to create and implement a winning strategy that will position Volt to produce long-term, superior returns to its shareholders.
CSV calls on the incumbent Board to not take actions adverse to the best interests of Volt shareholders prior to the 2015 Annual Meeting, including: 

Implementing a poison pill, 
Delaying the 2015 Annual Meeting beyond Spring 2015, 
Selling all or parts of the Company, 
Making material acquisitions, or 
Issuing equity or equity-linked securities.
The Concerned Shareholders of Volt remind each of the incumbent Board members that actions they take that are adverse to the best interests of shareholders and that impair shareholder value can result in personal liability.   
In the past few months, Glacier Peak has clearly expressed its views to the Board and management of Volt and has made every effort to engage in constructive discussions that would lead to meaningful improvement in the Board without the need for a proxy contest.  Glacier Peak believes the suggestions it has made would meaningfully improve shareholder rights and representation at Volt.  Unfortunately, to date, the Company has rejected all suggestions made by Glacier Peak.
Accordingly, the Concerned Shareholders of Volt have nominated Anthony Bergamo, James E. Boone, Charles M. Gillman and John C. Rudolf for election to the Board.  
Anthony Bergamo has held various positions with MB Real Estate, a property development and management company based in New York City and Chicago, since April 1996, including his current position as Vice Chairman since May 2003. He has also served as the Chief Executive Officer of Niagara Falls Redevelopment, LLC, a real estate development company, since August 1998. Mr. Bergamo previously served as Managing Director with Milstein Hotel Group, a hotel operator, from April 1996 until May 2013. Mr. Bergamo currently serves on the board of directors of ModusLink Global Solutions Inc., a NASDAQ company providing customized supply chain management services to the world's leading high technology companies, since December 2013, and Steel Partners Holdings L.P., a global diversified holding company that engages in multiple businesses through consolidated subsidiaries, associated companies and other interests and has significant interests in leading companies in various industries, since 2009.  He has also been a director since 1995, a Trustee since 1986 and currently is Chairman of the Audit Committee and a member of the Executive and Compensation Committees of Dime Community Bancorp, a NASDAQ listed bank with $4.2 billion in assets.  Mr. Bergamo's broad experience as chief executive officer and operating officer of public and private companies and his more than sixteen years of service on boards of public companies and various public service organizations make him very well qualified to serve on the Board.
James E. Boone has served as an independent executive management consultant since January 2014 and has managed his personal investments since January 2013.  From June 2011 to December 2012, Mr. Boone served as an advisor to the Chief Executive Officer of Volt and President and Chief Executive Officer of ProcureStaff Technologies, Ltd., a separate business unit of Volt providing specialized software applications to streamline and manage temporary staffing, project work, consultants and other human capital services globally.  From January 2009 to June 2011, Mr. Boone served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Impellam Group PLC, North America ("Impellam Group").  Impellam Group provides comprehensive human capital solutions for workforce needs globally.  From 2003 to January 2009, Mr. Boone served as a Managing Partner of Windship Partners, LLC, a senior level executive search firm that he founded, which merged in 2007 with Nosal Partners, LLC and became rebranded as NGS Global Americas, LLC in 2014.  Mr. Boone's extensive executive experience and background working with staffing and executive search firms, including Volt, make him very well qualified to serve on the Board.
Charles M. Gillman is the Executive Managing Director of the IDWR Multi-Family Office ("IDWR"), a multi-family investment firm, a position he has held since June 2013.  IDWR employs a team of analysts with expertise in finding publicly traded companies that require operational enhancement and an improvement in corporate capital allocation. From June 2001 to June 2013, Mr. Gillman was a portfolio manager of certain family office investment portfolios at Nadel and Gussman, LLC.  Prior to his employment at Nadel and Gussman, Mr. Gillman worked in the investment industry and as a strategic management consultant at McKinsey & Company.  Mr. Gillman has served as a director of Digirad Corporation, a diagnostic imaging solutions company, since April 2012, On Track Innovations, Inc., a provider of cashless payment salutations, since December 2012, and PMFG, Inc., a provider of energy delivery systems and products, since July 2014.  Mr. Gillman brings significant experience as a successful portfolio manager and experience implementing difficult corporate turnarounds, including M&A experience and divestiture experience. These experiences allow him to offer unique insight into a company's operations for the purpose of guiding the company to the right short-term and long-term strategic decisions designed to maximize shareholder value.
John C. Rudolf currently serves as President and Senior Portfolio Manager of Glacier Peak Capital LLC, a registered investment advisory firm he founded in July 2012, focusing on managing Glacier Peak, originally called Summit Capital Partners, L.P. which he founded in 1984 and the Glacier Peak Global Value Fund which he founded in October 2007.  From April 1996 until July 2012, Mr. Rudolf served as a Managing Member and founder of Summit Capital Group, an independent registered investment advisory firm managing individual accounts and several private investment funds.  From 1975 until 1996, Mr. Rudolf served in various positions at Oppenheimer & Co., Inc., including partner in charge of Oppenheimer's Pacific Northwest operations from 1988 until 1996.  Mr. Rudolf has served on the board of directors of Detrex Corporation, a leading manufacturer of high performance specialty chemicals including additives for industrial petroleum products and high purity hydrochloric acid, since November 2012.  Mr. Rudolf's substantial investing experience in a broad range of businesses, including the Company, make him very well qualified to sit on the Board. 
The Concerned Shareholders of Volt are open to continuing discussions with the Board regarding its composition and corporate strategy, and remain amenable to reaching a mutually agreeable resolution to re-constitute the Board in a manner that is in the best interests of all shareholders. However, if an agreement is not reached, the Concerned Shareholders of Volt are fully prepared to solicit the support of their fellow shareholders to elect a new slate of directors at the 2015 Annual Meeting who are committed to representing the best interests of all Volt shareholders.
CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING PARTICIPANTS
Glacier Peak, together with the participants named herein, intend to file a preliminary proxy statement and accompanying proxy card with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to be used to solicit votes for the election of their slate of four highly-qualified director nominees at the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders of Volt Information Sciences, Inc., a New York corporation (the "Company").

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

Rebalancing involves periodically buying and selling the stocks, bonds, cash, or other investments in your portfolio to maintain your original or desired mix of those assets.

footnote*For the 10-year period ended March 31, 2017, 23 of 23 Vanguard balanced funds outperformed their Lipper peer-group averages. Results will vary for other time periods.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
	Vanguard provides services to the Vanguard funds and ETFs at cost.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.

We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

How would index funds fit into your portfolio?

In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Past performance cannot be used to predict future returns. Fund share prices will fluctuate, so investors could lose money if they sell when prices have fallen.
You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through a broker like Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (you may incur commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares aren't redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Like stocks, ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you'll pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.
