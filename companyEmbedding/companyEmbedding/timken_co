Company history[edit]
Further information: Timken Roller Bearing Company
In 1898, Henry Timken obtained a patent for the tapered roller bearing, and in 1899 incorporated as The Timken Roller Bearing Axle Company in St. Louis.
In 1901, the company moved to Canton, Ohio, as the automobile industry began to overtake the carriage industry. Timken and his two sons chose this location because of its proximity to the American car manufacturing centers of Detroit and Cleveland and the American steel-making centers of Pittsburgh and Cleveland.
In 1917, the company began its steel- and tube-making operations in Canton to vertically integrate and maintain better control over the steel used in its bearings. World War I had created an increase in demand for steel, affecting its supply and price in the market.[5]
Some UK steam locomotives also used roller bearings. The LMS Turbomotive was fitted with Timken roller bearings, and they also were retrofitted to some of the LMS Coronation class.[6]
In 2014 the company changed its corporate structure, the roller bearing producing part of the company was separated from the steel producing part of the company, resulting in two separate companies.[7] The Timken Company continues to manufacture roller bearings, while TimkenSteel produces steel.
Company overview[edit]
The Timken Company brands includes Timken, Fafnir, Philadelphia Gear, Interlube and Drives.[7]
Timken is a member of World Bearing Association (WBA), a non-profit and unincorporated industrial association.




British Timken offices and works in Northampton, England in 2001 prior to demolition a few years later.


British Timken[edit]
British Timken was established in Chester Road, Aston, Birmingham in 1937, to manufacture tapered roller, parallel roller and ball bearings.
In World War II a shadow factory was built in 1941 on a green-field site at Duston in Northamptonshire, to produce roller bearings. At its peak over 4,000 people were employed in the factory. In 2002 the Duston works were closed and the site cleared for housing with production moving to Poland.[8][9]
Present-day operations[edit]
In 2003 the company acquired its largest domestic competitor in the bearing business[10]—The Torrington Company of Torrington, Connecticut. In 2007 it acquired the Purdy Corporation of Manchester, Connecticut. Renamed Timken Aerospace Transmissions, it is part of the Timken Aerospace & Defense division headquartered in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Timken operates eight locations in the US and Canada.
The company also manufactured test equipment for various purposes, including properties of lubricating oil. This resulted in the company lending its name to the industry standard Timken OK Load metric.
Timken has been present in India since 1987 and has production facilities in Chennai and Jamshedpur.[11] Additionally, Timken also has an IT support center in Bangalore.[12][13]
Notable partnerships[edit]

A supply agreement for Garlock Klozure oil seals by and bearing isolators.[14]

British Timken was established in Chester Road, Aston, Birmingham in 1937, to manufacture tapered roller, parallel roller and ball bearings.
In World War II a shadow factory was built in 1941 on a green-field site at Duston in Northamptonshire, to produce roller bearings. At its peak over 4,000 people were employed in the factory. In 2002 the Duston works were closed and the site cleared for housing with production moving to Poland.[8][9]
Present-day operations[edit]
In 2003 the company acquired its largest domestic competitor in the bearing business[10]—The Torrington Company of Torrington, Connecticut. In 2007 it acquired the Purdy Corporation of Manchester, Connecticut. Renamed Timken Aerospace Transmissions, it is part of the Timken Aerospace & Defense division headquartered in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Timken operates eight locations in the US and Canada.
The company also manufactured test equipment for various purposes, including properties of lubricating oil. This resulted in the company lending its name to the industry standard Timken OK Load metric.
Timken has been present in India since 1987 and has production facilities in Chennai and Jamshedpur.[11] Additionally, Timken also has an IT support center in Bangalore.[12][13]
Notable partnerships[edit]

A supply agreement for Garlock Klozure oil seals by and bearing isolators.[14]

Company history[edit]
Further information: Timken Roller Bearing Company
In 1898, Henry Timken obtained a patent for the tapered roller bearing, and in 1899 incorporated as The Timken Roller Bearing Axle Company in St. Louis.
In 1901, the company moved to Canton, Ohio, as the automobile industry began to overtake the carriage industry. Timken and his two sons chose this location because of its proximity to the American car manufacturing centers of Detroit and Cleveland and the American steel-making centers of Pittsburgh and Cleveland.
In 1917, the company began its steel- and tube-making operations in Canton to vertically integrate and maintain better control over the steel used in its bearings. World War I had created an increase in demand for steel, affecting its supply and price in the market.[5]
Some UK steam locomotives also used roller bearings. The LMS Turbomotive was fitted with Timken roller bearings, and they also were retrofitted to some of the LMS Coronation class.[6]
In 2014 the company changed its corporate structure, the roller bearing producing part of the company was separated from the steel producing part of the company, resulting in two separate companies.[7] The Timken Company continues to manufacture roller bearings, while TimkenSteel produces steel.
Company overview[edit]
The Timken Company brands includes Timken, Fafnir, Philadelphia Gear, Interlube and Drives.[7]
Timken is a member of World Bearing Association (WBA), a non-profit and unincorporated industrial association.

Timken has been present in India since 1987 and has production facilities in Chennai and Jamshedpur.[11] Additionally, Timken also has an IT support center in Bangalore.[12][13]
Notable partnerships[edit]

A supply agreement for Garlock Klozure oil seals by and bearing isolators.[14]

Company history[edit]
Further information: Timken Roller Bearing Company
In 1898, Henry Timken obtained a patent for the tapered roller bearing, and in 1899 incorporated as The Timken Roller Bearing Axle Company in St. Louis.
In 1901, the company moved to Canton, Ohio, as the automobile industry began to overtake the carriage industry. Timken and his two sons chose this location because of its proximity to the American car manufacturing centers of Detroit and Cleveland and the American steel-making centers of Pittsburgh and Cleveland.
In 1917, the company began its steel- and tube-making operations in Canton to vertically integrate and maintain better control over the steel used in its bearings. World War I had created an increase in demand for steel, affecting its supply and price in the market.[5]
Some UK steam locomotives also used roller bearings. The LMS Turbomotive was fitted with Timken roller bearings, and they also were retrofitted to some of the LMS Coronation class.[6]
In 2014 the company changed its corporate structure, the roller bearing producing part of the company was separated from the steel producing part of the company, resulting in two separate companies.[7] The Timken Company continues to manufacture roller bearings, while TimkenSteel produces steel.
Company overview[edit]
The Timken Company brands includes Timken, Fafnir, Philadelphia Gear, Interlube and Drives.[7]
Timken is a member of World Bearing Association (WBA), a non-profit and unincorporated industrial association.




British Timken offices and works in Northampton, England in 2001 prior to demolition a few years later.


British Timken[edit]
British Timken was established in Chester Road, Aston, Birmingham in 1937, to manufacture tapered roller, parallel roller and ball bearings.
In World War II a shadow factory was built in 1941 on a green-field site at Duston in Northamptonshire, to produce roller bearings. At its peak over 4,000 people were employed in the factory. In 2002 the Duston works were closed and the site cleared for housing with production moving to Poland.[8][9]
Present-day operations[edit]
In 2003 the company acquired its largest domestic competitor in the bearing business[10]—The Torrington Company of Torrington, Connecticut. In 2007 it acquired the Purdy Corporation of Manchester, Connecticut. Renamed Timken Aerospace Transmissions, it is part of the Timken Aerospace & Defense division headquartered in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Timken operates eight locations in the US and Canada.
The company also manufactured test equipment for various purposes, including properties of lubricating oil. This resulted in the company lending its name to the industry standard Timken OK Load metric.
Timken has been present in India since 1987 and has production facilities in Chennai and Jamshedpur.[11] Additionally, Timken also has an IT support center in Bangalore.[12][13]
Notable partnerships[edit]

A supply agreement for Garlock Klozure oil seals by and bearing isolators.[14]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Company history[edit]
Further information: Timken Roller Bearing Company
In 1898, Henry Timken obtained a patent for the tapered roller bearing, and in 1899 incorporated as The Timken Roller Bearing Axle Company in St. Louis.
In 1901, the company moved to Canton, Ohio, as the automobile industry began to overtake the carriage industry. Timken and his two sons chose this location because of its proximity to the American car manufacturing centers of Detroit and Cleveland and the American steel-making centers of Pittsburgh and Cleveland.
In 1917, the company began its steel- and tube-making operations in Canton to vertically integrate and maintain better control over the steel used in its bearings. World War I had created an increase in demand for steel, affecting its supply and price in the market.[5]
Some UK steam locomotives also used roller bearings. The LMS Turbomotive was fitted with Timken roller bearings, and they also were retrofitted to some of the LMS Coronation class.[6]
In 2014 the company changed its corporate structure, the roller bearing producing part of the company was separated from the steel producing part of the company, resulting in two separate companies.[7] The Timken Company continues to manufacture roller bearings, while TimkenSteel produces steel.
Company overview[edit]
The Timken Company brands includes Timken, Fafnir, Philadelphia Gear, Interlube and Drives.[7]
Timken is a member of World Bearing Association (WBA), a non-profit and unincorporated industrial association.




British Timken offices and works in Northampton, England in 2001 prior to demolition a few years later.


British Timken[edit]
British Timken was established in Chester Road, Aston, Birmingham in 1937, to manufacture tapered roller, parallel roller and ball bearings.
In World War II a shadow factory was built in 1941 on a green-field site at Duston in Northamptonshire, to produce roller bearings. At its peak over 4,000 people were employed in the factory. In 2002 the Duston works were closed and the site cleared for housing with production moving to Poland.[8][9]
Present-day operations[edit]
In 2003 the company acquired its largest domestic competitor in the bearing business[10]—The Torrington Company of Torrington, Connecticut. In 2007 it acquired the Purdy Corporation of Manchester, Connecticut. Renamed Timken Aerospace Transmissions, it is part of the Timken Aerospace & Defense division headquartered in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Timken operates eight locations in the US and Canada.
The company also manufactured test equipment for various purposes, including properties of lubricating oil. This resulted in the company lending its name to the industry standard Timken OK Load metric.
Timken has been present in India since 1987 and has production facilities in Chennai and Jamshedpur.[11] Additionally, Timken also has an IT support center in Bangalore.[12][13]
Notable partnerships[edit]

A supply agreement for Garlock Klozure oil seals by and bearing isolators.[14]

Company history[edit]
Further information: Timken Roller Bearing Company
In 1898, Henry Timken obtained a patent for the tapered roller bearing, and in 1899 incorporated as The Timken Roller Bearing Axle Company in St. Louis.
In 1901, the company moved to Canton, Ohio, as the automobile industry began to overtake the carriage industry. Timken and his two sons chose this location because of its proximity to the American car manufacturing centers of Detroit and Cleveland and the American steel-making centers of Pittsburgh and Cleveland.
In 1917, the company began its steel- and tube-making operations in Canton to vertically integrate and maintain better control over the steel used in its bearings. World War I had created an increase in demand for steel, affecting its supply and price in the market.[5]
Some UK steam locomotives also used roller bearings. The LMS Turbomotive was fitted with Timken roller bearings, and they also were retrofitted to some of the LMS Coronation class.[6]
In 2014 the company changed its corporate structure, the roller bearing producing part of the company was separated from the steel producing part of the company, resulting in two separate companies.[7] The Timken Company continues to manufacture roller bearings, while TimkenSteel produces steel.
Company overview[edit]
The Timken Company brands includes Timken, Fafnir, Philadelphia Gear, Interlube and Drives.[7]
Timken is a member of World Bearing Association (WBA), a non-profit and unincorporated industrial association.




British Timken offices and works in Northampton, England in 2001 prior to demolition a few years later.


British Timken[edit]
British Timken was established in Chester Road, Aston, Birmingham in 1937, to manufacture tapered roller, parallel roller and ball bearings.
In World War II a shadow factory was built in 1941 on a green-field site at Duston in Northamptonshire, to produce roller bearings. At its peak over 4,000 people were employed in the factory. In 2002 the Duston works were closed and the site cleared for housing with production moving to Poland.[8][9]
Present-day operations[edit]
In 2003 the company acquired its largest domestic competitor in the bearing business[10]—The Torrington Company of Torrington, Connecticut. In 2007 it acquired the Purdy Corporation of Manchester, Connecticut. Renamed Timken Aerospace Transmissions, it is part of the Timken Aerospace & Defense division headquartered in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Timken operates eight locations in the US and Canada.
The company also manufactured test equipment for various purposes, including properties of lubricating oil. This resulted in the company lending its name to the industry standard Timken OK Load metric.
Timken has been present in India since 1987 and has production facilities in Chennai and Jamshedpur.[11] Additionally, Timken also has an IT support center in Bangalore.[12][13]
Notable partnerships[edit]

A supply agreement for Garlock Klozure oil seals by and bearing isolators.[14]
