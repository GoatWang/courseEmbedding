      Kenneth Minor, hired killer of motivational speaker Jeffrey Locker, rages over prison sentencing Motivational speaker's hired killer rages at sentencing   BY  Jose Martinez  DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER Monday, April 4, 2011, 12:07 PM     facebook   Tweet   email          Kenneth Minor speaking at his sentencing Monday while receiving 20 years to life. (Siegel for News)       BY  Jose Martinez  DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER Monday, April 4, 2011, 12:07 PM    A potty-mouthed killer-for-hire will serve 20 years to life in prison for the murder of a Long Island motivational speaker. Kenneth Minor blurted out "S---!" as Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Carol Berkman sentenced him Monday for the stabbing death of a despondent and broke Jeffrey Locker. Locker paid Minor to kill him so his family could cash in on millions of dollars in insurance policies he'd taken out long before the 2009 Harlem slaying. "Only two people in the world know what happened that night - and one of them is not here no more," Minor said. "But (LOCKER) didn't want this for me." Given a chance to speak before he was sentenced, Minor tearfully blamed racism and the media for his conviction and complained that he was compared to Jack the Ripper. "In the end, Mr. Locker is where he wanted to be - can't take that back now," Minor said, choking up in spots. "But I ain't no animal." Locker, 52, died with his hands bound behind his back in a car at the rear of the Wagner Houses in Harlem.  Prosecutors said he was so buried in debt that he took out insurance policies on his life, then took to the streets in Harlem in July 2009 to find someone to kill him.      Kenneth Minor speaking at his sentencing Monday while receiving 20 years to life. (jefflocker.com)    "I didn't go searching for anyone that night," Minor said.The killer pointed out that his family was at the trial every day while Locker's family never appeared, and defense lawyer Daniel Gotlin said the motivational speaker's loved ones knew he was depressed and had a death wish."This individual wanted to kill himself," Gotlin said. "And they were well aware of that."Minor, 36, was Locker's second choice for a killer after another man earlier walked away from a deal to kill him.The Harlem man also should also have "turned the other cheek", Gotlin said, as he made an unsuccessful bid to have the guilty verdict tossed."I would like to say my condolences to the Locker family," Minor said.jmartinez@edit.nydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor  Join the Conversation:  facebook   Tweet

Description

                    Liszt's B minor Sonata is now regarded as his finest work for piano, and one of the pinnacles of Romantic piano music. This handbook opens with a survey of Liszt's early attempts at sonata composition - which include some well-known pieces that, hitherto, have been unrecognised as sonata forms - and clears away some of the persistent myths regarding programme music in Liszt's output. In the central chapters, built around an analysis of the B minor Sonata, Kenneth Hamilton discusses various interpretative approaches, arguing that the contradictory writings on the subject stem from the deliberate formal ambiguity of the piece itself - one reason for its perennial fascination, perhaps. The book concludes with a chapter on the performance practice and the performing history of the work, which should be of particular interest to pianists.show more

Course Overview


 Perhaps no other region of the world has played so many different roles in culture, religion, and politics, for so long a period of time, as the peninsula of Asian Turkey, known to the Greeks as Anatolia and to the Romans as Asia Minor. Though today we call it Turkey, that name dates back only to the Middle Ages. 9,000 Years of HistoryFrom 7000 B.C., when Neolithic hunters began the transition to a pastoral and agricultural lifestyle, to the founding of modern Turkey in the 20th century, this varied geographical area about the size of Texas has been a crossroads of history.Homer composed the Iliad and Odyssey on the shores of Asia Minor. All seven of the great ecumenical councils that defined Christian theology in the centuries after the conversion of Constantine took place within the boundaries of modern Turkey. To study the region is to study a land that has nurtured successive civilizations that have defined the Western and Muslim traditions that embrace so many of the modern world's inhabitants.A Hands-On ProfessorProfessor Kenneth W. Harl bases these lectures on both a lifetime of academic study and decades of his own firsthand fieldwork at sites throughout Turkey. He is Professor of History at Tulane University, where he has taught since 1978, after receiving his Ph.D. in History from Yale University. At Tulane, he has received the annual Student Award for Excellence in Teaching eight times. In Fall 2001, he was the national winner of the Robert Foster Cherry Award for Great Teachers.Conquest and CultureThe history of the region includes these milestones: the rise of the Hittites, a chariot-borne warrior people who struck out from their Anatolian heartland to overrun the Babylonian Empire and fight the armies of Egypt's Ramses II to a standstill the Trojan War, a legend created from historical events of the late Bronze Age, when Achaean merchant princes and adventurers clashed swords with Hittite emperors in Asia Minor  the birth of Western philosophy in the search for a rational account of all things by thinkers such as Thales, Anaximander, and Heraclitus—all Greek-speaking sages from what is now the Aegean coast of Turkey  the fiery revolt of the Ionian Greek cities that led to the Persian Wars (499-479 B.C.) and the rise of Periclean Athens as both the world's first democracy and the leader of a maritime empire wealthy enough to build the Parthenonthe great early victories of Alexander the Great that paved the way for the period of brilliant cultural and spiritual creativity we call the Hellenistic Age the spread of early Christianity under the guidance of St. Paul, a native of Tarsus on the southern coast of Asia Minor the golden age of the Byzantine Empire, which preserved the Greek classics and repeatedly saved Europe from nomadic invasion the Muslim transformation of Asia Minor culminating in the Ottoman Empire, which at its height in the 16th century threatened to take over Europe itself.  Change and ContinuityCultural change and continuity, says Professor Harl, are the main themes of this course. Each successive civilization inherited and modified the political, social, religious, and economic institutions of its predecessor. The scope of Anatolian history can be best understood as a series of transformations in the religious landscape of the peninsula. Anatolia has experienced a number of major cultural and religious rewrites: first by the Hittite emperors; then by the elites of Hellenic cities; next by their Hellenized descendants in the Roman age; then by Christian emperors and bishops in the Byzantine age; and, finally, by Turkish rulers and Muslim mystics. The final chapter, the transformation of Muslim Turkey into a modern secular    nation-state, is still in progress. In looking at cultural changes, certain archaeological sites and important monuments will be featured as examples of  wider changes. Cultural ComponentsThe course can be divided into five cultural components: Early Anatolia (6000–500 B.C.) The first lectures deal with the earliest civilizations of Anatolia, emerging at the dawn of agriculture in Neolithic villages on the Konya plain (in central Turkey); through the Hittite Empire, the apex of civilization in the late Bronze Age (1400–1180 B.C.); to the emergence of Phrygia, Lydia, and Persia, heirs to the Hittite traditions in the early Iron Age (1100–500 B.C.).  The Hellenization of Anatolia (750–31 B.C.) The shores of western Anatolia came under the influence of the earliest Greeks, the Achaeans or Mycenaeans, during the late Bronze Age.  Although this contact inspired the epic poems of Homer, it was only from 750 B.C. that Hellenic influence spread into the peninsula. Alexander the Great (336–323 B.C.) conquered Anatolia, and his successors transformed the region into a center of Greek cities that played a major role in the civilization of the Hellenistic Age (323–31 B.C.). Roman Asia Minor (200 B.C.–395 A.D.) The Romans built on the Hellenistic cities and institutions, and Anatolia was transformed into one of the most prosperous regions of the Roman world and homeland of the future Byzantine Empire. The Hellenic cities of Anatolia not only adapted Roman institutions and culture but also influenced the Roman monarchy, known as the Principate. Byzantine Civilization (395–1453) Imperial crisis in 235–305, and Christianization after 324, produced a new Byzantine civilization on Anatolian soil by 600, the basis of Orthodox Eastern Europe today. The Byzantine Empire, reduced to its Anatolian core, weathered two and one-half centuries of invasions and emerged as the leading civilization of medieval Christendom in the 10th and 11th centuries. Islamic Turkey (since 1071) The Anatolian peninsula was transformed from a Christian to a Muslim land in the wake of Byzantine decline and the arrival of crusaders from Western Europe.    Ottoman sultans then built the last great Muslim empire in the Middle East and Mediterranean world, an empire that fragmented in the 20th century into a series of nation-states. In 1922-1939, Anatolia became the core of the Turkish Republic, a Muslim society that has successfully met the challenges of modernization. Hide Full Description

1
 Introduction to Anatolia

                            The lands around the central Turkish plateau have historically "faced" two ways. The western and southern shores have been drawn to Greece and Europe. The mountain-ringed interior has been linked to Iran and Asia proper.                            x



2
 First Civilizations in Anatolia

                            Neolithic Anatolians were among the first farmers and herders, dwelling in villages with sophisticated technology and organization. From the Sumerians to the south, they learned to write and build palaces and cities.                            x



3
 The Hittite Empire

                            Beginning as invaders from the Balkans, the daring Indo-European people called the Hittites overran Anatolia's core with their war chariots and founded a dynasty that rivaled the Egypt of Ramses II.                            x



4
 Hattušaš and Imperial Hittite Culture

                            Hittite kings became the first of many conquerors who would leave their mark on the land. Near their ritual capital of Hattušaš, they carved from the living rock a mighty open-air shrine to their thousands of gods. But shortly thereafter, Hattušaš was sacked and abandoned.                            x



5
 Origins of Greek Civilization

                            As the Hittites were uniting Anatolia, early Greeks (called Achaeans) were visiting its western reaches. From fortress-palaces at places like Mycenae and Pylos, Achaean warlords traded and raided along the shores of Asia Minor and, in time, would become the first Greeks to clash with the armies of a great king to the east.                            x



6
The Legend of Troy

                            The most enduring legacies from early Anatolia are The Iliad and The Odyssey (c. 750 B.C.). How do the siege of Troy and the exploits of Homer's warrior chieftains fit into the wider tale of imperial struggle and decline during the Greek Dark Age (1100–750 B.C.)?                            x



7
Iron Age Kingdoms of Asia Minor

                            From 1200 to 1000 B.C., migrations reshaped Anatolia. Phrygians came from the Balkans, only to be overcome by Cimmerian nomads (c. 700 B.C.). In the West, Hittite provincials founded trade-rich Lydia, whose last king was Croesus.                            x



8
Emergence of the Polis

                            From 750 B.C. the Greeks distinguished themselves with the polis, a city-state based on citizen rule and destined to influence the world. By 500 B.C., Athens had devised the first democratic constitution, with all adult male citizens forming the sovereign assembly.                            x



9
Ionia and Early Greek Civilization

                            The Archaic Age (750–480 B.C.), known in glimpses, remains one of history's most creative periods. Its poets, philosophers, sculptors, and architects gave birth to the mind of the West. At its forefront were the Greek trading cities of Ionia on the coast of Asia Minor and the nearby islands.                            x



10
 The Persian Conquest

                            In 546 B.C., Cyrus the Great of Persia made Anatolia part of his world empire. Anatolian grandees took to Persian ways, and life across Asia Minor soon bore a Persian stamp. Only the Ionian Greeks stood apart. When they rebelled against their Persian-sponsored local tyrants in 499 B.C., war flamed forth between the Greek city-states and the Great King.                            x



11
 Athenian Empire and Spartan Hegemony

                            As the 5th century B.C. closed, war among the Greeks left the Great King once again ruler of Ionia, but with a weakened empire. It seemed that Persian and native elites would carve out kingdoms, and that Ionia would again become the meeting place of East and West. But Alexander the Great had other ideas.                            x



12
Alexander the Great and the Diadochoi

                            In eight years beginning in 334 B.C., Alexander and his Macedonians overran the Persian Empire, unexpectedly altering the course of Anatolian civilization by making Hellenism the leading cultural force in Asia Minor for the next 15 centuries.                            x





13
The Hellenization of Asia Minor

                            Alexander's successor dynasts promoted Greek culture. The Attalid kings turned their fortress city of Pergamum into a showcase of Hellenic arts and learning that the Romans admired. Elites poured their wealth into public display and buildings, and cities knew themselves to be part of a wider Hellenic world.                            x



14
Rome versus the Kings of the East

                            Pompey charged the Hellenistic cities with administering the Roman provincial system in the parts of Asia Minor the legions conquered. Thanks to his reforms, these rich cities paid for the civil wars (48–31 B.C.) that destroyed the Republic and made the brilliant politician Octavian Rome's first emperor.                            x



15
Prosperity and Roman Patronage

                            Under the pax Romana, Hellenic cities of Anatolia attained their greatest prosperity and cultural accomplishment. Polished Hellenic aristocrats sought Roman citizenship and, more than any other provincials, imposed the notion that an emperor should act not as a ruler of subjects but as a leader of free men.                            x



16
 Gods and Sanctuaries of Roman Asia Minor

                            In the Hellenistic and Roman ages, the native gods of Anatolia assumed Hellenic guises. The record of religious life at this time is at odds with the common opinion that the public worship of civic gods (including emperors) declined before enthusiastic, irrational mystery cults.                             x



17
Jews and Early Christians

                            Paul preached in the cities of Anatolia, converting Hellenized Jews and Judaized pagans. In A.D. 250, Christians were still a tiny minority, but with impressive institutions developed in Anatolia. When the convert Emperor Constantine (r. 306–337) summoned the First Ecumenical Council to Nicaea in 325, a momentous new chapter in religious history opened.                            x



18
From Rome to Byzantium

                            After a century of crisis in the Roman world, Constantine unified it and created an imperial church. By 500, Anatolia had undergone yet another cultural and religious transformation into a Christian land. Anatolia had passed over into the Byzantine age.                            x



19
 Constantinople, Queen of Cities

                            When Constantine dedicated his New Rome on the site of an old Greek colony on the European side of the Bosporus, he was founding a capital that would stand as the bastion of Roman government and classical learning under great emperors such as Justinian.                            x



20
 The Byzantine Dark Age

                            The restored Roman Empire of Justinian and after faced many foes, including the new armies of Islam. Urbane classical life yielded to a martial society. Fortress cities rose in the interior. Tenacious Byzantine defense broke the Arabic advance, and Anatolia prospered for a time.                            x



21
Byzantine Cultural Revival

                            Macedonian emperors revived patronage of the arts and letters at Constantinople, and this cultural rebirth was echoed across Anatolia in the 10th and 11th centuries. By 950, nobles were hiring first-class artists who painted in naturalistic styles that looked back to classical models and would influence the Italian Renaissance.                            x



22
Crusaders and Seljuk Turks

                            For a century, the fate of Anatolia lay poised between Byzantines and Seljuk Turks. Though damaged by Crusader depredations, the Byzantines struggled to stem the Turkish tide. As the 13th century opened, the outlines of a new Muslim Turkish civilization began to appear in Anatolia.                            x



23
 Muslim Transformation

                            The sultans sponsored a new, vital Muslim society that once again reshaped the religious landscape of Anatolia, this time with mosques and minarets. The Mongol attacks of the 1240s, ironically, would help make possible the rise of a new Turkish Muslim dynasty, the Ottomans.                            x



24
 The Ottoman Empire

                            The Ottomans forged the last great Mediterranean empire, ruled from a rebuilt Constantinople. Suleiman the Magnificent's failure to capture Vienna (1529) checked Ottoman expansion, but Ottoman military power remained formidable for centuries.                            x

        A great topical overview course
This is a marvelous course. The professor, not surprisingly, knows his stuff.  The course is a great topical overview and will help you identify quickly other sources of information if you want to explore the topic further.

        Great Topic but Disappointing Execution
Unfortunately, I just could not get into this course and found my mind wandering way too often.  I hope it wasn’t a case of the lecturer’s style not resonating with me because I have already bought a number of his other courses because the topics he covers really interest me.  Maybe this was just a specific sub-par effort but the reviews are extremely high so a lot of people don’t feel that way.

I purchased this course because it covers the many civilizations that came to occupy this region of the world but I felt the professor didn’t do their stories justice.  I wished he’d spent more time introducing the peoples in a chronological/narrative manner but instead he seemed to assume listeners knew specific events and had a foundation of knowledge and the lectures instead felt like a fast recitation/rapid fire of many civilizations and facts in some cases without discussion of a greater meaning/bigger picture.  At times I felt lost trying to keep up and maybe that’s why my mind gave up and kept wandering.  I feel like the best history Great Courses are those that explain the basics and facts and then provide any additional details or insight.  

The abrupt endings to lectures without a conclusion, “winding down” comments, or preview of the next lecture were jarring.  The sudden round of applause at times to mark the end of a lecture caused me to jump once or twice---no idea he was finished!

Additionally, the professor used a lot of “filler” words including “Uhh” and “Um” which became very distracting as the lectures wore on.  In one lecture I counted 44 in the first 4 minutes.  300+ for a 30 minute lecture just makes it way too distracting.  
I am going to try "History of the Ancient World: A Global Perspective" next in the hopes of a better understanding of these civilizations.

        Another Splendid Set of Lectures
Professor Harl delivers once again a set of lectures that are crammed with information and delivered with passion, style, and humor. Over the years he is one of the real gems used by Great Courses. Not much else to say. If you want to learn about the ancient history of Asia Minor and enjoy every minute of the experience, buy these lectures and dive in.

        Another Rollercoaster ride from 'our Kenneth'.
I use his name familiarly as he seems to be part of the family, now that I have watched so many of his courses. I have even gotten used to his 'argh, argh' punctuations !

This course is great because it fills in the geographical and historical gaps between Greece/Rome and the Middle East (see also his course on 'The Vikings' for a similar historical gap-filler to the north).

The singularly most appalling aspect is the type of maps. They are 'mud maps' of the worst sort ! Like molten chocolate, 'illuminated' from the northwest, giving gross shadows on the eastern side of countries. In some cases, this 3D visualisation often makes the seas stand forward - most uncomfortable. Certainly not up to the usual TGC's standard.

But don't let this one gripe prevent you from watching what is a most absorbing topic.

        Asia Minor: Eastern & Western Trajectories
Professor Kenneth W. Harl’s course Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor and his other CLASSICAL and BYZANTINE presentations have cleared many pre-conceptions and stereotypes in my understanding of history in general. Concepts such as the barbarian, heresy, paganism, Oriental-ism, persecution, religion, etc. simple but deceptive ideas, have come into a much clearer, refined, and critical focus allowing further depth analysis and objectivity to my historical studies.

These lectures document the ancient civilizations that inhabited, developed, fragmented, and transformed the political, cultural, social, and religious landscape of ASIA MINOR (Anatolia / Modern Turkey) which covers a wide time frame. It ranges FROM early Neolithic settlements 6000 BC, domestication, writing, merchant trade, urbanization, and rise in city life; TO the Fall of Constantinople and the rise in the Ottoman Empire 1453 AD. The professor’s empirical data and conceptual historical narrative is supplemented with the disciplines of archaeology, anthropology, mythology, and theology helping to clarify the social processes taking place on this strategic landscape which is a geographical-cultural BRIDGE connecting the EASTERN and WESTERN TRADITIONS of yesterday and today. Its interior mountainous plateau regions gravitate toward Iran and the Near East, its northern shores / Black Sea towards Eastern Europe, and its western and southern shores / Aegean and Mediterranean Seas towards Western Europe. These pulls towards the East and West are still making the headlines today.

These lectures focus on five major HISTORICAL STAGES portraying the rise, maturity, decline, crisis, fall, transformation, and continuity of the great ancient civilizations that inhabited this Anatolian landscape: EARLY ANATOLIAN period (6000 – 500 BC), HELLENIZATION period (750 – 31BC), ROMANIZATION period (200BC – 395 AD), BYZANTIZATION period (395 – 1453 AD),
ISLAMIZATION period (1071…). Whether designed or unintended, the presentation is a microscopic view of macro-Mediterranean world history through the cultural lens of Asia Minor’s changing landscape. According to the professor, the CULTURAL and RELIGIOUS RE-WRITES on this soil by the Hittites, Phrygians, Lydia, Trojans, Greeks, Persians, Romans, Western-Latin Church, Byzantines, Eastern-Greek Orthodox Church, Arabs, Turks, and Muslims have contributed to today’s richness of its culture which is still evolving toward modernization. These earlier periods echo and are sketched with the DARKNESS and ILLUMINATION of kings, generals, emperors, pharaohs, sheiks, grandees, satraps, sultans, ghazi-warriors, theologians, philosophers, renaissance-artists-scholars, mystics, caliphs, popes, bishops, patriarchs, prized cultural artifacts, secular-religious architectures, gods-goddesses, competing theologies, ecumenical councils, iconoclastic controversies, pagan cults, Christians, Shiites-Sunni Muslims, Seljuk-Ottoman Turks, Sufis, crusaders, migrations, famous battles, civil wars, etc., much still vibrating today, are all documented in detail in the excellent course guidebook with accompanying maps, timeline, glossary, biographies, and bibliography. (Should become the standard on how to organize and document a detailed guidebook – just excellent!)

Finally, I close with a comment I previously made on Professor Harl’s Byzantium lectures since it also applies here: the only historical point not addressed concerns the Belgian scholar Henri Pirenne whose work MOHAMMED AND CHARLEMAGNE deals with this area and periodization of history. To quote from the book cover: “the cause of the break with the tradition of antiquity was the rapid and unexpected advance of Islam…an event of historical proportions…causing the axis of life to shift northwards from the Mediterranean for the first time in history”. To hear the professor discuss, critique, and interpret Pirenne’s thesis in light of the civilizations of ASIA MINOR and BYZANTIUM would be very enlightening indeed. *** AN HISTORICAL NECESSITY, EXCELLENT, and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ***

        Another Great Course by Professor Harl
Professor Harl has done a number of excellent courses for The Great Courses and this course is just as excellent as the others. Professor Harl presents history in a manner which is both informative and entertaining.

A lot of the courses on ancient history start with major well-known empires such as the Persians, Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians. This course starts at the beginning with the first known civilizations and explains the evolutionary path from these earliest civilizations to the major empires.

Consequently, this course should be one of your first courses on ancient history so that you will have an appreciation of the “big picture” before delving into the other excellent ancient history courses by Professor Harl and other professors who have created courses for The Great Courses.

Highly recommended.

Ex-con Kenneth Minor, the Harlem man who helped Woodmere motivational speaker Jeffrey Locker kill himself in 2009 as part of a bizarre suicide-for-hire insurance scam, told a judge Monday he was sorry as he was sentenced to 12 years in prison.
"In 2009 I had the chance to do the right thing, and I didn't," Minor, 41, told Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Laura Ward. " . . . I failed Mr. Locker that night because of my own greed. I'll never let that happen again."

Minor was convicted of murder in 2011 and sentenced to 20 years in the stabbing death of Locker, who was deeply in debt and hoped his death would allow his family to collect on life insurance. Minor claimed he held a knife while Locker thrust his body on it.
 The conviction was reversed in 2013 due to incorrect jury instructions on assisted suicide, which is only second-degree manslaughter in New York. Minor finally pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter but can appeal the way prosecutors went about re-indicting him. 
He will get credit for the five years he has already served in prison and will likely be released after serving about five more years if his appeal fails, said his defense lawyer, Daniel Gotlin.
Locker, according to trial testimony, recruited Minor off the street on a trip to Harlem on July 16, 2009, giving him an ATM card in payment. Locker had $18 million in policies, including $12 million acquired just before his death that would not pay out for suicide.

Minor objected to any suggestion that he was used by Locker. "Every choice I made, I made myself," he said. His wife, Dawn, told reporters he was a "changed man" who had spent his time in prison praying and going to services.
Gotlin read Ward an anonymous letter he received from a person identified as an acquaintance of Locker, describing Locker as "someone with a big ego who thought he could manipulate other people . . . and live a life he did not have the means to do."

The letter also complained that Locker's family lived well while Minor paid the price. "Look at the Facebook page the daughter and mother have -- recent trips to Italy all smiles while a man that was manipulated by Jeff Locker sits in jail?" it said. "Where is the justice?"

The judge said that while Gotlin had the right to make a statement, the 12-year sentence was already agreed, and she didn't see the value in an anonymous letter. Prosecutor Peter Casolaro said the letter "was an excellent example of why testimony is taken under oath."
A spokesman for Locker's wife did not return a call for comment.

A New York man convicted of a stabbing murder two years ago after claiming he was just helping a stranger commit suicide won a retrial today following a shock decision.The Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ruled that the trial judge had misinterpreted the law and confused the jury by limiting the definition of 'assisted suicide' in the case of Kenneth Minor, a 41-year-old drug abuser who was hired by Jeffrey Locker, a broke motivational speaker, to assist in Locker's death.Locker, who worked for Modal Trigger Motivational, was $300,000 in debt following a botched Ponzi scheme and planned to make his suicide to look like a robbery so that his family could claim $18 million in life insurance.Minor told police Locker approached him on the street in East Harlem in 2009.He asked if Minor would hold a knife against the steering wheel of his car so Locker could repeatedly lung onto the knife.  



Committed suicide? Broke motivational speaker Henry Locker is said to have hired Kenneth Minor to help assist in his death as part of a life insurance scam. Minor was convicted of murdering Locker in 2011 but today won a re-trial after it was decided the judge had 'misinterpreted the law'
   



Jeffrey Locker was a Modal Trigger
Motivational speaker. The man convicted of his murder, Kenneth Minor, has won a retrial in an attempt to prove
 Locker had sent his wife an email about how to shield and distribute their assets and, according to Minor, told him: 'If you don't do it, someone else will. But this is getting done.'Minor was arrested after using Locker's ATM card, which he claimed was his compensation.During the landmark trial in 2011, Minor was convicted of murder in the second degree and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.

The district attorney argued all along that 'this was murder for money' and that Minor had stabbed Locker while he lay prone.However the defence had argued that Minor held the knife while Locker thrusted himself onto it several times and that the right charge was manslaughter, which they will again fight for in the retrial.  



Kenneth Minor, a known drug abuser, claims he was approached on the street in East Harlem (pictured) by Jeffrey Locker, a debt-ridden motivational speaker who needed help in making his suicide look like a robbery as part of an $18 million life insurance scam.
 Minor's attorney, Daniel Gotlin, said a second-degree manslaughter conviction would have been lawful.'Obviously we're elated (over the reversal) .... Now we hope we can get a fair and appropriate resolution,' he said.Assisted suicide is illegal in New York, but is allowed as a defense to murder.State Supreme Court Justice Carol Berkman, who has since retired, told the jury during her closing of the original trial that if Minor 'actively' caused Locker's death, even with Locker's consent, it wasn't assisted suicide 'because the consent of the victim is not a defense to murder'.One juror said afterward that the judge's instruction led her to vote for a murder conviction.The appeals court has since decided Judge Berkman was mistaken because of one word - 'active'.Her instruction 'was confusing and conveyed the wrong standard,' the court said.'Neither the word "active" nor its antonym "passive" appears in the statutory language.'The court said the instruction effectively 'mandated a directed verdict of guilt' on the murder charge.The district attorney's office said today it was reviewing the ruling.

‘Harlem Kevorkian’ Re-Sentenced In Death Of Motivational Speaker

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — After being convicted of helping a motivational speaker kill himself, a man known as the “Harlem Kevorkian” received a revised sentence on Monday.
Kenneth Minor, 41, admitted to stabbing motivational speaker and self-help author Jeffrey Locker to death on an East Harlem street in 2009. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison in 2011, but his conviction was later overturned.
As CBS 2’s Emily Smith reported, Minor then accepted a plea deal that reduced his 20-year sentence to 12 years. The deal still carries the murder conviction rather than the crime being reduced to manslaughter.
During Monday’s sentencing, Minor apologized to the judge for any wrongdoing.
“Every choice I made I made myself. And I accept responsibility for what I did,” he said.
But Minor maintained what he has said all along: Locker wanted to die, Smith reported.
Minor said the motivational speaker approached him for help staging what would look like a deadly knife robbery so that Locker’s family could collect his life insurance.
Prosecutors admitted Locker asked Minor to help him stage his death, but said Minor went beyond assisted suicide when he stabbed Locker seven times.
Still, defense attorney Daniel Gotlin said the whole case is the definition of assisted suicide or second-degree manslaughter, not murder.
“They knew then the deceased plotted his own death,” Gotlin said. “They had records he was calling funeral homes and emails calling cemeteries — all sorts of documentary evidence.”
No one from Locker’s family appeared in court during either trial or sentencing, Smith reported. According to Gotlin, they took part in the plan to live off an $18 million insurance policy.
“They certainly knew he wanted to kill himself. They were well aware of it,” he said.
In court, Minor told the judge he’s been going to church and reflecting on life. The judge declared him a changed man, telling him she hopes to never see him in a court room again, Smith reported.
Minor’s wife, Dawn, said she’s glad it’s all over with.
“He’s just been praying and he accepts the things that he has done,” she said.
Even though Minor said in court he is satisfied with the sentence, Gotlin said he plans to appeal yet again, Smith reported.
Minor has been behind bars for five years. That time will go toward his new sentence. He will then be released with five years supervision.
