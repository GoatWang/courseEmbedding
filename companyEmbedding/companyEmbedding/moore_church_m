Product DescriptionWe all long for revival but we tend to pray for it to come without being completely sure what precisely revival is. This book will be a revitalizing aid to those of us who desire revived spiritual life for our churches. T.M. Moore offer practical advice on steps, each with secure scriptural foundations, that we can take to prepare our churches for the sovereign work that is revival. This book is clear that there is no conflict between revival being a work of God and the continued and urgent need for Gods people to earnestly pray for its appearance. With practical guides to prayer for revival T. M. Moore realizes the need for balance and succeeds in providing a book that will help us to refocus on revival and will prepare our souls and our churches for the mighty work of a Sovereign and loving God.More Product InformationPublisher: Christian Focus Publications

• Selection Guide and Product Information







Temperature Sensors, Transmitters and Assemblies
Take a weak, low-level RTD or thermocouple signal and convert it to a high-level analog signal more suitable for long-distance transmission through a noisy plant, and ready for direct interface with an indicator, recorder, PLC, DCS, or PC-based SCADA system. 
• Selection Guide and Product Information
• Applications




Limit Alarm Trips and Switches 
Provide on/off control, warn of trouble, or provide emergency shutdown by sending one or more alarm (relay) outputs when a monitored process signal falls outside of a selected high and/or low limit.

• Selection Guide and Product Information
• Applications





Signal Transmitters, Isolators and Converters
Convert, isolate, split, boost, and step down process signals so field instruments can interface directly with indicators, recorders, DCS, PLC, and PC-based SCADA systems.

• Selection Guide and Product Information
• Applications






Smart HART Loop Monitors and Interfaces
Break out analog and discrete process, status and diagnostic signals from smart multivariable transmitters and valves; monitor critical and safety-related loops; prevent costly false shutdowns; and warn of unwanted process or instrument fault conditions. 
• Selection Guide and Product Information
• Applications





Process Controllers, Monitors and Backup Stations
Precisely control and monitor a temperature, pressure, level or flow process variable in batch and continuous processes, or back up critical or safety-related loops controlled by PLC, DCS and PC-based systems.
• Selection Guide and Product Information   
 




Fieldbus Device Couplers and Power Supplies

Deliver a fast and easy way to connect, protect, power and terminate multiple fieldbus devices in FOUNDATION fieldbus™ and PROFIBUS PA segments.

• Selection Guide and Product Information
   
 
 





Process Control and Distributed I/O Networks
Eliminate expensive point-to-point wires by sending just a few—or thousands of—process monitoring and control signals between the field and control room on one digital communication link.
• Selection Guide and Product Information
• Applications





I/P and P/I Converters
Convert a current signal to a pneumatic signal so a DCS, PLC, or PC can control a valve or actuator; or convert pneumatic signals to current signals so remote pneumatic devices can interface with electronic instruments and computer-based monitoring systems. 
• Selection Guide and Product Information
• Applications





AC Power Transducers and Monitors
Schedule maintenance, identify inefficiencies, cut energy use, and prevent expensive damage to a load device like a motor, pump, heater, or mixer by accurately monitoring AC power use and trends. 
• Selection Guide and Product Information
• Applications







Indicators and Displays
Take a process input signal from a temperature, pressure, level, or flow transmitter loop and view real-time process status in rugged and hazardous field environments.
• Selection Guide and Product Information
