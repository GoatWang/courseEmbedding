Wood-to-Wheels: A Multidisciplinary Research Initiative in Sustainable Transportation Utilizing Fuels and Co-Products from Forest Resources


2008-10-20



Technical Paper




2008-21-0026
David R. Shonnard, Jill R. Jensen, Jeffrey Naber, Qiong Zhang, Ann L. Maclean, Kathleen E. Halvorsen, Timothy L. Jenkins, Christopher Polonowski, John W. Sutherland
Michigan Technological University has established a broad-based university-wide research initiative, termed Wood-to-Wheels (W2W), to develop and evaluate improved technologies for growing, harvesting, converting, and using woody biomass in renewable transportation fuel applications. The W2W program bridges the entire biomass development-production-consumption life cycle with research in areas including forest resources, bioprocessing, engine/vehicle systems, and sustainable decisions. The W2W chain establishes a closed cycle of carbon between the atmosphere, woody biomass, fuels, and vehicular systems that can reduce the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. This paper will summarize the activities associated with the Wood-to-Wheels initiative and describe challenges and the potential benefits that are achievable.








National Science Foundation Workshop on Environmentally Benign Manufacturing for the Transportation Industries


2002-03-04



Technical Paper




2002-01-0593
Walter W. Olson, John W. Sutherland
The National Science Foundation recently sponsored a Workshop on Environmentally Benign Manufacturing (EBM) for the Transportation Industries. The objective of the workshop was to determine future directions of research in the EBM area and to construct a roadmap for development of future research programs. While research in the fields of Design for the Environment (DfE) and Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) have focused on the product and product life cycles, an additional focus is needed to find and develop processes with less environmental impact within the manufacturing environment. This workshop explored EBM issues with respect to the enterprise, the products, the processes and the materials.








A Proposed LCA Model of Environmental Effects With Markovian Decision Making


1997-04-08



Technical Paper




971174
Dusan Milacic, Hrishikesh Gowaikar, Walter W. Olson, John W. Sutherland
As the pool of existing non-renewable natural resources continues to shrink, it will be necessary for government and industrial leaders to achieve a workable strategy for the intelligent allocation of scarce resources. In this paper, a method of quantifying the environmental and resource impacts of product redesign is proposed. This new method utilizes Input Output Analysis coupled with the Markovian decision making into a single matrix-based tool. The benefit of a fully developed tool would be the ability to make informed pre-production decisions leading to optimum product and process designs with minimal environmental impact. This paper illustrates this technique with an example based upon real industry data and extrapolated effects.








Research Advances in Dry and Semi-Dry Machining


1997-02-24



Technical Paper




970415
Cecil M. Daniel, Walter W. Olson, John W. Sutherland
The current trend in the automotive industry is to minimize/eliminate cutting fluid use in most machining operations. Research is required prior to achieving dry or semi-dry machining. Issues such as heat generation and transfer, thermal deformation and fluid lubricity related effects on tool life and surface roughness determine the feasibility of dry machining. This paper discusses recent advances in achieving dry/semi-dry machining. As the first step, research has been conducted to investigate the actual role of fluids (if any) in various machining operations. A predictive heat generation model for orthogonal cutting of visco-plastic material was created. A control volume approach allowed development of a thermal model for convective heat transfer during machining. The heat transfer performance of an air jet in dry machining was explored. The influence of machining process variables and cutting fluid presence on chip morphology was investigated through designed experiments.








Modeling the Thread Chasing Process for Improved Product Quality


1992-04-01



Technical Paper




920919
John W. Sutherland, William J. Zdeblick
A simulation model for the thread chasing process, an operation widely used to produce pipe threads, is described. This model focuses on the prediction of the cutting force system, and is based on sub-models for the process geometry, tool-work contact area (chip load), chip load-force relationship, and the structural response of the machining system when acted on by the cutting forces. The model is shown to be capable of predicting the cutting torque, cutting forces, and displacement present in the process. Experimental data obtained from a turning process is used to condition the model to the material of interest. The process model is then verified through physical experiments conducted with the thread chasing process. Discussion is presented on how the model may best be put to use for enhancing the quality of the thread chasing process and its associated products.

Biography
Dr. Sutherland is involved in several projects related to manufacturing and environment/sustainability. Example initiatives are the use of novel technology to eliminate cutting fluid mist from machining operations, and the recovery of value from end-of-use products with the goal of employing components in multiple life-cycles. Sutherland’s teaching interests parallel his research activities and includes the application of statistical methods to manufacturing. His honors include the SME Outstanding Young Manufacturing Engineer Award (1992), MTU Distinguished Teaching Award (1992), NSF Career Development Award (1995), Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (1996), SAE Ralph R.Teetor Award (1999), ASME Manufacturing Engineering Division Outstanding Service Award (2001 & 2004), and MTU Research Award (2000).
