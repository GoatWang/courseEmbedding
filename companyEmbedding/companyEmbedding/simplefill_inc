What are some common reasons for changing your legal name? 

Personal Choice.  You may simply not like your name or may want a name that is more easily spelled or pronounced. With TotalLegal, you can change your last name, first name and/or middle name.
Change a Child's Name.  The absence of a parent in a child's life, changes in parental rights/custody, and paternity determinations are among the most common reasons to change a child's name.
Share a Last Name.  Couples may want to create a hyphenated or entirely new last name for themselves.
Divorce.  If you took your spouse's last name upon marriage, you may want to resume a former name if you separate or divorce. In most states, it is easy to include a name change in your Divorce Decree.


Fraud and Name Changes.  The court will not grant a name change that 
		is requested for a fraudulent or illegal purpose such as evading criminal 
		prosecution or a civil lawsuit, avoiding creditors, or identity theft. 
TotalLegal™ has helped over 1 million people nationwide make essential documents themselves.

State your funeral and burial instructions
Create a trust for minor children
Disinherit a person(s)
Name a guardian for minor children

Changing the Way America Fuels Its Vehicles


 










 





CHANGING THE WAY AMERICA 
		

SIMPLE-FILL IS GREENER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE 
		



















FUELS ITS VEHICLES 
		




 


AN ABUNDANT AMERICAN RESOURCE — UNDERUTILIZED


LIQUID PISTON APPROACH 

No reciprocating compressors here! Simple-Fill’s patent-pending technology uses unique geometries and flows to induct a pressurized liquid into a single stage gas filled compression chamber.

   


NEAR ISOTHERMAL COMPRESSION Compressing a gas turns it hot. Simple-Fill’s Intra-Compression technology utilizes the compression fluid to cool the gas during the compression cycle. What’s even cooler is that makes Simple-Fill’s compressor far more efficient than conventional compressors.   


NO HIGH-TOLERANCE PARTS Maintenance crews will jump for joy knowing the expensive and problematic high-tolerance parts found in conventional compressors have been replaced by easy-to-maintain compression cylinders, hydraulic pumps, valves and fittings. Hallelujah indeed!   


NO MOVING PARTS Well, at least not in Simple-Fill’s compression cylinders. Gone are the days of metal pistons rotating at thousands of times per second to compress a minute amount of gas. Simple-Fill’s liquid is the workhorse—so kiss cylinder/piston rebuilds goodbye!   


NO-LEAK COMPRESSOR What? Who Cares? You should. Methane is a GHG 25 times worse than CO2. And conventional compressors are notorious methane leakers. Simple-Fill’s compressor, not so much. If a hydraulic system leaks, it can’t compress. When we compress, we don’t leak. Which is a very good thing.   


LOW NOISE Ever try having a conversation near a 150 psi shop compressor? Good luck. Now imagine the noise from a 3,600 psi compressor. Simple-Fill’s liquid piston compressor generates very little noise: It is an electric motor turning a hydraulic pump. Your business neighbors will thank you, as will your ears.   





Simple-Fill is creating a new compression paradigm and it starts with natural gas. Fortunately, it doesn’t end there. Other markets that can take advantage of Simple-Fill’s technology include:

Transportation: CNG, Hydrogen
Oil & Gas: Gas uplift, vapor recovery, wellhead
Other Energy: Carbon sequestration, air storage—wind farms
Industrial Gasses: Hydrogen, CO2, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Argon, otherTESTIMONIAL“I’m really excited about Simple-Fill’s technology because it enables small, medium and large distributed fleets, such as mine, to adopt compressed natural gas (CNG) as an alternative fuel. The cost to install and maintain infrastructure is the barrier preventing widespread adoption of CNG. Simple-Fill’s solution may well smash that barrier.”

Develops Nat-Gas Compressor TechnologyNews DepartmentsProducts & Technology Simple-Fill Inc. Develops Nat-Gas Compressor TechnologyPosted by Lauren Tyler - January 16, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter   tweet Simple-Fill Inc., an Ohio State University spin-off that develops natural gas compression technologies, says it has raised $420,000 of a possible $450,000 round for the development of new compressed natural gas (CNG) compressor technologies, according to a report from Columbus Business First.According to the company, Simple-Fill is aiming to develop technology that would enable more small and midsize fleets to adopt CNG as a transportation fuel.The report notes that the company raised $1.7 million one year ago to set up pilot projects with two fleet customers, including Safelite Group Inc.   According to Simple-Fill, it is creating “a new compression paradigm” using a liquid piston approach, near isothermal compression, no high-tolerance parts, no moving parts, a no-leak compressor, and low noise.The company states that it leverages liquid to compress, cool and dehydrate natural gas, eliminating the complexity and cost of traditional compression methods and enabling more industries to take advantage of these new capabilities. In addition to being more cost-effective, Simple-Fill’s technology helps companies using fleet vehicles to improve their carbon footprint and, further, evolve with the future of fuel.

Simple-Fill Inc. has raised $1.7 million from investors to demonstrate its natural gas compressors with two customers that operate small fleets of CNG-powered vehicles.
The equity raise from 14 investors will fund the Columbus startup’s six- to nine-month pilot program, CEO Rob Underhill said.

The two companies were not identified.
“(We want to prove) that it’s a deployable technology,” Underhill told me. “We’re in a good spot right now, we’re focused very heavily on developing our product.”
Simple-Fill makes compressors that turn natural gas into a cleaner, cheaper source of fuel – compared to gasoline – for cars and light-duty trucks.




The company says its technology, born out of Ohio State University’s Center for Automotive Research, is more efficient than other “expensive, unreliable and inefficient compressors that can cost millions of dollars.”
Simple-Fill's compressor is made mostly from mass-produced industrial hardware that doesn’t require custom manufacturing, “which should drive (the) cost down," Underhill said.
“We have quite a bit of interest in our product, even with gas prices being (low),” he said. “There’s no question that there’s a market pullback and not everybody is jumping on the bandwagon like when gas was $4 a gallon. But I think a lot of fleets have realized (this)... is more of a temporary setback.”
Underhill said the $1.7 million raise also allows the company to grow to four employees from two, including himself.
Simple-Fill last year raised $170,000 through convertible notes as well as an undisclosed amount from Ohio State’s Technology Concept Fund.




 


Underhill has said the company will serve smaller fleets- 50 vehicles or less from, for example, a carpet-cleaning company - than the typical large fleets that currently use CNG.
Simple-Fill's partners include Worthington Industries Inc. (NYSE:WOR), which provides two components and its manufacturing capabilities, and Honda of America Manufacturing Inc., which provided some funding.
