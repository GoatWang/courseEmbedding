Evernote for Mac 6.3 Beta 1 Released



							
								
									
										
											David Daly replied to SoftwareMarcus's question in Mac Product Feedback






			Hi,   Just downloaded the beta and trying it out. Thanks.    The focus on search is topical for me. I had an issue with search just this morning. Any chance of adding in explicit dates when searching on modified or created time? Currently there are a number of preset searches that I can choose, but I can't search for all notes created on Oct. 15th, or all notes created between Oct 15th and Oct 20th. I find myself wanting to do that from time to time.

Android Lock Screen -- create new note



							
								
									
										
											David Daly replied to David Daly's question in Android Product Feedback






			So long as the lock screen widget only allows adding new notes, I'm not overly concerned about the security issues. I can deal if someone adds a bunch of notes to my database.   The real key is time -- reducing the time from reaching for the phone until I can start saving a note, and ultimately save it. Having the note on the lock screen saves the time to unlock the phone. I don't think having something in the notification tray really helps reduce that note taking time. I already have the evernote widget on my home screen, and use that.    As an aside, I'm on Marshmallow now, and I'm not sure it's possible anymore to add lock screen widgets anymore.

			System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Text -> Use smart quotes and dashes   Thanks. I should have gotten that before.    I remembered two other parts that I would like along these lines:    1. The ability to set things off in a box, just as the comments above show up in a box. To visually separate the code (or other quoted text).  2. The ability to go back to default formatting after pasting something in. If I paste in formatted text, the text immediately afterwards ends up in the same formatting. I never figured out an easy way to go back to default behavior for remaining text. The best I've been able to do is to insert some blank lines before pasting, to make sure there is at least one existing default formatted line after the paste.

											David Daly replied to SoftwareMarcus's question in Mac Product Feedback






			Trying out the new beta. Thanks.    I actually use the "* " shortcut, but it's not that big a thing for me one way or the other. The big thing I was hoping to get (and would still love to get) is support for preformatted code and quoted text (like an email or something copied from somewhere). I've had trouble with this in the past including "--" becoming one long dash. On the last beta I tried `test` but was never quite sure if it was working. Interestingly, it currently seems that if I paste something with -- it stays a --, but if I try to type it, it gets merged.    I do a lot of work programming, and being able to accurately save snippets of code and snippets of output is a big deal. The easier it is to do, the better things are for me.    Thanks.

Very fast logging/information capture



							
								
									
										David Daly posted a topic in  Off Topic Discussions






			Hi,   I'm a fan of measuring things to make them better, and have used evernote and other tools for that. I use evernote on my laptop and on my android phone for many of these things. However, I've found that the time to open evernote and take a note (particularly on my phone -- which is with me all the time) is just too long to be useful for logging those things. For example, I'm fighting a snacking habit at work (free snacks), and wanted to track when I craved or thought about eating a snack. There are really a number of small things I'd like to track, but because they are small, possibly frequent things, I have to be able to track them with very little overhead. I don't bite my nails, but that would be another good example.    I asked a question in the Android topic https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/81193-android-lock-screen-create-new-note/ looking to lower the time to take a note, based on this issue. Let me ask the more general question here:   Does anyone have any very light weight techniques for counting a small number (1 would be fine, 2 or 3 would be great) things that could happen frequently? Ideally I'd end up with a time for each event, but I'd settle for something that just gave me a count, and then I could manually bin things into time periods.    It would be great to do this on my phone. I'd love to be able to hit one of the buttons, or say two buttons together on my phone to log an entry, but don't know of anything that does that. Alternatively, I could see something like a hand counter (like this) , but don't want to carry one around, but I'd be open to something along that line that I could wear, like a ring or bracelet (but subtle -- I'm a guy...). I used to carry around note cards (before smart phone), and may again, but again don't want to carry around more things if I don't have to.    So, thoughts? Pointers?

Android Lock Screen -- create new note



							
								
									
										
											David Daly replied to David Daly's question in Android Product Feedback






			Thanks gazumped. My real issue is trying to reduce the cost of saving a piece of information. On my phone (nexus 5), it takes me six seconds to unlock, hit the evernote new note widget, and be ready to enter information. I'd really like to cut that down and trying to figure out any way to do that. I'm trying to capture and measure more things, and the six seconds limits what I can afford to record.

Android Lock Screen -- create new note



							
								
									
										David Daly posted an idea in  Android Product Feedback






			Is there a way to setup an android lock screen widget to --only-- create a new evernote note?    I don't want someone to be able to look through my notes without unlocking, but I would like to create notes without unlocking. I'd like similar behavior to the camera app, which allows me to take a picture without unlocking, but won't let me look at any pre-existing pictures without unlocking the phone. I'm not comfortable allowing access to my notes on the lock screen.    My apologies if this is discussed somewhere else, or solved. I've looked around and hadn't been able to find a solution.    Also, I'm running lolipop.

Develop confidence and competence in your treatment of fluency disorders
Clients become more fluent as they evaluate and change their attitudes and beliefs and learn to use fluency enhancing strategies, self-monitoring techniques, and cognitive/self-instructional strategies

			Author(s) & Intro 



The Source for Stuttering and Cluttering is based on three decades of working with over a thousand fluency-disordered individuals.  The unique approach allows clients to reflect on feelings and attitudes related to communication while working on the steps to fluent speech.  The book describes very specific, step-by-step procedures for teaching clients to integrate speech-motor skills with the cognitive strategies underlying fluency.  The stuttering program has two phases:
Phase I—Orientation and Motor-Speech Practice Phase Very discreet oral-motor response patterns are taught, one at a time.  Clients read, re-read, and practice the material while concentrating. 
Phase II—Cognitive and Self-Instructional Strategies This section covers the attitudinal and cognitive strategies necessary for durable, lasting improvement.  Not only must clients hear themselves getting better verbally, they must "see themselves" more fluent in the future through imagery.  Easy-to-follow, guided relaxation; affirmation training; and self-talk strategies are included.
The last section of the book provides a comprehensive account of cluttering.  Learn the obligatory symptoms of cluttering, how to assess it, and how to devise a successful treatment program.  
An audio CD included with the program contains:

examples of voicing practice and relaxation practice
examples of common client errors
cluttering voice samples
checklist for possible cluttering
Customers tell us that procedures in The Source for Stuttering and Cluttering yield better results than any other methods they have used before.  Help your clients master these lessons and share in the joy of gaining control of their fluency and, ultimately, their lives.

I have been working in public schools for the past twenty-seven years.  Each year I have about 4-5 students who stutter and 3 or 4 students who clutter.  I have several books on stuttering but have not come across any program on cluttering.  I was thrilled to find The Source for Stuttering and Cluttering.  Mr. Daly explains cluttering and its treatment in a manner easy to understand and do.  I share it with parents.  After reading the portion on cluttering, one parent made the comment, "So that's what it is!"  Learning that cluttering is language-based, with weaknesses in organization and memory, these parents were able to connect their child's cluttered speech with their cluttered bedrooms and unorganized school binders.  It made sense to them and to me.

I currently work in Istanbul, Turkey.  I ordered The Source for Stuttering and Cluttering and found it really helpful.  I would like to thank you for this valuable source.  After I read your book and used the techniques presented in it, the improvement was amazing.  Thank you for teaching me how to be more helpful to my clients. 
Cigdem Buzul, SLP Istanbul, Turkey 


Stuttering varies widely across individuals and is typically a multi-faceted disorder (ASHA, 1995). 
Cluttering is a disorder with deficits in fluency, rate, and coexisting problems in language and/or articulation (ASHA, 1999). 
Therapy should encompass the environmental factors that influence the individual's fluency as well as address the cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects (Taylor-Goh, 2005). 
Using a combination of empirical knowledge, theory, and common practice, appropriate goals should be selected, as well as processes and techniques to achieve those goals, based on a careful evaluation of the client (ASHA, 1995). 
It is important to periodically re-evaluate the selection of goals, processes, and techniques with regard to the outcome of treatment (ASHA, 1995). 
Research studies support the use of prolonged-speech procedures with adults who stutter.  These procedures were used within a comprehensive treatment framework, including initial intensive work, practice in front of groups, specific tasks for transferring fluency, self-management, and an active maintenance program (Bothe, Davidow, Bramlett, & Ingham, 2006). 
Literature suggests that treatments successful with adults may also be successful with adolescents (Bothe, Davidow, Bramlett, & Ingham, 2006). 
The Source for Stuttering and Cluttering incorporates these principles and is also based on expert professional practice.

BiographyDavid A. Daly, Ed. D., CCC, is associate professor of Speech-Language Pathology and Special Education at the University of Michigan, where he has served as director of the academic program, speech clinic, and director of Shady Trails residential camp for stutterers. 
Currently, David publishes extensively in professional journals, lectures nationwide, and owns and operates a successful private practice in Livonia, Michigan, specializing in chronic stuttering and cluttering.  In his 30-plus years of experience in public school, clinic, and private practice settings, David has helped hundreds of stutterers become independent, confident, and successful speakers. 
In addition to his many professional interests, David also enjoys sailing and tennis.  He is an inspiring and charismatic person who leaves his mark on those he meets with his unique sense of humor and zest for life's inevitable twists and turns. 
The Source for Stuttering and Cluttering is a completely revised version of David's first publication with LinguiSystems, The Freedom of Fluency.
IntroductionIn this book, I have tried to accomplish two objectives.  First, to update you with new information, ideas, and strategies about the treatment of stuttering in children and adults.  I have been gratified by the comments and letters from colleagues across the United States, Canada, and Europe on their positive experiences using the Freedom of Fluency program which was published with LinguiSystems in 1988.  This reinforcement motivated me to try even harder in this book to identify and clearly describe additional procedures, clinical rationales, and subtle changes which I have found to be most promising with disfluent clients.  As a result, The Source for Stuttering and Cluttering contains much new information and specific speech exercises designed to make fluency progress even easier for both client and clinician. 
However, colleagues and clinical researchers who have used The Freedom of Fluency encouraged me to not change too much in this revision.  They argued that procedures in The Freedom of Fluency were yielding better results than methods they had used before.  I was also particularly sensitive that the revision did not "throw out the baby with the bath water."  Because of these cautions, I believe that the essential ingredients for successful treatment of chronic fluency disorders have been retained in The Source for Stuttering and Cluttering. 
The intent of this book is to offer more ideas, explanations, and strategies to help an even larger number of clinicians become confident and competent when working with fluency disorders.  New information on the importance of the clinician's and client's belief systems, the need for clinicians to appreciate and learn the benefit of oral-motor exercise in therapy, and the significance of practice outside of therapy are emphasized.  Central to these factors is the importance of helping both clients and clinicians to take action; that is, to decide on a plan of treatment, to teach specific strategies thoughtfully one task at a time, and then to assist the client in taking action.  The necessity of over-practicing the various target fluency responses can't be overemphasized. 
Beyond updating the information on stuttering in The Freedom of Fluency, The Source for Stuttering and Cluttering was written to objectively identify, describe, and differentiate from typical stutterers a separate group of clients known as clutterers.  A section of this book provides you with as current and comprehensive an account of cluttering as possible.  Clinicians who have been puzzled with some slow-changing, atypical stuttering clients, many of whom also may show poor awareness, significant language disturbances, poor oral-motor abilities, rapid or fluctuating rates of speech, and difficulty with topic maintenance should find this section quite illuminating. 
In addition to my own clinical experiences with people who present with cluttering disorders, I have gathered what information I could on the topic from conferences, recent literature, and from the personal experiences of others.  These in-depth discussions with colleagues about their clinical and research experiences, suspicions, clinical hunches, and hypotheses about this "orphan" in the field of speech-language pathology have been most stimulating and informative.  Cluttering has been a specific clinical interest of mine for more than 2 decades and my hope is that readers who also witness this kind of disfluent individual will find the discussion and suggested clinical strategies in The Source for Stuttering and Cluttering particularly valuable.
