Financial highlights, risks and use of proceeds For the nine-month period that ended on Dec. 31, 2016, Hamilton Lane Inc. reported total revenues of $131,241,000 and a net income of $56,788,000. For the same time period that ended on Dec. 31, 2015, the company reported total revenues of $139,434,000 and a net income of $41,034,000. The company reported total revenues of $180,797,000 for the year that ended on March 31, 2016, and of $155,385,000 for the year that ended on March 31, 2015. It reported net incomes for the years that ended on March 31, 2016, and March 31, 2015, of $57,107,000 and $69,260,000, respectively. 

 (Source) The company reports that its historical investment performance should not be taken as an indication of its future performance. It reports that one risk factor is the intense competition for access to investment funds. It plans to use the proceeds from its IPO to repay its term loan and interest as well as to purchase existing membership units held by some of its owners.
 Conclusion: Consider Purchasing Shares Hamilton Lane Inc. has a strong management team and a history of profits and strong revenues. Using revenues for the past twelve months, and assuming IPO midpoint pricing, HLNE will have a P/S ratio of 4.3. This is above the industry average of 2.9 for firms like Morgan Stanely (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which offer private investment access. At the same time, these firms are significantly more established and diversified. A PwC report, noted by HLNE in its SEC filings, states an approximate doubling of the alternative investment industry to $13.6 trillion by 2020. We believe that growth investors should consider buying shares during this IPO.

Company Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania-based Hamilton Lane was founded in 1991 and has developed service lines to enable clients to invest in a variety of private markets, including:  Private Equity Private Credit Infrastructure Real Estate Venture Capital Growth Equity Natural Resources  Management is headed by CEO and director Mario Giannini who has been with the firm since 1993. He previously held senior executive positions in other financial services firms. The company has previously operated as Hamilton Lane Advisors, LLC, but has changed its entity type to a Delaware C Corporation Hamilton Lane Incorporated in preparation for the IPO. Investors in the company who hold at least 5% of company stock include HLA Investments and HL Management Investors. Below is a brief company video:  (Source: Hamilton Lane YouTube) Hamilton Lane claims $40 billion in AUM, or assets under management, and $274 billion of assets under advisement, or AUA, deployed in over 89 countries.
 It offers clients a number of different services:  Customized Separate Accounts Specialized Funds Advisory Services Distribution Management Reporting, Monitoring, Data and Analytics  Its investor and client base included more than 350 intermediaries and institutions as of September 30, 2016, and is divided by type as follows: 

 (Source: Hamilton Lane S-1) Market and Competition The company operates in a globalized, multitrillion-dollar marketplace for equity and debt capital investment in private companies. Its primary source of revenue is from customized separate accounts, and there are many other large international financial institutions that offer clients similar access to private investment opportunities, including:  Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) Fidelity Investments  Additionally, there are numerous smaller, regional players that provide their clients with access to selected private investment deals. Financials Hamilton Lane's recent financial results can be summarized as follows:  Steadily growing revenue in the range of 10% to 17% per year. Positive net income of generally increasing amount, with the exception of a drop in 2016 vs. prior.  Below are the company's operational results for the past five years (Audited GAAP): 

 (Source: Hamilton Lane S-1) Revenue  2016: $180.8 million, 16.3% increase vs. prior. 2015: $155.4 million, 11.1% increase vs. prior. 2014: $139.8 million, 17.3% increase vs. prior. 2013: $119.2 million, 9.6% increase vs. prior. 2012: $108.8 million 
 Net Income  2016: $55.9 million 2015: $71.5 million 2014: $67.0 million 2013: $51.8 million 2012: $45.9 million  As of September 30, 2016, the company had $58 million in cash on hand and total liabilities of $311 million. IPO Details Hamilton Lane intends to raise $200 million from the sale of Class A shares but has not yet provided a proposed price range for the stock, or resulting valuation. The company will use some of the proceeds to buy membership units in Hamilton Lane Advisors, HLA, from existing owners, and the remaining net proceeds to purchase newly issued membership units in HLA so that it can pay down debt: We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to purchase membership units in Hamilton Lane Advisors, L.L.C. from certain of its existing owners, and the remaining net proceeds to purchase newly issued membership units in Hamilton Lane Advisors, L.L.C. We expect Hamilton Lane Advisors, L.L.C. to use these proceeds to repay indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the reorganization transactions taking place contemporaneously with the closing of this offering, certain existing owners of Hamilton Lane Advisors, L.L.C. will exchange their membership interests for shares of our Class A common stock to be held directly and will cease to be members of Hamilton Lane Advisors, L.L.C. The company will also issue Class B shares to 'certain members' of HLA which will have ten shares voting power for each share issued, effective retaining control of the public entity. Commentary The desirability of Hamilton Lane's IPO will hinge on valuation, which we don't know about yet. The company has a consistent track record of growing revenues each year for the past five years, and its profit is growing, although less consistently than top line revenues. The private investments industry has undergone a significant growth period, as the number of publicly-held companies shrinks. However, going forward, if the current Federal administration and Congress work to reduce regulation on publicly-held companies, that trend could stabilize or even reverse, as companies find going public easier to do.
 In that scenario, the effect on Hamilton Lane's business would be hard to gauge, as more IPOs may mean better portfolio performance as exits become more numerous, but fewer investment opportunities in private companies. In any event, the company is a potentially attractive public entity, given its relatively consistently growing financial performance. I write about technology IPOs, M&A, follow-ons and secondaries.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
