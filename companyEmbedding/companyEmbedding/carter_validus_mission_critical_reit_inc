Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT II



























SCHEDULED TO CLOSE NOVEMBER 24, 2017**This initial offering will close to new investments upon the earlier of (A) raising
			a total of $2.25 billion in gross proceeds from the primary offering, (B) November 24, 2017, 4:00 PST or (C) if the board decides to terminate early.




























1) The amount of distributions that will be paid, if any, is uncertain. There is no guarantee that we will continue paying distributions. We have paid regular monthly distributions to our stockholders, and intend to continue paying monthly distributions unless our results of operations, our general financial conditions, general economic conditions, applicable provisions of Maryland law or other factors make it imprudent to do so. The timing and amount of distributions will be determined by our board of directors, in its discretion, and may vary from time to time. We have paid, and may continue to pay, without limitation, distributions from sources other than from our cash flow from operations including, but not limited to the proceeds of our offering, borrowings or the sale of assets. As of January 20, 2017, we had paid aggregate distributions, since inception, of approximately $65,819,000 ($28,245,000 in cash and $37,574,000 reinvested in shares of common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan [the “DRIP”]). The distribution rate for Class T shares is net of the distribution and servicing fee. With respect to Class T shares sold in its primary offering, CVMC REIT II will pay the dealer manager a distribution and servicing fee that accrues daily equal to 1/365th of 1.0% of the most recent purchase price per Class T share on a continuous basis from year to year, payable out of amounts that otherwise would be distributed to holders of Class T shares; provided, however, that upon the termination of the primary offering, the distribution and servicing fee shall be an amount that accrues daily equal to 1/365th of up to 1.0% of the most recent estimated NAV per Class T share on a continuous basis from year to year. CVREIT II will cease paying distribution and servicing fees with respect to all Class T shares sold in the primary offering on the earliest to occur of the following: (i) a listing of the Class T shares on a national securities exchange, (ii) following the completion of the Offering, total underwriting compensation in this Offering equaling 10% of the gross proceeds from our primary offering, (iii) there are no longer any Class T shares outstanding;or (iv) the fourth anniversary of the last day of the fiscal quarter in which the primary offering terminates. CVREIT II will not pay a distribution and servicing fee with respect to Class T shares issued under the DRIP;however, the distribution and servicing fees payable with respect to Class T shares sold in the primary offering will be allocated to Class T shares as a class cost, and therefore will impact the amount of distributions payable on all Class T shares, including those issued under the DRIP.

An investment in the Company is speculative.Investments in the healthcare property sector contain certain risks, including the fact that adverse trends in healthcare provider operations may negatively affect lease revenues and the ability to make distributions to stockholders.

1) The estimated per share net asset value (“NAV”), determined by the Board of Directors (“the Board”) of Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT, Inc., is based on the estimated value of the Company’s assets less the estimated value of the Company’s liabilities, divided by the approximate number of shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated as of September 30, 2015 (the “Valuation Date”). This valuation was performed in accordance with the provisions of Practice Guideline 2013-01, Valuations of Publicly Registered Non-Listed REITs, issued by the Investment Program Association (“IPA”) in April 2013 (the “IPA Valuation Guidelines”), in addition to guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The various factors considered by the Board in determining the estimated per share NAV were based on a number of assumptions and estimates that may not be accurate or complete. Accordingly, with respect to the estimated per share NAV, the Company can give no assurance that: a stockholder would be able to resell his or her shares at this estimated NAV; a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to the Company’s estimated per share NAV upon liquidation of the Company’s assets and settlement of its liabilities or a sale of the Company; the Company’s shares of common stock would trade at the estimated per share NAV on a national securities exchange; a different independent third-party appraiser or other third-party valuation firm would agree with the Company’s estimated per share NAV; or the methodology used to estimate the Company’s estimated per share NAV would be acceptable to FINRA or for compliance with ERISA reporting requirements. Similarly, the amount a stockholder may receive upon repurchase of his or her shares, if he or she participates in the Company’s share redemption program, may be greater than or less than the amount a stockholder paid for the shares, regardless of any increase in the underlying value of any assets owned by the Company.

DISTRIBUTION HISTORY



Prior to January 2016, Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT, Inc. paid distributions on a monthly basis based on 365 days in the calendar year. As of January 2016, Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT, Inc. pays distributions on a monthly basis based on 366 days due to 2016 being a leap year. Distributions for all record dates of a given month are paid approximately 15 days after month-end. There is no assurance that Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT, Inc. will continue to declare distributions at this amount. Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT, Inc. has paid, may continue to pay, and has no limits on the amounts it may pay, distributions from any source, including from sources other than cash flow from operations, which may include proceeds from its DRIP Offering, the sale of assets, advances and financings. The use of borrowed funds to pay distributions can result in a reduction or suspension of distributions. There is no guarantee that monthly distributions will be paid or that the distribution rate will be maintained. Any distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations may negatively impact the value of your investment. 
 

 
The Company has no operating history or established financing sources. As a result, an investment in the Company is speculative. In addition, the offeree will not be acquiring an interest in the Company's advisor.
Investments in the healthcare property sector contain certain risks, including the fact that adverse trends in healthcare provider operations may negatively affect lease revenues and the ability to make distributions to stockholders. Please consult the prospectus for additional risks.

Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT II, Inc. (“CV Mission Critical REIT II”) has acquired five properties in March 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $141.5 million. 
Norwalk Data Center 
Acquired by CV Mission Critical REIT II for approximately $58.9 million, the Norwalk Data Center is a powered-shell colocation data center property located in Norwalk, Connecticut. Standing as the largest data center in the state, the facility totals 167,691 rentable sq ft comprised of 75,000 sq ft of data center space, 30,000 sq ft of office space, and approximately 62,000 sq ft of supporting infrastructure. The Norwalk Data Center is 100% leased to Cervalis, LLC, a subsidiary of CyrusOne (NASDAQ: CONE). CyrusOne is an owner, operator, and developer of enterprise class, carrier neutral, multi-tenant data center properties. 
Aurora Healthcare Facility 
The Aurora Healthcare Facility was acquired by CV Mission Critical REIT II for approximately $11.5 million. Built in 2002 and located in Aurora, Illinois, across from the Rush-Copley Medical Center Campus, the 24,722 rentable-square-foot facility is 100% leased on a 9.5-year term to Copley Memorial Hospital, Inc. The facility currently houses an ambulatory surgery center, pre- and post-operating bays, cast rooms, a bone density room and imaging capabilities. Additional services offered include outpatient physical therapy and outpatient orthopedic surgeries. 
Texas Rehabilitation Hospital Portfolio 
CV Mission Critical REIT II acquired a portfolio of three fully-occupied inpatient rehabilitation facilities on March 31, 2017 for approximately $71.1 million. One property is located in Austin, Texas and is fully leased to HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital of South Austin, LLC. The other two properties are fully leased to affiliates of Post Acute Medical, LLC, (“PAM”) and are located in Allen, Texas and Beaumont, Texas. PAM is a national developer and operator of freestanding inpatient rehabilitation facilities and long-term acute care hospitals with operations in eight states. Together, the three properties total 169,722 sq ft of leased space. 
“We believe these acquisitions represent our commitment to invest in high-quality real estate in the growing data center and healthcare industries. We further believe the critical nature of these buildings to the tenants that occupy them, along with their favorable locations and property conditions make them attractive acquisitions for CV Mission Critical REIT II,” said John E. Carter, chief executive officer of CV Mission Critical REIT II. 
Michael A. Seton, president of CV Mission Critical REIT II, commented, “We are thrilled to add these fully-occupied, net leased properties to our expanding portfolio. We believe acquisitions like these align well with our high-growth, net lease, mission critical investment strategy, and anticipate that they will translate into added value for our stockholders.” 
Subsequent to these acquisitions, CV Mission Critical REIT II entered into two term loans: 

A $34.2 million loan with Bank of America, National Association on April 19, 2017 
A $39.9 million loan with Capital One, National Association on April 20, 2017

Healthcare Facilities Investment FocusThe healthcare sector is uniquely poised to enter an expansion phase based on an aging population, fundamental changes to the healthcare system, medical innovation, and a slowdown in speculative building development over the past few years. What’s more, ongoing healthcare reform is expected to add millions of newly insured individuals to the system, creating an increased demand for quality healthcare facilities.
