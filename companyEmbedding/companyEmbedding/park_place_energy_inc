Building a Regional Oil and Gas Company
Park Place Energy Inc. is a U.S. based oil and gas exploration company focused on building a portfolio of international exploration and development projects in Turkey and Southeast Europe. The Company’s focus is on recently acquired oil and gas producing assets in Turkey and a coal bed methane exploration license in Bulgaria.

In January 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of three oil and gas producing fields in Turkey. The main producing asset is a 36.75% interest in an offshore gas development project called the South Akcakoca Sub-Basin (SASB). The SASB involved 19 wells drilled, four platforms constructed in two phases, extensive shore-based logistical infrastructure, and significant pipeline and facilities construction to bring the gas to market.

Park Place’s priority is the expansion and revitalization of the SASB field during 2017 and beyond. By combining leading-edge technology to identify bypassed zones, the installation of artificial lift and new wells drilled from the existing platforms, we expect SASB to be a significant producing asset for the Company into the future.

About Us

The acquisition of Turkish assets marks a transformative event for the Company. We now have meaningful production and cash flow. We anticipate being able to increase production at the SASB field during 2017 and plan to drill new wells in 2018. We continue to look to expand our portfolio of oil and gas properties with particular focus on
 
Park Place holds rights to a natural gas play located in northeast Bulgaria that will produce gas from coal seams. The Company entered into a License Agreement and received regulatory approval from the environmental agency for its work programs but that approval was appealed by certain NGOs. Until the approval issue is resolved, the Company cannot commence its planned work programs. These work programs include the drilling up to 5 wells to demonstrate the technical feasibility and commercial potential of producing coal bed methane from this potentially world-class project.
 
Park Place is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, USA. The Company is led by a team of experienced international oil and gas executives, with decades of experience and much recent involvement in both Turkey and Bulgaria.
Corporate profile:

Park Place is incorporated in the State of Delaware, USA. It has its principal office in Dallas, Texas, an office in Ankara, Turkey and a satellite office in Sofia, Bulgaria.
As of February 1, 2017, Park Place has 55.4 million shares issued and outstanding.
Park Place is fully audited and is an SEC reporting entity.
The Company’s shares are presently quoted on the US:OTCBB and the OTC:QB under the ticker symbol PKPL.
The Company has a wholly-owned subsidiary in Bulgaria for local operations.


History of Projects:

From 2006 to 2010, the Company held interests in several producing and non-producing properties in the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta as well as in an offshore oil exploration block in the North Sea.
In 2009 and 2010, the Company disposed of substantially all of its North American properties to refocus its exploration efforts in Europe.
In October 2010, the Company was awarded an exploration permit for the Vranino 1-11 Block located in northeast Bulgaria by the Bulgarian Counsel of Ministers.
A competitor in the bidding competition contested the award and litigation ensued. In mid-2013 such the litigation was resolved in the Company’s favor.
In April 2014, the Company signed the License Agreement for the Vranino 1-11 Block.
In August 2014, the Bulgarian environmental agency approved the Company’s planned work programs for exploration of the Vranino 1-11 Block.
In September 2014, a number of parties appealed the decision of the environmental agency to approve our planned work programs.
Once the issues surrounding the regulatory approvals are resolved, the Company will commence on ground exploration activities on the Vranino 1-11.
In late December 2015, Park Place entered into an agreement to purchase three companies which have oil and gas production in Turkey.  The purchase was conditional on obtaining the approval of certain Turkish regulatory agencies.
The regulatory approvals were finally received in November 2016 and Park Place closed on the acquisition of the Tiway companies in January 2017.

Bulgaria

Overview of the Vranino Gas Project



Introduction
The Vranino project is situated in close proximity to a major gas pipeline in northeast Bulgaria.  The area covered by the License Agreement (the “license area”) was previously extensively explored for the potential to mine coal in the deep coal beds found in the Dobrudja Basin.  Based upon this prior coal exploration activity, we know these coal beds are a potentially prolific source of natural gas.  The main component of natural gas is methane and the data compiled from the prior coal exploration activity indicates the coals in the Dobrudja Basin contain natural gas that consists of 90-95% methane.  This methane is naturally occurring and will be produced through conventional drilling – the Company will not use coal gasification or hydraulic fracking, which is banned in Bulgaria.
The Company intends to initially drill up to five exploration wells, in a conventional and safe manner, consistent with best practices for environmental cleanliness and international standards.  If successful, the project will be a source of natural gas for the local community, will provide a cost savings for consumers and will reduce the need for Bulgaria to purchase expensive imported natural gas.
Historical exploration efforts
Between the 1960’s and the late 1980’s, over 220 wells were drilled on the Vranino 1-11 Block and the immediate surrounding area, with one additional well drilled in 2005. Of these wells, 120 wells are located on the Vranino 1-11 Block and intersect targeted gas bearing coal seams at depths of between 1200 meters and 2500 meters. 
The previous drilling centered on massive gas-charged coal deposits where over 60 individual coal seams (with varying thickness and gas content) have been identified. The coals are inter-bedded with various sandstones, which may also act as a reservoir for gas escaping from the gas bearing coals. The data gathered from the well drilled in 2005 confirmed numerous gas bearing zones of interest.
The Company has access to a massive amount of geological data in the Vranino 1-11 Block and the surrounding area, including logs, gas isotherms, location tops, temperature, DST and some core data, as a result of the prior drilling of such a large number of wells. Our evaluation of such data, which began in mid-2013, confirms that the Vranino 1-11 Block contains significant gas-bearing formations. 
While some of the wells have been converted to water wells, a large number of the existing wells are available for re-entry and possible deepening. One of the early objectives for Park Place will be to determine whether these wells can be successfully re-entered and deepened. If some of the old wells can be successfully used for future exploration, the Company could realize significant costs savings and higher returns. 
The coal beds in the Dobrudja Basin contain over 60 individual coal seams, many of which contain significant amounts of natural gas. Prior exploration activities targeted the coal seams for potential mining of the coal; however, the seams in the Dobrudja Basin were determined to be too deep for commercially viable coal mining.
 
Exploration and development strategy – a modern “green” approach
Park Place will use modern techniques for gas extraction that are environmentally friendly. (many of which have been developed in past 10 years). These techniques will not involve hydraulic fracking or underground coal gasification. 
Our plan is to initially drill 2 conventional vertical wells and core and test them; we will also re-enter and test an existing well. Once we evaluate the results, we will design and test completion techniques which will be safe and environmentally sound, and which we hope will optimize the production of natural gas from the coal seams. But we repeat: we will not use hydraulic fracking, which was banned in Bulgaria in 2012, or underground coal gasification.
In the USA, more than 50,000 wells have been drilled into coal seams in over a dozen basins. In Canada, over 10,000 wells have been drilled into coal seams. In the EU, there are currently underway projects targeting coal seams in the UK and pending in France.

Park Place Energy Inc. - Update on acquisition of Turkish oil and gas production companiesDALLAS, TX--(Marketwired - December 16, 2016) -  Park Place Energy Inc. (OTCQB: PKPL) ("Park Place" or the "Company") announces that closing of the acquisition of the "Tiway Companies", consisting of three oil and gas exploration and production companies operating in Turkey, will occur prior to mid-January 2017. While the parties are endeavoring to close the transaction before year end, due to logistical difficulties in finalizing all the necessary closing documents (which involves actions in several different countries), the parties have extended the Share Purchase Agreement to January 17, 2017.As previously announced, all required regulatory approvals have been received to enable Park Place to close on the acquisition of the Tiway Companies. Despite the delay in closing, the effective date of the transaction remains January 1, 2016.The principal asset being acquired in this acquisition is a 36.75% interest in the South Akcakoca Sub-Basin gas field located in the southern Black Sea just off the coast of Turkey. Based on recent meetings with the operator of the field, plans are now in place to run production logs in a number of the offshore wells and then perforate the behind pipe reserves confirmed by those logs. Earlier this year, Tiway commissioned a comprehensive reevaluation of the original logs in the 10 wells in the field at the 4 offshore platforms. This reevaluation indicated there remains substantial behind pipe reserves in these wells. Plans were also approved by the operator to study the feasibility of artificial lift in a number of the wells.

Acquisition of Turkish oil and gas production companies completed




      












 

Park Place Energy Inc.		Acquisition of Turkish oil and gas production companies completed	        



January 19, 2017Park Place Energy Inc. (OTCQB:PKPL) ("Park Place" or the "Company") is pleased to announce it has now completed the acquisition of three oil and gas exploration and production companies operating in Turkey (the "Tiway Companies").  As previously reported, the purchase price for the acquisition of the Tiway Companies from Tiway Oil B.V. was $2.1 million.  It took over a year to obtain all the required regulatory approvals for the transaction.  As a result of the acquisition of the Tiway Companies, Park Place now owns interests in three producing oil and gas fields in Turkey, one of which is offshore and the other two are onshore. 
At year-end 2016, net production to the Tiway Companies from such fields was 280 barrels of oil equivalent per day or Boe/d; and for the year 2016, net production to the Tiway Companies averaged 390 Boe/d.  In addition, the Tiway Companies have about US$745,000 in available cash. Due to the acquisition of the Tiway Companies, the Company is now a qualified oil and gas operator in Turkey based in Ankara.  With this base of operations in Turkey and its experienced management team, Park Place is poised to exploit these assets and for further growth in the region.
The primary asset of the Tiway Companies is the offshore production license called the South Akcakoca Sub-Basin ("SASB").  Over $450 million has been invested in the SASB to date.  The Company now owns a 36.75% working interest in SASB.  SASB has four producing fields, each with a production platform plus pipelines that connect the fields to an onshore gas plant.  The four SASB fields are located off the north coast of Turkey towards the western end of the Black Sea in water depths ranging from 60 to 100 meters. Gas is produced from Eocene age sandstone reservoirs at subsea depths ranging from 600 to 1200 meters.
The three nearer shore gas fields of Ayazli (discovered in 2004), Dogu Ayazli (discovered 2005) and Akkaya (discovered in 2006) were included in an initial phase of development with first gas production in 2007. The deeper water Akcakoca field (discovered in 2006) was developed later with first gas production in 2011.  All of the fields are developed using unmanned well head platforms/tripods tied back via a 25 kilometre 12-inch pipeline to shared processing and compression facilities onshore at Cayagzi gas plant.  The gas plant at Cayagzi is capable of processing up to 75 million cubic feet of gas per day. Sales gas is exported via an 18.6 km long 16-inch onshore pipeline, which ties into the main national gas transmission network operated by BOTAS.  Historically, gas has been produced at rates of as high as 30 MMcf/d from SASB; total gross production to date from the four fields is in excess of 37 Bcf.  The production license for SASB is covered by a modern 223 square kilometre 3D survey. There are five additional gas discoveries in SASB that have not yet been developed. Also, there are several additional prospects defined by 3D seismic data.
The year-end 2016 gross gas production rate for the seven producing wells in SASB was 2.56 MMcfd; the average daily 2016 gross production rate for the field was 4.36 MMcfd. Gas is sold at a price of approximately US$6.00 per Mcf for a netback per Mcf of approximately US$3.00. 
The Company believes there are substantial remaining gas reserves at SASB.  Based on third party evaluations, the Company has confirmed there are substantial behind pipe reserves in the ten SASB production wells connected to the four production platforms.  Plans to re-log certain of the wells have been approved by the operator and will be performed shortly; based upon those results, operations are planned to perforate the confirmed behind pipe reserves in order to increase production. 
In addition, the Company has initiated an investigation to determine the feasibility of installing artificial lift in order to rehabilitate production in certain wells.  Further, the Company has identified a number of proved undeveloped locations that can be drilled from the four existing production platforms.  The Company envisions the next stage of development in 2018 will include the drilling of additional wells to materially increase the volumes of gas produced through the existing infrastructure.   
With the acquisition of the Tiway Companies, Park Place also acquired two other oil and gas assets: a 19.6% interest in the Cendere field, a producing oil field located in Central Turkey, and a 50% operated interest in the Bakuk gas field located near the Syrian border.  At year-end 2016, the Cendere field was producing 123 barrels of oil per day, net to the Tiway Companies; and averaged 118 barrels per day during 2016 net to the Tiway Companies.  The Bakuk field is shut-in with no plans to revive production in the near term. 
Funds for the acquisition were raised through a combination of private placements and loans.   From a private placement that just closed, along with an earlier placement that closed in 2015, the Company raised just over $1.4 million. The remainder of needed funds was obtained through loans.  The private placement that closed concurrent with closing of this acquisition raised $1,015,000.  Units, which were sold at $0.20 per unit, consisted of one common share and one share warrant at $0.40 exercisable on or before January 17, 2018.   As a result of this placement, the Company will issue 5,075,000 shares of common stock, increasing the total issued and outstanding shares of the Company to 55,356,482 shares.  
Scott Larsen, the Company's President and CEO, stated:  "We are extremely pleased to finally complete this acquisition.  It has been a very long time in the making but we believe it is well worth the wait.  We are grateful for the support of the staff of our new subsidiaries throughout the process and look forward to growing and expanding the operations in Turkey."

Park Place Energy Inc. - Update on acquisition of Turkish oil and gas production companies


/EINPresswire.com/ -- DALLAS, TX--(Marketwired - December 16, 2016) -  Park Place Energy Inc. (OTCQB: PKPL) ("Park Place" or the "Company") announces that closing of the acquisition of the "Tiway Companies", consisting of three oil and gas exploration and production companies operating in Turkey, will occur prior to mid-January 2017. While the parties are endeavoring to close the transaction before year end, due to logistical difficulties in finalizing all the necessary closing documents (which involves actions in several different countries), the parties have extended the Share Purchase Agreement to January 17, 2017.
As previously announced, all required regulatory approvals have been received to enable Park Place to close on the acquisition of the Tiway Companies. Despite the delay in closing, the effective date of the transaction remains January 1, 2016.
The principal asset being acquired in this acquisition is a 36.75% interest in the South Akcakoca Sub-Basin gas field located in the southern Black Sea just off the coast of Turkey. Based on recent meetings with the operator of the field, plans are now in place to run production logs in a number of the offshore wells and then perforate the behind pipe reserves confirmed by those logs. Earlier this year, Tiway commissioned a comprehensive reevaluation of the original logs in the 10 wells in the field at the 4 offshore platforms. This reevaluation indicated there remains substantial behind pipe reserves in these wells. Plans were also approved by the operator to study the feasibility of artificial lift in a number of the wells.

Park Place Energy Inc.



10/11/2016 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 10/20/2016 14:30
Park Place Energy Inc. Announces Extension of Contract to Acquire Turkish Oil and Gas Production Companies








        DALLAS, TX-(Marketwired - October 11, 2016) - Park Place Energy Inc. (OTCQB: PKPL) ('Park Place' or the 'Company') previously announced it had entered into an agreement to purchase three oil and gas exploration and production companies operating in Turkey. The 'Tiway Companies' own interests in three producing oil and gas fields, one offshore and two onshore.
        The Company and the seller have now agreed to extend the purchase contract up to December 15, 2016. The Company has initiated a private placement to raise the funds to complete the purchase; it is anticipated the private placement will close in the next 20-30 days. The purchase price of the acquisition is $2.1 million. Park Place paid a deposit of $500,000 when the agreement was signed. The effective date of the purchase is January 1, 2016. Closing of the transaction is conditional on Park Place obtaining approvals from two Turkish regulatory agencies. One of the approvals has been received; the other approval is pending. Park Place expects to close the acquisition following receipt of the second approval. The Company believes the delay in obtaining the second approval is attributed, in part or in whole, to the Turkish Government declared State of Emergency which expires later this month. However, recent public announcements suggest the State of Emergency will be extended another three months into January 2017.
        The Tiway Companies report that year to date, production has averaged 414 BOE/D (barrels of oil equivalent per day). Approximately 75% of the production is gas (selling now at about $6.50 per mcf) and 25% of the production is oil (selling at a slight discount to Brent).
        The Company's focus in the acquisition is the offshore gas field called the South Akcakoca Sub-Basin located in the Black Sea where the Tiway Companies own a 36.75% working interest. Based on the large amount of research and investigation of the field, the Company believes there are substantial behind pipe reserves which can be accessed through a low cost work program. It is anticipated such work program will dramatically improve production. The Tiway Companies, with input from the Company, have been working with the operator to develop plans to commence this work program later this year.
        Additionally, the Company has identified a number of proved undeveloped locations in the offshore gas field which can be drilled from the four existing production platforms. Accordingly, the Company believes there is the potential to produce substantial additional volumes of gas through the existing infrastructure.

Building a Regional Oil and Gas Company
Park Place Energy Inc. is a U.S. based oil and gas exploration company focused on building a portfolio of international exploration and development projects in Turkey and Southeast Europe. The Company’s focus is on recently acquired oil and gas producing assets in Turkey and a coal bed methane exploration license in Bulgaria.

In January 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of three oil and gas producing fields in Turkey. The main producing asset is a 36.75% interest in an offshore gas development project called the South Akcakoca Sub-Basin (SASB). The SASB involved 19 wells drilled, four platforms constructed in two phases, extensive shore-based logistical infrastructure, and significant pipeline and facilities construction to bring the gas to market.

Park Place’s priority is the expansion and revitalization of the SASB field during 2017 and beyond. By combining leading-edge technology to identify bypassed zones, the installation of artificial lift and new wells drilled from the existing platforms, we expect SASB to be a significant producing asset for the Company into the future.
