About Our Mailing List

The information that you provide Ross Andrew Winery will not be shared with, or sold to, other companies without your prior consent.

The information is utilized so that we may offer a superior level of customer service reflective of the quality and scarcity of our wines. The only way to hear about the availability of our wines is through our print and email communications.

Email communications to our mailing list subscribers are sent only to those who have expressly given Ross Andrew Winery permission to send them information. You can update your information or unsubscribe from our list at any time by emailing us at info at RossAndrewWinery dot com

Credit Card Processing and Security

We keep your personal information safe. We encrypt all of our online ordering information—including your name, address, and credit card number—so that your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system. Once we receive your credit card information, we store it on a server that cannot be accessed from the Internet. Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution, which receives the credit card number and other personal identifying information, in an encrypted form, in order to verify credit card numbers and process transactions.

The Team Behind Ross Andrew Winery













































Who We Are











Ross Andrew Mickel, Winemaker
A Seattle-area native, Ross’ path to wine production began on a 1996 fly-fishing trip with Canlis Restaurant heir, Mark Canlis.  It was during this afternoon on the river where Mark asked Ross if he had any interest in learning about wine from the restaurant perspective – and he jumped at the opportunity to learn from the best in the Northwest. There are few (if any) restaurants that can match the history, class, service and knowledge about fine dining and wine like the team at Canlis.  So, while working under Canlis Master Sommelier Rob Bigelow, Ross soon realized that wine was going to be his life’s journey.  And it was from here that he launched into traveling the globe (Australia, South America, Europe and South Africa) to learn all he could about food and wine.  Upon returning home and realizing it was time to get something going, he landed a harvest job as cellar rat at Washington State icon winery DeLille Cellars which was immediately followed by a vintage at one of Australia’s leading wineries, Rosemount Estate.  Returning to the US, Ross was hired at arguably one of Washington’s most highly allocated and respected producers, Betz Family Winery where he spent nearly a decade helping craft some of Washington State’s most sought after wines under Master of Wine (one of 225 on this globe we call Earth), Bob Betz.
It was under the guidance and support of Bob and Cathy Betz that Ross and his family started Ross Andrew Winery in 1999.  Three barrels became fifteen, then thirty and now nearly 125 barrels of red wine rest peacefully in our cellar each vintage.  Along the way the winery has developed relationships with the state’s most reputable and attentive growers from which our wines are crafted.  Ross has also been hired to exact the skills he honed at Betz Family and Ross Andrew Winery as winemaker for Grand Reve/Force Majeure winery, where he’s earned scores of 97 and 98 points more than once from the wine industry’s leading periodicals.  Included is a 97 point accolade from Wine Spectator, for a Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, the highest rating ever given to a Washington State Cabernet Sauvignon.
Alexandra J. Mickel, Line Item Veto Queen
…or Dr. No.  Whatever title you choose to give her, she’s in charge.  Alexandra has a keen eye and ability to keep us headed in the right direction while entertaining our tangents and wild plans with a tight leash.  

Sheila Nelson, Executive Culinary Director
Sheila has been the chef behind all our events since our opening with the 1999 harvest. Her ability to craft both simple and masterful meals is second to none.  We consider her the MacGyver of the cooking world.

Ned Nelson, Chief Design Officer and Encyclopedia
Ned has been a commercial and residential architect for nearly 35 years. In addition to that he knows 8 out of 10 things, which is rather impressive.  At Ross Andrew Winery he is in charge of our flow controls and process design. His mechanical encryption skills are the driving force behind designing the only domestically manufactured commercial-grade basket press in the U.S (visit CarlsenAssociates.com).

Galena Mickel, SVP Sales and Legal
Galena, our Bernese Mountain Dog has ben SVP of Sales and Legal since joining the Ross Andrew Team back in Q2 of '09.  While her lack of opposable thumbs keeps her from using a cork screw or driving the delivery van (she can reach the pedals, but then steering and vision are out of the question), she does have a remarkable ability to do what she wants, when she wants (that's the legal: Galena's Law).  Whether she greets you with a bark or by trying to run between your legs (all 85 lbs) Galena welcomes all to her domain.  Eventually.

Where to Find Our Wines





 




Short version:

Don’t mess up what the vineyards give us and keep the process interesting and lively.

Slightly longer version:

Too many people try to make wine into much more than it is and it ends up coming across as an intimidating and elitist pursuit.   Our goal is to go in the other direction:  keep it simple and make it fun.

At the end of the day, we’re talking about squished grapes.  But it’s the process the grapes follow from vineyard to bottle that is most important.  To start, we are blessed to have partnerships with the greatest growers in Washington State’s Columbia Valley and Columbia Gorge AVAs.  It’s these relationships that give us the best possible Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Pinot Gris.  We’re also learning how incredible Oregon’s Willamette Valley is for our Pinot Blanc dominant blend MEADOW.

In the winery, we treat the grapes with the attention and respect they deserve the minute they arrive.  Once the wines successfully complete fermentation, we make it our top priority to know what is happening in each and every barrel.  This allows us to craft world class, singularly distinctive, consistent wines for you to enjoy

Bottom line: we’re having a great time making delicious wines.

2013 Red Mountain AVA Cabernet Sauvignon
								Our 2013 Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon represents a blend from three different vineyards:  Quintessence, Ciel du Cheval, and Klipsun.  The wine is a stunner and probably the most exciting wine I've put in bottle for this variety. 

AROMATICS
Impressive black fruit aromas bolstered by red currant, fresh cedar, and a hint of spice. 
PALATE
Balanced, rich Red Mountain plate. As it opens the wine takes on the subtle notes of a World Class Cabernet Sauvignon:  Black olive, mineral, and liquid Iron.

$30 per bottle (750mL)  



 








2013 Boushey Vineyard Syrah
								2013 represents the 8th vintage working Dick Boushey and his famed Syrah site. We blend four different clones ranging in age from 11 to 22 years (representing the 2nd oldest planting in Washington State). We are thrilled to be able to source all the Syrah from this particular site.

Download Fact Sheet [PDF]

Aromatics
Floral and finesse driven Syrah.  Wonderful hints of orange peel and candied lavender. As the wine opens it takes on that tell-tale Boushey Syrah Funk.  Incredible.

Palate
Lush, juicy, and silky with smooth and refined tannins.  Great spice and energy. 

$30 per bottle (750 mL) 								



 








2015 Glaze Cabernet Sauvignon, Columbia Valley
								The 2015 Glaze is a blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot and is fantastic.  This is your wine to pop mid-week when you just want something great, but don't want to think too much about it. We've sourced fruit from the central Columbia Valley as well as the Horse Heaven Hills to provide us with the best vineyards that will allow us to produce a wine of incredible quality at at a high level.  You need to have a case of this on hand at all times.

Download Fact Sheet [PDF] 

Aromatics
Cabernet and Merlot share the stage nicely with tell-tale Cabernet aromatics blending nicely with a touch of chocolate and orange peel.

Palate
Just enough structure to let you know this is Cabernet Sauvignon, but not so much that it needs time in the cellar.  Wonderful flavor and spice.

$15 per bottle (750 mL) 












2014 RA The Hutsman Cabernet Sauvignon
								The Huntsman Cabernet Sauvignon is a blend of 96% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Petit Verdot.  Our vineyard for this wine are a mix of Washington's finest AVAs:  Red Mountain, Horse Heaven Hills, and the Columbia Valley.  The Petit Verdot darkens the Cabernet Sauvignon just enough and adds incredible aromatics subtlety.  This wine is complex enough to be your Friday night starter or your daily drinker.

Download Fact Sheet [PDF]

$17 per bottle (750mL) ($13 for Club Members)								



 








2016 Celilo Vineyard Pinot Gris
Celilo Vineyard is a meticulously managed site rising high above the Columbia Gorge a few miles NW of Hood River, OR. It is arguably one of the greatest white grape sites in Washington with its cool climate, wonderfully mineral rich soil and high winds that move the 50" of annual rainfall off the canopy. 

Aromatics

The aromatics and palate of this wine really showcase what vine age can do to a wine. Asian pear, white flowers and nectarine. 

Palate

The palate is vibrant and crisp with a touch of minerals on the finish. A perfect food wine. 


$20 per bottle (750 mL)   












2012 Celilo Vineyard Chardonnay
								Celilo vineyard has quickly become one of our favorite sources for White grapes. We've been working with their Pinot Gris since 2006 and are thrilled to have added Chardonnay from one of their oldest blocks to our portfolio. The wine has an incredibly rich aromatic profile with a palate that is all Celilo: bright, crisp and focused. 100 Cases produced. Yep, that's it.

$38 per bottle (750mL) - ($32 for Club Members)

Reviews from Robert Parker's Wine Advocate Nov/Dec 2009
November 30, 2009

 
 

2008 Ross Andrew Winery Celilo Vineyard Pinot Gris        90 Points
The 2008 Celilo Vineyard Pinot Gris offers up a captivating bouquet of melon, citrus, tangerine zest, and mineral.  This leads to a crisp, fruity, dry finish with excellent depth and concentration.  Enjoy this crowd pleaser over the next three years.								  



Reviews from Steve Tanzer's International Wine Cellar Nov/Dec 2009
November  1, 2009

 





2006 Cabernet Sauvignon Columbia Valley    91 Points



Includes 17% Merlot.   Expressive aromas of black fruits, minerals and graphite, plus a whiff of menthol. Round, sweet and accessible, with palate-saturating dark berry, black cherry and tobacco flavors. Very sexy, round wine, finishing with substantial but sweet tannins. This is actually a shade under 14% alcohol. A very strong set of new releases from this producer, virtually all of them showing more generosity of texture than last year's bottlings.



2007 Boushey Vineyard Syrah, Columbia Valley      91 Points
Bright medium ruby-red. Vibrant raspberry, blueberry, smoked meat and floral aromas. Sweet and lush but lively in the mouth, offering a superb combination of fat and floral lift, along with a subtle saline character. The broad, sweetly tannic finish really saturates the mouth with blueberry perfume. This represents a blend of three clones from young vines.


2008 MEADOW, Oregon White Wine        89 Points

A Pinot Blanc dominant blend.  Sweet aromas of stone and soft citrus fruits, spices and flowers. Fresh and enticing, with a captivating sweetness and lovely aromatic lift to the flavors of orange and apricot. A very appealing fruit-driven wine with a supple aftertaste.
 
 
2008 Celilo Vineyard Pinot Gris Columbia Gorge       90 Points
Aromas of stone and citrus fruits. Supple and sweet but with a compellingly juicy character from brisk acidity. Boasts unusual concentration and depth of flavor for Washington pinot gris. The long finish offers lovely sweetness of apple and apricot fruit. Fully two-thirds of the crop was dropped to get the rest ripe, and the harvest did not take place until October 23. 


 

New Releases from Washington State
By Stephen Tanzer

Nov/Dec 09

If this year’s coverage of new releases from Washington State is longer than ever before, that’s because there are more wines worthy of your notice than previously. Sure, I’m still depressed by the number of oxidized, hollow or otherwise flawed wines I taste on my annual visit to Washington State, and amazed that the offending wineries can find homes for these bottles. But today’s stiff competition to sell wine in a difficult economic environment, in conjunction with new plantings of the right varieties in the right sites, the steady maturation of existing vines, and more careful winemaking and élevage, have enabled previous underperformers to make solid wines and allowed Washington’s stars to take their wines to a yet higher level of quality.
Like so many winemakers in California, growers in Washington once harvested strictly on brix levels whether the grapes had achieved phenolic ripeness or not. Then they got the idea that they needed to pick their grapes with fully brown seeds in order to make great wine; and now they’re coming around to thinking that the ideal time to harvest lies somewhere between these two extremes. The result is fresher, better balanced wines that are more likely to enjoy a positive evolution in bottle.
It helps, too, that Washington has enjoyed a favorable recent string of vintages. Many of the new reds I tasted in recent months are from 2007, a vintage most producers are thrilled with. This reasonably warm and even growing season, which avoided serious heat spikes, yielded dense, complex, elegant wines with vibrancy, including many very good whites. Some producers say their 2007s combine the structure and ripeness of the 2005s with the verve of the 2006s, and that the vintage looks to be one of the great ones for Washington. Although the best ’07s I tasted in recent months have the stuffing and balance to be agers, they are often so deep, juicy and attractively fruity now that it’s hard to defer gratification. Many of these wines seem even fresher than the 2006s, and in fact numerous growers reported that these wines have lower pHs and more energy than the previous vintage.
The first half of the 2008 growing season was cooler than usual, and the flowering, budbreak and veraison were up to two weeks later than the norm. But then a very warm August and favorable September weather helped to bring the fruit to near-perfect ripeness, and although the harvest took place from several days to two or three weeks later than that of 2007, the state’s major viticultural areas were lucky enough not to be hit by early frost or fall rains (as the later pickers were in 2009). My early look at the reds suggests that the vintage’s better examples are characterized by very good color, solid backbone, and enticing floral aromatics. Not surprisingly, 2008 appears to be a very good vintage for white wines too. In many cases, alcohol levels, for reds as well as whites, are lower than in recent vintages.
As always, the trickiest category of wines, both for me to score and for consumers to buy, are those that rate in the 87 to 89 point range (i.e., very good but not outstanding). This range includes well-made, nicely balanced and rather refined wines that simply lack the concentration, depth and complexity to merit 90-point ratings. That’s no knock on their quality: in many cases, talented winemakers have done a wonderful job with fruit from very young vines. But this scoring range also includes many other very ripe, overextracted and chunky wines that must be recognized for their sweetness and strength of material, but that come off as a bit heavyhanded and unrefined. Some of these wines get much higher scores in other publications, but I don’t find enough flavor complexity, definition or textural appeal to get overly excited about them. And I doubt that most readers of this publication will either.
Varieties in and out of favor. A sick joke going around Washington State is not a bit funny to many growers. Question: “What’s the difference between syrah and syphilis?” Answer: “At least you can get rid of a case of syphilis.” I should note that many of California’s producers saw their syrahs dead in the marketplace even before the infection spread to Washington. It remains to be seen what will happen to the newest plantings of syrah, especially those that are not in the best sites. There are already instances of producers blending syrah with cabernet, and this trend may continue. The fact that syrah is a tough sell, whether in Washington or California, is a real shame, as there are more superb examples now being produced in both areas than ever before. And in Washington State, a good percentage of them are done in a northern Rhône style that should offer considerable appeal for Francophiles. The best syrahs I tasted in recent months were among the most exciting wines of my tastings.
This year I saw a few new malbec bottlings of interest, but as these wines are not generally in the under-$15 range, they don’t yet represent much of a threat to bottlings from Argentina. The number of grenache bottlings is also on the rise, and some of these are quite intriguing. Meanwhile, the number of really good varietally labeled merlots continues to contract: today they can be counted on the fingers of two hands (a couple that come to mind are examples from Abeja and Woodward Canyon). Bordeaux blends are becoming more and more interesting, with clever winemakers making increasing use of grapes like cabernet franc and petit verdot planted in the right sites, and crafting more complex and complete wines in the process.
All of the following wines were tasted in Washington and in New York in the past four months.


 



Reviews from Robert Parker's Wine Advocate July/August 2008
August 18, 2009

 

2005 Columbia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon          91 Points
The 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon contains 4% Merlot with the fruit sourced from three top-notch vineyards. Deep crimson-colored, it offers up aromas of cedar, tobacco, red and black currants, and black cherry. Full-bodied, ripe, and structured on the palate, it has excellent depth of flavor and outstanding concentration. Give it 2-3 years in the cellar and drink it from 2012 to 2020.    
    

2007 Celilo Vineyard, Columbia Gorge AVA         91 Points
The 2007 Pinot Gris Celilo Vineyard, from a superb terroir for white wine grapes, is medium straw-colored with aromas of apricots, tangerine, spring flowers, and mineral. On the palate, it is crisp, refreshing, vibrant, and balanced. Dry, mouth-filling, and long, there are a great many Alsace wineries that would be proud to turn out a Pinot Gris of this quality.


2007 MEADOW, Oregon White Wine    90 Points
The 2007 Meadow is a Pinot Blanc [dominant] blend sourced from Oregon’s Willamette and Rogue Valleys. Medium straw-colored, it has an enticing bouquet of mineral, spice box, floral notes, melon, and tropical fruits. Complex, ripe, and lively, it is an ideal aperitif wine reminiscent of the village blends produced by Marcel Deiss in Alsace.
    

2006 Boushey Vineyard Syrah, Columbia Valley      91 Points
The 2006 Syrah Boushey Vineyard is a blend of three clones from this renowned terroir. Dark ruby/purple, it offers up a smoky, spicy nose featuring notes of meat, bacon, and blueberry. Layered and ripe on the palate with gobs of spicy, sleek blue and black fruits, this tasty, balanced wine will evolve for 2-3 years and be at its best from 2010 to 2017.


2005 Red Table Wine Columbia Valley     89 Points
The 2005 Red Table Wine, a blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Merlot sourced from three premier vineyards. Smoky, forward, ripe, and sweetly-fruited, the wine has layers of flavor, good balance, and a mediumlong finish. Drink this pleasing effort over the next 4-5 years.
 



Reviews from Wine Enthusiast Magazine July/August 2008
August 18, 2009

 

2006 Boushey Vineyard Syrah, Columbia Valley       91 Points
A blend of three new Syrah clones that were fermented separately, then blended into a satisfying, though still young and somewhat jagged wine that will benefit from more bottle age. It comes out toasty and gamy, with undertones of cured meat, stiff tannins and moist earth. The classic Boushey vineyard flavors of herb, green tea and cured meats are here in abundance. — P.G. (12/31/2008)

Also penned as of the Best Washington wines of 2008


2005 Columbia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon        91 Points
The 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon contains 4% Merlot with the fruit sourced from three top-notch vineyards. Deep crimson-colored, it offers up aromas of cedar, tobacco, red and black currants, and black cherry. Full-bodied, ripe, and structured on the palate, it has excellent depth of flavor and outstanding concentration. Give it 2-3 years in the cellar and drink it from 2012 to 2020.


2007 Celilo Vineyard, Columbia Gorge AVA      89 Points
This is delicious, from 28-year-old vines at the exceptional Celilo Vineyard in Washington’s Columbia Gorge AVA. Bone dry and dappled with spice, this elegant wine has exceptional mouthfeel and length. It’s crisp, subtle and distinctive. — P.G. (12/15/2008)
    

2007 MEADOW, Oregon White Wine       88 Points
This is the first vintage for this spicy tasting room white. It’s lightly spritzy, crisp and bone dry, with white pepper and tart citrus skin. The four grapes in the blend—Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling and Gewürztraminer — complement each other without losing their individuality. Persistent and very refreshing this is a quintessential summer wine. — P.G. (12/15/2008)


2005 Red Table Wine Columbia Valley      88 Points
There’s a lot of Boushey vineyard Cabernet, a little Kiona vineyard Cab and a little Alder Ridge vineyard Merlot in this blend. Bright and spicy, it has deliciously lively plum and currant fruit, hints of loam and coffee, and natural acids that keep it buoyant through the finish. — P.G. (12/31/2008)
 



Reviews from Steve Tanzer's International Wine Cellar  Nov/Dec 2008
November  1, 2008

 

2006 Boushey Vineyard Syrah Columbia Valley     88(+?) Points

Good deep ruby-red. Black fruits complicated by tar, chocolate and meat on the nose. Supple and complex in the mouth, if still a bit stunted by the bottling. Blackberry, licorice and floral flavors show a slightly roasted aspect and a note of game. 


2007 Pinot Gris Celilo Vineyard Columbia Gorge         89 Points
($16) Bright aromas of lemon, orange and butter, complicated by a minty nuance. Juicy and intense, with subtle yet palate-staining fruit and a dusty, almost glyceral impression of extract. Reportedly made from a crop level under three tons per acre, and it shows. 


2007 MEADOW, Oregon White Wine        87 Points
($16; a blend of pinot blanc, gewurztraminer, riesling and pinot gris, all done in stainless steel) Pale color. Crisp, floral aromas. Juicy and quite dry, with subtly aromatic flavors of citrus peel, minerals, spices and wild flowers. Quite dry, almost austere. Should make a light and easy-drinking deck wine.


 

New Releases from Washington State
By Stephen Tanzer

Nov/Dec 08

At a time when some of Washington’s most thoughtful winemakers are considering how they might make ripe, satisfying wines at lower alcohol levels, recent vintages have brought a return to more normal conditions following the 2003-2005 trio of very warm years. In my extensive tastings of Washington wines in Seattle and in Walla Walla Valley at the end of July and in recent weeks back in New York, I sampled 2006 reds from most of the state’s best producers, and I’m happy to report that this was a year that benefited from a more leisurely ripening process. There was a single heat spike in August but the weather cooled off at harvest time and growers could generally pick at their leisure, often well into October. The wines show fresher natural acidity than the 2005s, and in many cases more complexity. With healthier pHs, these wines are likely to enjoy a slow and leisurely development in bottle.
Two thousand seven is also quite different in character from recent hot years like 2005 and 2003, and I was particularly impressed by the freshness of the white wines I tasted—not just viogniers but rieslings, sauvignon/semillon blends and even chardonnays. Early evidence is that 2007 is an exceptional vintage for Washington’s white wines. But with no burst of heat at the end, it was a challenge to get the cabernet fruit fully ripe in some sites, especially where crop loads were too heavy.
Today, many Washington growers are harvesting smarter: they’re picking on flavor profile rather than on Brix levels, waiting for the acids to go down. At the same time, they know they need healthy acidity to make fresh wines, and they would like to rely less on acidification. While growing seasons like ’06 and ’07 (and probably ’08 as well) have been conducive to making wines in this style, there will still remain the longer-term challenge of getting fruit phenolically ripe before grape sugars skyrocket and acidity levels plunge. Hence the constant search for cooler and generally higher-altitude sites with less brutal exposure to the sun, more air movement, and a potentially longer and less extreme growing season.
My annual trip to Washington is always a voyage of discovery, and this year I had the impression of experiencing early releases—and some barrel samples—from more potential future stars than ever before (perhaps not a surprise, as nearly 80 of the state’s roughly 540 wineries will release their first crop of wines from vintage 2006). Among emerging wineries of note are such producers as Cadaretta Winery, Efesté, O’Shea Scarborough, Pacific Rim, Trust Cellars, Va Piano and Woodinville Cellars. Add these to the list of producers I named last year—àMaurice Cellars, Chateau Rollat, Brian Carter Cellars, Gramercy Cellars, Mark Ryan Winery and Waters Winery—and wine lovers have a pretty impressive list of new choices. And then there’s Corliss Estates, this year’s #1 new superstar on the Washington scene, with a bullet

Best Washington wines of 2008
December 19, 2008

 
The best Washington wines of 2008, as picked by Seattle Times Wine Adviser Paul Gregutt.
With each passing year, my list of the year's Top 100 Washington wines gets more competitive. We now have nearly 600 wineries in the state, so even limiting it to one listing per winery means that five out of six wineries won't even appear on the list.
Washington wines do well on other Top 100 lists, and though these are not inexpensive wines, they are far less expensive than most of the wines that show up elsewhere. This list is the only one that focuses exclusively on wines made with Washington grapes — and the only one compiled by a single individual living and working here.
Whether or not you always agree with my choices, I hope they will encourage you to explore many of the wineries (listed from 1 to 100 on page 10), and not just for the specific wine on the list, but for all of their wines. Quality is rarely an accident; if the winery made one great wine, they probably made quite a few really good ones.
Every wine on this list has been scored 90 points or higher by me on the standard 100-point wine-rating system. Within each scoring category, I have listed the wines from least to most expensive, awarding a higher slot to the cheaper wines, because they offer the most value. They have all been released within the 2008 calendar year, but be advised — some are already sold out. Your wine seller can guide you to what is still available, and in some instances he or she may have a newer vintage in stock. (See a list of wine shops on page 10.)
This special NW Ticket edition of the Wine Adviser column will close out the year. In 2009, Wine Adviser will move to Pacific Northwest Magazine, the Times' Sunday magazine, and will appear weekly beginning in February. I wish you all a holiday season filled with good friends and family, good health and, of course, good wine!
Paul Gregutt's Top 100 Washington State Wines For 2008

2. Leonetti Cellar 2005 Reserve Red ($110)
3. Cayuse 2006 En Cerise Syrah ($65)
4. Quilceda Creek 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon ($115)
5. Woodward Canyon 2006 Estate Red ($60)

One Man's Wine
By Roger Downey

Suppose that, right out of college, you decide you want to spend your life making wine—your own wine, not someone else's. Your family isn't wealthy, nor does it own vineyards or a winery, both fairly high-capital enterprises. What do you do to break into a very high-stakes game?

Ross Mickel is doing it the hard way. To get a toehold in the business, he worked the harvest in Oregon's Willamette Valley, picking up what he could during the most frenzied weeks in the winemaker's year. With a little experience under his belt, he began apprenticing to established winemakers, trading his labor for their experience. In time, he established an ongoing year-round relationship with Bob Betz, one of the Northwest's most respected wine scientists and educators, and, in a very small way, one of its most respected winemakers as well.

Delivering Betz wines to the specialty shops selected to carry them, Mickel made more connections, so that when, in 2003, he released 250 cases (3,000 bottles) under his own Ross Andrew label, he wasn't just another unknown competing for top retailers' attention and shelf space. Mickel's ongoing association with Betz also helped when buying grapes; his second (2001) release, due out this fall, was composed of fruit from name acreage like Alder Ridge, Boushey, and Hedges.

Many beginning winemakers try to hedge their bets by making half a dozen different wines; often, distracted, they fail to ring the bell with any. For the foreseeable future, Mickel plans to make just one, labeled as cabernet sauvignon but containing a legally permissible admixture of merlot fruit. This choice has both advantages and disadvantages: In Washington, as in California, the cabernet market is dominated by famous labels with long pedigrees and commanding high prices. A newcomer has to price his product modestly enough to persuade sophisticated buyers to experiment (Mickel's '01 Ross Andrew will run $25), but high enough to indicate that he's serious about contending with the big names. (Fair or not, wines priced under $20 rarely develop much buzz where buzz counts.)

A lot of cabernet winemakers go for maximum heft and impact: The result can be impressive but rough, and need a few years in bottle to lose their asperity. Mickel prefers a suaver approach; the wine he's releasing this fall has been a year in bottle to date, but, a distinctive cabernet aroma apart, it's as easy on the palate as wines made mostly from the traditionally softer merlot grape, though the blend is actually four-fifths cab.

Mickel upped his production slightly for the '01, to 350 cases; 425 cases of the '02 are slated for '05 release. When you consider that the '03 Ross Andrew is already waiting to be blended before the '01 is released, you can see why Mickel favors a wine that asks to be drunk right away. "It's a pretty big investment, spending three years making wine before you find out whether anyone likes the style of wine you make."

Meant to Be
By Roger Downey

The ancient folkways of the grape never really took root in North America, so it's understandable if our winemakers' tales are fraught with epiphanies: sudden midlife course corrections, abrupt trade-ins of hot urban concrete for cool Mother Earth. Maybe it's a sign that wine has finally gone native that an easygoing Bellevue boy could drift into winemaking as if it were the most natural move in the world.

An English major at the University of Washington, Ross Mickel had his first brush with the wine game when a childhood friend suggested he work as a wine waiter at the friend's family's restaurant. Since the childhood friend was Mark Canlis, Mickel abruptly found himself counseling some of the region's wealthiest and most knowledgeable wine consumers on their beverage choices before he was all that secure in the subject himself.

Once in the wine bag, Mickel got serious, flying to UC Davis for weekend winemaking classes, with luck and contacts at home ensuring that theory got blended with practice. A college classmate working at Woodinville's DeLille Cellars introduced Mickel to DeLille winemaker Chris Upchurch, who put him to work as a "rat" around the winery. In another lucky twist, Ste. Michelle winemaker Bob Betz was using DeLille's plant to produce his own wines, and Mickel soon found himself assisting one of America's most admired winemakers in crafting his spare-no-expense boutique syrahs and Bordeaux-style blends. In 1999, Mickel produced his first solo wine from the 2000 harvest, a fairly standard "meritage" blend of 55 percent cabernet sauvignon grapes, 40 percent merlot, and 5 percent cabernet franc. But thanks to his reflected credibility from Master of Wine Betz, Mickel was able to procure grapes from some of Washington's best growing sites, including Alder Ridge, Milbrandt, and Taptiel.

Briskly tannic without raspiness, refreshingly acidic, the three-year-old wine favors fruitiness over weight, a distinct advantage when most Washington reds, no matter how gnarlyexcuse me, "age-worthy"are consumed the year of their release.

Mickel is delighted at the reception his debutant is getting. "I think people I know who taste it are thinking, 'What can I say nice about it?' because after they do, they say, 'I like it! No, I really like it." He'll have no trouble placing the mere 200 cases made at about $25 per bottle. That won't come close to paying off what Mickel and his partners ("well, parents") have invested in the enterprise so far, but it's a great base to build on.

On the threshold of wider recognition, does he regret not having a more stormy tale of struggle to tell? "Not really; I've been lucky, sure. But looking back, it seems like it was all just meant to be."

Where to buy and drink wine discussed in this week's Sips column:

Ross Andrew 2000 Columbia Valley Red is available on the wine lists of Eva, Chez Shea, Canlis, el Gaucho, Waterfront, and Jack's Steakhouses in Issaquah, West Seattle, and Sand Point. It is also available at retail shops including Pike & Western, McCarthy & Schiering Queen Anne and Roosevelt, and Pete's Wines Eastside and Larry's Market in Bellevue.

About the Wine


Cabernet Sauvignon | Red Wine | Columbia Valley | Washington
Tasting notes: Aromas of deep blackberry, red currant, cedar and tobacco aromatics are followed by a hint of cherry and lavender. The potent nose makes way for a full-bodied, ripe structure on the palate with fantastic depth of flavor and terrific concentration. This Cabernet has a drink me now appeal, but has the potential to age well. .
Style: Full bodied
 Varietal content: 93% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot
Alcohol: 13.9%

About Washington
Get the Full Story






The proliferation of new wineries in Washington State has slowed in the past couple of years, but the landscape today is radically different from even 15 years ago. As recently as the early 1990s the Washington wine scene was dominated by a few large players who also owned a high percentage of planted vineyard land. Today, most of the excitement is being generated by small, quality-minded wineries, and the industrial-scale producers are mostly competing at the low end of the market.
Cabernet and Merlot are Washington's most serious and successful varieties, with Syrah rapidly increasing in popularity thanks to the efforts of some talented newcomers. Red wine is generally growing as a percentage of total production of premium wines, even if Riesling still has considerable commercial importance.
Most of Washington's grapes are grown in the desert east of the Cascade mountains, in the Columbia and Yakima River Valleys, where annual rainfall is so low that the vineyards must be irrigated. The vines in Washington benefit from long daylight hours during the summer, and a longer growing season than California (grapes are usually picked well into October). Although daytime temperatures can be quite hot, frequently surpassing 100 degrees, generally cool September nights allow the grapes to retain healthy acidity, resulting in wines with noteworthy intensity of varietal character. The greatest threat to grape-growing in Washington is winter frost, which can sometimes be severe enough to kill vines, as it did during the winters of 1996 and 2004.

Here's a very tasty Cabernet Sauvignon for everyday enjoyment with burgers, steaks, or just sharing with friends.  It's a blend of 80% Cabernet and 20% Merlot from selected Columbia Valley vineyards with just enough oak for roundness and extra interest.  Rich red currant and eucalyptus on the nose with grace notes of spice and mocha.  Juicy and rich on the palate, with currant and blackberry fruit, gentle oak, and sweet spice.  The ripe fruit and spice flavors carry through the easygoing finish where supple tannins provide support.
