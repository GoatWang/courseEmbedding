Foster & Associates Taps CEO for Aurora Plastics 

 February 23, 2017 – Executive search firm Foster & Associates has placed Darrell K. Hughes as chief executive officer of Aurora Plastics Inc. Robert Foster, the firm’s president, led the assignment.
Mr. Hughes replaces Jim Domo who left the company at the end of last year. He previously served as vice president and general manager of the pressure sensitive materials business at Avery Dennison North American. Prior to that, he worked at GE Plastics, where he held successive positions as general manager of global business development, general manager of the RTV and elastomers business, and president and general manager for specialty film and sheet.
“Aurora has a strong track record of organic growth based on excellent product technology, quality and customer service, “said Mr. Domo. “With the company’s recent change in ownership to Wind Point Partners / Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, and now the addition of Darrell, Aurora can build on its strengths and add additional focus on growth.” Wind Point Partners acquired Aurora Plastics last August.
“It was extremely gratifying to work with Wind Point to, in essence, put the band back together at Aurora Plastics and recruit Darrell Hughes as the new lead member,” said Mr. Foster.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/29/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

The AuroraLite™ product line is comprised of rigid cellular PVC foam compounds in the 0.35 – 0.80 density range – one of the lowest in the industry. These materials are available in both free-foam and Celuka-based formulations. The end result is a lightweight, yet durable profile that is ideal for an array of interior or exterior applications, including decking, railings, garage and wall trim, arbors and pergolas as well as for custom use.
The AuroraShield™ line of products includes PVC/acrylic capstock compounds that represent a proven solution for long-term weatherability and resistance to water whitening, especially in darker colors. From a manufacturing perspective, these products process with the ease of PVC but provide the superior weatherability of acrylic. It gets applied thinner which results in significant bottom-line benefits for customers.
“In order to position our ever-growing exterior weatherable capstock and rigid cellular PVC foam products, we felt that establishing product line brand names would further build awareness and enhance customer trust in Aurora Plastics,” said Matthew Kuwatch, vice president of marketing and business development.
With two of the newest ISO 9001:2008 certified production facilities in the industry and an ongoing commitment to investing in new material technology platforms, Aurora Plastics continues to lead the industry in innovation, quality and technical support. Its unparalleled seven-day lead time to shipment means that customers can save costs by maintaining lower inventory levels yet still meet tight order schedules.

The local politics of plastics might have just gotten a bit more interesting.
Streetsboro, Ohio-based Aurora Plastics has appointed Darrell K. Hughes as its new CEO and installed Matt D. McDonald as chief financial officer.
That might intrigue local industry watchers, because McDonald is involved in a major lawsuit with Fairlawn, Ohio-based A. Schulman Inc., which says it was defrauded by McDonald, Calif.-based Huntsman Gay Capital Partners and Boston's Charlesbank in an $800 million acquisition in 2015.
That's when Schulman bought Indiana-based Citadel Plastics from Huntsman and Charlesbank in a deal that Schulman now says it made based on false information about Citadel's operations and finances. Schulman has twice since had to revise its earnings estimates downward, as it struggled with former Citadel plants and operations, leading to the ouster of Schulman CEO Bernard Rzepka in August, along with a sharp decrease in the company's stock price.
"If we would have uncovered the fraud in due diligence, we would not have done the deal," says current Schulman CEO Joe Gingo, who was chairman at the time of the Citadel transaction. He recently hired advisers with Citi to assist Schulman with a review of its business and strategic direction.
Schulman is suing Citadel's sellers, along with former Citadel CEO Michael Huff and former Citadel CFO McDonald, for an unspecified amount, over what it alleges was fraud in the representation of Citadel before the transaction.
In announcing its new executive team, Aurora Plastics noted that McDonald had experience with Citadel, but an Aurora spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Aurora did not say whether the new appointments are the result of the August acquisition of the company by Chicago-based Wind Point partners, which teamed with Canada's Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan to buy Aurora in August. Wind Point was also the previous owner of Citadel, before selling it to Huntsman in 2012.
McDonald, who was Citadel's CFO from 2007 to 2014, has prior experience with Wind Point from that role. In his new position, he is replacing Tony Lamorte, who was already planning to retire as Aurora's CFO this year before the recent change in ownership, said Kuwatch.
Aurora's outgoing CEO, Jim Domo, will remain with the company through the end of 2016 as an adviser. After that, Domo will leave to pursue "other interests," according to Kuwatch.
His replacement, Hughes, was most recently vice president and general manager of the California-based Avery Dennison's North American business for pressure-sensitive materials. Prior to that, he worked at GE Plastics as a general manager of global business development and several business units, according to Aurora.
Aurora did not say what, if any, other major changes would come with its new management team. Domo, however, expressed confidence in the new leadership.
"Aurora has a strong track record of organic growth based on excellent product technology, quality and customer service," Domo said in Aurora's announcement. "With the company's recent change in ownership to Wind Point Partners/Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, and now the addition of Darrell and Matt, Aurora can build on its strengths and add additional focus on growth," he added.
Aurora is a private company that does not disclose its sales. Kuwatch said the company employs about 75 people in Streetsboro and its plant in North Carolina.
