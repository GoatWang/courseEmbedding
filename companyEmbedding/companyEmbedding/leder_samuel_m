Leder Group - Company Profile





























































































 
 





 





 

The Leder Group is the product of forty years of successful 
                  real estate investing orchestrated by Dr. Samuel E. Leder. Dr. 
                  Leder began his career as a veterinarian in 1962. By 1964, 
                  Academy Animal Hospital, located on Federal Highway in Fort 
                  Lauderdale, opened its doors as his first small animal 
                  practice. December 1995 marked the sale of the last of Dr. 
                  Leder's eleven veterinary practices. While his veterinary 
                  license is still active, he no longer practices.
Shortly after the inception of Dr. Leder's first veterinary 
                  practice, he began investing in commercial real estate. His 
                  approach, at the time, had more to do with creating alternate 
                  sources of cash flow to supplement what he could produce from 
                  his veterinary practice than with trying to create a real 
                  estate organization.
In August 1995, Dr. Leder's oldest son, Sean Leder, 
                  returned to Florida from New York City to work with his father 
                  on the family's real estate interests. Previously, Sean spent 
                  two years working on Wall Street, the last of which was spent 
                  underwriting equity and debt financings for Real Estate 
                  Investment Trusts with Merrill Lynch in their Real Estate 
                  Investment Banking Division. During that time, Sean had the 
                  opportunity to work with some of the most professionally 
                  managed and well-financed real estate organizations in the 
                  country.
Sean Leder, as Chief Executive Officer of The Leder Group, 
                  is responsible for the day-to-day management of the family's 
                  and their partners' holdings. Additionally, he is responsible 
                  for evaluating all new acquisition, development and management 
                  opportunities.
The Leder Group Philosophy on investing in real estate is 
                  based on the aggressive and proactive acquisition and 
                  management of assets that are approached from a buy and hold 
                  perspective. We are very selective based on the fact that we 
                  are averse to selling assets once they have been acquired.
Dr. Leder's forty years of investing experience, coupled 
                  with the youthful energy of his son, empowers The Leder Group 
                  to maximize opportunities in the acquisition, development and 
                  management of investment properties.

         Origins and Descendants of the Elder Samuel Jackson Murray of Virginia: The Story of Nine Generation          Quantity in Basket:None Code: 101-M3146Price: $28.00                   Quantity:          Origins and Descendants of the Elder Samuel Jackson Murray of Virginia: The Story of Nine Generations of the Murray Family since 1700  - Lewis R. Murray. This is principally an amalgamation of data collected over the years, of oral history passed down to the author, a career American diplomat, through relatives and people who have known his family, and the results of some formal research that has recently been concluded. Some personal recollections of the author's childhood are also included. The first section of the book presents a general background of Caroline County and social-economic conditions in Colonial Virginia during the 18th century, and a review of early Scottish immigration patterns. It includes a summary of interesting documented references to people of the period carrying the Murray surname (however spelled), and selected citations of specific references to Murrays in Caroline County during the 18th and early 19th centuries. It also identifies the parents and grandparents of the family's first remembered ancestor, the elder Samuel Jackson Murray, born in Virginia on the eve of the War of Independence. The second section is devoted to a review of seven generations of Murrays from that time: the elder Samuel J. Murray, James M. Murray, James Hope Murray, Lewis Roy Murray, Sr., Lewis Roy Murray, Jr., his daughter Alexia Justine Murray, and finally, her daughter Luce who was born in Rome in 2004. The third section contains a study of the Murray family's Virginia origins done by Norman Peters, a professional genealogical researcher; a set of genealogical charts compiled by Mr. Peters; and a selection of references to various Murrays in Caroline County documents from 1747 to 1810. Finally, this work concludes with appendices containing copies and transcripts of correspondence, and copies of historical documents 2005, 5�x8�, paper, 254 pp.   $28.00 M3146 ISBN: 0788431463
