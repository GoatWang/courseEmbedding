Vinyl Siding Contractor








Vinyl Siding Installation in Connecticut (CT)
WHP offers a variety of vinyl siding products that allow homeowners to not only increase the value of their home, but give it a unique appearance they can be proud of. The vinyl siding we install is manufactured by CertainTeed, who is the industry leader in residential vinyl siding. White Home Products' siding mechanics are certified by the Vinyl Siding Institute and have been installing our siding for more than 15 years. We are also a CertainTeed Master Craftsman installer and are recommended by their online contractor referral program (in the southern Connecticut area), as we have been installing their products since 1990.
About CertainTeed Siding Products
CertainTeed is one of the most reputable names in the industry having pioneered the way vinyl siding is manufactured by everyone today. In addition, CertainTeed has the largest selection of vinyl siding colors available in the market. WHP offers the monogram clapboard panel which is the finest clapboard style product you can put on your home.  A wind rating of 180 mph and a thickness of .046” makes for a very strong panel accompanied by an authentic woodgrain look.
CertainTeed’s Cedar Impressions siding is yet another look revolutionary to the home improvement industry.  It has a distinctly natural look of wood cedar shingles with no visible seams.  In addition, this product is .100” thick and features a temperature gauge on each individual panel for precision siding installation. CertainTeed has been a leader in manufacturing building materials for over 100 years.

Doors








Door Contractors in Connecticut (CT)
WHP offers a variety of doors for your home including entry doors, patio doors, french doors, and storm doors. We specialize in Therma-Tru entry doors, which have been the brand leader in quality and used most by builders for the past several years. These fiberglass doors were pioneered by Therma-Tru in 1983 and are significantly more durable and efficient than outdated steel and wood doors. This product won’t crack, warp or rot like wood, and is not susceptible to rust or corrosion and everyday dings/dents as steel doors are.
All of our entry doors can not only be painted, but are stainable as well. A special technology is used to give the door an authentic wood grain look that when finished with stain, cannot be differentiated from wood. Factory painting and staining are available to make it easier on you! 
In addition to WHP's collection of fiberglass entry doors, other Therma-Tru products available for installation are patio doors, sliding glass doors and french doors.
            
›  Therma-Tru is the number one brand in fiberglass entry doors in the US.
Wincore
We now also offer a full line of Wincore Entry Doors. Wincore manufactures a fully composite door system that comes standard with a factory finish in your choice of 21 paint colors or 10 stains. The finished product results in a beautiful looking entryway that is totally maintenance free.

Decking & Railing Systems








Deck and Railing Systems in Connecticut (CT)
White Home Products also offers installations of maintenance free composite decking and railing systems. The possibility of having a beautiful deck that lasts for years is easier to attain now more than ever. By using composite deck and railing materials homeowners no longer have the worry of painting or staining a deck every couple of years, or the worries of wood rot and splintering. More and more people are turning to maintenance free materials on their homes, as they add curb appeal and value, and now the ability to have a maintenance free deck is another great option.
CertainTeed Evernew Decking and Panorama Railings
The decking and railing products White Home Products offer include the CertanTeed Evernew line of decking products, and the Panorama Rail System. These are among the highest rated composite decking and railing systems in the industry. Both beautiful and strong the CertainTeed line of composite decks and rails give homeowners various options when choosing a new deck. The decking material consists of a wood and plastic resin core with a resistant surface coating, which has stain, fade and scratch resistant technology. It is backed by the industry's only 20 year fade and stain warranty.
The Panorama rail system is similar in its composition to the decking, with a solid core and a composite skin coating. This provides for a clean finish while also allowing for the strength and durability needed for the support a rail system should have.

Product Description▼▲
Through the prayers in the Bible we look into the profoundest issues of life and death, and the deepest longings of our own hearts. And we learn about the God to whom we pray, the one who wants to talk with us, the one who takes the initiative in our relationship with him.  In this classic book on prayer, John White helps us listen to Abraham plead for Sodom and Gomorrah. We watch Jacob wrestle with the Angel of the Lord. We hear David confess his sin. We also see David dance before the ark of the covenant. We hear Hannah ask for a child. Finally, John White shows how Jesus' prayers on the cross present a model for facing our last hours as well. The ten prayers in this book will take you near to the holy one of the universe, the personal God of every person in the world.

John White was born in Liverpool, England, on March 5, 1924, and grew up in Manchester. After serving as a reconnaissance photographer in the Fleet Air Arms during World War II, he completed medical training at Manchester University. He later participated in a variety of short-term missions efforts (including Bible smuggling!) and capitalized on many opportunities to encourage Christians behind the Iron Curtain during the beginning of the Cold War.  On June 25, 1955, White married Laureate May O'Hara. From 1955 to 1964 he served as a medical missionary with New Tribes Mission. Later he was appointed associate general secretary of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students of Latin America.  White emigrated to Canada with his family in 1965 and later completed his residency in psychiatry in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He next filled the post of associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Manitoba and also served locally as pastor of Church of the Way.  He wrote 25 books as well as numerous articles and study guides. A much sought-after speaker, he lectured around the world at churches, conferences and leadership events. During his later life, White moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, helping to plant a Vineyard church there (Surrey Vineyard) and becoming involved in the larger Vineyard Christian Fellowship.  John White died in 2002, but his written ministry lives on, with over 1.5 million of his books in print.

Product Description▼▲
Short deadlines...Not enough staff...Tight budgets... Personal attacks...External opposition...Internal conflicts...A huge task. Every leader faces these problems but as Christians, should we solve them by using the secular strategies or is there another way? John White says there is. Nehemiah provides the model we need for excellence in leadership. From the way he overcame obstacles, we find practical solutions for surmounting the problems we encounter. From the way he achieved his goals, we learn how to accomplish the work God has called us to. With the wisdom and biblical insight John White is known for, he shows how to be action-oriented and prayer-oriented, a firm leader and a servant, a realist and a visionary.

Publisher's Description▼▲
 Short deadlines Not enough staff Tight budgets Personal attacks External opposition Internal conflicts A huge task  Every leader faces these problems. But as Christians, should we solve them by using the secular strategies of best-selling management books? Or is there another way? John White says there is. Nehemiah provides the model we need for excellence in leadership. From the way he overcame obstacles, we find practical solutions for surmounting the problems we encounter. From the way he achieved his goals, we learn how to accomplish the work God has called us to. With the wisdom and biblical insight John White is known for, he shows how to be action-oriented and prayer-oriented, a firm leader and a servant, a realist and a visionary. This book confronts the crises facing leaders today. Here White inspires and guides us in our task. A book for present and future leaders.


Author Bio▼▲
John White was born in Liverpool, England, on March 5, 1924, and grew up in Manchester. After serving as a reconnaissance photographer in the Fleet Air Arms during World War II, he completed medical training at Manchester University. He later participated in a variety of short-term missions efforts (including Bible smuggling!) and capitalized on many opportunities to encourage Christians behind the Iron Curtain during the beginning of the Cold War.  On June 25, 1955, White married Laureate May O'Hara. From 1955 to 1964 he served as a medical missionary with New Tribes Mission. Later he was appointed associate general secretary of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students of Latin America.  White emigrated to Canada with his family in 1965 and later completed his residency in psychiatry in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He next filled the post of associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Manitoba and also served locally as pastor of Church of the Way.  He wrote 25 books as well as numerous articles and study guides. A much sought-after speaker, he lectured around the world at churches, conferences and leadership events. During his later life, White moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, helping to plant a Vineyard church there (Surrey Vineyard) and becoming involved in the larger Vineyard Christian Fellowship.  John White died in 2002, but his written ministry lives on, with over 1.5 million of his books in print.

            John White takes his reader into God's presence for an understanding and practical ways of applying God's wisdom and power for leadership. He does this by following Nehemiah through the challenge and triumph of accomplishing an impossible task. I highly recomend this book to anyone serious about leading others according to God's ways.
