ABOUT SEWELL




 
 






SEWELL SERVICE DEPARTMENT





            Every vehicle needs service, but not every dealership makes service as convenient as Sewell.  We offer complimentary loan cars, complimentary car washes and the opportunity to make a reservation online to our Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio customers. We even give you the option of not making a reservation at all.

Just bring in your vehicle to our  service department when you need us – we welcome you anytime, at your convenience. Or, if you are more comfortable making a reservation, simply give us a call or utilize our online tools to reserve Sewell automotive service appointments and Sewell parts orders.
