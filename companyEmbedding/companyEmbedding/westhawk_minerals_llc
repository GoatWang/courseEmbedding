Westhawk Minerals

Posted by Susan A Tippel on May 6, 2012 at 9:40am in General Shale Discussions

Hello,

I signed with Shell last year.  Now I got a letter from Westhawk MInerals offering $3,000 an acre for my mineral right. I must admit it is a little bit tempting since I do not know if I am going to be in a unit or if Shell plans on drilling any time soon, and I am looking to retire.  I have 52 acres in Londonderry township in Guernsey county.  Any thoughts?

I'd hold out  on retiring  or least think very very hard about it! I know of individuals that couldn't wait to retire and found out being with the wife 24/7 isn't as easy as the work was. Ya normally see these guys at Walmart saying Welcome to Walmart! Selling mineral rights is a one time deal with no turning back. With a lease you might if worded right get a decent bonus and possibly renewal payment or another lease plus royalty
 You might consider selling the property outright with mineral rights included which opens the door to speculators also.

I personally would wait at least a year and see what shell does. 156,000.00 is good money but you could do better. If I was to sell them I would contact an auction house and see if they are interested. I really think 156 thousand for 52 acres of minerals seems low.
Recently someone sold theirs already leased for more at auction. The link was on this site but I don't remember where right now. If I remember right it was 100 acres and they got 3800.00 per acre. That would be 41,600 more minus the auction fee. If the drilling picks up and the numbers are good in your area these numbers could even go higher and you wouldn't have the tax burden of the royalties.
Everyone has their own personal thought on this topic with some people saying never sell. I think if someone really thinks about it, looks at it in all directions and still wants to sell than they should sell.

I have decided to wait.  Westhawk does not have website that I could find and that is not good.  And, yes, the price seems low. Thanks for responding.

LOL. I've wanted to retire since I was 21(I'm a women and staying home with the man won't be any picnic either).  But I am going to wait--you are right--selling mineral rights is very permanent.

Susan,
 
Did Shell pay you ?
Were you in a group or did you sign the standard Shell lease ?

I was in the Matt Crislip group.  Yes, I got paid. Although I know there are people who have not been paid yet.

What makes this site so great? Well, I think it's the fact that, quite frankly, we all have a lot at stake in this thing they call shale. But beyond that, this site is made up of individuals who have worked hard for that little yard we call home. Or, that farm on which blood, sweat and tears have fallen. [ Read More ]

Some opting to sell rather than lease mineral rights
Intelligencer/Wheeling News-Register photo by Casey JunkinsAs Ohio County Clerk Patricia Fahey and her staff continue recording oil and natural gas leases for Marcellus and Utica shale drilling, some companies are now purchasing minerals instead of merely leasing them.
WHEELING, W.Va. — It appears as if a slight shift is taking place in the local gas leasing rush, as at least one firm is now purchasing entire mineral tracts from Upper Ohio Valley property owners instead of entering into lease agreements.
The amounts offered for buying minerals can vary widely.
Belmont County Recorder’s Office data indicate Oklahoma City-based Westhawk Minerals LLC paid about $8,750 per acre for one particular 51.66-acre tract near Shadyside in November, while the firm tendered a little more than $6,000 per acre for another tract near Fairpoint in August.
In West Virginia, Westhawk paid about $6,667 per acre for land in the Bethlehem area, the Ohio County Clerk’s Office shows.
The firm paid amounts ranging from $3,000-$4,100 per acre in Marshall County, records indicate.
The practice can be beneficial for property owners, in that the up-front payment likely will be higher than what is offered through a lease agreement. But royalties are not included, and for tracts with true drilling potential this could mean the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars over the life of a lease.
Tim Greene, owner of Land and Mineral Management of Appalachia and a former West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection inspector, said purchasing minerals instead of just leasing them is fairly common.
“Lots of companies just buy them and flip them onto someone else,” he said of the practice of the purchasing firm selling the minerals to another company. “But if they buy all the minerals, that is it. You won’t get any royalties or anything else.
“If getting $100,000 right now could change my life, selling out might be something I am interested in,” Greene added.
Charlie Burd, executive director of the Independent Oil and Gas Association of West Virginia, said some firms purchasing oil and natural gas minerals may already have agreements to transfer those properties to established drilling firms. Sometimes, companies do this so they can acquire the land at a lower price than they would have to pay if property owners knew the identity of the ultimate owner.
“It’s not atypical for one company to purchase minerals in hopes of selling them to a major company,” Burd said. “They may already have a contract with a major company, but there could be a non-disclosure agreement in place.”
Burd said mineral owner groups often form to negotiate better terms with a company. He said companies assembling blocks of acreage to sell to a driller is a similar scenario.
The Sunday News-Register reported on such a situation in 2010 during the early stages of the region’s drilling boom, when a company known as Ed Broome Inc. of Glenville, W.Va., sold 22,000 acres of oil and gas rights in Wetzel County to Chesapeake Energy for $22 million. Broome had speculated on the mineral rights over a period of years, and when the drilling boom began, he quickly agreed to the deal with Chesapeake.
Greene said a mineral owner may actually receive more money in a lump sum than they otherwise would, citing the fact that a driller may decide to never produce gas from one’s property.
“It’s all about how badly you need the money, and how long you are willing to wait to get that money,” he said. “By leasing, you are likely to make more money over time. But, you may not have that time.”
Messages left with Westhawk officials were not immediately returned. According to the firm’s website, it has more than 35 years experience in purchasing oil and natural gas assets.
“In the long term, we feel the oil and natural gas prices will generally trend upward and we believe buying oil and gas rights now is a good investment,” the website states.
