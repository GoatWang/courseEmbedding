Equivalent Models List
(click to view related information):Below is a model
equivalency list which identifies OEM machines (in bold / blue) that
are sold by other companies under their own brand names. Typically,
troubleshooting / error codes / machine parts are identical, but some
may be modified to the rebranded company's specifications by the OEM -
you will want to verify this when purchasing parts from your parts
supplier. Toner, cartridges, and other consumables will most likely not
be identical, so you will want to make note of this when purchasing
these products.

Effects of urban development on stream ecosystems along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, Colorado and WyomingProduct Type: Fact SheetYear: 2006Author(s): Sprague, L.A., R.E. Zuellig, and J.A. DupreeSuggested Citation: Sprague, L.A., R.E. Zuellig, and J.A. Dupree. 2006. Effects of urban development on stream ecosystems along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, Colorado and Wyoming. Fact Sheet 2006-3083. U.S. Geological Survey. 4 p. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducted a study from 2002 through 2003 through its National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program to determine the effects of urbanization on the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of stream ecosystems along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. The objectives of the study were to (1) examine physical, chemical, and biological responses at sites ranging from minimally to highly developed; (2) determine the major physical, chemical, and landscape variables affecting aquatic communities at these sites; and (3) evaluate the relevance of the results to the management of water resources in the South Platte River Basin.

                    If you have been thinking about upgrading to a larger home or a different neighborhood but have been putting it off until the real estate market improves then it may be time to bite the bullet. The bull market is back in Ocala, but who knows for how long. Low inventory of homes for sale coupled with increasing buyer demand has created a seller's market once again. Even new construction has resumed, a tell tale sign that prices are up. Don't be fooled though, the market is not back to its record highs, but prices are up and houses are selling within days of being listed and frequently with multiple offers. This is fantastic news for the Ocala real estate market and for your if you are thinking about selling your home. The first step is to contact a local realtor who can perform a comparative market analysis of your home's value so that you know what to expect going forward. Don't let the seller's market pass you by. Seize the opportunity to sell your home today.
