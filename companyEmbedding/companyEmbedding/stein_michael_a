Michael Stein

Ralph and Mary Otis Isham
Professor,
                Department of Statistics and  the College

  My research focuses on statistical models and methods for spatial and
spatial-temporal processes. In particular, I am interested in the nature of
the spatial-temporal interactions implied by these models and on developing
statistical methods for assessing these interactions.
  
  My main motivation for studying spatial-temporal processes is to describe
variations in the physical environment. In recent years, most of my efforts
in this direction relate to problems in climate and weather.  Two
topics of current interest are methods for combining output from
deterministic climate models with observational data to produce realistic
spatially and temporally resolved simulations of future temperature and
precipitation fields, and ways of estimating temperature extremes that take
proper account of seasonality, long-term trends and spatial structure.

Climate datasets (either computer-generated or observational) are generally
quite large, leading to two major thrusts of my research.  First, when one
has lots of spatial-temporal data for the natural environment, it is
often apparent that the process is nonstationary in space, time, or both.
Thus, the development of nonstationary models plays a central role in my
current research.  Second, when one has large datasets with complex
dependencies,
computational issues are critical as they relate to evaluating likelihoods
and running simulations.  Much of my recent research has considered bringing
to bear modern tools from numerical linear algebra to these computational
problems.

Michael Stein is a trial attorney and partner with Tisdale & Nicholson, LLP in Los Angeles.  Now in his 29th year of practice, Mike specializes in business and employment litigation and has represented clients in matters involving a multitude of subject areas including commercial contract disputes, antitrust, unfair competition, lender liability, FDIC insurance coverage, Securities Act issues, real estate, franchisor-franchisee disputes, Medicare fraud, mortgage banking, trade secret misappropriation and employment discrimination.
A 1983 magna cum laude graduate of UCLA with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science, Mike received his Juris Doctor degree from the University of California, Boalt Hall School of Law in 1987 where he was an Associate Editor of the California Law Review and a judicial extern to United States District Court Judge Edward Rafeedie.  He is admitted to practice before all state and federal courts in California, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the United States Supreme Court.
Mike has served as a Judge Pro Tempore for the Los Angeles Superior Court, a member of the California Young Lawyers Association Board of Directors and an Adjunct Professor at Loyola Law School and Pepperdine Law School where he is a past recipient of the David McKibbin Excellence in Teaching Award.  He has also served as a volunteer deputy district attorney for the Glendale District Attorney’s Office and provided pro bono legal services to lower income members of the community as a volunteer attorney with Public Counsel and the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles.  In 2001, Mike made headlines after winning one of the largest jury verdicts in San Bernardino Superior Court history, $9.9 million dollars, on behalf of a young child severely shaken by a former daycare center operator.  The case and verdict were featured in the National Law Journal, Lawyers Weekly U.S.A. and The Los Angeles Daily Journal and prompted the consideration of legislation to require California private daycare centers to maintain liability insurance.
Since 2000, Mike has taught legal education seminars for attorneys in conjunction with the California State Bar’s Annual Conference and The Rutter Group on a wide range of topics including pre-trial civil litigation, legal writing, deposition practice, law and motion practice, trial advocacy and appellate advocacy and has served as a contributing editor for numerous Continuing Education of the Bar publications.  He is the author of The State Court Survival Manual:  Strategies and Techniques From Complaint to Closing Argument and California Elements of An Action (published by Thomson West) and has been named 6 times by Los Angeles magazine to the Southern California “Super Lawyers” list as one of the top 5% of attorneys in California.  Here is a sampling of just a few of Mike’s trial victories:
■   Unanimous defense jury verdict for an international auto manufacturer accused of fraud, breach of contract and unfair business practices.
■   Unanimous defense jury verdict for an international importing company and its president accused of breach of fiduciary duty.
■   Unanimous defense jury verdict for an executive placement agency accused of pregnancy discrimination.
■   Unanimous defense jury verdict for an attorney accused of legal malpractice.
■   Defense jury verdict for a national restaurant chain accused of retaliatory termination.
■   Court trial verdict for a local bank against an international lending institution in dispute over lien priority to a parcel of residential property.
■   Unanimous $9.9 million jury verdict for a child shaken by his daycare center operator.
■   $1.4 million jury verdict for a law firm against an international insurance carrier for breach of contract.
■   $658,000 jury verdict for a telecommunications consulting firm against a former employee for trade secret misappropriation.
■   $487,000 court trial verdict for an Ohio based bank against a home mortgage brokerage company for breach of contract and fraud.

Michael Stein | about.meMichael SteinMichael Stein wanted to be an actor since he was a child when he first saw Jackie Gleason in “Smokey and the Bandit”. So, when he was fifteen he enrolled into a drama class his first day of high school. The first assignment was to write a conflict between two characters. Being a product of the 1980s and a self proclaimed neurotic kid, he wrote a scenario about a husband trying to convince his wife to leave the country due to early warning signs of a nuclear war. Despite classmate’s tilted heads and dropped jaws, his drama teacher loved it. After Michael graduated high school he had no interest in going to college but he attended community college and took classes in three subjects that interested him, psychology, business and acting. During the same period Michael performed as a comedian in Los Angeles, appearing at the, Comedy Store, Laugh factory, L.A. Cabaret, and the Improv. In order to pay for his acting education, Michael started promoting nightclubs and became known as the leading nightclub promoter of the “young Hollywood scene” with his club called “Off The Wall”. At the same time Michael organized and produced movie premiere promotions working closely with Guber Peters Productions and Rob Friedman at the ripe old age of twenty one. He then started studying with venerable acting coach and Group Theater disciple, Eric Morris. Stein’s, first role came when he was cast by his friend Paul Thomas Anderson to play the lead role of Dirk Diggler in the original short film “The Dirk Diggler Story”, that later became the feature film “Boogie Nights” which Michael Appears in as well. Michael was inspired by Paul Thomas Anderson’s success as a film maker when Anderson landed his first film “Hard eight”. It motivated Michael to leave his promotion business and become a full time production assistant in order to learn how to become a film maker. Stein worked on commercials, music videos and films with directors such as, Zack Snyder, David Dobkin, Tony Kaye, Dave Ramser, and Spike Jonez and many others. After several years of production work, Michael decided to write, direct and produce a thirty minute dramatic short film, “Rituals and Resolutions”. The intense and intellectual film about infidelity and broken self promises won many festival awards, including the two largest short film festivals at the time, Int. Short Film Festival Oberhausen and The Palm Springs Int. Film Fest. The film was then acquired and distributed by HBO films. Due to the success of “Rit
