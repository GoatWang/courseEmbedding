Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 To the Partners and Board of Directors of  SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P.  We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and
liabilities of SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. (the Fund), including the schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2011, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for the year then ended and the statements of
changes in limited partners capital for each of the two years in the period then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Funds management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2011, by
correspondence with the custodian and management of the underlying investment fund. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. at December 31, 2011, the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended and the changes in its limited partners capital for each of the two years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. 
Notes to Financial Statements 
December 31, 2011 
1. Organization 
SEI Structured Credit Fund, LP (the Fund) is a Delaware limited partnership established on June 26, 2007 and commenced
operations on August 1, 2007. The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act) as a closed-end, non-diversified, management investment company. The Fund offers limited partnership interests
(Interests) solely through private placement transactions to investors (Limited Partners) that have signed an investment management agreement with SEI Investments Management Corporation (SIMC or the
Adviser), the investment adviser to the Fund. As of December 31, 2011, the SEI Structured Credit Segregated Portfolio owned approximately 68.1% of the Fund, while the only other remaining Limited Partner owned approximately 31.9% of
the Fund.  The Funds objective is to seek to generate high total returns. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its
objective. The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a portfolio comprised of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and other structured credit investments. CDOs involve special purpose investment vehicles formed to
acquire and manage a pool of loans, bonds and/or other fixed income assets of various types. CDOs fund their investments by issuing several classes of securities, the repayment of which is linked to the performance of the underlying assets, which
serve as collateral for certain securities issued by the CDO. In addition to CDOs, the Funds investments may include fixed income securities, loan participations, credit-linked notes, medium-term notes, registered and unregistered investment
companies or pooled investment vehicles, and derivative instruments, such as credit default swaps and total return swaps (collectively with CDOs, Structured Credit Investments).  SEI Investment Strategies, LLC (the General Partner), a Delaware limited liability company, serves as the General Partner to the Fund and has no investment in the Fund as of December 31,
2011. The General Partner has delegated the management and control of the business and affairs of the Fund to the Board of Directors (the Board). A majority of the Board is and will be persons who are not interested persons
(as defined in the 1940 Act) with respect to the Fund. 
2. Significant Accounting Policies 
The following is a summary of significant accounting and reporting policies followed by the Fund in preparing the financial statements:

Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Funds financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however, actual results could differ from these estimates and
it is reasonably possible that differences could be material.  Valuation of Investments 
CDOs and other Structured Credit Investments are priced based upon valuations provided by independent, third party pricing agents using their proprietary
valuation methodology. The third-party pricing agents may value Structured Credit Investments at an evaluated bid price by employing methodologies that utilize actual market transactions, broker-supplied valuations, or other methodologies designed
to identify the market value for such securities. Such methodologies generally consider such factors as security prices, yields, maturities, call features, ratings and developments relating to specific securities in arriving at valuations.
 If a price for a CDO or other Structured Credit Investment cannot be obtained from an independent, third-party pricing agent, the Fund shall
seek to obtain a bid price from at least one dealer, who is independent of the Fund. In such cases, the independent dealer providing the price on the CDO or Structured Credit Investment may also be a market maker, and in many cases the only market
maker, with respect to that security. As of December 31, 2011, all asset-backed securities are valued by an independent dealer who is also a market maker.  A dealers valuation reflects its judgment of the price of an asset, assuming an arms length transaction at the valuation date between knowledgeable, willing market participants and sufficient
time in advance of the valuation date to market the instrument. It generally assumes a round lot institutional transaction, without consideration for whether the client is long or short the instrument, and without adjustment for the size of the
clients position. The valuation pertains to an assumed transaction, does not necessarily reflect actual quoted or other prices, and does not indicate that an active market exists for the financial instrument.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)  December 31, 2011   
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Valuation of Investments (continued) 
A dealers valuation may be formulated using inputs such as a combination of observable market transactions of the exact security or a similar
security and internal models. Bids-Wanted-In Competition, or BWICs, are widely distributed auctions of securities whose results are the primary input used by dealers to establish valuations for structured credit securities. Dealers supplement BWIC
results with private transactions and model-driven valuations. Model-driven valuations require assumptions regarding default, recovery, and prepayment rates that are consistent with current market conditions. 
In situations where market inputs are not available or do not provide a sufficient basis under current market conditions for pricing the instrument, the
valuation may reflect the dealers view of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument. Since market participants may have materially different views as to future supply, demand, credit quality and other factors
relevant to pricing financial instruments, as well as bid and ask prices, valuations may differ materially among dealers. The actual level at which these instruments trade (if trades occur) could be materially different from the dealers
valuation.  Debt obligations with remaining maturities of sixty days or less may be valued at their amortized cost, which approximates fair
value. Investments in open-ended investment companies are valued based on reported NAV of the investment company.  Securities for which market
prices are not readily available or may be unreliable are valued in accordance with Fair Value Procedures established by the Board. The Funds Fair Value Procedures are implemented through a Fair Value Committee (the
Committee) designated by the Board. When a security is valued in accordance with the Fair Value Procedures, the Committee will determine the value after taking into consideration relevant information reasonably available to the
Committee.  Examples of factors the Committee may consider are: the last trade price, the performance of the market or of the issuers
industry, the liquidity of the security, the size of the holding in the Fund, or any other appropriate information. The determination of a securitys fair value price often involves the consideration of a number of subjective factors, and is
therefore subject to the unavoidable risk that the value assigned to a security may be higher or lower than the securitys value would be if a reliable market quotation for the security was readily available. At December 31, 2011, there
were no securities that were fair valued by the Committee.

Valuation of Investments (concluded) 
Certain Structured Credit Investments may be structured as private investment partnerships. Traditionally, a trading market for holdings of this type does
not exist. The fair value of the Funds Interest in such a private investment fund will represent the amount that the Fund could reasonably expect to receive from the private investment fund if the Funds Interest were sold at the time of
valuation, determined based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the Fund believes to be reliable. Unless determined otherwise in accordance with the Funds Fair Value Procedures, the fair value of the
Funds Interest in a private investment fund will usually be the value attributed to such interest, as of that time of valuation, as reported to the Fund by the private investment funds manager, administrator, or other designed agent. As
a practical matter, the Adviser and the Board have little or no means of independently verifying the valuations provided by such private investment funds. In the unlikely event that a private investment fund does not report a value to the Fund on a
timely basis and such fund is not priced by independent pricing agents of the Fund, the Fund Committee would determine the fair value of the private investment fund based on the most recent value reported by the private investment fund, as
well as any other relevant information available at the time the Fund values its portfolio. As of December 31, 2011, there were no securities fair valued in accordance with the Funds Fair Value Procedures. 
The Board will periodically review the Funds valuation policies and will update them as necessary to reflect changes in the types of securities in
which the Fund invests.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  In accordance with the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosure under GAAP, the Fund discloses the fair value of its investments in a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure the fair value. The objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date (an exit price).

Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued) 
Accordingly, the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:  Level 1
 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities that the Fund has the ability to access at the measurement date;  Level 2  Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data, which includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation
methodologies. These models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including time value, yield curve, volatility factors, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for
the underlying financial instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which
transactions are executed in the marketplace;  Level 3  Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data (supported by
little or no market activity), which is comprised of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies utilizing significant inputs that are generally less readily observable. 
Investments are classified within the level of the lowest significant input considered in determining fair value. Investments classified within Level 3
whose fair value measurement considers several inputs may include Level 1 or Level 2 inputs as components of the overall fair value measurement.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, there have been no significant changes to the Funds fair valuation methodologies.

Income Recognition and Security Transactions 
Security transactions are recorded on the trade date for financial reporting purposes. Costs used in determining net realized capital gains and losses on
the sale of securities are on the basis of specific identification. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date, and interest income is recognized using the accrual basis of accounting except for certain heavily subordinated collateralized
loan obligations (CLOs) for which the Fund cannot reasonably estimate performance. Amortization and accretion is calculated using the scientific interest method, which approximates the effective interest method over the estimated life of
the security. Amortization of premiums and discounts are included in interest income.  Collateralized Debt Obligations
 The Fund invests in CDOs which include CLOs and other similarly structured securities. CLOs are a type of asset-backed security. A CLO is a
trust typically collateralized by a pool of loans, which may include, among others, domestic and foreign senior secured loans, senior unsecured loans, and subordinate corporate loans, including loans that may be rated below investment grade or
equivalent unrated loans. CDOs may charge management fees and administrative expenses. For CDOs, the cashflows from the trust are split into two or more portions, called tranches, varying in risk and yield. The riskiest portion is the
equity tranche which bears the bulk of defaults from the bonds or loans in the trust and serves to protect the other, more senior tranches from default in all but the most severe circumstances. Since it is partially protected from
defaults, a senior tranche from a CDO trust typically has a higher rating and lower yield than their underlying securities, and can be rated investment grade. Despite the protection from the equity tranche, CDO tranches can experience substantial
losses due to actual defaults, increased sensitivity to defaults due to collateral default and disappearance of protecting tranches, market anticipation of defaults, as well as aversion to CDO securities as a class. 
The risks of an investment in a CDO depend largely on the type of the collateral securities and the class of the CDO in which the Fund invests. Normally,
CLOs and other CDOs are privately offered and sold, and thus, are not registered under the securities laws. As a result, investments in CDOs may be characterized by the Fund as illiquid securities; however, an active dealer market may exist for
CDOs, allowing a CDO to qualify for Rule 144A transactions.

Collateralized Debt Obligations (continued) 
In addition to the normal risks associated with fixed income securities (e.g., interest rate risk and default risk), CDOs carry additional risks
including, but not limited to: (i) the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments; (ii) the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default; (iii) the
Fund may invest in CDOs that are subordinate to other classes; and (iv) the complex structure of the security may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment results.
 Federal Taxes  The
Fund intends to be treated as a partnership for federal, state, and local income tax purposes. The Limited Partners are responsible for the tax liability or benefit relating to its distributive share of taxable income or loss. Accordingly, no
provision for federal, state, or local income taxes is reflected in the accompanying financial statements.  For the period ended
December 31, 2011, in accordance with the accounting guidance provided in the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Investment Companies, the Fund reclassified $25,393,121 and $25,779,543 from accumulated net investment income
and accumulated net realized gain, respectively, to net Limited Partners capital. The reclassification was to reflect, as an adjustment to net Limited Partners capital, the amount of taxable income that has been allocated to the Limited
Partners and has no effect on net assets.  The Fund evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the
Funds tax returns to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50-percent) that each tax position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. Tax
positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. The Fund did not record any tax provisions in the current period. However, managements conclusions regarding tax
positions taken may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, examination by tax authorities (i.e., the last 3 tax year ends, as applicable), on-going analysis of and changes to tax laws,
regulations and interpretations thereof.

Restricted Securities  As of December 31, 2011, the Fund owned private placement investments that were purchased through private offerings or acquired through initial public offerings and cannot be sold without prior
registration under the Securities Act of 1933 or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. In addition, the Fund has generally agreed to further restrictions on the disposition of certain holdings as set forth in various agreements entered into in
connection with the purchase of these investments. These investments are valued at fair value as determined in accordance with the procedures approved by the Board. For the acquisition dates, cost and fair value of these investments, along with
their liquidity terms at December 31, 2011, see the Schedule of Investments.  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Fund treats all highly liquid financial instruments that mature within three months of acquisition as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are valued at
cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. At December 31, 2011, the Fund did not hold any cash and held $12,696,413 in an affiliated money market fund which is classified as part of the Funds investment portfolio in the
Schedule of Investments. 
3. Adviser, Administrator and Other Transactions 
The Adviser does not charge a management fee to the Fund. Limited Partners are responsible for paying the fees of the Adviser directly
under their individual investment management agreement with the Adviser. Each agreement sets forth the fees to be paid to the Adviser, which are ordinarily expressed as a percentage of the Limited Partners assets managed by the Adviser. This
fee, which is negotiated between the Limited Partner and the Adviser, may include a performance-based fee and/or a fixed-dollar fee for certain specified services.  The Adviser has voluntarily agreed that certain expenses of the Fund, including custody fees and administrative fees, calculated monthly, shall not in the aggregate exceed 0.50% per annum of the
Funds monthly average net asset value, and the Adviser or its affiliates will waive Fund fees or reimburse Fund expenses to the extent necessary so that such 0.50% limit is not exceeded. The following expenses of the Fund are specifically
excluded from the expense limit: organizational expenses; extraordinary, non-recurring and certain other unusual expenses; taxes and fees; and expenses incurred indirectly by the Fund through its investments in Structured Credit Investments. The
Adviser may discontinue all or part of this waiver at any time.

3. Adviser, Administrator and Other Transactions (continued) 
 
SEI Global Services, Inc. (the Administrator), serves as the Funds administrator. The
Administrator is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SEI Investments Company. The Administrator provides certain administrative, accounting, and transfer agency services to the Fund. The services performed by the Administrator may be completed by one or
more of its affiliated companies. The Fund pays the Administrator a fee equal to 0.10% (on an annualized basis) of the Funds Net Asset Value which is accrued monthly based on month-end net assets and is paid monthly, and reimburses the
Administrator for certain out-of-pocket expenses.  SEI Investments Distribution Co. (the Placement Agent) serves as the
Funds placement agent pursuant to an agreement with the Fund. The Placement Agent is a wholly owned subsidiary of SEI Investments Company. The Placement Agent is not compensated by the Fund for its services rendered under the agreement.

4. Allocation of Profits and Losses 
The Fund maintains a separate capital account for each of its Limited Partners. As of the last day of each month, the Fund shall
allocate net profits or losses for that month to the capital accounts of all Limited Partners, in proportion to their respective opening capital account balances for such month (after taking into account any capital contributions deemed to be made
as of the first day of such month). 
5. Partners Capital 
The Fund, in the discretion of the Board, may sell interests to new Limited Partners and may allow existing Limited Partners to
purchase additional Interests in the Fund on such days as are determined by the Board in its sole discretion. It is the Funds intention to allow limited purchases of Interests only during designated subscription periods as may be established
by the Board or its designees (currently, the Adviser) and communicated to Limited Partners. The Board or its designee will determine the amount of Interests offered to Limited Partners during a subscription period at its discretion. During the
established subscription periods, Interests may be purchased on a business day, or at such other times as the Board may determine, at the offering price (which is net asset value). The Fund may discontinue its offering at any time. 
The Fund is a closed-end investment company, and therefore no Limited Partner will have the right to require the Fund to redeem its Interests. The Fund
from time to time may offer to repurchase outstanding Interests pursuant to written tenders by Limited 
  19 


Table of Contents

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)  December 31, 2011   
5. Partners Capital (continued)   
Partners. Repurchase offers will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the
Board in its sole discretion. In determining whether the Fund should repurchase Interests from Limited Partners pursuant to written tenders, the Board will consider the recommendations of the Adviser. 
The Adviser expects that it will recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase Interests four times each year, as of the last business day of
March, June, September, and December. However, Limited Partners will not be permitted to tender for repurchase Interests that were acquired less than two years prior to the effective date of the proposed repurchase. 
Even after the initial two year period, it is possible that there will be extended periods during which illiquidity in the underlying investments held by
the Fund or other factors will cause the Board to elect not to conduct repurchase offers. Such periods may coincide with periods of negative performance. In addition, even in the event of a repurchase offer, it is possible that there will be an
oversubscription to the repurchase offer, in which case an Investor may not be able to redeem the full amount that the Investor wishes to redeem.  During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Fund offered to repurchase Interests resulting in capital withdrawals of $27,336,751. 
6. Investment Transactions 
The cost of security purchases and proceeds from the sale and maturity of securities, other than temporary cash investments, during the
year ended December 31, 2011 were $313,723,370 and $267,056,093, respectively.  As of December 31, 2011, the estimated cost of
investments for tax purposes is $375,533,659 Net unrealized appreciation on investments for tax purposes was $30,835,056 consisting of $41,714,612 of gross unrealized appreciation and $10,879,556 of gross unrealized depreciation. 
7. Concentrations of Risk 
In the normal course of business, the Fund may trade various financial instruments and may enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. The Funds satisfaction of the obligations may exceed the amount recognized in the statement of assets and liabilities. 
  20 


Table of Contents
SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. 
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)  December 31, 2011   
7. Concentrations of Risk (continued)   
(a) Market risk  Market risk encompasses the potential for both losses and gains and includes price risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk and collateral performance risk. The Funds market risk management
strategy is driven by the Funds investment objective. The Adviser oversees each of the risks in accordance with policies and procedures. 
(i) Price risk  Price risk is the risk the
value of the instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices, whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment, its issuer or any factor affecting financial instruments traded in the market. As all of the Funds
financial instruments are carried at fair value with fair value changes recognized in the Statement of Operations, all changes in market conditions directly affect net assets.  (ii) Interest rate risk  The fair value of the Funds investments will change in response to
interest rate changes and other factors. During periods of falling interest rates, the values of fixed income securities generally rise. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the values of such securities generally decline. Changes by
recognized rating agencies in the ratings of any fixed income security and in the ability of an issuer to make payments of interest and principal may also affect the value of these investments. 
(iii) Prepayment risk  Prepayment risk is the
risk associated with the early unscheduled return of principal on a fixed-income security. Some fixed-income securities, such as CDOs, have embedded call options which may be exercised by the issuer, or in the case of a CDO, the borrower. The
yield-to-maturity of such securities cannot be known for certain at the time of purchase since the cash flows are not known. When principal is returned early, future interest payments will not be paid on that part of the principal. If the security
was purchased at a premium (a price greater than 100) the securitys yield will be less than what was estimated at the time of purchase. 
(iv) Collateral performance risk  Collateral
performance risk is the risk that defaults or underperformance of the CDOs underlying collateral negatively impacts scheduled payments to a tranche based on relative seniority in the overall capital structure of each deal.

SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. 
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)  December 31, 2011   
7. Concentrations of Risk (continued)   
(b) Counterparty credit risk  Counterparty credit risk is the risk a counterparty to a financial instrument could fail on a commitment that it has entered into with the Fund. The Fund minimizes counterparty credit risk by undertaking
transactions with large well-capitalized counterparties or brokers and by monitoring the creditworthiness of these counterparties. 
8. Indemnifications 
The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Funds maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, since inception the Fund has not had claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

10. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-04 Amendments to Achieve Common
Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs (ASU 2011-04). ASU 2011-04 includes common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between U.S. GAAP and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). ASU 2011-04 will require reporting entities to disclose quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In
addition, ASU 2011-04 will require reporting entities to make disclosures about amounts and reasons for all transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements. The new and revised disclosures are effective for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. At this time, management is evaluating the implications of ASU 2011-04 and its impact on the financial statements has not been determined. 
11. Subsequent Events 
The Fund has evaluated the need for additional disclosures and/or adjustments resulting from subsequent events through the date the
financial statements were issued. Based on this evaluation, no disclosures and/or adjustments were required to the financial statements.

SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. 
Approval of the Advisory Agreements with the Adviser (Unaudited) 
SEI Structured Credit Fund, L.P. (the Fund) has entered into an investment advisory agreement with SEI Investments Management Corporation
(SIMC or the Adviser) dated July 20, 2007 (the Advisory Agreement). Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, SIMC is responsible for the day-to-day investment management of the Funds assets. 
The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), requires that the initial approval of, as well as the continuation of, the
Funds Advisory Agreement must be specifically approved by: (i) the vote of the Board of Directors of the Fund (the Board) or by a vote of the shareholders of the Fund; and (ii) the vote of a majority of the directors who
are not parties to the Advisory Agreement or interested persons (as defined under the 1940 Act) of any party to the Advisory Agreement (the Independent Directors), cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting
on such approval. In connection with their consideration of such approvals, the Board must request and evaluate, and SIMC is required to furnish, such information as may be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the Advisory Agreement. In
addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) takes the position that, as part of their fiduciary duties with respect to a funds fees, fund boards are required to evaluate the material factors applicable to a decision to
approve an advisory agreement.  The discussion immediately below summarizes the materials and information presented to the Board in connection
with the Boards Annual Review of the Advisory Agreement and the conclusions made by the Directors when determining to continue the Advisory Agreement for an additional one-year period.  Consistent with the responsibilities referenced above, the Board called and held a meeting on March 22, 2011 to consider whether to renew the Advisory Agreement. In preparation for the meeting, the
Board provided SIMC with a written request for information and received and reviewed extensive written materials in response to that request, including information as to the performance of the Fund versus benchmarks, the levels of fees for various
categories of services provided by SIMC and its affiliates and the overall expense ratio of the Fund, comparisons of such fees and expenses with such fees and expenses incurred by other funds, the costs to SIMC and its affiliates of providing such
services, including a profitability analysis, SIMCs compliance program, and various other matters. The information provided in connection with the Board meeting was in addition to the detailed information about the Fund that the Board reviews
during the course of each year, including information that relates to the operations and performance of the Fund.

Approval of the Advisory Agreements with the Adviser (Unaudited)  (continued)   
The Directors also received a memorandum from Fund counsel regarding the responsibilities of directors
in connection with their consideration of an investment advisory agreement. In addition, prior to voting, the Independent Directors received advice from Fund counsel regarding the contents of the Advisers written materials. 
As noted above, the Board requested and received written materials from SIMC. Specifically, this requested information and written response included:
(a) the quality of SIMCs investment management and other services; (b) SIMCs investment management personnel; (c) SIMCs operations and financial condition; (d) SIMCs investment strategies; (e) the
level of the advisory fees that SIMC charges the Fund compared with the advisory fees charged to comparable funds; (f) the overall fees and operating expenses of the Fund compared with similar funds; (g) the level of SIMCs
profitability from its Fund-related operations; (h) SIMCs compliance systems; (i) SIMCs policies on and compliance procedures for personal securities transactions; (j) SIMCs reputation, expertise and resources in
domestic and/or international financial markets; and (k) the Funds performance compared with benchmark indices.  The Independent
Directors met in executive session, outside the presence of Fund management, and the full Board met in executive session to consider and evaluate a variety of factors relating to the approval of the continuation of the Advisory Agreement. The
Independent Directors also participated in question and answer sessions with representatives of the Adviser. At the conclusion of the Boards deliberations, the Board including the Independent Directors unanimously approved the continuation of
the Advisory Agreement for an additional one-year period. The approval was based on the Boards (including the Independent Directors) consideration and evaluation of a variety of specific factors discussed at the March 22, 2011 Board
meeting and other Board meetings held throughout the year, including:  -    the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided to the Fund under the Advisory Agreement, including the resources of SIMC and its affiliates dedicated to the Fund; 
-    the Funds investment performance and how it compared to that of appropriate benchmarks; 
-    the expenses of the Fund under the Advisory Agreement and how those expenses compared to those of other comparable funds;
 -    the profitability of SIMC and its affiliates with respect to the Fund, including both direct and indirect benefits
accruing to SIMC and its affiliates; and

Approval of the Advisory Agreements with the Adviser (Unaudited)  (concluded)   
-    the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the Fund grows and
whether fee levels in the Advisory Agreement reflect those economies of scale for the benefit of Fund investors.  Nature, Extent and
Quality of Services. The Board concluded that, within the context of its full deliberations, the nature, extent and quality of services provided by SIMC to the Fund and the resources of SIMC and its affiliates dedicated to the Fund supported
renewal of the Advisory Agreement.  Fund Performance. The Board concluded that, within the context of its full deliberations,
the performance of the Fund supported renewal of the Advisory Agreement.  Fund Expenses. The Board concluded that, within the
context of its full deliberations, the expenses of the Fund are reasonable and supported renewal of the Advisory Agreement. 
Profitability. The Board concluded that, within the context of its full deliberations, the profitability of SIMC is reasonable and
supported renewal of the Advisory Agreement.  Economies of Scale. The Board concluded that, within the context of its full
deliberations, the Fund obtains reasonable benefit from economies of scale.  Based on its evaluation of the information and the conclusions
with respect thereto at its meeting on March 22, 2011, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors, unanimously approved the Advisory Agreement and concluded that the compensation under the Advisory Agreement is fair and reasonable in
light of such services and expenses and such other matters as the Independent Directors and the Board considered to be relevant in the exercise of their reasonable judgment. In the course of their deliberations, the Board, including the Independent
Directors, did not identify any one particular factor or specific piece of information that determined whether to approve the Advisory Agreement .

Audit fees include amounts related to the audit of the Registrants annual financial statements and services normally provided by the accountant in connection with
statutory and regulatory filings.

(2)
Other fees and services not requiring pre-approval include amounts billed in fiscal year 2011 and 2010 related to services provided in connection with internal control
reports issued pursuant to SAS No. 70.  (e)(1) The Funds Audit Committee has adopted and the Board of Directors has
ratified an Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy (the Policy), which sets forth the procedures and the conditions pursuant to which services proposed to be performed by the independent auditor of the Fund may be pre-approved.
 The Policy provides that all requests or applications for proposed services to be provided by the independent auditor must be
submitted to the Registrants Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and must include a detailed description of the services proposed to be rendered. The CFO will determine whether such services: 
 


 
(1)
require specific pre-approval;   


 
(2)
are included within the list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee pursuant to the Policy; or 
 


 
(3)
have been previously pre-approved in connection with the independent auditors annual engagement letter for the applicable year or otherwise. In any instance where
services require pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider whether such services are consistent with SECs rules and whether the provision of such services would impair the auditors independence. 
Requests or applications to provide services that require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit
Committee by the CFO. The Audit Committee will be informed by the CFO on a quarterly basis of all services rendered by the independent auditor. The Audit Committee has delegated specific pre-approval authority to either the Audit Committee Chair or
financial expert, provided that the estimated fee for any such proposed pre-approved service does not exceed $100,000 and any pre-approval decisions are reported to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
Services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee are identified and described in the Policy. In addition, the
Policy sets forth a maximum fee per engagement with respect to each identified service that has received general pre-approval. 
All services to be provided by the independent auditor shall be provided pursuant to a signed written engagement letter with the
Registrant, the investment advisor or applicable control affiliate (except that matters as to which an engagement letter would be impractical because of timing issues or because the matter is small may not be the subject of an engagement letter)
that sets forth both the services to be provided by the independent auditor and the total fees to be paid to the independent auditor for those services.  In addition, the Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an annual basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the independent auditor and to assure the auditors
independence from the Registrant, such as reviewing a formal written statement from the independent auditor delineating all relationships between the independent auditor and the Registrant, and discussing with the independent auditor its methods and
procedures for ensuring independence.

(h)
During the past fiscal year, Registrants principal accountant provided certain non-audit services to the Registrants investment adviser or to entities
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Registrants investment adviser that provide ongoing services to Registrant that were not subject to pre-approval pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X. The
audit committee of Registrants board of directors reviewed and considered these non-audit services provided by Registrants principal accountant to Registrants affiliates, including whether the provision of these non-audit services
is compatible with maintaining the principal accountants independence.

Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End Management Investment Companies. 
Proxy Voting (Rule 206(4)-6)  POLICY
STATEMENT  A public companys shareholders typically have the right to vote on various corporate issues. Clients typically delegate to
SIMC the authority to vote proxies for shares they own. Under the Advisers Act, SIMC has a duty of care and loyalty with respect to all services undertaken for clients, including proxy voting. 
Rule 206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act requires that SIMC must vote proxies in a manner consistent with clients best interest and must not place its
interests above those of its clients when doing so. It requires SIMC to: (i) adopt and implement written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that SIMC votes proxies in the best interest of its clients, and
(ii) to disclose to the clients how they may obtain information on how SIMC voted proxies. In addition, Rule 204-2 requires SIMC to keep records of proxy voting and client requests for information. 
As a registered investment adviser, SIMC has an obligation to vote proxies with respect to securities held in its client portfolios in the best economic
interests of the clients for which it has proxy voting authority. PROCEDURES  SIMC has adopted the following procedures to implement the firms policy and to monitor compliance with the firms policy:  1. Third Party Proxy Voting ServiceSIMC has elected to retain a third party proxy voting service (the Service) to vote proxies with respect to those clients. The
Service shall vote proxies in accordance with guidelines approved by SIMCs Proxy Voting Committee (the Guidelines). The Guidelines set forth the manner in which SIMC shall vote, or the manner in which SIMC shall determine how to
vote, with respect to various matters that may come up for shareholder vote. So long as the Service votes proxies in accordance with the Guidelines, SIMC believes that there is an appropriate presumption that the manner in



Table of Contents

which SIMC voted was not influenced by, and did not result from, a conflict of interest. SIMC Compliance shall conduct periodic reviews of the Service to ensure compliance with SIMCs proxy
voting guidelines and the appropriateness of the Service.  2. Establishment of Proxy Voting CommitteeSIMC shall establish
a Proxy Voting Committee (the Committee), comprised of representatives of SIMCs Investment Management Unit and Legal and/or Compliance personnel. Currently, the members of the Committee are as follows: 
Brad Mook  Greg
McIntire  Aimei Zhong  Noreen Procaccini  Stephanie Cavanagh
Tom Williams  The membership of
the Committee may be changed at any time upon approval of the existing members of the Committee or by the President of SIMC. The Committee shall meet as necessary to perform any of the activities set forth below. Any action requiring approval of the
Committee shall be deemed approved upon an affirmative vote by a majority of the Committee present or represented. The submission of votes electronically (i.e., via email) by the Committee members shall be considered acceptable. The Committee shall
consult with counsel or other experts as it deems appropriate to carry out its responsibilities.  3. Approval of Proxy Voting
GuidelinesThe Committee shall approve Guidelines that set forth the manner in which SIMC shall vote, or the manner in which SIMC shall determine how to vote, with respect to various matters that may come up for shareholder vote with
respect to securities held in client accounts and for which SIMC has proxy voting responsibility. In the event that any employee of SIMC recommends a change to SIMCs Guidelines, the Committee shall meet to consider the proposed change and
consider all relevant factors. If approved by the Committee, the change shall be accepted, and the Guidelines revised accordingly.  4.
Certain Proxy Votes May Not Be CastIn some cases, the Committee may determine that it is in the best interests of SIMCs clients to abstain from voting certain proxies. SIMC will abstain from voting in the event any of the
following conditions {listed below} are met with regard to a proxy proposal:   


 

 
 Neither the Proxy Voting Guidelines nor specific client instructions cover an issue; 
 


 

 
 The Service does not make a recommendation on the issue; 
 


 

 
 In circumstances where, in SIMCs judgment, the costs of voting the proxy exceed the expected benefits to clients; or
  


 

 
 The Committee cannot convene on the proxy proposal at issue to make a determination as to what would be in the clients best interest. This could
happen, for example, if the Committee found that there was a material conflict or if despite all best efforts the Committee is unable to meet the requirements necessary to make a determination. 
In addition, it is SIMCs policy not to vote proxies for accounts that engage in securities lending, SIMC believes that the additional income
derived by clients from such activities generally outweighs the potential economic benefit of recalling securities for the purpose of voting. Therefore, SIMC generally will not recall securities on loan for the sole purpose of voting proxies.
Further, in accordance with local law or business practices, many foreign companies prevent the sales of shares that have been voted for a certain period beginning prior to the shareholder meeting and ending on the day following the meeting
(share blocking). Depending on the country in which a company is domiciled, the blocking period may begin a stated number of days prior to the meeting (e.g., one, three or five days) or on a date established by the company. While
practices vary, in many countries the block period can be continued for a longer period if the shareholder meeting is adjourned and postponed to a later date. Similarly, practices vary widely as to the ability of a shareholder to have the
block restriction lifted early (e.g., in some countries shares generally can be unblocked up to two days prior to the meeting whereas in other countries the removal of the block appears to be discretionary with the
issuers transfer agent). SIMC believes that the disadvantage 


Table of Contents

of being unable to sell the stock regardless of changing conditions generally outweighs the advantages of voting at the shareholder meeting for routine items. Accordingly, SIMC generally will not
vote those proxies subject to share blocking.  5. Proxies of Investment CompaniesWith respect to proxies of an
affiliated investment company or series thereof, such as the SEI Funds, the Committee will vote such proxies in the same proportion as the vote of all other shareholders of the investment company or series thereof (i.e., echo vote
or mirror vote). When required by law, the Committee will also echo vote proxies of an unaffiliated investment company. When not required to echo vote, the Committee will delegate to the Service responsibility for
voting proxies of an unaffiliated investment company in accordance with Guidelines approved by the Committee; provided that, if such proxy presents a material conflict of interest for SIMC, such proxy shall be voted in accordance with Section 6
below.  6. Conflicts of InterestThe Service makes available to SIMC, prior to voting on a proxy, its recommendation on how
to vote with respect to such proxy in light of SIMCs Guidelines. SIMC retains the authority to overrule the Services recommendation, and instruct the Service to vote in a manner at variance with the Services recommendation. The
exercise of such right could implicate a conflict of interest. As a result, SIMC may not overrule the Services recommendation with respect to a proxy unless the following steps are taken: 
 


 
a.
The Committee shall meet to consider the proposal to overrule the Services recommendation. 
 


 
b.
The Committee must determine whether SIMC has a conflict of interest with respect to the issuer that is the subject of the proxy. The Committee will use the following
standards to identify issuers with which it may have a conflict of interest.   


 
1.
Significant Business Relationships  The Committee will determine whether SIMC or its affiliates may have a significant business relationship with the
issuer, such as, for example, where SIMC (or an affiliate) manages a pension plan, administers employee benefit plans, or provide brokerage, underwriting, insurance, or banking services to the issuer. For this purpose, a significant business
relationship is one that: (1) represents 1% or $1,000,000 of SIMCs or an affiliates revenues for the most recent fiscal year, whichever is less, or is reasonably expected to represent this amount for the current fiscal year;
or (2) may not directly involve revenue to SIMC or its affiliates but is otherwise determined by the Committee to be significant to SIMC or its affiliates, such as, for example, the following: 
 


 

 
 SIMC or its affiliates lease significant office space from the company or have some other real estate-related relationship with the issuer;
  


 

 
 SIMC or an affiliate otherwise has a significant relationship with the company such that it might create an incentive for SIMC to vote in favor of
management.   


 
2.
Significant Personal/Family Relationships  The Committee will determine whether any employees who are involved in the proxy voting process may have a
significant personal/family relationship with the issuer. For this purpose, a significant personal/family relationship is one that would be reasonably likely to influence how SIMC votes proxies. To identify any such relationships, the
Committee shall obtain information about any significant personal/family relationship between any employee of SIMC who is involved in the proxy voting process (e.g., IMU analysts, members of the Committee, senior management, as applicable) and
senior employees of issuers for which SIMC may vote proxies.   


 
3.
 Duties of the Proxy CommitteeThe Committee has a duty to make reasonable investigation of information relating to conflicts of interest.
For purposes of 


Table of Contents


 

identifying conflicts, the Committee shall rely on publicly available information about SIMC and its affiliates, information about SIMC and its affiliates that is generally known by employees of
SIMC,1 and other information actually known by a member of
the Committee. Absent actual knowledge, the Committee is not required to investigate possible conflicts involving SIMC where the information is (i) non-public, (ii) subject to information blocking procedures, or (iii) otherwise not
readily available to the Committee. In connection with the consideration of any proxy voting matters under this policy, each member of the Committee has a duty to disclose to the Committee any material conflicts of interest of which the member has
actual knowledge but which have not been identified by the Committee pursuant to these Procedures, and, if appropriate, recuse himself/herself from the matter at issue. 
 


 
c.
If SIMC determines that it has a conflict of interest, the Committee shall determine whether the conflict is material to any specific proposal included
within the proxy. If not, then SIMC can vote the proxy as determined by the Committee. The Committee shall determine whether a proposal is material as follows: 
 


 
1.
 Routine Proxy Proposals  Proxy proposals that are routine shall be presumed not to involve a material conflict of interest for
SIMC, unless the Committee has actual knowledge that a routine proposal should be treated as material. For this purpose, routine proposals would typically include matters such as the selection of an accountant, uncontested election of
directors, meeting formalities, and approval of an annual report/financial statements. 2   


 
2.
Non-Routine Proxy Proposals  Proxy proposals that are non-routine shall be presumed to involve a material conflict of interest for SIMC, unless
the Committee determines that SIMCs conflict is unrelated to the proposal in question (see 3. below). For this purpose, non-routine proposals would typically include any contested matter, including a contested election of
directors, a merger or sale of substantial assets, a change in the articles of incorporation that materially affects the rights of shareholders, and compensation matters for management (e.g., stock option plans, retirement plans, profit sharing or
other special remuneration plans).   


 
3.
Determining that a Non-Routine Proposal is Not Material  As discussed above, although non-routine proposals are presumed to involve a material conflict of
interest, the Committee may determine on a case-by-case basis that particular non-routine proposals do not involve a material conflict of interest. To make this determination, the Committee must conclude that a proposal is not directly related to
SIMCs conflict with the issuer or that it otherwise would not be considered important by a reasonable investor. The Committee shall record in writing the basis for any such determination. 
 


 
d.
For any proposal where the Committee determines that SIMC has a material conflict of interest, SIMC may vote a proxy regarding that proposal in any of the following
manners:   


 
1.
Obtain Client Consent or Direction  If the Committee approves the proposal to overrule the recommendation of the Service, SIMC shall fully disclose to each
client holding the security at issue the nature of the conflict, and obtain the clients consent   


1 
 The procedures provide that the Committee should be aware of information about SIMC or its affiliates that is generally known by employees of SIMC, but
it does not extend this knowledge to information about SIMCs affiliates that is generally known by employees of SIMCs affiliates (unless such information also is generally known by SIMCs employees). 


2 
 For guidance on defining routine and non-routine matters, SIMC shall use the standards set forth in NYSE Rule 452 and Special
Instruction 12b.viii. of Form 13F. 


Table of Contents

to how SIMC will vote on the proposal (or otherwise obtain instructions from the client as to how the proxy on the proposal should be voted). 
 


 
2.
Use Recommendation of the Service  Vote in accordance with the Services recommendation. 
 


 
e.

 Conflicts of Interests. Each portfolio managers management of other accounts
may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in connection with his management of the Funds investments, on the one 


Table of Contents

hand, and the investments of the other accounts, on the other. The other accounts include portions of two U.S. registered high yield mutual funds and an Irish registered high yield fund
(collectively, the Other Accounts). The Other Accounts might have similar investment objectives as the Fund or hold, purchase, or sell securities that are eligible to be held, purchased, or sold by the Fund. While the portfolio
managers management of the Other Accounts may give rise to the following potential conflicts of interest, the Adviser does not believe that the conflicts, if any, are material or, to the extent any such conflicts are material, the Adviser
believes that it has designed policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to manage those conflicts in an appropriate way. 
Knowledge of the Timing and Size of Fund Trades. A potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the portfolio managers
day-to-day management of the Fund. Because of their position with the Fund, the portfolio managers know the size, timing, and possible market impact of Fund trades. It is theoretically possible that the portfolio managers could use this
information to the advantage of the Other Accounts and to the possible detriment of the Fund. However, the Adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over
time.   Investment Opportunities. A potential conflict of interest may arise as a result of the portfolio
managers management of the Fund and the Other Accounts which, in theory, may allow them to allocate investment opportunities in a way that favors the Other Accounts over the Fund. This conflict of interest may be exacerbated to the extent that
the Adviser or the portfolio managers receive, or expect to receive, greater compensation from their management of the Other Accounts than the Fund. Notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest, it is the Advisers policy to
manage each account based on its investment objectives and related restrictions and, as discussed above, the Adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time
and in a manner consistent with each accounts investment objectives and related restrictions. For example, while the portfolio managers may buy for an Other Account securities that differ in identity or quantity from securities bought for the
Fund, such an approach might not be suitable for the Fund given its investment objectives and related restrictions.  The Adviser may enter
into incentive fee arrangements with one or more investors in the SEI Structured Credit Segregated Portfolio (the Offshore Feeder Fund), a segregated portfolio of SEI Offshore Advanced Strategies Series SPC, a segregated portfolio
company established in the Cayman Islands, that acts as a feeder fund for the Fund, whereby a portion of the increase in the net asset value of such investors investment in the Offshore Feeder Fund over a given period shall be payable to the
Adviser. This arrangement may create an incentive for the Adviser to make investments for the Fund that are riskier or more speculative than if the Adviser had no such interest because the Adviser will not bear an analogous portion of
depreciation in the value of the Offshore Feeder Funds assets if the value of its investment in the Fund declines. Notwithstanding this theoretical conflict of interest, it is the Advisers policy to manage each account based on its
investment objectives and related restrictions and the Adviser believes that it has designed policies and procedures that are designed to manage such conflict in an appropriate way.

        RELATED PRODUCTS    Credit Estimates    Loan, Recovery and CLO Ratings    Private Credit Analysis (PCA)    Large Corporate Mapping    Issue Credit Ratings         PRODUCTS & CAPABILITIES : Models  Structured Credit Products Our structured credit products provide analytical modeling and data capabilities for performing credit, cash flow and detailed asset analyses. The tools provide issuers, structurers, investors and asset managers with deep credit risk insight at the asset, pool and tranche level and support portfolio performance monitoring, risk management and scenario-based analyses. Included below are products we offer along with their description. All products are available for download from the Structured Finance Interface website.   STRUCTURED CREDIT PRODUCTS  Cash Flow Evaluator Beta: S&P Cash Flow Evaluator applies various combinations of stresses to the collateral portfolio of a structured transaction and examines whether the rated securities would likely receive timely or ultimate interest and principal payments in those scenarios. The stresses it applies include certain collateral default levels and timing, collateral recovery levels and timing, and interest-rate movements, as well as currency and prepayment stresses, when applicable. Small Business Portfolio Evaluator: S&P Global Ratings' Small Business Portfolio Evaluator is an analytical model that helps issuers and underwriters assess the gross default and prepayment risk of small business loan portfolios. Small Business Portfolio Evaluator is built upon data from more than $1 trillion in outstanding small business loans - with the same analytical model used internally by S&P Global Ratings to rate small business loan securitizations. Market Value Evaluator: The S&P Global Ratings Market Value Evaluator incorporates our quantitative methodology and assumptions for rating market value securities transactions as outlined in our criteria. The S&P Global Ratings Market Value Evaluator estimates the minimum sale realization by reducing, from the securities' current market value, the market value loss the criteria assume could occur when such securities are sold during different periods of economic stress. The periods of economic stress the S&P Global Ratings Market Value Evaluator estimates are commensurate with the stress levels our rating categories imply. Hedge Fund Evaluator: Hedge Fund Evaluator incorporates S&P Global Ratings' securitization criteria for modeling hedge fund performance. It allows analysts to develop securitization scenarios that incorporate S&P Global Ratings' analytic criteria and tests far more quickly and easily than otherwise possible.    CDO SUITE OF PRODUCTS  CDS Accelerator and CDS Xpress: S&P Global Ratings' CDS Accelerator and CDS Xpress each provide you with an efficient and convenient way to analyze new and existing synthetic CDO transactions. Incorporating the same quantitative methodology used in S&P Global Ratings' synthetic CDO ratings process, CDS Accelerator and CDS Xpress enables you to model potential deals and monitor transaction performance using uniquely organized data feeds, classification information and asset identifiers employed by S&P Global Ratings' analysts. CDO Evaluator: The CDO Evaluator model allows users to evaluate pools of corporate, municipal or structured finance assets.  Using a Monte Carlo simulation of defaults, the model incorporates S&P Global Ratings' default and correlation assumptions to estimate portfolio loss rates under different economic stresses commensurate with our rating levels. CDO Evaluator Engine: The CDO Evaluator Engine analyzes CDO asset portfolios asset by asset, allowing the user to access the tool via an API which integrates with your proprietary systems and enables you to generate default scenarios, identify over-collateralization of rated tranches of cash or synthetic CDOs, estimate maximum default levels for each tranche before its rating is affected and much more. CDO Monitor: S&P Global Ratings CDO Monitor is a tool used by CDO managers and trustees to determine compliance with the S&P Global Ratings' CDO Monitor Test as required by transaction documents.  The S&P Global Ratings' CDO Monitor Test is intended to highlight potential changes in the credit quality of the underlying assets in a CDO, or changes in other collateral attributes, that could have an impact on transaction performance.
