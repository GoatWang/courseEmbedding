      OfficeMax® Incorporated (NYSE: OMX), a leader in office 
      supplies, technology and services, announced today that Ronald Lalla 
      has been named EVP, chief merchandising officer, effective Monday, March 
      19. He will serve as a member of the OfficeMax executive committee and 
      will have responsibility for all aspects of enterprise-wide 
      merchandising for OfficeMax, including category management, strategic 
      product planning, global sourcing, private label expansion and cost of 
      goods sold initiatives. In this role, Mr. Lalla will report to Michael 
      Lewis, EVP, president of Retail.
    

      "Ron is a strategic merchant with a strong financial acumen who will 
      focus on driving disciplined processes to enhance the customer 
      experience and improve margins," said Ravi Saligram, president and CEO 
      of OfficeMax. "His track record of driving innovations in both the

      which is one of Canada's leading drug store operators with over 1,800 
      drug stores across the country. Prior to that, he was executive vice 
      president, global merchandising, for Corporate Express. While in that 
      position, he implemented best-in-class programs for category and vendor 
      management, resulting in significant cost savings and margin 
      enhancement. He also held several leadership positions in merchandising, 
      store operations and finance during his more than 10 years at Kmart 
      Corporation.
    

      He attended the University of Manitoba, where he received his degree in 
      Commerce and then later earned his M.B.A from Duke University.
    

      "With a strong management team in place, a commitment to profitable
