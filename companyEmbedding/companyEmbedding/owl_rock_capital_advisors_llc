Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.
The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings.
The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award.
The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry.
The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration.  In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in court.
The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any agreements thereto, shall be incorporated into these Terms.

Arbitration shall be conducted (i) for claims required to be arbitrated as specified in FINRA rules, that FINRA Dispute Resolution decides to hear, before FINRA Dispute Resolution at the New York FINRA District Office, (ii) in all other cases, in New York, NY in accordance with the arbitration rules then in force by the American Arbitration Association, or (iii) in either case, at another mutually agreed upon site under mutually agreed upon rules,.  The award of the arbitrator shall be final, and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court, state or federal, having jurisdiction. 
No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, or seek to enforce any pre-dispute arbitration agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action or who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action, until (a) the class certification is denied; or (b) the class is decertified. 
Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under these Terms except to the extent stated herein.

Owl Rock Capital Corporation Enters into Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement
Feb 1 17
On February 1, 2017, Owl Rock Capital Corporation entered into a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement. The parties to the Facility include the Company, as Borrower, the lenders from time to time parties thereto and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Runners, SunTrust Bank as Administrative Agent and Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent. The Facility is guaranteed by OR Lending LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, and will be guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company that are formed or acquired by the Company in the future (collectively, the “Guarantors”). Proceeds of the Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments. The maximum principal amount of the Facility is $400,000,000, subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on the Company’s portfolio investments and other outstanding indebtedness. Maximum capacity under the Facility may be increased to $750,000,000 through the exercise by the Borrower of an uncommitted accordion feature through which existing and new lenders may, at their option, agree to provide additional financing. The Facility includes a $50,000,000 limit for swingline loans and is secured by a perfected first-priority interest in substantially all of the portfolio investments held by the Company and each Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions. The availability period under the Facility will terminate on January 31, 2020 (“Commitment Termination Date”) and the Facility will mature on February 1, 2021 (“Maturity Date”). During the period from the Commitment Termination Date to the Maturity Date, the Company will be obligated to make mandatory prepayments under the Facility out of the proceeds of certain asset sales and other recovery events and equity and debt issuances. The Company may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. Amounts drawn under the Facility, will bear interest at either LIBOR plus a margin, or the prime rate plus a margin. The Company may elect either the LIBOR or prime rate at the time of drawdown, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time at the Company’s option, subject to certain conditions. The Company will also pay a fee of 0.375% on undrawn amounts under the Facility.
