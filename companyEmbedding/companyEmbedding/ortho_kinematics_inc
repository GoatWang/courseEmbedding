 "Not only does VMA frequently change surgical decisions, it also identifies potential surgical candidates that the current test misses. With the VMA, these patients can often be offered pain-relieving surgery instead of being either cycled onto the next clinician or continuing with potentially addictive pain killers or expensive pain injections."

— Dr. Reginald Davis, MD Spine Neurosurgeon
  "The VMA gives me instant access to test results and never-before-seen spine views. The views 'wow' the patients and the objective data makes dealing with insurance companies much easier."
— Dr. James Woodall Jr., MD Orthopedic Surgeon
"The VMA alerts save me time on my busy clinic days by quickly identifying patients with a problem area based on my own criteria.  From the VMA portal, I can identify the highest-priority patients before I ever enter the exam room or look at an imaging study."
— Dr. David Lee, MD Spine Neurosurgeon















Ortho Kinematics :: Sagittal Alignment






















A breakthrough in spine imaging
Vertebral Motion Analysis (VMA) is a new spine diagnostic tool that combines controlled patient movement during fluoroscopic imaging with advanced image processing and motion analysis. One straightforward VMA test provides both spinal instability and sagittal alignment measurements.*
                             
                            Why sagittal alignment?
Previously only considered for deformity surgical procedures, new literature suggests the clinical importance of sagittal alignment in even short-segment lumbar fusion.[1,2,3]
                             





Our results indicate that surgeons should pay attention to sagittal spinopelvic alignment and avoid post-operative PI‑LL mismatch even when treating patients with short-segment lumbar interbody fusion.—Aoki, et al, 2015

PI-LL mismatch brings the deformity world into the degenerative lumbar spine... —Rothenfluh, et al, 2014





                             
                            



Significance of PI-LL Mismatch
Researchers have proposed that sagittal balance occurs when pelvic incidence (PI) matches lumbar lordosis (LL); the difference is referred to as "PI‑LL mismatch".[1,2]
Recently-published studies of one- and two-level lumbar spinal fusion patients suggest that post-op PI‑LL mismatch correlated with long-term clinical symptoms.[3,4]



                             
                            


Sophisticated measurements with no extra steps

VMA automates the process for obtaining established spinopelvic alignment parameters from fluoroscopic images collected during VMA testing.
Pelvic incidence, lumbar lordosis, pelvic tilt, and sacral slope are included in the VMA report, along with the assessment of spinal motion and instability.
VMA provides a "red-light" alert when PI-LL mismatch exceeds the physician-set threshold (e.g. 10°).




  View sample VMA Lumbar Sagittal Alignment report.



 
                            



Replacing an antiquated process with automated accuracy
Traditionally, surgeons planning for deformity surgery have relied on long-film x‑rays and complex geometric constructions to assess sagittal alignment parameters like PI‑LL mismatch.
VMA reports provide convenient access to alignment measurement without these complicated manual steps.



							 





                            
							Measurement matters
Recently-published studies have emphasized a direct correlation between sagittal alignment and both short- and long-term clinical outcomes.[1,3,4] Reliable spinal motion and alignment data support informed surgical decisions and provide potentially powerful patient consult tools.
With VMA, these insights can become a standard part of spinal fusion surgical planning.

 "I have seen many doctors over the years for my neck pain, and have been told many times I might have instability. My doctor used the VMA as an important part of an evaluation that excluded this condition, and put me on a course of physical therapy that has really helped.  Having these test results made it easier for me to stick with my exercises, and I'm glad I did."
— A. Jumper
  "I had been suffering from back pain for a long time, and had been told I needed surgery.  As part of a second opinion, my doctor ordered a VMA.  My doctor explained the VMA videos to me and how they showed motion in my spine that could benefit from surgery. It gave me peace of mind with my decision to have an operation."
— S. Darnell
"In 2013, I was suffering excruciating back pain. I was given a medial branch block in C2 through C4. Dr. David Lee diagnosed an issue in C5/C6 after using the VMA. He ordered a cervical epidural steroidal injection at C5/C6, and I felt immediate relief and have been pain free for  1 year. The VMA provided valuable information that helped guide my doctor's treatment."
— L. Millette

Ortho Kinematics Raises $4 Million in Debt Financing | Business Wire
























































Ortho Kinematics Raises $4 Million in Debt Financing




Company Strengthens Cash Position, Focusing on Commercialization 
      Efforts






January 05, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ortho Kinematics‚ Inc. (OKI), a privately held healthcare diagnostics 
      company focused on spine imaging informatics, announced today the close 
      of $4 million in debt financing. This financing will be used to 
      strengthen OKI’s cash position, expand US and OUS commercialization of 
      the VMA (Vertebral Motion Analysis), the company’s flagship product for 
      the radiographic assessment of spinal motion and instability and the 
      launch of several new product features.
    


      The debt financing was completed amongst current OKI investors and 
      largely led by TEXO Ventures, an early stage technology venture fund 
      focused on the business of healthcare, as well as other previous 
      investors. Terms of the financing were not disclosed.
    

      Seattle-based spine neurosurgeon, Dr. Richard Wohns, MD, JD, MBA, and 
      Founder of NeoSpine, commented on the VMA technology saying, “Patients 
      benefit from improved diagnostic capabilities. The VMA provides the 
      biomechanical insight we have not had in the past. This advanced 
      clinical information can impact diagnostic and treatment decisions.”
    

      OKI has commercially tested over 4,000 patients with the VMA technology. 
      With the significant uptick in sales and adoption of the VMA technology, 
      OKI has announced the appointment of Margie Hans as Director of 
      Reimbursement and Health Policy. Ms. Hans joins OKI with 15+ years of 
      experience in medical device reimbursement and payer policy.
    

      Paul Gunnoe, CEO of OKI, said, “This debt financing is a strong vote of 
      confidence by OKI’s current shareholders. We have ambitious plans in 
      2016 and this additional financing provides us a strong cash position 
      and the resources to support those plans. The VMA test is a disruptive 
      diagnostic technology that allows us to position ourselves as leader in 
      the spine industry.”

Ortho Kinematics Raises $9.6 Million Series C Equity Financing | Business Wire
























































Ortho Kinematics Raises $9.6 Million Series C Equity Financing




Spine informatics company to build on successful launch of its new 
      diagnostic product






April 14, 2015 09:53 AM Eastern Daylight Time



AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ortho Kinematics‚ Inc. (OKI), a privately held healthcare diagnostics 
      company focused on spine imaging informatics, announced today the close 
      of a $9.6 million Series C equity financing to expand commercialization 
      of the VMA (Vertebral Motion Analysis), the company’s flagship product 
      for the radiographic assessment of spinal motion and instability.
    


      Investors in the Series C included Medtronic, Inc.; TEXO Ventures, an 
      early stage technology venture fund focused on the business of 
      healthcare; MB Venture Partners, a venture capital firm that provides 
      capital and strategic direction to life sciences companies; and other 
      previous and new investors. Terms of the financing were not disclosed. 
      Gary Stevenson, co-founder and Managing Partner of MB Venture Partners, 
      has joined the OKI board of directors.
    

      Spine neurosurgeon, Dr. Reginald Davis, commented on the technology 
      saying, “My patients benefit from getting a VMA. The VMA provides the 
      clinical information of traditional x-rays, as well as tremendous 
      biomechanical insight from motion analysis that can impact diagnostic 
      and treatment decisions. To improve spine care, diagnostic capabilities 
      must also improve.”
    

      These new funds will support the continued commercialization of the VMA. 
      After securing FDA clearance for the VMA and completing a successful 
      limited-scale commercial launch, the company is currently ramping up 
      efforts to support a full scale commercial launch within the U.S. and 
      Europe. These funds will be used to expand sales and marketing efforts 
      as well as for limited research and development activities.
    

      Paul Gunnoe, CEO of OKI said, “This current round of financing is a 
      strong vote of confidence and will give OKI the resources to support 
      ambitious growth. The VMA is disrupting 60+ year old methods of 
      diagnosing spine issues, and we believe this type of innovation is long 
      overdue. We are leading in this area and are humbled by the support we 
      have received.”

Both your lawn and the plants and vegetation you have need plenty of water and sunlight, which you and Mother Nature provide. However, your greenery needs a little help in the form of food, fertilizer, pest control and other treatments to keep everything growing and producing as much as it can. With our low prices, every day, on everything in our Garden Center, you can create a terrific-looking natural space for yourself, your family and your friends without breaking the bank.Lawn careIn addition to frequent cutting, edging, trimming and other maintenance steps you do to maintain a healthy, beautiful-looking lawn, you need to keep it fed and pest- and weed-free. If you have bare patches in your lawn, spread some grass seed in the bare spots. It'll take just a few weeks for the new grass to fill in. Make sure you're using seed that matches the type of grass you have, such as fescue or Bermuda grass.Keep your lawn fed properly by using fertilizer. Fertilizer comes in large bags from 10 pounds to 25 pounds and serves as the primary food for your lawn. It's recommended that you use a fertilizer spreader to apply fertilizer in an even pattern. Too much fertilizer in one spot can cause your grass to "burn" in direct sunlight. Choose a spreader that's suited for your lawn. If you have an average- to large-size lawn to maintain, you'll want to use a spreader that you push across your lawn that spreads the fertilizer out as you walk. If you only have a small patch of grass to maintain, such as at a condominium or apartment with a back yard, choose either a handheld spreader or apply with a wand using liquid fertilizer. There are even liquid fertilizers you can spray using your own water hose. GardeningEven before you plant your first flower bulb, vegetable, bush or tree, it's important to prepare the soil. The first step is to clear any weeds and old vegetation from the area where you plan to do your planting. Then, it's a good idea to enrich the soil with new garden soil or topsoil. It's also smart to use a pH level tester on the soil to make sure the pH levels are correct for the plants you wish to grow. It might be necessary to add some lime or calcium to the soil until the nutrient balance is correct.Once you've sown your seeds or planted your plants, it's necessary to keep them feed. If you apply garden soil initially, many brands have fertilizer mixed in with the soil, which feeds your plants for a few weeks. However, as the plants and flowers mature, it becomes necessary to feed them periodically. A good way to take care of this is to attach a liquid fertilizer container to a water hose to disperse a measured amount of food to your plants.If you don t have a patch of land to grow plants, there are many other options available, such as planters, vases and boxes. If you don t have access to a water hose, a watering can will deliver the water the plants need.Weed and plant controlIf you have weeds popping up in your lawn or garden, you want to remove them right away so they don't overrun your lawn, vegetables or other plants. In your garden, it's best to remove them by hand, such as by using a garden shovel, trowel or asparagus knife to dig beneath the roots of the weed and remove it completely. Any weeds that have roots remaining in the soil can regrow in time, which means you'll need to repeat the process again. For lawns, you can apply fertilizer to your grass that has weed killer mixed in, allowing you to "weed and feed" your lawn that the same time. For weeds that pop up individually on your lawn, such as dandelions or crabgrass, and for any weeds that grow between patio or sidewalk sections, you can use a spot sprayer to kill them directly. These usually kill the weeds within a few days.If you have garden pests, such as ants or crawling insects, that are eating or killing your plants, there are options you can use to kill the pests without harming your vegetation. A good example of this is diatomaceous earth, which provides long-lasting control against harmful insects. It's safe for pets, and you can even use it inside your home.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863236, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

You may have a patio and a strip of green if you live in an urban setting, or you may have a large yard with plenty of green space that allows you, your family and your friends to spread out. Patio furniture is a good place to start when outfitting your outdoor space. Those who have a large patio can choose sofas, chairs and outdoor dining sets. No exterior space is complete without a grill, and an outdoor kitchen is especially family- and entertaining-friendly. At Walmart, we offer many different pieces of outdoor furniture from which you can choose. Check out our Best Sellers, Special Buys and Clearance items for great finds on pieces to make your patio and backyard a place to which you'll rush home.Patio FurniturePatio furniture takes many forms. Some of the most common pieces are chaise lounges and chairs. Materials that this furniture is made of include aluminum, metal, wood and PVC. Some chairs and chaise lounges have mesh seats and backs. For added comfort, look for chairs that have accessories like overhangs and cup holders and have their own padding attached. If your desired piece doesn't come with them, we have several pads you can attach to them. Chairs that are portable and break down so they fit into a carry bag easily make it easy for you to use them at home, at the beach or an outdoor concert. If you entertain often outside, we have two- and three-person benches for added seating, and some of these have storage underneath. To relax in style, consider chairs that are also rocking chairs or are Adirondack-style chairs that are a cross between a chair and chaise lounge. Outdoor dining sets that have tables that allow for a large umbrella to insert through provide shade when it's time to sit down to lunch or dinner. Other types of outdoor furniture sets we have include conversation sets, bistro sets, sectionals and sofas. Many of the permanent pieces also have covers to protect them from inclement weather.Grills and Outdoor CookingA backyard doesn t seem complete without a grill or two in use. Having a grill as part of your patio setup means less time inside the house on nice days and a chance to show off your culinary skills   even if it's just for grilling hot dogs and hamburgers. Grills come in many assorted styles, and we have several for you to consider. Gas grills and charcoal grills are the most common, with electric grills also being an option. There are also portable grills that you can use on a table or when you're out at the beach or park, and smokers or pellet grills make it so you can slow-roast meats and vegetables and add a lot of smoky flavor to them.Gas grills come in two forms: propane and natural gas. Propane gas grills require a canister of propane to be attached, but this allows these grills to be used anywhere in the backyard or even away from home. Natural gas grills require a hookup to the home and can only go as far as the gas line allows them. Charcoal grills use lighted charcoal briquettes to supply the heat. Gas grills allow you to control the flame better, but some people prefer the taste that comes from cooking over charcoal.Portable grills can be either propane gas or charcoal. Smokers can also be all three, although many use chunks of hardwood like pecan or mesquite to create the smoke that permeates whatever you're cooking. Pellet grills are also smoker grills but use pellets made from sawdust to create smoke. With any kind of grill, accessories are important. This includes spatulas, tongs, sauce brushes or mops, knives, grill brushes, forks and skewers. You can purchase these items separately or choose one of our convenient sets that have all the pieces you need inside. Other accessories and supplies to consider include:  Grill covers   for protecting your grill against the elements Chimney starters, charcoal, lighter fluid, wood chunks and chips   use with both charcoal grills and smokers Grill cleaning tools   stiff wire brushes that keep grill grates clean of burnt food turkey fryers   large, deep fryers for frying large cuts of meat outside Refrigerators and ice makers   for keeping food and beverages coldPatio and Outdoor DecorHaving some furniture and a grill on the patio is a terrific start. However, you may want to consider adding some homier touches to complete the scene. A couple of planters or large pots with flowers is a nice touch, or if you're doing a lot of cooking outside, you may want to grow some fresh herbs. Outdoor lighting is also essential because you don't want to be forced to go inside once the sun sets. Options you have here include landscape and deck lights, decorative lights that you connect to your home, tiki torches, colored bulbs on strands that you hang strategically around the patio or even flood lights. Other decorations you can add to brighten your patio area and backyard include bird baths, bird feeders, fountains, garden statues, weathervanes and even a small pond. The choices come to life with your imagination, so see what we have to offer and what inspires you.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349569, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
