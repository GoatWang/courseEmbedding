We never imagined the patent process could be so painless, cost effective, and produce such high quality, consistent results.
Brad GriffithFounder & CEO, Gametime
Obtaining the kind of information that a TurboPatent Portfolio report provided would typically cost us thousands of dollars and multiple weeks in turnaround time.
Taher SavliwalaVP of Intellectual Property, Quixey
As a start up, we knew that protecting our intellectual property was extremely important, but we also had to consider the reality of budget constraints. TurboPatent’s use of high-tech software is the solution we had hoped for, but didn’t know existed.
Evan MacmillanFounder & CEO, Gridspace
TurboPatent did a fantastic job of producing a quality patent in an impossibly short timeline. Their intellectual property expertise and use of the latest and greatest patent production technology saved my company tens of thousands of dollars and produced a quality document that has a critical role for us and our future.

Paralegal robot reviews patent documents

by Stephen Rynkiewicz, ABA Journal
New software helps patent lawyers draft applications that are more likely to pass muster with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office, as well as respond to official letters from examiners.
TurboPatent Corp. on June 28 launched artificial-intelligence products that compare patent claims with past applications to make predictions about patent eligibility.
The patent drafting software, dubbed RoboReview, automates paralegal work, bringing more rigor to the task of researching prior art and potentially saving thousands of dollars on a filing. It’s sold as a subscription product on an unlimited or per-use basis.
“Typically this review is done by humans doing multiple searches,” says James Billmaier, TurboPatent’s chief executive officer. “Very seasoned attorneys are amazed at things the machine finds that they miss in these very technically written documents.”

Big upgrades to TurboPatent’s Patent Quality Report tool: Art Unit prediction, related statistics on outcomes, cover page customization, and more!

June 02, 2016/



Britt Griffith












TurboPatent's newly upgraded Patent Quality Report includes Art Unit prediction and related statistics on outcomes, and much more.



Exciting news! TurboPatent has just deployed significant upgrades to the Patent Quality Report (PQR) tool. The PQR tool allows you to rapidly assess the technical quality of any patent application.As a result of these upgrades, you’ll find four new and improved features in the PQR:A prediction of the top five art units most likely to examine an application once filed (predictions are based on the text of claim 1)Associated with each predicted art unit are two corresponding statistics: the allowance rate and the average number of months to allowance from the filing date.The cover page may now be customized, per report, with up to five pieces of bibliographic information: title, firm, attorney, assignee, and docket number.A new navigation bar to the left of the report to rapidly scroll to any section of interest.You can check out the newly upgraded PQR by visiting app.turbopatent.us/application/reportTo analyze a patent application, you can upload any locally stored .docx document, OR you can check any granted or published application by simply entering the appropriate USPTO document number.We think you’re going to be very impressed with the latest PQR enhancements. Run a PQR in mere seconds and let us know what you think. We look forward to hearing your feedback!

TurboPatent Announces New Patent Quality Analytics Tool!

April 20, 2016/



Britt Griffith













TurboPatent Corporation today rolls out Patent Quality Report (PQR), a new analytics tool that enables corporations and patent professionals to rapidly assess the technical quality of a patent application at any stage.The Patent Quality Report (PQR) tool uses natural language processing technology and five validation algorithms to instantly identify quality gaps in any patent application, whether the application is in draft, post-grant, or anywhere in between. The report, which is produced in seconds, provides a highly informative, easy-to-digest summary of potential errors that may result in 112 rejections, restrict the scope of a patent, or weaken a patent during prosecution or litigation."Patent quality is one of the hottest topics in patent prosecution right now. The Patent Office has made patent quality a top ongoing priority, and has rightly indicated they can't do it alone. The patent bar needs to step up and produce higher quality patent applications, which will result in faster and more consistent prosecution, and more valid, enforceable, and defensible patent grants. Low quality patents mean low customer satisfaction with the patent system. They are bad for patent owners, bad for the Patent Office, and bad for business," said Charles Mirho, TurboPatent Co-Founder and General Counsel.For corporations, PQR not only reduces the time and expense in patent prosecution, creates stronger patents, and decreases litigation risks, but also serves as an inexpensive way to quickly and accurately evaluate the work-product of the intellectual property professionals that draft and prosecute their patents."Most corporations have handled their patent costs by using a fixed fee billing approach, which has put a lot of time pressure on their patent practitioners. As a result, the quality of the work-product and the ability to monitor and track it has suffered. We know this because we've been able to use our analytics technologies on tens of thousands of pending and granted patents, which revealed significant defects that would pose great risks in post-grant proceedings. With TurboPatent's PQR and other analytics services, corporate patent managers can now easily monitor workflow and ensure that quality is not being compromised," said James Billmaier, Co-Founder and CEO of TurboPatent.TurboPatent's PQR tool is highly secure, cloud-based, and is both Mac and PC-compatible, unlike existing patent analysis tools which require third-party software integrations, and are not compatible with all operating systems.PQR joins TurboPatent's suite of intellectual property tools, which focus on automating and streamlining the drafting and prosecution process. In addition, TurboPatent Engineering Services group provides patent prosecution analytics, outside counsel performance scoring, and portfolio assessments, all using TurboPatent® natural language processing, machine learning, and big data analytics technologies.More information, including further product details, pricing, and a downloadable Patent Quality Report sample, can be found here. You can also sign up or sign in to use PQR here. This press release originally appeared on PR Newswire. Read the full press release here.

TurboPatent Announces New Patent Quality Analytics Tool






Apr 20, 2016, 11:00am EDT














SEATTLE, April 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- TurboPatent Corporation today rolls out Patent Quality Report (PQR), a new analytics tool that enables corporations and patent professionals to rapidly assess the technical quality of a patent application at any stage. 
The Patent Quality Report (PQR) tool uses natural language processing technology and five validation algorithms to instantly identify quality gaps in any patent application, whether the application is in draft, post-grant, or anywhere in between. The report, which is produced in seconds, provides a highly informative, easy-to-digest summary of potential errors that may result in 112 rejections, restrict the scope of a patent, or weaken a patent during prosecution or litigation. 
"Patent quality is one of the hottest topics in patent prosecution right now. The Patent Office has made patent quality a top ongoing priority, and has rightly indicated they can't do it alone. The patent bar needs to step up and produce higher quality patent applications, which will result in faster and more consistent prosecution, and more valid, enforceable, and defensible patent grants. Low quality patents mean low customer satisfaction with the patent system. They are bad for patent owners, bad for the Patent Office, and bad for business," said Charles Mirho, TurboPatent Co-Founder and General Counsel. 
For corporations, PQR not only reduces the time and expense in patent prosecution, creates stronger patents, and decreases litigation risks, but also serves as an inexpensive way to quickly and accurately evaluate the work-product of the intellectual property professionals that draft and prosecute their patents.
"Most corporations have handled their patent costs by using a fixed fee billing approach, which has put a lot of time pressure on their patent practitioners. As a result, the quality of the work-product and the ability to monitor and track it has suffered. We know this because we've been able to use our analytics technologies on tens of thousands of pending and granted patents, which revealed significant defects that would pose great risks in post-grant proceedings. With TurboPatent's PQR and other analytics services, corporate patent managers can now easily monitor workflow and ensure that quality is not being compromised," said James Billmaier, Co-Founder and CEO of TurboPatent.
TurboPatent's PQR tool is highly secure, cloud-based, and is both Mac and PC-compatible, unlike existing patent analysis tools which require third-party software integrations, and are not compatible with all operating systems.
PQR joins TurboPatent's suite of intellectual property tools, which focus on automating and streamlining the drafting and prosecution process. In addition, TurboPatent Engineering Services group provides patent prosecution analytics, outside counsel performance scoring, and portfolio assessments, all using TurboPatent® natural language processing, machine learning, and big data analytics technologies.
