Home


Acadian specializes in active global and international equity strategies, employing sophisticated analytical models for active stock selection. Our proprietary database covers over 40,500 securities in more than 100 markets worldwide. Acadian's extensive research capabilities are used to develop customized investment management solutions for our clients.

 
















Acadian is led by a dedicated team including some employees whose tenure with the firm extends back over thirty years. Co-founder and CEO Churchill Franklin brought his experience from the corporate treasury and endowment worlds to his oversight of Acadian's client service, sales and marketing teams, and to his current role as Chief Executive Officer. CIO John Chisholm, whose long association with Acadian began while at MIT's Sloan School of Management, oversees our investment process and team and directs research initiatives. Ron Frashure, Chairman, continues to work closely with clients on asset allocation and investment policy issues. Ron was formerly a portfolio manager and director of asset allocation with the Putnam Companies prior to joining Acadian.



From its origin as a non-U.S. all-cap equity manager in 1988, Acadian has grown to manage over 60 different strategies in global equities and emerging markets for clients across the globe.  Acadian's strategies today include Global Equity, Long/Short Equity, and Managed Volatility along with a host of customized solutions which have been tailored to clients' needs. 
Acadian is proud to have been acknowledged by Pension & Investments as one of the Best Places to Work in Money Management for 2015. P&I noted many of Acadian's core beliefs of transparency, collaboration, and diversity in describing the characteristics that helped Acadian earn this distinction. In responding to surveys that were the basis for P&I's selections, Acadian employees took pride in mentioning Acadian's supportive culture and open, collegial atmosphere, also noting exciting opportunities for growth within the firm. According to the survey's data compilers, companies making P&I's "Best Places to Work" list scored highly in the categories of employer relations, social responsibility and diversity, and work-life balance. These firms also earned high marks from employees on career development, total rewards, and work environment.

ESG






Global
We believe there are numerous advantages to a truly global approach to investing, in addition to the pure breadth of opportunities it may offer. Our Global strategy, launched in 1992, best reflects the increased globalization of economic activity and seeks to provide the greatest opportunity to exploit stock, country and sector effects in both developed and emerging markets. A global approach to equity investing may also offer diversification in the sources of value-added to portfolio returns, and allows for active asset allocation across countries, regions and sectors that may not be available in segregated regional strategies.  


Regional
As clients' needs have evolved, Acadian's product offerings have expanded to include a variety of regional equity strategies. These implementations range from single country mandates in the U.S. and Japan to entire regions in developed, emerging and frontier markets.   


Small-Cap
Acadian’s expertise in managing high volumes of data gives us the ability to apply our stock selection process not only across countries, regions and sectors, but across capitalization sizes as well. Our highly structured portfolio construction and portfolio management processes, and skill in trading less liquid markets, gives Acadian the ability to efficiently apply our stock forecast model in small-cap stocks in developed and emerging markets.    


Concentrated
Based on collaboration with clients seeking higher levels of excess return, Acadian launched a series of high conviction strategies. Holding a smaller number of stocks in a portfolio has the potential to allow us to maximize absolute returns by focusing on Acadian's most highly ranked stocks. Within our concentrated strategies the focus is on absolute risk, as portfolios feature high tracking error, but are also aiming for high risk-adjusted returns as reflected in Sharpe ratios.


ESG
		        At our core, Acadian seeks investments that are likely to generate the best risk-adjusted returns. We believe such investments are characterized by strong financial health, solid business prospects, effective corporate governance and upside potential. We have uncovered responsible investment factors that have the potential to add value at both the bottom-up and top-down levels, and these are integrated within our core process. In addition, we offer customized ESG capabilities in our portfolio construction and proxy voting systems at client request. 

For more information, please see Acadian's Statement on Responsible Investing.

In addition, Acadian is committed to our ESG research agenda. We believe that ESG issues may be material investment issues, and the academic and practitioner research on quantitative ESG signals is growing. Acadian believes the potential return to such research has the potential to be attractive, and that principles of socially responsible investing fit well with our core approach to investing.

Acadian is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), ESG-RA and the Japan Stewardship Code. As an active signatory to the PRI, we participate in the annual review of our firm’s responsible investing process and policies. Our Transparency Report is disclosed on the PRI website.

Global
We believe there are numerous advantages to a truly global approach to investing, in addition to the pure breadth of opportunities it may offer. Our Global strategy, launched in 1992, best reflects the increased globalization of economic activity and seeks to provide the greatest opportunity to exploit stock, country and sector effects in both developed and emerging markets. A global approach to equity investing may also offer diversification in the sources of value-added to portfolio returns, and allows for active asset allocation across countries, regions and sectors that may not be available in segregated regional strategies.  


Regional
As clients' needs have evolved, Acadian's product offerings have expanded to include a variety of regional equity strategies. These implementations range from single country mandates in the U.S. and Japan to entire regions in developed, emerging and frontier markets.   


Small-Cap
Acadian’s expertise in managing high volumes of data gives us the ability to apply our stock selection process not only across countries, regions and sectors, but across capitalization sizes as well. Our highly structured portfolio construction and portfolio management processes, and skill in trading less liquid markets, gives Acadian the ability to efficiently apply our stock forecast model in small-cap stocks in developed and emerging markets.    


Concentrated
Based on collaboration with clients seeking higher levels of excess return, Acadian launched a series of high conviction strategies. Holding a smaller number of stocks in a portfolio has the potential to allow us to maximize absolute returns by focusing on Acadian's most highly ranked stocks. Within our concentrated strategies the focus is on absolute risk, as portfolios feature high tracking error, but are also aiming for high risk-adjusted returns as reflected in Sharpe ratios.


ESG
		        At our core, Acadian seeks investments that are likely to generate the best risk-adjusted returns. We believe such investments are characterized by strong financial health, solid business prospects, effective corporate governance and upside potential. We have uncovered responsible investment factors that have the potential to add value at both the bottom-up and top-down levels, and these are integrated within our core process. In addition, we offer customized ESG capabilities in our portfolio construction and proxy voting systems at client request. 

For more information, please see Acadian's Statement on Responsible Investing.

In addition, Acadian is committed to our ESG research agenda. We believe that ESG issues may be material investment issues, and the academic and practitioner research on quantitative ESG signals is growing. Acadian believes the potential return to such research has the potential to be attractive, and that principles of socially responsible investing fit well with our core approach to investing.

Acadian is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), ESG-RA and the Japan Stewardship Code. As an active signatory to the PRI, we participate in the annual review of our firm’s responsible investing process and policies. Our Transparency Report is disclosed on the PRI website.

Acadian Asset Management Launches Emerging Market Equity Fund
Jan 9 17
Acadian Asset Management has launched what it believes to be the emerging market equity fund focused on avoiding fossil-fuel-related investments. It would be a ‘pioneering new direction’ for responsible investing and emphasises its commitment to responsible investment. This new approach was developed with seed money from the Guardian Media Group. Acadian said there is strong, growing demand for such funds that allow investors to diversify their returns while not impacting sustainability ambitions. It will operate using a combination of third-party data and Acadian’s own proprietary investment models, which can identify and exclude companies which own fossil fuel reserves.  The aim is to ensure the portfolio’s aggregate carbon emissions are at least 25% lower than the benchmark index. This approach will be applied across the 13,000-strong database of stocks it tracks in the emerging world, as well as within the less-covered small- and mid-cap investment markets.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services. Fiduciary standards or fiduciary duties do not apply, for example, when the Bank is offering or providing credit solutions, banking, custody or brokerage products/services or referrals to other affiliates of the Bank.

Emerging Markets at the Crossroads
A radical shift in the forces shaping emerging market (EM) growth will require investors to take a different investment approach from what may have worked in the past. Increasingly, discovering EM investment opportunities will be rooted in the ability to capture the alpha from the new growth drivers, rather than in chasing the beta of the broad EM universe.

Home


Acadian specializes in active global and international equity strategies, employing sophisticated analytical models for active stock selection. Our proprietary database covers over 40,500 securities in more than 100 markets worldwide. Acadian's extensive research capabilities are used to develop customized investment management solutions for our clients.

 
















Acadian is led by a dedicated team including some employees whose tenure with the firm extends back over thirty years. Co-founder and CEO Churchill Franklin brought his experience from the corporate treasury and endowment worlds to his oversight of Acadian's client service, sales and marketing teams, and to his current role as Chief Executive Officer. CIO John Chisholm, whose long association with Acadian began while at MIT's Sloan School of Management, oversees our investment process and team and directs research initiatives. Ron Frashure, Chairman, continues to work closely with clients on asset allocation and investment policy issues. Ron was formerly a portfolio manager and director of asset allocation with the Putnam Companies prior to joining Acadian.



From its origin as a non-U.S. all-cap equity manager in 1988, Acadian has grown to manage over 60 different strategies in global equities and emerging markets for clients across the globe.  Acadian's strategies today include Global Equity, Long/Short Equity, and Managed Volatility along with a host of customized solutions which have been tailored to clients' needs. 
Acadian is proud to have been acknowledged by Pension & Investments as one of the Best Places to Work in Money Management for 2015. P&I noted many of Acadian's core beliefs of transparency, collaboration, and diversity in describing the characteristics that helped Acadian earn this distinction. In responding to surveys that were the basis for P&I's selections, Acadian employees took pride in mentioning Acadian's supportive culture and open, collegial atmosphere, also noting exciting opportunities for growth within the firm. According to the survey's data compilers, companies making P&I's "Best Places to Work" list scored highly in the categories of employer relations, social responsibility and diversity, and work-life balance. These firms also earned high marks from employees on career development, total rewards, and work environment.

Acadian specializes in active global and international equity strategies, employing sophisticated analytical models for active stock selection. Our proprietary database covers over 40,500 securities in more than 100 markets worldwide. Acadian's extensive research capabilities are used to develop customized investment management solutions for our clients.

 
















Acadian is led by a dedicated team including some employees whose tenure with the firm extends back over thirty years. Co-founder and CEO Churchill Franklin brought his experience from the corporate treasury and endowment worlds to his oversight of Acadian's client service, sales and marketing teams, and to his current role as Chief Executive Officer. CIO John Chisholm, whose long association with Acadian began while at MIT's Sloan School of Management, oversees our investment process and team and directs research initiatives. Ron Frashure, Chairman, continues to work closely with clients on asset allocation and investment policy issues. Ron was formerly a portfolio manager and director of asset allocation with the Putnam Companies prior to joining Acadian.



From its origin as a non-U.S. all-cap equity manager in 1988, Acadian has grown to manage over 60 different strategies in global equities and emerging markets for clients across the globe.  Acadian's strategies today include Global Equity, Long/Short Equity, and Managed Volatility along with a host of customized solutions which have been tailored to clients' needs. 
Acadian is proud to have been acknowledged by Pension & Investments as one of the Best Places to Work in Money Management for 2015. P&I noted many of Acadian's core beliefs of transparency, collaboration, and diversity in describing the characteristics that helped Acadian earn this distinction. In responding to surveys that were the basis for P&I's selections, Acadian employees took pride in mentioning Acadian's supportive culture and open, collegial atmosphere, also noting exciting opportunities for growth within the firm. According to the survey's data compilers, companies making P&I's "Best Places to Work" list scored highly in the categories of employer relations, social responsibility and diversity, and work-life balance. These firms also earned high marks from employees on career development, total rewards, and work environment.
