Dynegy Inc. has signed a deal with NRG Energy Inc. through which the companies will each simultaneously purchase the other's stake in two jointly held entities that own power generation facilities in Illinois and California.
Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement for the Illinois interests, Dynegy will acquire NRG's 50 percent ownership stake in the jointly held entity that owns the Rocky Road power plant, a 330-megawatt natural gas-fired peaking facility near Chicago.




 


As part of the purchase and sale agreement for the California interests, Dynegy will sell its 50 percent stake in WCP (Generation) Holdings LLC, a joint venture between Dynegy and NRG with ownership in power plants totaling approximately 1,800 megawatts in Southern California, to NRG.





As a result of the two transactions, Dynegy will also receive net cash proceeds of $160 million from NRG, subject to certain purchase price adjustments at closing. The transactions, which are conditioned upon one another and subject to approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, are expected to close in the first quarter of 2006.
Following the closing of the transactions and a 90-day period during which Dynegy will provide NRG with certain transition services for the California assets, NRG will assume full operational and commercial management of Encina (a 965-megawatt generation facility in Carlsbad, Calif.), El Segundo (a 670-megawatt generation facility in El Segundo, Calif.), and Cabrillo II (173 megawatts of combustion turbines located in San Diego).
The California interests involved in the transactions also include Dynegy's 50 percent ownership stake in Long Beach, a 530-megawatt facility whose generating capacity has not been included in overall transaction figure of approximately 1,800 megawatts because the asset was retired effective Jan. 1, 2005.




 


Houston-based Dynegy (NYSE: DYN) provides electricity to markets and customers throughout the United States.
NRG (NYSE: NRG) is a power generator based in Princeton, N.J. It owns NRG Energy Center Pittsburgh, which supplies steam and chilled water to heat and cool 28 buildings throughout the North Side.

The buildings NRG provides steam and chilled water to range from Allegheny General to the Community College of Allegheny County's Allegheny Campus, PNC Park and The Andy Warhol Museum.
Pittsburgh has three separate district energy plants: NRG on the North Side, Pittsburgh Allegheny County Thermal, Downtown, and the Bellefield Power Plant in Oakland.

The non-guarantor subsidiaries include all of NRG's foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries, including GenOn and its subsidiaries. NRG 
conducts much of its business through and derives much of its income from its subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company's ability to make required payments with 
respect to its indebtedness and other obligations depends on the financial results and condition of its subsidiaries and NRG's ability to receive funds from its 
subsidiaries. Except for NRG Bayou Cove, LLC, which is subject to certain restrictions under the Company's Peaker financing agreements, there are no 
restrictions on the ability of any of the guarantor subsidiaries to transfer funds to NRG. In addition, there may be restrictions for certain non-guarantor 
subsidiaries. 
The following condensed consolidating financial information presents the financial information of NRG Energy, Inc., the guarantor subsidiaries and 
the non-guarantor subsidiaries in accordance with Rule 3-10 under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-X. The financial information

such projects, El Segundo Power, LLC, Long Beach Generation LLC,
Cabrillo Power I LLC and Cabrillo Power II LLC (the

shares (subject to the potential addition or substitution of new
investors in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), for the
purpose of holding one hundred percent of their ownership interests
in West Coast Power LLC, a new single-member Delaware limited
liability company formed to consolidate the ownership interests in
all of the Initial Project Companies and for acquiring, owning and
managing the operations of such additional power generation assets
as West Coast Power LLC may acquire in the future.

the Company as a foreign limited liability company in that

2.07         
No State-Law

(iii)

Member may not Dispose of or Encumber all or any portion of its
Membership Interest except in strict accordance with this Section
3.03. (References in this Section 3.03 to Dispositions or
Encumbrances of a “Membership Interest” shall also
refer to Dispositions or Encumbrances of a portion of a Membership
Interest.) Any attempted Disposition or Encumbrance of a Membership
Interest, other than in strict accordance with this Section 3.03,
shall be, and is hereby declared, null and
 
15 





 
void ab initio. The Members agree that a
breach of the provisions of this Section 3.03 may cause irreparable
injury to the Company and to the other Members for which monetary
damages (or other remedy at law) are inadequate in view of (i) the
complexities and uncertainties in measuring the actual damages that
would be sustained by reason of the failure of a Member to comply
with such provisions and (ii) the uniqueness of the Company
business and the relationship among the Members. Accordingly, the
Members agree that the provisions of this Section 3.03 may be
enforced by specific performance.
 

(b)            
Dispositions of Membership
Interests .

 

(i)        
General
Restriction . A
Member may not Dispose of its Membership Interest except by
complying with all of the following requirements:

in the event a Member seeks to
Dispose of a Controlling Interest in the Company in one or more
separate or related transactions, such Member must receive the
consent of the Initial Members that are the non-Disposing Members,
which consent may be granted or withheld by the non-Disposing
Members in their Sole Discretion; provided, however, that such
consent need not be obtained if (I) the proposed Assignee is a
Wholly-Owned Affiliate of the Disposing Member and (II) such
proposed Assignee demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of
the non-Disposing Members that it has the ability to meet the
financial and contractual commitments and other obligations of the
Disposing Member; and

 

(B)      
in the event a Member seeks to
Dispose of any Interest that is less than a Controlling Interest in
the Company in one or more separate or related transactions, such
Member must receive the consent of the Initial Members that are the
non-Disposing Members, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld; provided, however, that such consent need not be obtained
if (I) the proposed Assignee is a Wholly-Owned Affiliate of the
Disposing Member and (II) such proposed Assignee demonstrates to
the reasonable satisfaction of the non-Disposing Member that it has
the ability to meet the financial and contractual commitments and
other obligations of the Disposing Member; and

 

(C)      
if the applicable consent required
by the preceding clause (A) or (B), as the case may be, has been
obtained, such Member must comply with the requirements of Section
3.03(b)(iii) and, if the Assignee is to be admitted as a Member,
Section 3.03(b)(ii).

 

(ii)       
Admission of Assignee as a
Member . An
Assignee has the right to be admitted to the Company as a Member,

making the Disposition has granted the Assignee either (I) the
Disposing Member’s entire Membership Interest or (II) the
express right to be so

Dispositions and Admissions . In
addition to the requirements set forth in Sections 3.03(b)(i) and
3.03(b)(ii), any Disposition of a Membership Interest and any
admission of an Assignee as a Member shall also be subject to the
following requirements, and such Disposition (and admission, if
applicable) shall not be effective unless such requirements are
complied with; provided, however, that the Executive Committee, in
its sole and absolute discretion, may waive any of the following
requirements:

its confirmation that the representations and warranties in Section

correct.

Disposition is registered under the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities Law, or the proposed Assignee is a
Wholly-Owned Affiliate as described in 3.03(b)(i)(A) above, a
favorable opinion of the Company’s legal counsel, or of other
legal counsel acceptable to the Executive Committee, to the effect
that the Disposition and admission is being made pursuant to a
valid exemption from registration under those Laws and in
accordance with those Laws.
 
17 





 

(IV)      
Tax Opinion
. Unless waived by the Executive Committee, a
favorable opinion of the Certified Public Accountants, or of other

meaning of Code Section 708.

 

(V)       
Amended LLC
Agreement . An
amended Agreement governing the rights and obligations of the
Members, and making such changes to this Agreement as are made
necessary by the Disposition (e.g., the provisions pertaining to
management of the LLC may be revised due to a Member having a
non-Controlling interest in the Company).

 

(B)      
Payment of
Expenses . The
Disposing Member and its Assignee shall pay, or reimburse the
Company for, all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
Company in connection with the Disposition and admission, including

the tenth Day after the receipt by that Person of the
Company’s invoice for the amount due.

 

(C)      
No Release
. No Disposition of a Membership Interest shall
effect a release of the Disposing Member from any liabilities to
the Company or the other Members arising from events occurring
prior to the Disposition.

 

(c)            
Disposition Resulting from a
Change of Member Control . The
requirements of this Section 3.03 shall have no application to an
effective Disposition of Control over Membership Interests that may
result from a Change of Member Control. No Member shall have any
rights to consent to or approve any Change of Member
Control.

 

(d)            
Encumbrances of Membership
Interest and Member Equity . A
Member may not Encumber its Membership Interest, or permit an
Encumbrance against the equity interests in such Member (other than
interests in such Member’s Parent), without the consent of
the non-Encumbering Members, which may be granted or withheld in
their Sole Discretion. If such consent is granted, a Member may
Encumber its Membership Interest (or suffer an Encumbrance against
the equity interests in such Member), only if the instrument
creating such Encumbrance provides that any foreclosure of such
Encumbrance (or Disposition in lieu of such foreclosure) must
comply with the requirements of Section 3.03(b), unless waived by
the other Members. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions
set forth in this clause (e) shall not apply in the event the
Members Encumber their Membership Interests in connection with
Company financings approved by the Executive Committee.
 
18 





 

3.04        
Creation of Additional
Membership Interest. Additional Membership Interests may be created
and issued to existing Members or to other Persons, and such other
Persons may be admitted to the Company as Members, with the
unanimous consent of the existing Members, on such terms and
conditions as the existing Members may unanimously determine at the
time of admission. The terms of admission or issuance must specify
the Sharing Ratios applicable thereto and may provide for the
creation of different classes or groups of Members having different
rights, powers, and duties. The Executive Committee may reflect the
creation of any new class or group in an amendment to this
Agreement indicating the different rights, powers, and duties. Any
such admission is effective only after the new Member has executed
and delivered to the Members an instrument containing the notice
address of the new Member, the Assignee’s ratification of
this Agreement and agreement to be bound by it, and its
confirmation that the representations and warranties in Section
3.02(a) are true and correct with respect to it. The provisions of
this Section 3.04 shall not apply to Dispositions of Membership
Interests or admissions of Assignees in connection therewith, such
matters being governed by Section 3.03.

 

3.05        
Access to
Information. Each
Member shall be entitled to receive any information that it may
reasonably request concerning the Company; provided, however, that
this Section 3.05 shall not obligate the Company or the Executive
Committee to create any information that does not already exist at
the time of such request (other than to convert existing
information from one medium to another, such as providing a
printout of information that is stored in a computer database).
Each Member shall also have the right, upon reasonable notice, and
at all reasonable times during usual business hours to inspect the
properties of the Company and to audit, examine and make copies of
the books of account and other records of the Company. Such right
may be exercised through any agent or employee of such Member
designated in writing by it or by an independent public accountant,
engineer, attorney or other consultant so designated. The Member
making the request shall bear all costs and expenses incurred in
any inspection, examination or audit made on such Member’s
behalf. Moreover, the Member making the request shall indemnify the
Company and the other Members for any and all Claims arising out of
or related to any activities of the requesting Member’s
agent, employee, independent public accountant, engineer, attorney
or other consultant while present at and traveling to and from the
Projects. Confidential Information obtained pursuant to this
Section 3.05 shall be subject to the provisions of Section
3.06.

 

3.06        
Confidential
Information. (a)
Except as permitted by Section 3.06(b), (i) each Member shall keep
confidential all Confidential Information and shall not disclose
any Confidential Information to any Person, including any of its
Affiliates, and (ii) each Member shall use the Confidential
Information only in connection with the business of the
Company.

 

(b)           
Notwithstanding Section 3.06(a), but
subject to the other provisions of this Section 3.06, a Member may
make the following disclosures and uses of Confidential
Information:
 
19 





 

(i)        
disclosures to the other Members in
connection with the Company;

 

(ii)       
disclosures and uses that are
approved by the Executive Committee;

 

(iii)      
disclosures to a Wholly-Owned
Affiliate of such Member, if such Wholly-Owned Affiliate has agreed
to abide by the terms of this Section 3.06;

 

(iv)      disclosures to a Person that is not a Member or
an Affiliate of a Member, if such Person has been retained to
provide services by the Member in connection with the Company or
such Member’s Membership Interest and has agreed to abide by
the terms of this Section 3.06;

 

(v)      
disclosures to lenders, potential
lenders or other Persons providing financing for the Projects or to
potential equity purchasers, in each case if such Persons have
agreed to abide by the terms of this Section 3.06;

 

(vi)      disclosures to Governmental Authorities that
are necessary to operate the Projects consistent with the Project
Agreements and applicable Law;

 

(vii)     disclosures that a Member is legally compelled
to make by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents,
subpoena, civil investigative demand, order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, or similar process, or otherwise by Law or securities
exchange requirements; provided, however, that prior to any such
disclosure, such Member shall, to the extent legally
permissible:

 

(A)       
provide the Executive Committee with
prompt notice of such requirements so that the other Members may
seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive
compliance with the terms of Section 3.06(a);

 

(B)       
consult with the Executive Committee
on the advisability of taking steps to resist or narrow such
disclosure; and

 

(C)       
cooperate with the Executive
Committee and with the other Members in any attempt any of them may
make to obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy or
assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded the
Confidential Information; and in the event such protective order or
other remedy is not obtained, or the other Members waive compliance
with the provisions hereof, such Member agrees (I) to furnish only
that portion of the Confidential Information that the other Members
are advised by counsel to the disclosing Member is legally required
and (II) to exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain
 
20 





 

assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such Confidential
Information.

 

(c)           
Each Member shall take such
precautionary measures as may be required to ensure (and such
Member shall be responsible for) compliance with this Section 3.06
by any of its Affiliates, and its and their directors, officers,
employees and agents, and other Persons to which it may disclose
Confidential Information in accordance with this Section
3.06.

 

(d)           
A Terminated Member shall promptly
destroy (and provide a certificate of destruction to the Company
with respect to) or return to the Company, as directed by the
Executive Committee, all Confidential Information in its
possession. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, a
Terminated Member may, subject to the other provisions of this
Section 3.06, retain and use Confidential Information for the
limited purpose of preparing such Terminated Member’s tax
returns and defending audits, investigations and proceedings
relating thereto.

 

(e)           
The Members agree that no adequate
remedy at law exists for a breach or threatened breach of any of
the provisions of this Section 3.06, the continuation of which
unremedied breach will cause the Company and the other Members to
suffer irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Members agree that the
Company and the other Members shall be entitled, in addition to
other remedies that may be available to them, to immediate
injunctive relief from any breach of any of the provisions of this
Section 3.06 and to specific performance of their rights hereunder,
as well as to any other remedies available at law or in
equity.

this Section 3.06 shall terminate on the third anniversary of the
end of the Term.

the Company, unless such liability is expressly agreed to in
writing by such Member.

 

3.08

. A Member may not withdraw or resign from the
Company.
 

ARTICLE 4
CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS
 

4.01        
Capital
Contributions . Without creating any rights in favor of any
third party, the Initial Members shall contribute to the Company on
the Effective Date their respective DPC Contributed Shares and NRG
Contributed Shares, and thereafter, on or before the date specified
as hereinafter described, each Member shall contribute its Sharing
Ratio of monies and other assets that, in either case, in the
judgment of the Executive Committee are necessary to enable the
Company and its subsidiaries to pursue
 
21 




 

 
the business purposes specified in Section 2.04.
The Executive Committee shall notify each Member of the need for
Capital Contributions pursuant to this Section 4.01 when
appropriate, which notice must include a statement in reasonable
detail of the proposed uses of the Capital Contributions and a date
(which date may be no earlier than the fifth Business Day following
each Member’s receipt of its notice) before which the Capital
Contributions must be made. Notices for Capital Contributions must
be made to all Members in accordance with their Sharing
Ratios.
 

4.02         
Failure to
Contribute.  
(a) If a Member does not contribute, within 10 Days of the date
required, all or any portion of a Capital Contribution that such
Member is required to make as provided in this Agreement, the other
Members may cause the Company to exercise, on notice to that Member
(the “Non-Contributing Member”), one or more of
the following remedies:

 

(i)        
taking such action (including court
proceedings) as the other Members may deem appropriate to obtain
payment by the Non-Contributing Member of the portion of the
Non-Contributing Member’s Capital Contribution that is in
default, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from
the date that the Capital Contribution was due until the date that
it is made, all at the cost and expense of the Non-Contributing
Member;

 

(ii)       
in the case of Capital Contributions
other than DPC Contributed Shares or NRG Contributed Shares,
permitting the other Members (the “ Lending Members
”), to advance the portion of the Non-Contributing
Member’s Capital Contribution that is in default (in
proportion to their respective ownership interests or as they may
otherwise agree), with the following results:

 

(A)       
the sum advanced constitutes a loan
from the Lending Members to the Non-Contributing Member and a
Capital Contribution of that sum to the Company by the
Non-Contributing Member pursuant to the applicable provisions of
this Agreement,

 

(B)       
the principal balance of the loan
and all accrued unpaid interest thereon is due and payable in whole
on the tenth Day after written demand therefor by the Lending
Members to the Non-Contributing Member,

 

(C)       
the amount lent bears interest at
the Default Rate from the Day that the advance is deemed made until
the date that the loan, together with all interest accrued on it,
is repaid to the Lending Members,

 

(D)       
all distributions from the Company
that otherwise would be made to the Non-Contributing Member
(whether before or after dissolution of the Company) instead shall
be paid to the Lending Members until the loan and all interest
accrued on it have been paid in full to the
 
22 






 

Lending Members (with payments being
applied first to accrued and unpaid interest and then to
principal),

 

(E)        
the payment of the loan and interest
accrued on it is secured by a security interest in the
Non-Contributing Member’s Membership Interest, as more fully
set forth in Section 4.02(b), and

 

(F)        
the Lending Members have the right,
in addition to the other rights and remedies granted to them
pursuant to this Agreement or available to them at Law or in
equity, to take any action (including court proceedings) that the
Lending Members may deem appropriate to obtain payment by the
Non-Contributing Member of the loan and all accrued and unpaid
interest on it, at the cost and expense of the Non-Contributing
Member;

 

(iii)      
exercising the rights of a secured
party under the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of Delaware,
as more fully set forth in Section 4.02(b); or

 

(iv)      exercising any other rights and remedies
available at Law or in equity.
 

In addition, the failure to make
such contributions shall constitute a Default by the
Non-Contributing Member, and the other Members shall have the
rights set forth in Article 9 with respect to such
Default.

 

(b)           
Each Member grants to the Company,
and to each Lending Member with respect to any loans made by a
Lending Member to that Member as a Non-Contributing Member pursuant
to Section 4.02(a)(ii), as security, equally and ratably, for the
payment of all Capital Contributions that Member has agreed to make
and the payment of all loans and interest accrued on them made by
Lending Members to that Member a
