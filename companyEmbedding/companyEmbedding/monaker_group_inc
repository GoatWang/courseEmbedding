To help others experience the wonders of our world and the delights of traveling. From what began in the late 1940s as a glimmer in his eye, today is Maupintour, one of the best known and respected names in the travel industry. In 1951, Tom Maupin took a big step in realizing his dream — he purchased a small travel company in the university town of Lawrence, Kansas, where he had attended college. Soon after, he began creating escorted vacations.
In 1956 Maupintour became the first company to send tourists into the Soviet Union after World War II. These tours were unprecedented in tourism and received wide national press coverage that instantly established Maupintour as an innovative, forward-thinking company, a reputation that it still maintains. Maupintour continues to lead the tour industry in the creation of outstanding, unique itineraries. Maupintour travelers have the highest repeat rate in the industry, with some taking as many as 60 vacations with Maupintour.
Today, Maupintour is still guided by the traditions and principles instilled by the late Tom Maupin, leadership, quality, variety, value, service and the fulfillment of client’s travel dreams. Come along with Maupintour and make your dreams come true.

            Committed to building innovative companies and bringing unique product sets to the marketplace Monaker Group, Inc. (OTCQB: MKGI) is a technology-driven travel company leveraging its resources to become a significant presence in the fastest growing sector of the $1.3 trillion travel and tourism market. The company's flagship brand, NextTrip.com, is the industry's first and only real-time booking engine that features alternative lodging (vacation home rentals, resort residences and unused timeshare inventory), as well as a full selection of airlines, hotels, cruises, rental cars, tours and concierge services. These features are combined into a single, easy-to-use platform that gives travelers complete real-time control when planning and booking their vacations.   Investment Highlights  Unique and Competitive Travel Offerings to Global Destinations 	Assembled Multiple Key Travel Brands and Partnerships 	Proprietary Technology Creates Comprehensive Booking Platform 	Positioned to Scale in Budding Alternative Lodging Space 	Innovative First Mover in Lucrative Tourism Industry 	Led by Experienced Travel, Technology and M&A Team       Brand Portfolio  Established portfolio of travel brands its catalyst for diverse yet sturdy foundation of growth According to data from the U.S. Travel Association, direct spending on leisure travel by domestic and international travelers topped $650 billion in 2015. When combined with the fact that roughly 64 percent of travel companies are still considered small businesses, Monaker's all-inclusive approach to vacation booking through its NextTrip and Maupintour brands strategically positions the company for sustainable growth moving forward.    NextTrip.com combines multiple booking solutions into a highly intuitive real-time booking platform. Since its launch in February 2016, NextTrip has already grown to more than 250,000 units of vacation rental inventory. Monaker currently has roughly 1 million additional alternative lodging units under contract that will soon be added to the platform, which will place NextTrip among the top three largest vacation rental inventories and rival industry peers (Airbnb and HomeAway) in the rapidly expanding alternative lodging market. Unlike the competition, which book by request and can take hours or days before a lodging owner confirms the reservation, the vast majority of NextTrip's platform books in real-time, similar to online hotel bookings. NextTrip listings are in desirable locations span the globe with a concentration in the U.S., the EU and the Caribbean with about 20% exclusive listings. Monaker expects rapid exclusive listing growth because unlike the competition, Monaker's primary model is a commission upon booking and may charge auxiliary fees based upon the transaction. Monaker has also integrated its proprietary timeshare booking engine, NextTrip Resorts, which will now allow timeshare owners and/or property managers to post their unused resort properties into NextTrip's vacation rental inventory. As an added feature, consumers can make an offer for even greater savings on these properties. The NextTrip Resorts Platform:  Gives timeshare owners access to a large scale travel distribution platform allowing them to market their property and capture income when not using it 	Owners can add/edit properties, monitor bookings and rent otherwise vacant properties 	Vacationers gain access to high quality vacation suites with numerous amenities at high-end resorts worldwide. 	This largely untapped inventory is estimated 19 million rooms of which roughly 25% go unused.        In business for 65 years, Monaker's Maupintour still leads the tour industry in the creation of outstanding, unique itineraries and has the highest repeat rate in the tour industry. The brand's upscale luxury services create a unique blend with the various product offerings of NextTrip.    Monaker is also the parent company for Voyage TV, which has thousands of hours of travel footage shot in over 30 countries worldwide. These 15,000 video clips of hotels, resorts, cruise and destination activities are a treasure trove for vacation travel marketing.         Channel Partners  Established relationships with strategic channel partners provide significant inventory and distribution opportunities and pathways MarkTravel  Largest travel wholesaler in North America 	Mark Travel has approximately 70,000 Travel Agents using their system 	60+ million customers including Southwest Airlines, Hilton and Hyatt Vacations and United Airlines  International Travel Organization (ITO)   20,000+ travel agents worldwide 	Agreement to supply Monaker's alternative lodging and tour products 	Expected $2 million contribution initial year  Recruiter.com Partnership with Monaker to develop a custom travel club solution offering for Recruiter.com membersRecruiter.com will offer the new travel club solution to its three million current members and followers Members will enjoy highly discounted travel and vacation packages (through Monaker's NextTrip Platform), along with special benefits such as concierge support, exclusive experiences, and premium upgrades.      Today's Travel Market  Innovatively serving one of the world's largest industries Travel and tourism is one of the world's largest industries.

Moniker Group | A Dream Factory













































































Welcome to the dream factory.
























Wait, what’s a dream factory?
We’re an investment company that invests in people. The dreams that live inside them become our dreams too, and through collaboration, community, and a whole lot of hustle, paths are forged, trails blazed, and limits reinvented.
Everything we do is by design. Our projects, involvement, and business decisions are intentional and fueled by the relationships we build with people and their ideas. We don’t limit ourselves to a product, a location, an event, or a space; we exist within all of those areas to catapult dreams into realities.

Monaker Group, Inc. (MKGI) Building Innovative Travel Products for Work and Play
November 30, 2016



For six decades, Monaker Group (OTCQB: MKGI) has catered to leisure travelers seeking to book “vacations of a lifetime” or find “travel made easy” options. Along the way, the company has gained the knowledge and experience to be considered an industry-leading, technology-driven travel company. Now, equipped with decades of experience and leveraging over 60 years of operation in leisure travel, Monaker is expanding its reach to business travel, using the full resources of its multiple brands and divisions to offer novel travel products to executives and professionals traveling for work.
Over the years, management has combined vital partnerships and established travel brands to form foundation stones that support Monaker’s corporate goal: to expand its offerings until it becomes the “one stop” vacation center. 
NextTrip.com, an online marketplace for the alternative lodging rental (ALR) industry, is one of those key travel brands that Monaker has developed for the leisure traveler. With this flagship product, Monaker introduced to the ALR industry the first booking engine to feature alternative and specialty lodging (e.g. vacation home rentals, resort residences and unused timeshares) side by side with a wide selection of airlines, hotels, cruises, rental cars, destination tours/activities and concierge services. What’s more, all of NextTrip.com’s services are offered under a single platform that gives travel customers the power to choose exactly when they want to book their vacations.
Monaker is now extending that power to corporate travelers, starting with the development of a custom travel club offering for the members of Recruiter.com – an online global recruiting and career service with its own industry-leading technology platform. One of the most influential career sites around, Recruiter.com boasts of a highly engaged membership base and manages a social media following of more than 2.8 million people while matching top talent to top jobs. In April 2016, Monaker signed on to help it create the Recruiter.com Travel Club, a powerful new incentive to be added to the Recruiter.com Rewards Program and offered to the site’s current members and followers.
With this partnership, Recruiter.com is counting on Monaker offering its Travel Club members personalized travel and lifestyle offerings, including highly-discounted travel and vacation packages as well as special benefits such as concierge support, exclusive experiences and premium upgrades. Monaker, on the other hand, is counting on the partnership to open up another distribution line for its ALR inventory and other business and vacation travel products within its portfolio.
It has been seven months since Monaker and Recruiter formed their partnership and it is going well. In August, the companies expanded the terms of their initial agreement and Monaker became the exclusive provider of travel services to Recruiter.com. With this new title, Monaker gained a means to communicate directly with Recruiter’s broad list of customers, largely comprised of senior corporate executives. Now, on a weekly basis, a choice selection of Monaker’s travel products and services will be marketed to a list of approved members and their respective companies as well as other Recruiter.com followers, a development that gives Monaker and its platforms, inventory and travel products significant exposure to decision makers at over a million global companies.
