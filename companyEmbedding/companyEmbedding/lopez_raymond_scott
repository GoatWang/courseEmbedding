Cowboy Spa

Film (short)
                                                    by Raymond Scott                                                                                                            (Comedy, Fantasy, Romance and Western)
                                                                                                    
Director, Writer, Producer A contrast between the simple rustic lifestyle of a cowboy and his wife, and the lure of the delights that are there for the taking in the nearby cosmopolitan city. She wants a spa day and tells him get things ready while she makes breakfast. But in the meantime he falls asleep and dreams of his own cowboy version of a spa day, complete with beautiful women and pampering for himself and his dog. He is rudely awakened once breakfast is ready, only to wonder was it really just a dream? The Old West versus the New West is an interesting contrast. The Old West consisted of horses, early mornings riding the fence while pondering the day ahead, and maintaining the ranch. Today's New Western cities are filled with resorts, spas, trendy restaurants and bars, and all manner of anti-aging treatments. Can a modern day cowboy couple co-exist between these two worlds?
