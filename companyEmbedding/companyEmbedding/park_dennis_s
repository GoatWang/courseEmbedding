Dennis S. Ellis is a partner in the Litigation Department of Paul Hastings and is chair of the Complex Litigation and Trial Practice group. Mr. Ellis is resident in the Los Angeles office and concentrates his practice in consumer class actions, unfair competition (Section 17200), business torts, product liability defense, environmental law, and breach of contract actions. He has worked for a diverse group of clients, including major retail chains, petroleum, pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies, and internationally known celebrities. Mr. Ellis has authored several articles that have appeared in various legal publications, including a law review article entitled A Product Liability Claim By Any Other Name Remains A Product Liability Claim: California Courts Should Not Permit Plaintiffs To Recast A Product Liability Claim In The Terms Of Fraud, 25 Whittier L. Rev. 441 (2003). He has also written a practitioner’s treatise, entitled Enforcement of Judgments: A Practitioner’s Guide to Recovery, which was published by ALM Media LLC in July 2016.
Before studying law, Mr. Ellis was one of 18 individuals, from a nationwide pool of over 350 applicants, selected to work for the California State Assembly as a Jesse Marvin Unruh Assembly Fellow. After completing the year-long Fellowship program, he was hired as a legislative aide to Assemblywoman Carol Bentley. As Assemblywoman Bentley’s chief legislative advisor, Mr. Ellis briefed the Assemblywoman on pending legislation and was responsible for drafting many of the bills that she introduced. 
Mr. Ellis graduated from California State University, Fullerton in 1990, where he was a scholarship student-athlete and starting offensive lineman on the Titan football team. He graduated cum laude from Howard University School of Law in 1995. While there, Mr. Ellis was first runner-up in the Charles H. Houston Moot Court Competition, a member of the National Moot Court Team, and a member of the Howard Law Journal. 



                            Experience
                        

Consumer Class Action Defense: Mr. Ellis has a thriving practice representing cosmetic companies, including, but not limited to, L’Oréal USA, Inc. and Avon Products, Inc., across the country. Most recently, Mr. Ellis led a team that defeated class certification on behalf of L’Oréal USA, Inc., when its brand, Kiehl’s Since 1851, was named in litigation relating to its customer loyalty program. The lower court’s decision denying class certification was affirmed by the Second District of the California Court of Appeal. 
MVUInvestors, LLC v. General Electric Company: Represented General Electric Company (“GE”) as lead counsel in a breach of contract and fraud case (based on failed negotiations surrounding a purchase of medical device patents). A motion for summary judgment was granted in favor of GE by the United States District Court for the Central District of California, which was affirmed on appeal by the Ninth Circuit. 
John Doe, Mary Doe and Oscar C. Russell, Jr. v. ABC Corporation, DEF Corporation, XYZ Corporation, and Hibernia Corporation: Represented defendant bank, acquired by Capital One Bank, in a lawsuit brought by two bank executives for breach of their employment contracts and fraud. Based on the allegations in the lawsuit, Mr. Ellis was required to deal with, inter alia, complex issues regarding federal regulation of the banking system. The case, which was pending in Louisiana State Court, had been litigated for 14 years at the time Mr. Ellis was brought into the matter. After working on the case for less than 18 months, during a mediation handled by Mr. Ellis, a confidential resolution of the case was reached just before trial. 
New World TMT Limited v. PrediWave Corporation, et al.: Mr. Ellis was lead attorney in the case which resulted in what is believed to be the largest judgment ever obtained by a Chinese firm in a U.S. court. In New World, Paul Hastings successfully brought a motion for terminating sanctions against PrediWave Corporation, eight PrediWave related companies, and their CEO Jianping “Tony” Qu. In its order, the court struck all of the defendants’ answers and cross-claims, and ordered that default be entered against them and in favor of Mr. Ellis’ client New World. A default hearing to prove compensatory damages and punitive damages resulted in a total judgment in excess of $2.8 billion.
Charney v. American Apparel, et al.: The Firm successfully defended American Apparel and chairman Colleen Brown in a $20 million defamation lawsuit filed by former CEO Dov Charney. The suit alleged that Brown, on behalf of the company, sent a letter to all American Apparel employees containing false claims, including that Charney was fired for cause after an independent investigation revealed financial and sexual wrongdoing. Charney also alleged that the investigation was not independent because it was paid for by the board and produced by a company hired by American Apparel’s outside general counsel. Mr. Ellis and his team moved to strike the complaint based on California’s anti-SLAPP statute, arguing that Charney was suing over acts of free speech and could not demonstrate a probability of prevailing. During the hearing, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Terry A. Green agreed with the defendant, resulting in a significant win for American Apparel amidst ongoing legal battles, and the award of more than $100,000 in attorneys’ fees related to the cost of bringing the motion. The case and Mr. Ellis’ victory have been featured in American Lawyer magazine as one of the top cases in 2015.
Recent Significant Trials 
Vitascan v. GE Healthcare: Mr. Ellis was the lead trial lawyer in the Vitascan case, handling the opening, closing, and direct and cross-examination of all of the major witnesses. This case was tried over three months in Santa Barbara County. In Vitascan, Paul Hastings successfully defended GE Healthcare in a $16 million lawsuit filed by a Santa Barbara based preventative medical scanning company. The jury concluded that the company’s demise was due to a downward industry trend in the full-body scanning market and its own poor management decisions, rather than the company’s claims of malfunctioning equipment manufactured by GE Healthcare. The jury also found in favor of GE Healthcare’s claims for unpaid services and awarded more than $50,000 to GE Healthcare. GE’s litigation department was named the “Litigation Department of the Year” by Corporate Counsel magazine for 2007, which cited the Vitascan victory as the primary reason GE merited distinction. 
Broadlink Communications, Inc. v. MRV Communications, Inc.: Mr. Ellis was the lead trial lawyer in the Broadlink case, assisted only by a junior associate, where Paul Hastings represented iTouch Communications, Inc. (“iTouch“), a division of MRV Communications, Inc. (“MRV“), in a case of breach of contract for sale of goods. A collection agency brought the case in Sonoma County Superior Court on behalf of bankrupt Broadlink. After deliberating for three and a half hours, the jury returned a defense verdict on all counts in favor of the firm’s clients, iTouch and MRV. 
Wu, et al. v. Magnus Sunhill Group LLC, et al.: In 2013, Mr. Ellis was lead trial lawyer in a month-long trial against his real estate developer client Magnus and certain of its current and former managers. Plaintiffs claimed that Magnus and its managers (whom Mr. Ellis did not represent) used fraudulent breaches of fiduciary duty to extract funds from Plaintiffs as seed money for a mixed-use commercial center in Monterey Park, California. Plaintiffs requested compensatory damages from the jury in the amount of $2,770,000, an additional amount of non-economic damages for humiliation, and punitive damages. The jury awarded Plaintiffs $1,175,000 against all defendants jointly and severally, and punitive damages against the defendant managers but not against Magnus. The total award as to Magnus was just slightly higher than its C.C.P. Section 998 offer-to-compromise of $654,000.
Ahmad Besaratinia, M.D. v. City of Hope, et al.: In 2015, Mr. Ellis assisted in an employment case where the Plaintiff brought claims for wrongful termination, retaliation, and defamation, and sought more than $7 million in compensatory damages and punitive damages. After more than a month of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of $750,000 on the wrongful termination claim, and $200,000 on the defamation claim, yet remained deadlocked on the retaliation claim. The jury determined that the defendants acted with fraud, malice, and oppression, necessitating a second phase regarding punitive damages. Mr. Ellis was called in at the conclusion of the trial to assist his employment law partner with deliberations, during which closing arguments were reopened on two separate occasions. Both of those arguments were handled by Mr. Ellis exclusively, who also examined the key witness in the second phase regarding punitive damages. Despite concluding that a second phase for punitive damages was warranted, the jury remained deadlocked on the amount to be awarded as four jurors refused to award any amount of punitive damages.
