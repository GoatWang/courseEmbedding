Stonebridge Chesterfield, VA





 




Shopping Center


Overview
    				
    				Stonebridge Shopping Center is a multi-use redevelopment of the former Cloverleaf Mall in Chesterfield County, Virginia, and was named the Best Private/Public Project by Virginia Business. This multi-phase, master planned community is anchored by the first Kroger Marketplace in Virginia, and well-known national retail shops and restaurants. In addition, a 600 unit multi-family apartment complex, Element at Stonebridge, is adjacent to the center and is now leasing while completing the final stages of construction. 

The completed Phase I of Stonebridge also includes five out parcels, including Firestone Complete Car Care Center, Bank of America, Panda Express, Zaxby's, Wendy's and Krispy Kreme Donuts. Additionally, there are four village retail buildings which are well leased to service and restaurant tenants to meet your shopping needs. The stores include Virginia ABC Liquor, Mattress Firm, Subway, Qdoba, and Sweet Frog. Stroll through our grounds for a relaxing and fulfilling shopping experience.

Still in the planning phases, Phase II of Stonebridge is proposed to include more retail shops and restaurants. 

Stonebridge is owned by S2 Stonebridge Associates LLC (an affiliate of S2 Capital Partners) and is managed by Stewart Commercial Management.
