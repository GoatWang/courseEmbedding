History[edit]
Reliv was founded in 1988 by Robert and Sandy Montgomery. The Montgomerys licensed a nutritional formula developed by Dr. Theodore Kalogris in the early 1980s. The formula, called Reliv Classic, became Reliv’s first product.
In the next two decades, the company expanded its sales operations to various countries around the world.[9] In 1993, Reliv became a publicly traded company on the American Stock Exchange and three years later, the company moved to the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol RELV. The Great Flood of 1993 flooded the company’s headquarters and put a temporary halt to production. The company broke ground on a $4 million headquarters expansion in 1997. It was completed in 1998.[9]
Reliv was ranked number 3 of the "Top 100 International Companies" in International Business Magazine.[9][unreliable source?] In 2005, the company had an increase of 41 percent in its fourth-quarter net income,[10] and Reliv International ranked number 43 on Forbes Magazine's "200 Best Small Companies" 2005 list and ranked number 14 in 2006.[11]
Products[edit]
Reliv has three product lines: Essential Nutrition (nutritional shakes), Weight Loss (Slimplicity meal replacement shakes and metabolism-boosting supplements), and Targeted Solutions (nutritional shakes targeting specific benefits such as digestive, joint, and heart health, and an energy shot called 24K).[12] The company examined the effect of one of their products, GlucAffect, on blood glucose and body weight in a non-randomized, nonblinded, non-controlled clinical study.[13]
Litigation[edit]
In January 2013, Environment Research Center (ERC) filed suit against Reliv, accusing them of "failure to warn consumers that they have been exposed to lead from several of the company's nutritional health products," citing the California Health & Safety Code Section 25249.7(b)(1), commonly known as Proposition 65. [14] Reliv responded by saying that the company was in compliance, the significance of the issue was exaggerated, and that the company was singled-out for unethical reasons. Nonetheless, Reliv revised the formula for all of the covered products to meet the new standards of California. [15]

History[edit]
Reliv was founded in 1988 by Robert and Sandy Montgomery. The Montgomerys licensed a nutritional formula developed by Dr. Theodore Kalogris in the early 1980s. The formula, called Reliv Classic, became Reliv’s first product.
In the next two decades, the company expanded its sales operations to various countries around the world.[9] In 1993, Reliv became a publicly traded company on the American Stock Exchange and three years later, the company moved to the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol RELV. The Great Flood of 1993 flooded the company’s headquarters and put a temporary halt to production. The company broke ground on a $4 million headquarters expansion in 1997. It was completed in 1998.[9]
Reliv was ranked number 3 of the "Top 100 International Companies" in International Business Magazine.[9][unreliable source?] In 2005, the company had an increase of 41 percent in its fourth-quarter net income,[10] and Reliv International ranked number 43 on Forbes Magazine's "200 Best Small Companies" 2005 list and ranked number 14 in 2006.[11]
Products[edit]
Reliv has three product lines: Essential Nutrition (nutritional shakes), Weight Loss (Slimplicity meal replacement shakes and metabolism-boosting supplements), and Targeted Solutions (nutritional shakes targeting specific benefits such as digestive, joint, and heart health, and an energy shot called 24K).[12] The company examined the effect of one of their products, GlucAffect, on blood glucose and body weight in a non-randomized, nonblinded, non-controlled clinical study.[13]
Litigation[edit]
In January 2013, Environment Research Center (ERC) filed suit against Reliv, accusing them of "failure to warn consumers that they have been exposed to lead from several of the company's nutritional health products," citing the California Health & Safety Code Section 25249.7(b)(1), commonly known as Proposition 65. [14] Reliv responded by saying that the company was in compliance, the significance of the issue was exaggerated, and that the company was singled-out for unethical reasons. Nonetheless, Reliv revised the formula for all of the covered products to meet the new standards of California. [15]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Reliv was founded in 1988 by Robert and Sandy Montgomery. The Montgomerys licensed a nutritional formula developed by Dr. Theodore Kalogris in the early 1980s. The formula, called Reliv Classic, became Reliv’s first product.
In the next two decades, the company expanded its sales operations to various countries around the world.[9] In 1993, Reliv became a publicly traded company on the American Stock Exchange and three years later, the company moved to the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol RELV. The Great Flood of 1993 flooded the company’s headquarters and put a temporary halt to production. The company broke ground on a $4 million headquarters expansion in 1997. It was completed in 1998.[9]
Reliv was ranked number 3 of the "Top 100 International Companies" in International Business Magazine.[9][unreliable source?] In 2005, the company had an increase of 41 percent in its fourth-quarter net income,[10] and Reliv International ranked number 43 on Forbes Magazine's "200 Best Small Companies" 2005 list and ranked number 14 in 2006.[11]
Products[edit]
Reliv has three product lines: Essential Nutrition (nutritional shakes), Weight Loss (Slimplicity meal replacement shakes and metabolism-boosting supplements), and Targeted Solutions (nutritional shakes targeting specific benefits such as digestive, joint, and heart health, and an energy shot called 24K).[12] The company examined the effect of one of their products, GlucAffect, on blood glucose and body weight in a non-randomized, nonblinded, non-controlled clinical study.[13]
Litigation[edit]
In January 2013, Environment Research Center (ERC) filed suit against Reliv, accusing them of "failure to warn consumers that they have been exposed to lead from several of the company's nutritional health products," citing the California Health & Safety Code Section 25249.7(b)(1), commonly known as Proposition 65. [14] Reliv responded by saying that the company was in compliance, the significance of the issue was exaggerated, and that the company was singled-out for unethical reasons. Nonetheless, Reliv revised the formula for all of the covered products to meet the new standards of California. [15]

LunaRich X Product Information View product flyer (pdf) View benefits sheet (pdf)Multiply Your Good Health by the Power of XXtraordinary Discovery Soy’s health benefits are well established. Learn more about the safety and benefits of soy. But only recently have scientists uncovered the nutritional component largely respon­sible: lunasin, a naturally occurring peptide. Researchers at the University of California-Berkeley first discovered lunasin in 1996. Today 80+ peer-reviewed and published studies from 30+ research institutions demonstrate lunasin’s ability to improve your health, including: Cholesterol managementInflammation reductionAntioxidant benefitsImproved immunityOverall cellular healthAnd the list keeps growing… LunaRich X™ is the most pure, con­centrated form of bioactive lunasin ever produced — many times the potency of any other source. In 2013 Reliv acquired exclusive rights to the patented lunasin technology behind LunaRich X. Now you can reap the benefits of the first epigenetic superfood. Benefits Booster In addition to its own benefits, the lunasin in LunaRich X increases the benefits of other bioactive nutrients (like those found in Reliv nutritional formulas) in two ways:Synergism: Lunasin works with other nutrients, each with its own effect on genes and physiological pathways. When you optimize these pathways with different bioactive nutrients, you optimize your health as well.Increased potency: Certain nutrients are activators of important genes involved in main­taining health. Once these genes are activated, lunasin has the ability to further increase their expression by making them more readily recognized by the cell. Nutrition at a Higher Level GenomeThe blueprint of life — the DNA that makes you who you are. All 200+ cell types in your body contain the same genome.EpigenomeDNA packaging material that works as a series of genetic switches, signaling your genome which genes to turn on and off. Determines cell function (skin cells, liver cells, etc.), as well as how well each cell performs its function.LunasinThe first dietary ingredient identified to affect gene expression and promote optimal health at the epigenetic level. Now available in concentrated form in LunaRich X.Bottom line: You can’t change your DNA blueprint, but you can influence how that DNA expresses itself. LunaRich X can help.  Understanding Epigenetics Who you are is written in both pen and pencil. Things written in pen you can’t change. That’s DNA. But things written in pencil you can. That’s epigenetics.StudyStudy shows potential of Reliv Now® + LunaRich X to support weight loss, heart health and metabolic wellness.
