Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volatili ty, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at NAV. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value or market  price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested and includes management fees and other expenses. Until the reinvestment of Fund distributions is completed, returns are calculated using the lower of the net asset value or market price of the shar es on the distribution ex date.  Once the reinvestment is complete, returns are calculated using the average reinvestment price.  Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative.

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. There can be no assurance that the liquidation of  collateral securing an investment will satisfy the issuer’s obligation in the event of nonpayment or that collateral can be readily liquidated. The ability to realize the benefits of any collateral may be delayed or limited. Investments in income  securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer’s ability to make principal and interest payments. Borrowing to increase investments (leverage) will exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of Fund investments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as &ldquo;junk”) are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Bank loans are subject to prepayment risk. Investment s in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Changes in the value of investments entered for hedging pur poses may not match those of the position being hedged. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks.

This data reflects distributions paid on Fund shares held for the full calendar year and is not predictive of the tax character of current or future distributions.  Fund shareholders should refer to the individual IRS Form 1099-DIVs provided to them shor tly after each year-end to determine the appropriate federal income tax treatment of the distributions they receive.  Eaton Vance is not responsible for any errors in tax reporting that may result from using the above data. Non-qualified ordinary dividen ds are subject to federal income tax at ordinary rates.  Qualified dividends and capital gains distributions are taxable at long-term capital gains rates. Nondividend distributions, also known as return of capital distributions, are not subject to curren t federal income tax.  Instead, the tax cost basis of each shareholder receiving a return of capital distribution is reduced by the amount of the distribution.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
The S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index (the Index)6 delivered a 1.15% total return for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. Though investor demand remained robust throughout the period, technical conditions eased in March as prepayments slowed and  new-issue supply increased. As a result, net Index par outstandings expanded during the quarter. Performance results for the period were nearly entirely composed of income generation, with coupon income accounting for 1.17% while market value return sub tracted -0.02%. Though loan prices continued to firm in both January and February – 0.16% and 0.14% higher, respectively – prices lost -0.31% during March's modest ease in technical strength. Overall, monthly returns during the period were 0. 56%, 0.50% and 0.08% for January, February and March, respectively. The average loan price in the Index ended the period at $98.22.
In line with 2016's theme, aggregate demand outstripped net supply expansion during the period. Though quarterly loan volume increased considerably during the quarter, demand still managed to outpace alongside continued strength in both structured produc t growth as well as net mutual fund subscriptions. On the funds' side of the equation, Lipper reported more than $11 billion in net inflows to loan funds. Meantime, collateralized loan obligation (CLO) creation totaled more than $17 billion for the perio d.
On fundamentals, the par-weighted default rate ended the period at 1.49% on a last-12-months basis. The default rate remained low from a historical perspective, with about two thirds of these modest defaults having come by way of commodity-related issuer s over this period – which collectively account for a limited corner of the overall market. From this respect, the majority of the asset class outstanding continued to remain in relatively benign shape fundamentally.


Performance Summary 
Eaton Vance Floating-Rate Income Trust (EFT) outperformed the Index at net asset value for the quarter.

Security selection within the B and BB tiers of the market was beneficial to the Funds' relative performance.
The Funds' underweight to the retailers sector – as well as security selection within – aided relative results for the three-month period.
The Funds remained underweight to the better-performing, higher-credit risk tiers of the market, although the limited weight of these segments kept the relative impact limited.
Employment of investment leverage, a strategic element of the Funds' strategies, aided performance as it amplified the positive results of the Funds' underlying portfolios.
An allocation to high-yield bonds helped performance relative to the Index, as the high-yield market generally outperformed loans.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volatili ty, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at NAV. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value or market  price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested and includes management fees and other expenses. Until the reinvestment of Fund distributions is completed, returns are calculated using the lower of the net asset value or market price of the shar es on the distribution ex date.  Once the reinvestment is complete, returns are calculated using the average reinvestment price.  Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative.

Contributors 
Security selection within the B and BB tiers of the market was beneficial to relative performance.

The retailers segment was the worst performing area of the loan market during the quarter, generating a return of -1.97%. The Funds' underweight to this sector – as well as security selection within – aided relative results for the three-mont h period. Security selection within the oil & gas, food service and business equipment & services sectors also helped relative performance.
Employment of investment leverage, a strategic element of the Funds' strategies, aided performance as it amplified the positive results of the Funds' underlying portfolios.
The Funds' allocation to high-yield bonds – a strategic element of its investment strategy – aided performance relative to the Index, as high-yield bonds outperformed loans for the quarter. The Index does not include high-yield bonds.



Detractors 
Quarterly returns by credit tier were 0.66%, 1.14%, 5.02% and 3.06% for loans rated BB, B, CCC and D, respectively. In a similar vein, second-lien loans also outperformed, returning 3.61% for the quarter, compared with 1.06% for first liens. Though the F unds remained underweight to the better-performing, higher-credit risk tiers of the market, although the limited weight of these segments kept the relative impact limited.


Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
We remain constructive on the credit risk profile underlying the loan market. While the default rate is a lagging indicator, the distress ratio – defined as the percentage of performing loans trading below $80 – can often paint a clearer pict ure about the path of forward default probabilities. Through December, the ratio was 2.9%. Only 1.5% traded below $70, a level considered to be higher in default risk. Overall, we believe defaults are likely to grind modestly higher in the coming year bu t remain low and below average in an historical context. This view aligns with the latest S&P/LCD quarterly survey of loan managers, with the latest poll showing that participants have cut forecasts of near-term loan defaults. Though the current credit c ycle may indeed be in its later innings, decent economic data now and the potential for supportive Trump-era policies ahead should shift default risk from the nearer term to something further out.
Market pricing indicates positive-but-nonetheless very limited price appreciation potential from here. The average price of the Index ended March at $98.2, with 66.9% of performing loans bid at par or higher. With the price "upside" of the asset class ha ving largely played out in 2016, upside potential for the remainder of 2017 is shaping up to take its place in the coupon component of returns – as the Fed projects three quarter-point rate hikes.
With 3-month LIBOR at the average floor in the loan market and 1-month LIBOR at 0.98%, the higher income potential that may follow the next Fed rate hike will likely continue to draw investor attention. Looking ahead, we believe the market's technical ba lance remains tipped toward one of strength, and we think it's likely that asset class buyership grows as investors brace for the likelihood of higher interest rates. Though unexpected events can always translate to volatility in the shorter run, we thin k loans are set up well given competing investment opportunities across the capital markets.

There can be no assurance that the liquidation of  collateral securing an investment will satisfy the issuer’s obligation in the event of nonpayment or that collateral can be readily liquidated. The ability to realize the benefits of any collateral may be delayed or limited. Investments in income  securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer’s ability to make principal and interest payments. Borrowing to increase investments (leverage) will exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of Fund investments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as &ldquo;junk”) are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Bank loans are subject to prepayment risk. Investment s in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Changes in the value of investments entered for hedging pur poses may not match those of the position being hedged. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks.

Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. The Fund seeks to mitigate interest rate risk by taking short positions in U.S. Treasuries, but there is no guarantee this will be achieved. Derivative investments can be volatile and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions.

                                    Fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. The Funds may engage in “short sale” transactions of U.S. Treasuries where losses may be exaggerated, potentially losing more money than the actual cost of the investment and the third party to the short sale may fail to honor its contract terms, causing a loss to the Funds. While the Funds attempt to limit credit and counterparty exposure, the value of an investment in the Funds may change quickly and without warning in response to issuer or counterparty defaults and changes in the credit ratings of the Funds’ portfolio investments. Investing in mortgage- and asset-backed securities involves interest rate, credit, valuation, extension and liquidity risks and the risk that payments on the underlying assets are delayed, prepaid, subordinated or defaulted on. 

                                    Securities with floating rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes than securities with fixed interest rates, but may decline in value. The issuance of floating rate notes by the U.S. Treasury is new and the amount of supply will be limited.  Fixed income securities will normally decline in value as interest rates rise.  The value of an investment in the Fund may change quickly and without warning in response to issuer or counterparty defaults and changes in the credit ratings of the Fund’s portfolio investments. Due to the investment strategy of certain Funds’ they may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs. Please read the Funds’ prospectus for specific details regarding the Funds’ risk profile.

How can you use ETFs to navigate interest rate changes at the Fed?
 
Bonds and interest rates have an inverse relationship, so when interest rates rise, bond prices (and total returns) fall. WisdomTree partnered with Bloomberg, Barclays, and BofA Merrill Lynch to create a family of five unique bond ETFs that can help investors navigate rising interest rates, while maintaining exposure to familiar strategies (and potentially supplementing income). 
 
AGZD


AGGREGATE BOND EXPOSURE WITH ZERO DURATION

The WisdomTree Barclays Interest Rate Hedged U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund (AGZD) can help investors maintain traditional bond exposures while decreasing their overall sensitivity to rising interest rates.


 
AGND


AGGREGATE BOND EXPOSURE WITH NEGATIVE DURATION

The WisdomTree Barclays Negative Duration U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund (AGND) can help investors maintain traditional bond exposures while decreasing their overall sensitivity to rising interest rates.


 
HYZD


HIGH YIELD WITH ZERO DURATION

The WisdomTree Interest Rate Hedged High Yield Bond Fund (HYZD) can help investors reduce the interest rate risk of their overall portfolio while supplementing income levels.


 
HYND


HIGH YIELD WITH NEGATIVE DURATION

The WisdomTree Negative Duration High Yield Bond Fund (HYND) can help investors reduce the interest rate risk of their overall portfolio while supplementing income levels.


 
USFR


U.S. TREASURY FLOATING RATE

The WisdomTree Bloomberg Floating Rate Treasury Fund (USFR) seeks to track the price and yield performance of the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Floating Rate Bond Index.




AGGREGATE BOND EXPOSURE WITH ZERO DURATION

 
Many investors view the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index (Agg), as a broad approximation of the U.S. investment-grade1 bond market—and mirror it for much of their core bond portfolios. In the current environment, however, investors may face increasing volatility and low levels of income from this subset of the fixed income markets.



The WisdomTree Barclays Interest Rate Hedged U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund (AGZD) can help investors maintain traditional bond exposures while decreasing their overall sensitivity to rising interest rates.

 

AGZD essentially combines a long position in cash bonds representative of the Agg with a short position in Treasury Bonds and/or Treasury futures to target the zero interest rate exposure. Investors can use the portfolio as a stand-alone tool for combatting rising interest rates or combine it with other interest rate-sensitive assets in their portfolio to target their desired level of risk.



As shown in the hypothetical allocation below, by allocating a portion of their overall portfolio to AGZD, investors can reduce their overall exposure to interest rate risk2.

1Bonds with ratings of BBB-/Baa or higher are considered investment grade.

2Interest rate risk: The risk that an investment's value will decline due to an increase in interest rates.

HIGH YIELD WITH ZERO DURATIONHigh yield bonds continue to be one of the most popular segments of the fixed income market. But as concerns about credit risk trend lower, fear of interest rate risk is on the rise.



The WisdomTree Interest Rate Hedged High Yield Bond Fund (HYZD) can help investors reduce the interest rate risk of their overall portfolio while supplementing income levels.
 

HYZD essentially combines a long position in cash bonds from the BofA Merrill Lynch 0-5 Year US High Yield Constrained Index with a short position in Treasury bonds and/or Treasury futures to target the zero duration exposure. When incorporated into a core fixed income portfolio, HYZD could provide many benefits in a rising rate environment.




As shown in the hypothetical allocation below on the right, by allocating a portion of their overall portfolio to HYZD, investors can reduce their overall exposure to interest rate risk1.

2Interest rate risk: The risk that an investment's value will decline due to an increase in interest rates.


U.S. TREASURY FLOATING RATE


In response to the growing demand from investors looking to reduce interest rate risk, the United States Treasury is issuing floating rate notes (FRNs)1 for the first time in its history. We believe this new class of issuance is an attractive option for investors looking to limit their exposure to credit risk2, while maintaining the potential to benefit from increases in interest rates.



The WisdomTree Bloomberg Floating Rate Treasury Fund (USFR) seeks to track the price and yield performance of the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Floating Rate Bond Index.

Floating rate notes help bridge an important gap between short-maturity Treasury bills3 and longer-maturity, fixed rate Treasury bonds4 providing:

 
1


Potential to benefit from rising interest rates and higher yields


 
2


Income payments backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government

Fixed Income Strategy: Staying on Course


Kevin Flanagan 



									When examining the appropriate course for fixed income strategies thus far in 2017, we appear to be staying on course. The overall premise for fixed income investing has essentially been playing out according to our base case: blending a strategic core approach with a complementary solution for the potential of higher rates later in the year.

Playing Better Defense with Rate-Hedged High-Yield Bonds


Bradley Krom 



With global economic activity accelerating, a commonsense trade has been to be over-weight high-yield debt as the outlook for risky borrowers continues to improve. While we have long advocated for this shift in portfolios, we believe there may be a more intuitive way for investors to play defense via interest rate-hedged high-yield bonds.

In Like a Lion?


Kevin Flanagan 



The fixed income arena seems to be facing an interesting dilemma as the calendar turns to March. Will the money and bond markets have to weather the storm from potentially higher rates, or will the storm clouds part as monetary policy developments here in the U.S. give way to the upcoming elections in the Netherlands and France?

After nearly two and a half years of debate, the Federal Reserve finally lifted the Federal Funds Rate target by 25 basis points on December 16, 2015.
