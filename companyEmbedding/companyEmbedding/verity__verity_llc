Common Questions

 COMMON QUESTIONS






 Here are some of the most frequently asked questions. If youneed additional information, contact us at info@verityvip.com or 843 379-6661.As a client of Verity Investment Partners (VIP), who actually holds my assets?When you work with us, your portfolio will be held in your account and in your name by an independent and well-established custodian such as Charles Schwab Institutional. The custodian provides monthly statements as well as internet access to your account 24/7. Having an independent custodian provides a check and balance by separating the management of your investment account from the custody of your account.Is VIP registered with the SEC?Yes, Verity Investment Partners is an SEC registered investment advisory firm under the name Verity & Verity, LLC.How does VIP charge for services?We are a fee-only firm, and our annual fee is generally 1.0% of assets under management. Is there an account or relationship minimum?Our minimum account size is generally $1 million though we reserve the ability to make exceptions in certain situations – particularly in cases where the beginning amount is less, but the longer term intent is to add to the portfolio.How do I get started?In order for you to assess whether our approach is right for you, we invite you to set up an initial consultation so that we can better understand your current financial situation and your future investment objectives. Based on this information, we can provide an assessment of your existing investment portfolio in terms of how well it addresses your objectives, and we can identify what we would do differently. Our objective is to get to know you and to give you enough information about us and how we would approach your investments, so that we can each make an informed decision as to whether it would be mutually beneficial to work together.  



















Client Profiles — Verity Investment Partners






















































Client Profiles

 CLIENT PROFILES






Professionals & Business Owners







Many of our clients are business owners or professionals such as attorneys, physicians, veterinarians and dentists who tend to have very hectic lifestyles. We have found that they need someone to help organize, plan and manage their financial lives. These clients generally have an income stream that is directly tied to the number of hours they work. We help them develop a passive income stream from their investments that will grow each year and that is not tied to hours worked. When this passive income stream increases to the point that it can fund their lifestyle, then their work hours become optional. Individuals & Couples Planning for Retirement







We work with individuals and couples who are saving for retirement as well as those who are already retired and looking for a way to finance their retirement lifestyle. We develop a financial plan and construct dividend growth portfolios in both cases, but for clients who are still saving and don’t need the income, we reinvest the dividends. This dividend reinvestment serves as another source of savings. For clients who need to take distributions from their portfolio, the dividend income can be distributed on a monthly basis to meet their living expenses. We set up a money link that enables a fixed amount of cash to be transferred to their checking account each month.Women







We have found that the women we work with tend to be different from men when it comes to investing. They like the idea of a conservative investment approach that is straight forward and that is designed to generate a growing income stream each year, regardless of what the stock market is doing. Peace of mind tends to be more important to them than beating a market index. They also tell us that they like having a trusted advisor to help them plan for their future and navigate life’s twists and turns.Recipients of Sudden Wealth 







A number of our clients have acquired their wealth suddenly due to the death of a spouse or parent or from an insurance or divorce settlement. Receiving sudden wealth can provide new opportunities, but it also brings up many questions. How should the money be invested so that it can be passed onto future generations but still benefit the current recipient? How should we think about our financial future now that we have these additional assets? We have found that our investment approach is very helpful in these situations because generally these clients want to be stewards of the wealth they have acquired and preserve the principal rather than spend it. The growing dividend income stream from the portfolio can be used to make distributions to the current generation while preserving the principal for future generations.

Our Story — Verity Investment Partners






















































Our Story

 OUR STORY






 







I was very fortunate to meet my wife, Paula, 50 years ago in nursery school. We did not rush into marriage right away, but we have the good fortune of being happily married for the past 28 years. We moved to Beaufort, SC from Cincinnati, OH in 2001 to be closer to my father, in his later years, and to raise our three children in one of the most beautiful places in the world. We started VIP in early 2002 in order to provide investment management services to a limited number of individual investors and their families. Our intention from the beginning has been to treat our clients as we would want to be treated – professionally and with complete honesty and respect.My older brother, Jon, joined us as a partner in 2006 bringing with him 38 years of financial services experience at JP Morgan and its affiliates, most recently serving as the CEO of Bank One Trust Company. We first got to know Andrew Jones in 2004 when he was still in college and told us he wanted to get into financial planning. We recruited him to join us from a financial planning firm in 2013 so that we could offer more comprehensive financial planning services to our clients. Andrew is a Certified Financial Planner and has a real passion for helping clients plan their future.Andy Anderson and I have been good friends since our days together in business school almost 30 years ago. After graduating from business school and spending 10 years as an investment banker, Andy decided to follow his passion for veterinary medicine, went back to school and eventually became a veterinary surgeon. He opened a hospital in 2000 in San Antonio which he just recently sold. Andy became a partner in VIP in 2013 and plans to focus his next chapter on helping veterinarians and other professionals invest in their future.In our ongoing commitment to offer a high quality, personalized investment management approach, we recruited Joe Costigan to join our team in 2014 as our Senior Portfolio Manager and Director of Research. Joe has over twenty-five years of portfolio management and investment experience having most recently served as Director of Research for Bryn Mawr Trust Company where he oversaw, and participated in, research supporting over $5 billion of client and institutional assets invested in individual equities, bonds, mutual funds and alternative investments. Joe is helping us further develop our internal portfolio management capability which is focused on dividend growth equities but also encompasses fixed income and other income producing assets such oil and gas pipelines and real estate.Verity Investment Partners has grown steadily over the years, one client at a time, and we now serve 140 clients and their families in 20 states with approximately $350 million of assets under management as of 3/31/17. If you would like to learn more about what we can do for you, please contact us or let us know how we can contact you. We look forward to speaking with you.

Verity IA software saves time in laboratory research, product development, and ongoing quality control by delivering fast, repeatable tests for substrate surface variability quantification.
 
 
 
 




MEASURE TOPOGRAPHY, FORMATION, & PRINT MOTTLE
The Print Target application is designed to quantify visual variability in printed matter and substrates. It is commonly used to measure topography, formation, and print mottle.
 
 
 




QUANTIFY KEY INK JET PRINT ON SUBSTRATE QUALITIES
The Ink Jet Print application reports paper surface smoothness and ink jet print qualities, including bleed and wicking, ink/substrate interaction, and ink overprint.
 
 
 




MEASURE VISIBLE CONTAMINANTS IN PAPER & PULP
Measure contaminants that are lighter or darker than the material under test. The Light & Dark application measures images in full color, making it useful for white paper, linerboard, pulp handsheets, non-woven materials and other substrates.  It is the paper industry standard for dirt counting.
 
 
 




GET CONTAMINANT COUNT FROM A FULL MACHINE WIDTH REEL STRIP
Use the Verity IA StripScan product to produce dirt and contaminant count of a reel strip with a one-button operation.  Reports light and dark contaminants on white or colored substrates up to 10mm thick.  The StripScan product includes an engineering-grade continuous-feed scanner and the Verity IA software to manage the image analysis and data delivery.

Measure Formation in Paperboard and Liner Board
Distribution of mass, or “Formation” is a critical property that influences strength properties, cockle and curl.  Formation, using transmitted light, has been done on white paper for years but has been unavailable to paperboard and liner board due to the inability to use transmitted light.  Now, a new method, pioneered by Dr. Steven Keller and Verity IA makes formation measurement to board manufacturers.

How To Reduce Your Commodities Costs
Who You Know, Makes The Difference.
It’s not so much as what you know but who you know in the commodities business when it comes to price. Verity has high placed sellers who will make the difference in your pricing simply because they are direct to the refinery or mandate.


The professionalism I experienced in all of my conversations, phone calls, emails and contracts is surpassed by none.
Jess Preston, Supplier, Great Britain
