John L. Gainer - Wikipedia






















 






John L. Gainer

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from John Gainer)

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

John L. Gainer (born July 19, 1938) is an American chemical engineer and co-founder and chief scientific officer of Diffusion Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology and pharmaceutical company based in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S.[1]




John Gainer


Gainer pioneered investigation into the mechanism of action underlying oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds (ODECs) and invented the subclass of ODECs known as bipolar trans carotenoid salts.[2] The lead compound of this class is trans sodium crocetinate (TSC)[3] which Gainer invented while a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Virginia.
Education and career[edit]
Gainer earned a BS in chemical engineering from West Virginia University in 1960, and a PhD in chemical engineering in 1964 from the University of Delaware. He later accepted a professorship in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Virginia.[1] In the early 1970s, he studied the prediction of diffusion rates of gases in liquids and began to investigate oxygen diffusion in biological systems, focusing particularly on the cardiovascular disease atherosclerosis.[4]
While at the University of Virginia, Gainer invented TSC by modifying certain natural products, including saffron, resulting in the creation of a novel single trans isomer carotenoid salt.[3] Using animal models, he then investigated the activity of TSC, exploring his theory that the drug would increase the transfer of oxygen through blood plasma into hypoxic tissues.[3][5] The drug's clinical promise became evident when Gainer and colleagues demonstrated that TSC could improve survival in animal models of severe hemorrhage while reversing the drop in blood pressure that accompanies the loss of large amounts of blood.[5] From his work with animal models, Gainer also predicted that TSC held promise for the treatment of cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction (heart attack), and other diseases associated with hypoxia and ischemia (a lack of oxygen delivery to tissues).[6][7] He was awarded the first of over a dozen patents on ODECs and TSC in 2000.[3][8]
Awards and honors[edit]
Gainer became professor emeritus in chemical engineering at the University of Virginia in 2005. He has been a member of the International Society on Oxygen Transport to Tissue since 1973, the year that the society was formed. He received the University of Virginia Alumni Association's Distinguished Professor Award and the Outstanding Teacher Award from the Southeastern Section of the American Society for Engineering Education.[2] The Virginia Healthcare Innovators "Medical Product or Device" award went to Gainer and Diffusion Pharmaceuticals in 2012, honoring his and the company's work on TSC.[9]

Go From Half Pint To Hulk*


Many people have trouble putting on muscle mass. The old saying is true - you have to eat big to get big. It can be difficult to keep your calorie intake up, and those of us with fast metabolisms burn most of what we take in.But have no fear because weight gainers are here! Keep your body packed with the right ingredients and sculpt your body into a rock-solid powerhouse!* Weight gainer supplements may help with:Quality protein and carbohydrate sourceConvenientPacked with high quality calories





Add Weight On With Ease*


One of the biggest reasons would-be gainers struggle with packing on muscle is because they are not taking in nearly enough calories to generate new muscle tissue. It's not unheard of to see people consuming 4000+ calories a day - a challenge in itself along with your actual training.If your head is spinning just thinking about how to cram enough protein, carbs, and calories in each day to fuel your body bulking, weight gainers are a convenient and high-quality alternative.By cramming an awesome ratio of protein, carbs, and calories into one convenient powder, you can get the extra fuel you need without the hassle of preparing a meal. Just mix it up and you are set to go!











Supersize Your Gains*


Hitting a muscle building plateau is one of the most frustrating situations for anybody trying to put on some serious muscle mass. Weight gainers are different than normal protein powders because they contain more protein, carbohydrates, and calories per serving. By adding a weight gainer shake to your daily diet, you can support:Plenty of good calories, protein, and carbs for building muscle*Recovery from workout sessions with nutrient availability*The prevention of catabolism*





No Force-Feeding Necessary


Contrary to popular belief, weight gainers aren't only for those trying to become Mr. Olympia. In fact, many people who have extremely fast metabolisms and have trouble keeping on weight will also benefit from a weight gainer. People involved in endurance-intensive lifestyles that are trying to build some muscle mass can also benefit from a weight gainer.*Likewise, anyone who is having trouble getting the proper carbs, calories, and protein from their normal diet may also want to consider a weight gainer, since it can help provide your body with important nutrients to fight dangerous weight loss.* Whether trying to gain 5, 10, or 30 pounds of muscle, weight gainers are your go-to product!*





Not Sure What To Pick?


Once you've decided a weight gainer is something to go for, there's still the decision of which one to go with. There are a few things to consider like:Pick a calorie level that fits your nutrient needsBe careful about fat contentProtein content at least 40 gramsFor those looking to put on 5-10 lbs, go for a leaner calorie gainer. Alternatively, those looking to put on 30+ lbs should get something having at least 600 calories per serving.





An Easy Filling Station For Mass*


Once you have your weight gainer, the next thing you want to think about is how to use it. Ideally, you should be using the weight gainer between normal meals when you need to get those extra calories in your body.Some people will try and use the weight gainer with their main meals, but it is most beneficial to consume your calories evenly throughout the day. Have you ever tried eating 4,000 calories in one sitting? It's hard for most people!See which strategy works best for you. Spread it out behind 4-5 shakes or 2-3 a day. As long as you make your protein/carb/calorie intake for the day, you will be one step further to success!

LATE_ADULTHOOD


2012

He has been a member of the International Society on Oxygen Transport to Tissue since 1973, the year that the society was formed. He received the University of Virginia Alumni Association's Distinguished Professor Award and the Outstanding Teacher Award from the Southeastern Section of the American Society for Engineering Education.

Gainer earned a BS in chemical engineering from West Virginia University in 1960, and a PhD in chemical engineering in 1964 from the University of Delaware.
More Details
Hide Details
He later accepted a professorship in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Virginia. In the early 1970s, he studied the prediction of diffusion rates of gases in liquids and began to investigate oxygen diffusion in biological systems, focusing particularly on the cardiovascular disease atherosclerosis.
 While at the University of Virginia, Gainer invented TSC by modifying certain natural products, including saffron, resulting in the creation of a novel single trans isomer carotenoid salt. Using animal models, he then investigated the activity of TSC, exploring his theory that the drug would increase the transfer of oxygen through blood plasma into hypoxic tissues. The drug's clinical promise became evident when Gainer and colleagues demonstrated that TSC could improve survival in animal models of severe hemorrhage while reversing the drop in blood pressure that accompanies the loss of large amounts of blood. From his work with animal models, Gainer also predicted that TSC held promise for the treatment of cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction (heart attack), and other diseases associated with hypoxia and ischemia (a lack of oxygen delivery to tissues).

BEST GAINER ON THE MARKET!!!
The taste of the Double Choc Ice Cream is the best flavor I've ever tasted for a gainer or any protein for that matter. So freakin' delicious! Mixes excellent if you mix each scoop individually in a shaker. Goes down smooth! One thousand calories for four scoops without milk! This stuff is ultra high quality, too. Anytime you see John Scott's name on a product you better believe it's top notch. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Also wish it came in a plastic container instead of a bag that ziplocks. Not easy to ziplock but no biggie. Best gainer as far as I'm concerned! I could drink this stuff until I was gagging!

Weight Gain









Weight Gainers: Overview
"Weight gainers" are specialized supplements formulated to help users increase their bodyweight by providing extra protein and carbohydrate calories in a convenient shake format. Weight gainers are most often used by younger athletes who are more likely to have difficulty putting on weight than older users. Many older adults and seniors, however, are regular users of weight gainer powders since they have a much higher nutritional value than plain protein powders but are no more difficult to use or consume than a protein shake.

Protein shakes provide mainly protein, but very little else nutritionally. Weight gainers are essentially beefed-up protein powders; they provide protein, plus significant amounts of carbohydrates and fat, and very often vitamins and minerals in modest potencies. Weight gainers usually have a blend of protein sources as their base ingredient, often a combination of whey and casein dairy protein, with egg protein and certain amino acids added by some manufacturers. To the protein blend, the other ingredients are added in amounts, combinations and  flavors that vary from brand to brand.

There are a few things worth keeping in mind when considering a weight-gainer. First, a weight gainer product can't influence whether any resultant weight gain is due to muscle and lean body mass or an increase body fat; that is determined by exercise habits and overall nutritional intake. But weight gainers generally provide protein, fats and carbohydrates in a ratio that supports an increase in muscle and lean body mass when used by those engaged in a program of strength training.

Keep in mind is that while the suggested serving size of some weight gainers is very large, users can use smaller serving sizes as they see fit. Another important factor to consider is the importance of basic nutrition. Weight gainers will yield the best results when used by those with a solid and complete nutritional foundation. That means a healthy balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables, a good multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acid supplement in addition to the weight gainer product. Finally, users should know that difficulty gaining weight can be a sign of a serious medical problem. A doctor can help you determine if an underlying medical problem is contributing to any difficulty gaining weight.
