Partnering for Continuous Delivery Toolchain Success

 By Ali Kheirolomoom  October 9, 2014 9:32 AM 

If you didn’t see the news yesterday, our friends at CloudBees, the enterprise Jenkins company, announced further strengthening of their partner program to delivery continuous delivery success to software development and IT organizations around the world.
It was a pleasure to be quoted in the release, because I firmly believe that continuous delivery isn’t about any one particular process you automate or tool you buy. Instead, to achieve continuous delivery speed and quality, you need to seamlessly connect your processes and tools into a DevOps toolchain that eliminates bottlenecks, manual steps and errors.
Of course, I believe that our deployment automation and release management solutions are critical components in that toolchain, but those products need to plug-in easily and work collaboratively with adjacent tools such as SCCM (e.g., Dimensions CM, PVCS, Subversion, Git), continuous integration (e.g., Jenkins) and infrastructure configuration management (e.g., CFEngine, Puppet, Chef).
If you are near Chicago, San Francisco or Washington DC in the next month, I invite you to come to one of the continuous delivery summits or Jenkins user conferences we are sponsoring with CloudBees to learn more about this subject and see these products working together for DevOps success.  I also invite you to attend our next DevOps drive-in webcast on October 30th with Mark Burgess, founder of CFEngine, on the future of configuration management.
-Ali
“We are excited to partner with CloudBees to deliver world-class Continuous Delivery automation for the world’s largest and most important companies,” said Ali Kheirolomoom, senior vice president of R&D, Serena Software. “Serena provides application deployment automation and release process management solutions that seamlessly integrate with Jenkins-powered CloudBees products, whether in the cloud or on-premise, to enable our mutual customers to speed up application delivery, increase software quality and, most importantly, better respond to the demanding needs of their customers.”

Serena ChangeMan SSM 8.4 is Available!

 By Ali Kheirolomoom  October 9, 2013 11:17 AM 

I’m proud to announce that we have delivered ChangeMan SSM 8.4!
ChangeMan System Software Manager (SSM) 8.4 contains many improvements that are part of our continuing program to enhance usability and maintain z/OS currency. Changes include:



Compatibility with z/OS 2.1
SMP/E Installation Option

ChangeMan SSM 8.4 can be installed with IBM’s SMP/E method as well as the non-SMP/E (IEBCOPY) method of installing Serena’s mainframe products. Installation instructions for each method are provided in the ChangeMan SSM 8.4 Installation Guide.


Enhanced Operational Integrity

This feature allows ChangeMan SSM to identify important z/OS data set names and add them to dynamically defined groups to provide for automatic change tracking. When Operational Integrity is enabled, the following data sets will be tracked automatically:

APF entries
Linklist
LPA list
Proclibs allocated in the master address space and JES2/3 address space
SYS1.NUCLEUS
SYSx.IPLPARM
All parmlib data sets referenced during the IPL




Enhanced Member Reference Tracking

Member Reference Tracking (MRT) has been expanded to pick up more member references. Originally, the BLDL macro only recorded references to a single member. MRT now picks up BLDL macro references to multiple members as well as references from the FIND macro.


Support for Data Sets on Extended Address Volumes (EAV)
HMIGRATE/HRECALL/HDELETE Support for Real Time Change Tracking (RTCT) Option

This enhancement increases the accuracy of the event information by picking up HMIGRATE, HRECALL, and HDELETE data set events when they happen, instead of relying on Global Capture or a CLOSE-driven capture.





How to Obtain the New Release
Please go to the Support Website to obtain the documentation and software for ChangeMan SSM 8.4. (Note: You must be signed into the site to access this link.) On this webpage, you can choose the ChangeMan SSM 8.4 release.
If the above link does not work for you, please log into http://support.serena.com, click the “My Downloads” tab, then select “ChangeMan SSM” in the “Please Select Product” drop-down box.

Thrilled to be Taking on a New Challenge

 By Ali Kheirolomoom  December 12, 2012 10:51 AM 

After seven great years here at Serena, I am thrilled to announce my new role as Senior Vice President of Products, where I will lead all product development and strategy across Serena’s award-winning portfolio of technologies. Our core purpose here at Serena is to advance the business value of IT by orchestrating application development, delivery, and support. In my humble opinion, Serena has never been so relevant to the industry and solves today’s tremendous market needs.
Needless to say, I’m excited about this new opportunity and look forward to continuing to bring the industry the most innovative ALM, enterprise DevOps, and IT service management solutions available today.
Most recently I served as GVP & GM of SBM Products & IT Service Management where I worked to develop and launch the Serena Service Management Solution, which received the coveted Pink Elephant Innovator of the Year Award last year. Prior to that, I was VP of SBM products here at Serena where I defined the strategy for process-based visual application assembly and developed the SBM Platform to fulfill the orchestrated IT solution strategy for Serena.
In the year ahead, I plan to help Serena continue our great journey of strengthening Serena’s leadership position and will focus on automating and streamlining the supply chain process of application development, delivery and support. We plan to further leverage Serena’s underlying PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) to empower Managed Service Providers and Online Enterprises looking to deliver differentiated process-based application content to their cloud (Process-as-a-Service). Stay tuned!

 By Ali Kheirolomoom  November 29, 2012 8:57 AM 

We’re proud to announce that the significant advancements made to our Orchestrated IT solution set are now generally available.  Serena Orchestrated IT 4.0 was specially designed to help agile enterprises take full advantage of mobile, social and cloud capabilities.
For the Front Office, Development, and Operations, Serena Orchestrated IT 4.0 consists of Serena’s major solutions, including Serena Dashboard, Request Center, Demand Manager, Requirements Manager, Development Manager, Release Manager, and Service Manager.

 
New and enhanced Serena solutions to enable Orchestrated IT for the agile enterprise include:

The latest version of Serena Dashboard also includes many more metrics for Serena ChangeMan ZMF, providing customers a unified view of both distributed and mainframe platforms.
Request Center 4.0: Serena Request Center adds smart search capabilities, improving self-service so users can quickly locate knowledge base articles pertinent to their issues. Tighter linkages between service requests and the associated services provide better visibility across the service delivery life-cycle, aiding continual service improvement.
Demand Manager 4.0: The latest release of Serena Demand Manager provides a number of features that make it easier to track resources and costs. Managers can create teams based on skills, allocate them to project deliverables and be alerted when resources are already fully allocated. Team managers also have complete visibility into both planned and actual allocations in a given month.
Requirements Manager 4.0: The latest release of Requirements Manager provides a number of customer enhancements, and includes even tighter integrations with Serena Development Manager and Serena Release Manager.
Development Manager 4.0: Providing many customer enhancements, Development Manager advances the user experience for development team stakeholders, supports process control that unifies the coordination of development change requests across both ChangeMan ZMF and Dimensions CM, and streamlines the hand-off of development packages to Serena Release Manager.
Release Manager 4.0: Rich development-driven release management capabilities have been added to Serena Release Manager to complement its strong operations-driven release management capabilities. Significant enhancements include support of continuous delivery, intelligent deployments to reduce deployment time, and enhanced cloud deployment capabilities, including the ability to schedule and deploy applications to Amazon EC2. Other enhancements to Serena Release Manager include the scheduling of deployments across multiple applications, the availability of Media Vault / Definitive Media Library (DML) functionality, and enhancements to the release calendar to support user customizable data feeds.
Service Manager 4.0: The Configuration Management System (CMS) has been enhanced in this release to make it easier for customers to configure authorized and allowable relationships between configuration item (CI) types, associate custom icons with CI categories, create relationships between CIs graphically and zoom in to the details of a CI that is in focus. New dashboards that track work assignments across service request, incident, problem and change management to better manage resources have also been added in this release.

You can read the detailed release notes for all the Serena solutions on the Serena Support website (customer login required).

You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
