HONG KONG, July  13, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SPI Energy Co., Ltd. ("SPI Energy" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:SPI), a global clean energy market place for business, residential, government and utility customers and investors, today announced the buyback of preferred shares in EnSync, Inc. ("EnSync"). 
On August 30, 2016, SPI Solar, Inc. ("SPI Solar"), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into an agreement (the "Melodious SPA") with Melodious Investments Company Limited ("Melodious") and certain other party to sell to Melodious 8,000,000 shares of common stock, 7,012 shares of series C-1 convertible preferred stock and 4,341 shares of C-2 convertible preferred stock of EnSync for an aggregate price of US$17 million, which sale was completed in December 2016.  Pursuant to the Melodious SPA, Melodious has the right to request SPI Solar to repurchase 7,012 shares of the C-1 preferred stock and 4,341 shares of the C-2 preferred stock under certain circumstances.  In April 2017, Melodious exercised such right and requested that SPI Solar repurchase those preferred stocks at a per share price of US$1,018.25, with a total repurchase consideration of US$11.6 million plus interest.  The aforementioned repurchase was completed on July 10, 2017.  Among the repurchase consideration, US$8.5mn was set off against the outstanding payment obligation of Melodious under the Melodious SPA with net payment by SPI Solar in the amount of US$3.2 million.  After the completion of this repurchase, SPI Solar holds 28,048 shares of series C preferred stock of EnSync (consisting of 7,012 shares of each of series C-1, C-2, C-3 and C-4 preferred stock) and a warrant to purchase 50 million shares of common stock of EnSync, subject to certain conditions. Those preferred stocks and the warrant were originally acquired by SPI Solar from EnSync in July 2015.

As previously reported, on June 30, 2017, the Company was notified by the Nasdaq Listing Qualification Staff (the "Staff") that the Company's securities were subject to delisting as a result of the Company's noncompliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c).

Nasdaq has confirmed that a hearing has been set for August 10, 2017, at which hearing the Company will demonstrate its ability to regain compliance with the particular deficiencies cited by the Staff as well as its ability to sustain long-term compliance with all applicable maintenance criteria. In addition, the delisting action referenced in the Nasdaq Staff's determination letter has been stayed for 15 calendar days, or until July 22, 2017.  Upon expiration of the stay period, the Company's securities will be suspended from trading unless the Panel grants an extension of the stay pending the hearing.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

What’s something you can’t go without?
I’m not talking about your iPhone or chocolate... I’m talking about actual needs.
Maybe electricity? Water? Gas?
These are basic necessities.
And utilities provide them.
They’ve cornered the market on these necessities and while they might not be as hot as the newest self-driving car, they’re stocks that give solid returns and high dividends.
In fact, utility stock dividends are sometimes three times higher than the average company…
I don’t know about you, but I love high dividends. They mean that no matter what, I will get a return on my investment.
Utility stocks are so important that we’ve written a free report on them called “Why You Need to Buy Utility Stocks Today.”
In this report you’ll learn:

The basics of utility investing.
Why they’re such a solid investment.
How you can get invested in them.

At Energy and Capital, we believe in giving you your bang for your buck, so we’re also including an ETF and several stocks that can help you get invested in utilities.
It’s all waiting for you.
Just enter your email and the report will be yours.
