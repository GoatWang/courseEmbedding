Product Development

Clients often need help taking a good product and turning it into something great. That is where design and creativity can make all the difference. A t-shirt has little perceived value. But if it has a swanky design on it that appeals to a specific target audience, it evolves from being a piece of clothing into a coveted and collectible lifestyle accessory. Here are several examples of how we turned ordinary items—everything from apparel, to stationery, to home decor, and school supplies—into successful lines of products.



Apparel Design

FARM BOY/FARM GIRL

Creating designs for such a hip client as Farm Boy was a real honor. They already have a full line of very cool products, so we were a bit intimidated by the high bar their collection has already set! Nevertheless, we rolled up our sleeves and put in several honest days’ work.

Designer: Ligia Teodosiu



Apparel Design

FARM BOY/FARM GIRL

Hats and t-shirts are essential for farm fashion.

Designer: Ligia Teodosiu
Creative Director: Joel Anderson



Apparel Design

FARM BOY/FARM GIRL
 
Ah, tractors and tail feathers. These t-shirt themes practically design themselves!

Designer: Ligia Teodosiu




Apparel Design

FARM BOY/FARM GIRL

A good t-shirt design can work on lots of colors. You can’t go wrong with pink for chix.

Designer: Andy Gregg
Creative Director: Joel Anderson



Apparel Design

FARM BOY/FARM GIRL

...and you can’t go wrong with blue for dudes!

Designer: Andy Gregg
Creative Director: Joel Anderson



Apparel Design

FARM BOY/FARM GIRL

These two designs were aimed at guys, so we had Andy plow deep into his fertile imagination to create the art.

Designer: Andy Gregg



Apparel Design

FARM BOY/FARM GIRL

We borrowed some inspiration from a famous WWII propaganda poster for one of these designs.

Designer: Ligia Teodosiu



Apparel Design

FARM BOY/FARM GIRL

Industrial colors seem to work well for this sort of fashion design.

Designers: Ligia Teodosiu 
& Andy Gregg
Creative Director: Joel Anderson



Wall Decor

HARLEY-DAVIDSON

One of our favorite licensing partners (Meissenburg Designs) takes our art and creates awesome wood and metal signs. They recently became a Harley-Davidson decor products licensee. They asked us to help them create a series of new Harley-approved designs.

Designer & Ilustrator: Joel Anderson



Wall Decor

HARLEY-DAVIDSON (continued)

We were designing under a time crunch so this first batch of designs was created from skulls we nabbed from royalty-free stock art sites. Then we revved up our creative engines and made a series of bad-to-the-bone art that Meissenburg turned into wood and metal signs to sell in Harley Dealerships across the country.

Designer: Joel Anderson



3-Box Postcard Set

 ART & SOUL OF AMERICA

We took 100 of our most popular American Travel posters and shrunk them down to postcard size, creating a lovely collectible postcard set. We created 3 specially designed boxes to divide up each group of cards—one for Western cities, one for National Parks, and one for Eastern cities. If you line up the backs of the 3 boxes, you get a swanky all-American scene!

Designer: Joel Anderson



Stationery/Postcards

CICADA INVASION

Every good product line starts with an underexploited natural resource. Take cicadas for instance. In Nashville, they come out once every 13 years and drive everyone crazy. One of Nature’s little jokes provided an excellent opportunity for us to develop an entire line of postcards, posters and gifts!

Designer: Joel Anderson



Novelty Gifts

CICADA INVASION
 
We dreamed up this whole collection 13 years ago the last time the Periodical Cicadas invaded Nashville. So when they came back, we were ready for them with swatters, beer mugs, t-shirts, stickers, posters, and more!



Gifts & Apparel

CICADA INVASION
 
When we develop a line of products, we ask: “who is the target audience and what will motivate them to buy the items we are creating?” In this case, it’s anyone who loves or hates cicadas!



Posters/Home Decor

CICADA INVASION
 
A good product is something people need or really want. If it is super stylish, then it becomes a statement about the user. That is where design plays a big role—taking an ordinary item and making it a coversation piece! In this case, art for a poster would also become a set of commemorative postcards, and t-shirt designs.

Illustrator: Andy Gregg



Collectible Gifts

SPIRIT OF NASHVILLE

It all started with our line of classic posters created to celebrate Nashville’s history and charm. Once the poster art was done, the next logical step was to put the art on high-end gifts and collectibles.



Food/Licensing

SPIRIT OF NASHVILLE
 
Licensing is a great way to deepen a product line. Once a brand is established, it’s easy to partner up with makers of other products that appeal to the same target audience. In this case, we’ve lent our Music City designs to a southern shortbread maker, Willa’s Shortbread. It’s a match made in heaven—he sells more cookies, and we extend our product line into new categories!



Fashion Accessories

SPIRIT OF NASHVILLE
 
A tote bag is a logical extension to a line that already has everything! We created a pattern that featured the most popular Spirit of Nashville designs and icons, and we embellished a canvas tote. Chicks dig it.

Designer: Joel Anderson




Wall Calendar

ART & SOUL OF AMERICA

We created a 2011 promotional calendar with the French Paper Company to show off their paper and our new line of classic American travel poster art. The calendar won a Gold ADDY, a Gold Regional ADDY, and in May, 2011, it went on to the National ADDYs. It was also selected to appear in Print Magazine’s 2011 Regional Design Annual.

Designers: Joel Anderson, 
Andy Gregg, Ligia Teodosiu 
& Edward Patton



Postcard Collection

ART & SOUL OF AMERICA

These postcards were created as part of the Art & Soul of America and French Paper Company promotional calendar to show off Pop-Tone papers.

Designer: Andy Gregg 
Creative Director: Joel Anderson



Candle Tins

ART & SOUL OF AMERICA

One of our clients produces exquisite scented candles. We are collaborating with them to create a new line of candles with labels that feature our Art & Soul Of America art. The labels and unique scents will make these travel candle tins appeal to consumers who love to explore America’s favorite destinations.

Designers: Joel Anderson 
& Andy Gregg




Candle Tin Labels

ART & SOUL OF AMERICA

These travel tins of scented candles capture the aroma of each city or national park we’ve depicted in our art. Scents like juniper, sage and lemon pepper go quite nicely with our designs!

Designers: Joel Anderson 
& Julian Baker



Toys & Apparel

UNIVERSAL STUDIOS

Universal’s licensing department hired us to help them create a style guide (art and graphic standards) for the 25th anniversary of Bruce Lee’s death. The licensing collection was made available to companies around the world who used our art to create products of all kinds. We especially enjoyed seeing our art translated into packaging and apparel.

Designer: Joel Anderson




Apparel

UNIVERSAL STUDIOS

Before Universal Studios began production on Jurassic Park III, they hired us to help them create a comprehensive style guide that would target 3 specific audiences of boys (ages 6 to 14.) Some guys like NASCAR and wrestling. Others like extreme sports. And others are into museums and science. This is a sample from the collection aimed at the 3rd group.




Apparel/Home Decor

UNIVERSAL STUDIOS

Team Woody was the sponsor for a Formula 1 racing outfit. Universal Studios hired us to create a style guide that would fuse that nutty wood pecker with the high-speed world of racing. Most of the products we dreamed up were aimed at boys age 6-14.



Toys/Apparel/School Supplies

UNIVERSAL STUDIOS

The Grinch was a very big movie for licensing. Universal hired us to work on a special line of products aimed at teens. We called the line Whovenile Delinquents and went for a rebellious, edgy feel. Our style guide was used by licensees around the world to make everything from school supplies, to apparel, to home decor.



Playing Cards

ELLUSIONIST PLAYING CARDS

Here's a product that we don't get to work on everyday. Ellusionist Playing Card Company hired us to create a deck of cards themed after 60s era Madison Avenue businessmen. 

Illustrator: Aaron Johnson



Playing Cards

ELLUSIONIST PLAYING CARDS

With over 52 cards in a deck (and 12 them with characters) we had to keep the look consistent, yet still give each card a unique personality. Luckily Aaron has plenty of tricks up his sleeve!

Illustrator: Aaron Johnson



School Supplies

NORCOM, INC.

School supplies are just commodities—unless you can give them some attitude and make them visually more appealing than the competition. Norcom hired us to create pop culture eye candy that would make their ordinary pocket folders and notebooks stand out. This line spoofed old comic books.

Designer/Illustrators: Joel Anderson & Matt Lehman




School Supplies

NORCOM, INC.

Our clients in the stationery and school supply biz are always looking for ways to reinvent notebooks, pencil holders, etc.. We helped them to take design to a new level through shapes, colors and materials. Rather than just printing new designs on paper, we challenged them to use metal and create a line called Hardware. (This was before schools had metal detectors installed at the doors.)



School Supplies

NORCOM, INC.

In the never-ending battle to make school supplies jump off of the shelf and into the hands of back-to-school shoppers, Norcom hired us to create a line of 1970s-era faux advertising imagery to make their notebook covers stand out amid the clutter.

Designers: Matt Lehman 
& Joel Anderson




Apparel

NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC

National Geographic has a wealth of amazing nature photography. They asked us to help them create some creepy, fun, or thrilling apparel that would appeal to kids. It started with choosing cool images. Then we wrote snappy slogans to go with the pictures. These shirts were sold in their gift stores and catalogs during the fall/Halloween season.

Thomas Anderson (born November 8, 1970)[4] is the American co-founder of the social networking website Myspace, which he founded in 2003 with Chris DeWolfe.[5] He was later president of Myspace and a strategic adviser for the company until he left in 2009.[3][6] Anderson is popularly known as "Tom from Myspace" because until 2010 he would automatically be assigned as the first "friend" of new Myspace users upon the creation of their profiles.

Early life[edit]
Anderson's father was an entrepreneur.[7] As a teenager at San Pasqual High in Escondido, California, Anderson was a computer hacker under the pseudonym "Lord Flathead" (friends with Bill Landreth), and prompted a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raid after he cracked the security of Chase Manhattan Bank. He was not arrested because of his young age (14).[8][9]
Anderson studied English and Rhetoric at the University of California, Berkeley, prior to becoming the lead singer of a band called "Swank."[7] Anderson then lived in Taiwan for some time, before returning to the United States to study for a degree in Critical Film Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.[5][10]
Career[edit]
Anderson was a product tester and copywriter at XDrive, a digital storage company in 2000, where he first met DeWolfe.[10] He initially joined XDrive as a product tester after answering a flyer advertisement, while still at film school and looking to earn extra money.[11] After XDrive went bankrupt in 2001, he and DeWolfe founded direct marketing company ResponseBase.[5][10] They sold ResponseBase to Brad Greenspan's eUniverse in late 2002.[7]
With other eUniverse employees, Anderson set up the first pages of Myspace in August 2003. He founded the site partly as a reaction to Friendster, and its policy of blocking accounts that did not use real names.[12] Intermix Media was then founded as the successor of eUniverse, and it was under Intermix that Myspace garnered the level of popularity that it is notable for. When Intermix Media and Myspace were sold to News Corp, Anderson became president of the company.[5]
Myspace was sold to News Corp in 2005 for $580 million.[13] Following the News Corp acquisition, Anderson said: "Before [the acquisition], I could do whatever I wanted. Now it takes more time to get people to agree on things. All the budget reviews and processes. That can be a pain. But it's not stopping us."[7] Reuters quoted an unnamed News Corp executive: "Tom [Anderson] was responsible for the product but ended up being a complete bottleneck on getting things done."[14] Anderson was replaced as president in April 2009 by News Corp;[15] by 2010, he was no longer the default friend on Myspace, and was replaced by a profile called "Today On MySpace," or "T.O.M."[16]
In late May 2012, Anderson announced that he would be joining RocketFrog Interactive as an adviser to the 16-person, Los Angeles, U.S.-based company, which created a Facebook app.[13] However, in a September 2014 interview, Anderson did not mention any advisory roles in his life at the time, while his Twitter blurb in October 2014 reads: "Enjoying being retired."[17] He explained in the interview that he is not interested in returning to his previous vocation, but concluded: "I'll never say never, because more than anything I like the idea that anything can happen. I don't know exactly where my life will lead. Adventure and the unknown has always been appealing to me."[18]
Media appearances[edit]
Anderson had a cameo appearance in the 2009 American drama-comedy film Funny People starring Adam Sandler.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Anderson is active on other social media platforms, including Facebook, Reddit, Twitter (with over 237,000 followers as of January 2017), and Google+ (6.50 million followers as of March 2016).
Following an experience with photography at the 2011 Burning Man festival, Anderson's interest in his own photography was piqued. In a September 2014 ABC News interview, Anderson credited friend and photographer Trey Ratcliff for facilitating his skill development, and explained: "I'm not necessarily trying to represent nature exactly. I'm trying to make something beautiful like a painter would." Anderson travels globally with friends to locations such as Thailand and Myanmar, where he primarily focuses upon landscape images.[18]
Anderson also explained in September 2014 that his personal interests have always been diverse:

If you knew me before Myspace, you'd probably thought I'd have been a scholar teaching philosophy in a university my whole life. If you met me before college, you'd probably have thought I'd be a musician for my entire life ... I like change.[18]

But it's not stopping us."[7] Reuters quoted an unnamed News Corp executive: "Tom [Anderson] was responsible for the product but ended up being a complete bottleneck on getting things done."[14] Anderson was replaced as president in April 2009 by News Corp;[15] by 2010, he was no longer the default friend on Myspace, and was replaced by a profile called "Today On MySpace," or "T.O.M."[16]
In late May 2012, Anderson announced that he would be joining RocketFrog Interactive as an adviser to the 16-person, Los Angeles, U.S.-based company, which created a Facebook app.[13] However, in a September 2014 interview, Anderson did not mention any advisory roles in his life at the time, while his Twitter blurb in October 2014 reads: "Enjoying being retired."[17] He explained in the interview that he is not interested in returning to his previous vocation, but concluded: "I'll never say never, because more than anything I like the idea that anything can happen. I don't know exactly where my life will lead. Adventure and the unknown has always been appealing to me."[18]
Media appearances[edit]
Anderson had a cameo appearance in the 2009 American drama-comedy film Funny People starring Adam Sandler.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Anderson is active on other social media platforms, including Facebook, Reddit, Twitter (with over 237,000 followers as of January 2017), and Google+ (6.50 million followers as of March 2016).
Following an experience with photography at the 2011 Burning Man festival, Anderson's interest in his own photography was piqued. In a September 2014 ABC News interview, Anderson credited friend and photographer Trey Ratcliff for facilitating his skill development, and explained: "I'm not necessarily trying to represent nature exactly. I'm trying to make something beautiful like a painter would." Anderson travels globally with friends to locations such as Thailand and Myanmar, where he primarily focuses upon landscape images.[18]
Anderson also explained in September 2014 that his personal interests have always been diverse:

If you knew me before Myspace, you'd probably thought I'd have been a scholar teaching philosophy in a university my whole life. If you met me before college, you'd probably have thought I'd be a musician for my entire life ... I like change.[18]

Early life[edit]
Anderson's father was an entrepreneur.[7] As a teenager at San Pasqual High in Escondido, California, Anderson was a computer hacker under the pseudonym "Lord Flathead" (friends with Bill Landreth), and prompted a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raid after he cracked the security of Chase Manhattan Bank. He was not arrested because of his young age (14).[8][9]
Anderson studied English and Rhetoric at the University of California, Berkeley, prior to becoming the lead singer of a band called "Swank."[7] Anderson then lived in Taiwan for some time, before returning to the United States to study for a degree in Critical Film Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.[5][10]
Career[edit]
Anderson was a product tester and copywriter at XDrive, a digital storage company in 2000, where he first met DeWolfe.[10] He initially joined XDrive as a product tester after answering a flyer advertisement, while still at film school and looking to earn extra money.[11] After XDrive went bankrupt in 2001, he and DeWolfe founded direct marketing company ResponseBase.[5][10] They sold ResponseBase to Brad Greenspan's eUniverse in late 2002.[7]
With other eUniverse employees, Anderson set up the first pages of Myspace in August 2003. He founded the site partly as a reaction to Friendster, and its policy of blocking accounts that did not use real names.[12] Intermix Media was then founded as the successor of eUniverse, and it was under Intermix that Myspace garnered the level of popularity that it is notable for. When Intermix Media and Myspace were sold to News Corp, Anderson became president of the company.[5]
Myspace was sold to News Corp in 2005 for $580 million.[13] Following the News Corp acquisition, Anderson said: "Before [the acquisition], I could do whatever I wanted. Now it takes more time to get people to agree on things. All the budget reviews and processes. That can be a pain. But it's not stopping us."[7] Reuters quoted an unnamed News Corp executive: "Tom [Anderson] was responsible for the product but ended up being a complete bottleneck on getting things done."[14] Anderson was replaced as president in April 2009 by News Corp;[15] by 2010, he was no longer the default friend on Myspace, and was replaced by a profile called "Today On MySpace," or "T.O.M."[16]
In late May 2012, Anderson announced that he would be joining RocketFrog Interactive as an adviser to the 16-person, Los Angeles, U.S.-based company, which created a Facebook app.[13] However, in a September 2014 interview, Anderson did not mention any advisory roles in his life at the time, while his Twitter blurb in October 2014 reads: "Enjoying being retired."[17] He explained in the interview that he is not interested in returning to his previous vocation, but concluded: "I'll never say never, because more than anything I like the idea that anything can happen. I don't know exactly where my life will lead. Adventure and the unknown has always been appealing to me."[18]

History




Founded in 1981 as an office broker in Rocklin, California

by J. Matthew Thomas, (current Chairman and CEO) J.M. Thomas Forest Products

has become one of the largest independent building material distributors in the

United States.
 
J. Matthew Thomas started in the business at age 19 at

Georgia Pacific in Salt Lake City, Utah. Determined that he could provide a

higher level of customer satisfaction, he started his own sales office in

California in 1981, and sold lumber products to retail dealers in several

western states. 
 
Seizing an opportunity to begin a distribution center, he

purchased a distressed company�s land in Ogden, Utah in 1990. The Ogden

distribution center was opened in late 1990, and had solid growth those first

few years. Building the best staff in the business, by 1995 J. M. Thomas had

become a major player in the Utah and Western Colorado markets. 
 
In 1995 Bill Anderson joined the company in a management

position to assist Matt with growth objectives. By 1998 J. M. Thomas had become

one of the largest building distributors in the Western United States. In 2002, the Boise,

Idaho facility was opened and in 2009 JM Thomas acquired Colorado Forest Industries in Denver, CO. 
 
Today J.M. Thomas Forest Products ranks as one of the top 

distributors in the United States, and with a strong financial position we are

poised for future growth.�
