TPG Pace Holdings Corp. Completes $450,000,000 Initial Public Offering | Business Wire


























































TPG Pace Holdings Corp. Completes $450,000,000 Initial Public Offering






June 30, 2017 04:48 PM Eastern Daylight Time



FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TPG Pace Holdings Corp. (the “Company”), a newly organized blank 
      check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and 
      formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset 
      acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business 
      combination with one or more businesses, today announced the closing of 
      its initial public offering of 45,000,000 units, which includes 
      5,000,000 units issued pursuant to the partial exercise by the 
      underwriters of their over-allotment option. The offering was priced at 
      $10.00 per unit, resulting in gross proceeds of $450,000,000, before 
      deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering 
      expenses payable by the Company.
    

      The Company’s units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under 
      the ticker symbol “TPGH.U” on June 28, 2017. Each unit consists of one 
      of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares and one-third of one warrant, 
      each whole warrant enabling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A 
      ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. Once the securities 
      comprising the units begin separate trading, the Class A ordinary shares 
      and warrants are expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange 
      under the symbols “TPGH” and “TPGH WS,” respectively.
    

      Deutsche Bank Securities, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, and J.P. Morgan 
      Securities LLC served as joint book runners for the offering.
    

      The offering was made only by means of a prospectus, copies of which may 
      be obtained from Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Attn: Prospectus Group, 
      60 Wall Street, New York, NY 10005-2836, tel: (800) 503-4611, email: prospectus.CPDG@db.com;

      803-9204, email: prospectus-eq_fi@jpmchase.com.
    

      A registration statement relating to the securities has been declared 
      effective by the SEC on June 27, 2017. This press release shall not 
      constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor 
      shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction 
      in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to 
      registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such 
      state or jurisdiction.
    

      This press release contains statements that constitute “forward-looking 
      statements,” including with respect to the anticipated use of the net 
      proceeds from the initial public offering. No assurance can be given 
      that the net proceeds of the initial public offering will be used as 
      indicated. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous 
      conditions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, 
      including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of the Company’s 
      registration statement and preliminary prospectus for the Company’s 
      offering filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). 
      Copies are available on the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. 
      The Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for 
      revisions or changes after the date of this release, except as required 
      by law.
