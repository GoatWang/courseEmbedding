Veritable, LP and Moelis Asset Management LP Announce Joint Venture 
      Focused on Providing Initial Capital and Operational Support to New 
      Private Market Investment Firms




Archean Capital Partners’ Initial Fund Established with $100 Million 
      of Commitments






January 17, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



PHILADELPHIA & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Veritable, LP. (“Veritable”) and Moelis Asset Management LP (“Moelis 
      AM”) today announced they have entered into a joint venture agreement 
      establishing Archean Capital Partners, a private market investment 
      platform that will provide new portfolio managers with the initial 
      capital, advice and infrastructure necessary to launch their own funds.
    

      Veritable is a leading wealth management firm with over $13 billion of 
      assets under management. Moelis AM is the parent company for alternative 
      asset management firms with an aggregate of over $3 billion in assets 
      under management.
    

      Through Archean Capital Partners (“Archean”), Veritable and Moelis AM
will seek capital commitments for a series of single manager, 
      special purpose vehicles (“SPV” or collectively, “SPVs”) that will 
      invest in selected newly launched private funds. Archean will partner 
      with managers across a broad range of strategies including buyout, 
      turnaround/restructuring, growth, credit opportunities, infrastructure 
      and real estate. As part of Archean's seed investment of capital in 
      these newly launched funds, Archean will seek to provide its investors 
      returns generated on both invested capital and revenue sharing from the 
      new investment manager’s business.
    

      Veritable and Moelis AM have already established the initial Archean 
      SPV, a single manager SPV with $100 million of capital committed by 
      Veritable’s clients and individuals at Veritable, Moelis AM and Moelis & 
      Company. The Archean SPV is in the process of investing with its first 
      candidate in the private funds industry. Moelis & Company’s Private 
      Funds Advisory Group has been retained by this manager to advise on 
      further capital raising.
    

      Michael Stolper, Founder and CEO of Veritable, said, “Veritable made its 
      first alternative strategy investment in the late 1980s. Since then we 
      have invested several billion dollars of client capital around the world 
      with a wide variety of unaffiliated private fund and hedge fund 
      managers. In many instances, Veritable has provided fund managers with a 
      significant portion of their initial investment capital having often 
      cultivated relationships with them for years. We have developed a strong 
      reputation among fund managers for providing long-term investment 
      capital and the opportunity for managers to build their own track 
      records. We are very pleased to be partnering with Moelis AM on this 
      innovative partnership that, through Archean, will provide newly formed 
      private markets managers with the critical mass and operating support to 
      create institutional quality organizations.”
    

      Christopher Ryan, Managing Director of Moelis AM, said, “The Archean 
      platform is intended to allow individual managers the certainty of a 
      large and stable source of initial capital for a rapid first close and 
      the fundraising capabilities to secure additional capital commitments 
      for their first funds. In partnership with Veritable, we believe there 
      will be tremendous opportunities to grow this unique investment platform 
      for the benefit of new managers and investors alike.”
