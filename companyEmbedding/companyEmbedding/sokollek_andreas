Fungus In Chobani Greek Yogurt Outbreak A Threat To Consumers

News Staff






In September of 2013, customers of Chobani brand Greek yogurt complained of gastrointestinal problems after consuming products manufactured in the company's Idaho plant. The company issued a recall and claimed that the fungal contaminant Murcor circinelloides was only a potential danger to immunocompromised individuals. 
Yet complaints of severe GI discomfort continued from otherwise healthy customers and researchers began to question the fungus and its ability to cause harm in healthy humans.  Resulting research has found that this fungus is not harmless after all, but a strain with the ability to cause disease. 
In the study, the researchers isolated a strain of the fungus from a yogurt container that was subject to recall. Using a technique known as multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), they identified the strain as Mucor circinelloides f. circinelloides (Mcc). Unlike other strains of the fungus, that particular subspecies is commonly associated with human infections.
Mucho is sexually compatible with an M. circinelloides f. circinelloides isolate. Zygospore formation between Mucho and (−) NRRL3614 was observed, whereas Mucho did not mate with (+) NRRL3615 (data not shown). The results indicate that Mucho is the (+) mating type. Its mating ability with the other M. circinelloides f. circinelloides isolate also supports that Mucho is M. circinelloides f. circinelloides. Scale is 100 µm. Credit: 
doi:10.1128/mBio.01390-1

Whole-genome sequence analysis of the yogurt isolate confirmed it as being closely related to Mcc and also revealed the possibility that this fungus could produce harmful metabolites that were previously unknown in this species. 
The researchers then tested the strain on mice, where the fungus showed an ability to cause lethal infections when the fungal spores were injected into the bloodstream as well as to survive passage through the GI tract when the spores were ingested orally.

"When people think about food-borne pathogens, normally they list bacteria, viruses, and maybe parasites. Fungal pathogens are not considered as food-borne pathogens. However, this incidence indicates that we need to pay more attention to fungi. Fungal pathogens can threaten our health systems as food-borne pathogens," says co-author Soo Chan Lee of Duke University.

      Chonabi's public relations agency, Weber Shandwick, sent the following via email:
Please find below a statement attributable to Chobani. I would appreciate if you could please update the story on your website to include this. Thank you.“Chobani conducted an aggressive, statistically significant series of tests of the products voluntarily recalled in September 2013 with third party experts confirming the absence of foodborne pathogens. Chobani stands by these findings, which are consistent with regulatory agency findings and the FDA’s Class II classification of the recall on October 30th 2013,” said Dr. Alejandro Mazzotta, Chobani Vice President of Global Quality, Food Safety, and Regulatory Affairs. Dr. Mazzotta continued, “In regards to this specific study, we were just made aware of it and want to take more time to review its methodology and assertions. To our knowledge, there is no evidence, including the assertions presented in this publication, that the strain in the recalled products causes illness in consumers when ingested. Food quality and safety has always been and always will be paramount to Chobani. Through our partnership with Cornell University and other leading institutions, we constantly look for ways to further promote quality and safety in the dairy industry.” To further ensure the continued safety and quality of its products, since its voluntary recall in September 2013, Chobani has implemented additional state of the art equipment for microbiological testing, and the company routinely conducts more than 500 microbiological tests daily from crafting and finished product samples, in excess of the regulatory requirements.  Additionally, Chobani has significantly invested in experienced and accomplished people. In October of last year, it named Dr. Alejandro Mazzotta, one of the industry’s leading experts in food safety with more than two decades of experience, as Vice President of Global Quality, Food Safety and Regulatory Affairs. Last November, it named Andreas Sokollek, who brings more than 24 years of operations excellence and project management experience, as Senior Vice President of Supply Chain and Operations, overseeing all new product launches, production planning and materials management initiatives. This year, Dr. Jarret Stopforth joined Chobani as Director of Manufacturing Quality to lead manufacturing food safety and quality, and Dr. Candace Jacobs, Sr. Manager, Supplier Quality is now leading our supplier quality programs. Industry veterans Michele Gorman, Sr. Manager of Microbiology and Daniel Gorman, Sr. Manager of Quality and Food Safety Systems, have also joined Chobani to enhance its food safety and quality processes and systems. “Nothing is more important to us than the quality of our products and the trust of our fans. Our focus continues to be on food safety, quality, production and distribution to ensure that we are meeting our most important commitment: delivering perfect cups of yogurt, every time. Our plants continue to meet all food safety standards and are making very high quality yogurt using only natural ingredients and we're very proud of our craft," Dr. Mazzotta said.

Ravens Plan Ahead

      Jul 15 2017 | 1 comment(s) 


    In early times, a raven could be a bad omen, and a new study finds that ancient people were not wrong in thinking the raven might be planning on using a negative event to full advantage. It turns out, according to the paper, they plan ahead, just like humans, and can even forgo an immediate reward in order to gain a better one in the future, which at least some humans do. Great apes too.Ravens and great apes have not shared a common ancestor for over 300 million years, so what explains it? Evolution is not a straight line and the authors speculate that the cognitive "planning" abilities they share in common re-appeared, on a separate evolutionary path, in the birds. 







Tardigrade, The World's Most Indestructible Species - What Would It Take To Make Them Extinct?

      Jul 14 2017 | 0 comment(s) 


    It won't matter if all the ice melts and seas rise 100 feet, even if frogs rain from the skies and dogs and cats are living together, one species will be around until the sun explodes.That species is the eight-legged micro-animal tardigrade, the world's most indestructible species.







Brain Performance Not Affected By Menstrual Cycle

      Jul 07 2017 | 0 comment(s) 


    Men who worry that women may not make the right decisions during a menstrual cycle, and women who claim biology is a valid excuse for being a jerk, you're both out of luck.An examination of three aspects of cognition across two menstrual cycles found that the levels of estrogen, progesterone and testosterone had no impact on working memory, cognitive bias or ability to pay attention to two things at once. While some hormones were associated with changes across one cycle in some of the women taking part, these effects didn't repeat in the following cycle. Overall, none of the hormones the team studied had any replicable, consistent effect on study participants' cognition.







Theories On Pulsar Phenomena Aren't Theories

      Jul 04 2017 | 0 comment(s) 


    A theory is a very precise thing in science - yet some scientists can't resist using the term to lend intellectual weight to what may be a hypothesis and is likely just reasonable speculation. It's a large part of the reason why the term has become colloquialized, and 'wellness' is equivalent to gravity in the minds of some.Physical science is not immune. String Theory put theory in the name, so it gets to skate on the edges of truth, but theoretical physicists are trying to recapture the Golden Age of the 1930s, plus write a bestselling book. Astrophysics should know better. Yet many have still used the word theory to describe the "glitch" and "wobble" detected among pulsars, despite having no basis for it.







Gender-Blind Recruitment Process Leads To More Men Being Hired

      Jul 01 2017 | 0 comment(s) 


    It's been shown that there is no hiring deficit for women in science; women have been hired far more than men for new jobs. Yet women's groups have continued to point to total numbers as the problem, as if to say older men who have been supportive of more diversity and are making it happen on hiring committees should be fired without cause to open up more jobs for women.Only the weakest candidate wants to be hired as part of a quota. There has to be a better way.







For Amateur Cyclists, EPO Blood Doping Won't Help

      Jun 29 2017 | 0 comment(s) 


    Use of performance enhancing drugs is a major problem in many competitive sports and the 2017 prohibited list includes over 300 substances. However, the scientific evidence around these substances is scarce, partly because it is impossible to do trials with professional cyclists who are subject to anti-doping regulation.Meanwhile, media attention given to performance enhancing drugs may encourage amateurs to try them. But it is unlikely to help, according to a new paper published in The Lancet Haematology journal.

Chobani Twin Falls Facility Reaches Full Capability Milestone, Increases Production & Innovation to Support National Growth and Demand

Chobani Twin Falls Facility Reaches Full Capability Milestone, Increases Production & Innovation to Support National Growth and Demand























     Chobani, Inc., maker of America's No. 1-selling Greek Yogurt brand, announced today that its Twin Falls, Idaho, facility has reached optimal production capability, a significant milestone achieved in less than a year.   This will serve to support the continued growth and demand for its Greek Yogurt as its sales have increased 32% year-to-date and are projected to grow even higher in 2014.    "Our Twin Falls facility is ready to take on the increased production capacity and innovation it was designed for in order to help us meet the remarkable growth we're experiencing," said Hamdi Ulukaya, Founder and CEO of Chobani. "This accomplishment allows us to sustainably and efficiently meet rising national demand and is a testament to the hard work of our new leadership, as well as those who have been with us from the beginning."   In addition to its original plant in upstate New York, Chobani Greek Yogurt is made in Twin Falls, which opened in late December 2012 and is the largest yogurt facility in the world.   To support the supply and distribution of its products throughout the country, Chobani will rebalance and optimize the production of its yogurt between its facilities in upstate New York and Twin Falls, increasing production in Twin Falls given its design, size and innovation capability while Chobani's New York facility will remain the key manufacturing and distribution hub of Chobani's important and strategic East Coast region.     Chobani's Twin Falls plant is a state-of-the-art facility that was built from the ground up through a $450 million investment and 1.7 million work hours. The facility supports close to 1,200 local jobs and has been a key economic driver for the state.   In its first year of production, Chobani focused on making its Twin Falls plant not just a leader in size, but in cleanliness, safety and innovation. Chobani recently brought in significant resources and continues to work with internal as well as outside experts to assemble one of the most advanced food safety and quality systems in the industry.   In October, Chobani named Dr. Alejandro Mazzotta, one of the industry's leading experts in food safety with more than two decades of experience, as Vice President of Global Quality, Food Safety and Regulatory Affairs. In November, it named Andreas Sokollek, who brings more than 24 years of operations excellence and project management experience, as Senior Vice President of Supply Chain and Operations, overseeing all new product launches, production planning and materials management initiatives. Chobani has also recently hired Sherri Chatham as Twin Falls Quality Assurance Manager. Chatham is a passionate Quality Assurance professional with over 20 years in dairy quality management.  She brings a proven track record of implementing successful quality assurance and sanitation programs, HACCP and food training.   "Our commitment to the craft and quality of our products has never been deeper, our Twin Falls factory has never run better and our confidence in delivering more cups of yogurt to more people has never been stronger" said Andreas Sokollek, Senior Vice President of Supply Chain and Operations.   Since choosing Twin Falls as its second home, Chobani worked closely with the community in support of various local initiatives. Chobani has initiated a job training program in conjunction with the College of Southern Idaho and the Shepherd's Gift Foundation, Chobani's charitable arm, has supported the Southern Idaho Children's Learning Center, given weekly donations to Idaho food banks, sponsored the Twin Falls county fair and Twin Falls Rapids Soccer Club, among others.

Ancient Human Retrovirus Could Help Fight HIV

      Jun 28 2017 | 0 comment(s) 


    We're in a lifelong struggle against nature every single day, the ultimate arms race. Viruses have continually infected humans just as they do today. Some early viruses even became integrated into our genome and are now known as human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). Over millions of years, they became inert due to mutations or major deletions in their genetic code. Today, one of the most studied HERV families is the HERV-K family, which has been active since the evolutionary split of humans and chimpanzees with some members perhaps actively infecting humans within the past couple hundred thousand years.







Zika Linked To Miscarriages, Thin Brain Tissue In Babies

      Feb 21 2017 | 0 comment(s) 


    Zika virus can cross the placenta, intended to protect the developing fetus, and appears to lead to a high percentage of miscarriages and to babies born with thin brain tissue and inflammation in brain cells, at least in mice.Mice are not little people, of course, or every disease would have been cured by now and every chemical would be toxic, but it's a starting point for understanding the role of zika in birth defects beyond vague epidemiology.







The Machiavellian Side Of Cholera

      Feb 06 2017 | 0 comment(s) 


    Recently, two armies were pitted against each other, with harpoon-like appendages covered in poison. They went two war, stabbing each other and rupturing victims like water balloons. It was all mathematically predictable, at least over time. In a one-off scenario, Tom Brady and the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl, though in over 90 other instances where a team in the playoffs was down by 19 after three quarters, they lost. Knowing the math could lead to new, targeted therapies to fight infections.But dueling bacteria would not be the infectors in that scenario; they'd be the remedy.







Broccoli Science: Natural Fatty Acids Follow The Golden Ratio

      Jan 27 2017 | 0 comment(s) 


    The number of theoretically possible fatty acids with the same chain length but different structures can be determined with the aid of the famous Fibonacci sequence.The ability to calculate the number of possible fatty acids is of great importance for their chemical analysis (‘lipidomics’) and a new paper states the number of possible fatty acids with increasing chain length rises at each step by a factor that agrees with what is called the ‘Golden Ratio’. The Golden Ratio is essentially a ratio that is the midpoint between asymmetry and symmetry, when "the whole is to the larger as the larger is to the smaller". In numerical terms, it is 1.618.







How Viruses Leave Messages For Descendants On How To 'Infect'

      Jan 18 2017 | 0 comment(s) 


    Many viruses face a choice after they have infected their hosts: to replicate quickly, killing the cell in the process, or to become dormant and lie in wait. HIV, herpes, and a number of other human viruses behave this way and, in fact, even the viruses that attack bacteria – phages – face similar decisions when invading a cell. What causes a virus to choose dormancy over immediate gratification? Prof. Rotem Sorek and his group in the Weizmann Institute’s Department of Molecular Genetics have now discovered that, during infection, viruses secrete small molecules into their environment that other viruses can pick up and “read.” In this way, they can actually coordinate their attack, turning simple messages into a fairly sophisticated strategy.







Cheap Way To Kill Off Gonorrhea - Mouthwash

      Dec 20 2016 | 0 comment(s) 


    A paper in Sexually Transmitted Infections details a cheap way to kill off gonorrhea in the mouth - alcohol-containing mouthwash. Gonorrhea is caused by bacteria and  curb the growth of the bacteria responsible.  Gonorrhea of the mouth has become more common among primarily gay men as fear of AIDS has declined. That disease is quite treatable today and so fear of it has declined, meaning a decline in condom use. Gonorrhea is also treatable, with antibiotics, but those heighten the risk of the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of Neisseria gonnorheae, the bacteria responsible for the infection, so concern is high. If gay men won't use condoms, maybe they'll use mouthwash







Paper Hopes To Link Diet, Gut Microbiome And Colorectal Cancer

      Dec 12 2016 | 0 comment(s) 


    A new paper links specific types of intestinal bacteria in the development of colorectal cancer - in animal models, at least. Finding it in humans is another matter.But if such a link is ever found, and currently these findings are only exploited by people selling something, it could lead to dietary-based therapeutic interventions which may be able to modify the composition of the gut microbiome and reduce 
colorectal cancer
 risk.







Avocado Extract Can Prevent Listeria In Food

      Nov 22 2016 | 0 comment(s) 


    Thanks to savvy marketing by food corporations who are looking for health halos to put over their food, consumer demand for food products formulated without synthetic additives has increased. There is a big drawback, demonstrated by Chipotle and others who are hoping to make themselves look healthier when selling junk food - it still has to be safe to eat. Additives, synthetic or not, are needed for food safety reasons, so food product developers are faced with the challenge of developing more "natural" additives that can produce comparable in safety results with synthetic versions. 







Over 7 Million Bacterial Genes In The Pig Gut

      Nov 07 2016 | 0 comment(s) 


Pigs are a main livestock species for food production worldwide and is also widely used as an animal model in biomedical research. Today we know that the many types of bacteria that inhabit the gut are important for health and disease. Knowledge of the genes of these bacteria and their function therefore constitutes the first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of how bacteria in the gut affect health and disease.
An international consortium of researchers from INRA (France), University of Copenhagen and SEGES (Denmark), BGI-Shenzhen (China) and NIFES (Norway) has now established the first catalog of bacterial genes in the gut of pigs. This achievement is published in the latest issue of Nature Microbiology.







Nitrate-Reducing Microbes Linked To Migraine Headaches

      Oct 20 2016 | 0 comment(s) 


    Researchers have found an association between migraines and microbes that reduce nitrates. Analyzing data from the American Gut Project, they found that migraine sufferers harbored significantly more microbes in their mouths and guts with the ability to modify nitrates compared to people who do not get migraine headaches.
