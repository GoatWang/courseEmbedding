Governance Guidelines
(As adopted by the Board of Directors on June 23, 2016)

The Board of Directors (the �Board� of Argan, Inc. (the �Company�), has adopted these guidelines to reflect the Company�s commitment to good corporate governance, and to comply with New York Stock Exchange and other legal requirements.  In furtherance of these goals the Board has also adopted a Code of Conduct, and written charters for each of its Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee, Compensation Committee and Audit Committee.  The Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee will periodically review these guidelines and propose modifications to the Board for consideration as appropriate.

	These guidelines should be interpreted in the context of all applicable laws and the Company�s Amended and Restated Articles of  Incorporation (the �Articles of Incorporation�), Amended By-Laws (the �By-Laws�) and other corporate governance documents, and are intended to serve as a framework within which the Board may conduct its business. These guidelines are subject to modification, and the Board shall be able, in the exercise of its discretion, to deviate from these guidelines from time to time, as the Board may deem appropriate or as required by applicable laws and regulations.

I. Director Responsibilities
A. Basic Responsibilities
The business affairs of the Company are managed under the direction of the Board, which represents and is accountable to the shareholders of the Company.  The Board�s responsibilities are active and not passive and include the responsibility to regularly evaluate the strategic direction of the Company, management policies and the effectiveness with which management implements its policies. 
		
The basic responsibility of the directors is to act in good faith and with due care so as to exercise their business judgment on an informed basis in what they reasonably and honestly believe to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.  In discharging that obligation, the directors must inform themselves of all relevant information reasonably available to them, and should be entitled to rely on the honesty and integrity of the Company�s senior executives and its outside advisors and auditors.
		
The Board believes that each director should have a basic understanding of (i) the principal operational and financial objectives and plans and strategies of the Company, (ii) the results of operations and financial condition of the Company and of any significant subsidiaries.
		
B. Board and Committee Meetings
Directors are expected to prepare for and use reasonable efforts to participate in all Board meetings and meetings of committees on which they serve.  The Board and each committee will meet as frequently as necessary to properly discharge their responsibilities, provided that the full Board will meet at least four times per year.
		
The Chairman and the Lead Independent Director will prepare the agenda for each Board meeting.  While the agenda will initially be set by the Chairman of the Board and the Lead Independent Director, each director is free to suggest the inclusion of items on the agenda.
		
Information and data that are important to the Board�s understanding of the business to be conducted at a Board or committee meeting should, to the extent practical, be distributed in writing to the directors sufficiently in advance of the meeting to permit meaningful review, and directors are expected to review in detail the provided materials in advance of each meeting.
		
Directors are expected to attend the annual meeting of shareholders.

C. Meetings of Independent Directors
The Independent Directors will meet without non-independent directors at regularly scheduled executive sessions at least four times per year and at such other times as they deem appropriate. 
		
D. Board Interaction with Institutional Investors, Research Analysts and Media
As a general rule, management will speak on behalf of the Company. Comments and other statements from the entire Board, if appropriate, will generally be made by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. It is suggested that, in normal circumstances, each director will refer all inquiries from third parties to management.
		
II. Composition and Selection of the Board
A. Size and Composition of the Board
The Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws provide that the Board may determine the size of the Board from time to time. The Nominating and Governance Committee will assess the Board�s size from time to time to determine whether its size continues to be appropriate.  The Nominating and Governance Committee will make its recommendations to the Board.
		
B. Board Membership Criteria
The Board will have a majority of directors who meet the criteria for independence required by the New York Stock Exchange. The Board will monitor its compliance with the New York Stock Exchange requirements for director independence on an ongoing basis. Each independent director is expected to notify the Chair of the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee, as soon as reasonably practicable, in the event that his or her personal circumstances change in a manner that may affect the Board�s evaluation of such director�s independence.
		
The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing with the Board, on an annual basis, the composition of the Board as a whole, and whether the company is being well served by each director taking into account the director�s independence, age, skills, experience and availability for service to the Company.
		
The Board has delegated to the Nomination and Governance Committee the responsibility for reviewing and recommending nominees to join the Board in accordance with the policies and principles in its Charter.  The formal invitation to join the Board should be extended by the Chairman of the Board.
		
C. Membership on Other Boards
Directors must inform the Chairman of the Board and the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee when accepting an invitation to serve on another public company board. No member of the Audit Committee may simultaneously serve on more than three other public company audit committees unless the Board determines that doing so would not impair the director�s service on the Board of the Audit Committee.
		
III. Term Limits and Mandatory Retirement
The Board has not established any term limits to an individual�s membership on the Board.  As an alternative to term limits, the Nomination and Governance Committee will, as part of its annual assessment of the composition of the Board, review a director�s continuation on the Board. 
		
IV. Board Committees
A. Composition and Responsibilities
The Board will have at all times an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Nomination and Governance Committee, an Executive Committee, and any other committees the Board deems appropriate.  All of the members of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nomination and Governance Committee will be independent directors under the criteria for independence in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the rules promulgated thereunder, and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, as each may be from time to time amended. The members of each committee will be appointed by the Board upon recommendation of the Nomination and Governance Committee based on each committee�s member qualification standards.  Consideration should be given to the desires, skills and characteristics of individual directors. The Board will appoint the Chair of each committee upon the recommendation of the Nomination and Governance Committee.
		
B. Charters
The Board will adopt charters setting forth the purposes, goals and responsibilities of each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and the Nomination and Governance Committee.
		
C. Subcommittees
Board Committees may, in their discretion, delegate all or a portion of their duties and responsibilities to a subcommittee of such committee.
		
V. Director Access to Officers, Employees, Security Holders and Independent Advisors
A. Access to Management and Employees
Directors have full and unrestricted access to officers and employees of the Company.
		
B. Access to Independent Advisors
The Board and each committee have the power to hire independent legal, financial or other advisors as they may deem necessary, without consulting or obtaining the approval of any officer of the Company in advance, and will have access to the Company�s internal and independent auditors and the Company�s outside legal counsel. The Company will provide sufficient funding to the Board and to each committee, as determined by the Board and each of its committees, to exercise their functions and provide compensation for the services of their advisors and, in the case of the Audit Committee, independent auditors. 
		
C. Interaction With Security Holders and Other Interested Parties
The Nomination and Governance Committee believes that shareholder accessibility to members of the Board is an important element of the Company�s corporate governance practices. The e-mail address of the Nomination and Governance Committee is to be posted to the Company�s website.
		
D. Internal Reporting
The Audit Committee will encourage submission, and establish procedures for the confidential treatment by the appropriate officers, under the supervision of the Audit Committee, of complaints and concerns by officers and employees regarding accounting and auditing matters and of reports regarding alleged violations of the Code of Conduct, or other Company policies or law.
		
The senior executives of the Company are encouraged to initiate direct contact with the Chair of the Audit Committee if they believe that there is a matter that should be brought to the attention of the Board.
		
VI. Director Orientation and Continuing Education
All new directors must be provided with these Governance Guidelines and will participate in the Company�s orientation initiatives as soon as practicable after appointment or the annual meeting at which a new director is elected. The initiatives will include furnishing new directors with materials and presentations by senior management and outside advisors as appropriate to familiarize new directors with the Company�s business, its strategic plans, its significant financial, accounting and risk management issues and its compliance programs as well as their fiduciary duties and responsibilities as directors.
		
The Nomination and Governance Committee and members of senior management of the company as well as appropriate outside advisors will periodically report to the Board on any significant developments in the law and practice of corporate governance and other matters relating to the duties and responsibilities of directors in general. 
		
VII. Ethics and Conflict of Interest
The Board expects the Company�s directors, as well as officers and employees, to act ethically at all times and to acknowledge their adherence to the Company�s policies from time to time in respect of business conduct and ethics.
		
VIII. Director Compensation
The Compensation Committee will periodically review and recommend, and the Board will approve, the form and amount of director compensation in accordance with the corporate policies and principles relevant to director compensation. It is the Company�s policy that some portion of director compensation be in the form of Company stock or equity-based awards. The Board will consider that directors� independence may be jeopardized if director compensation and perquisites exceed customary levels, if the Company makes substantial charitable contributions to organizations with which a director is affiliated, or if the Company enters into consulting contracts with (or provides other indirect forms of compensation to) a director or an organization with which the director is affiliated.
		
IX. Combination of Chairman and CEO Positions
The Board believes that the Company is best served by having one person serve as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, because this structure provides unified leadership and direction. The combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer also ensures that the Company presents its message and strategy to shareholders, employees, customers and other stakeholders with a unified, single voice. 
		
Board independence and oversight of the senior management of the Company are enabled by the presence of independent directors who have substantive knowledge of the Company�s business and have oversight over critical functions of the Company, such as the integrity of the Company�s financial statements, the evaluation and compensation of executive management and the nomination of directors.  In addition, one of the independent directors has been chosen as �Lead Director.� The Independent Directors meet in executive session at the end of each Board of Directors meeting to discuss the affairs of the Company without any executive of the Company being present.
		
X. Board Role in Risk Oversight
The Board will take an active role in overseeing risks related to the Company both as the full Board and through its committees through detailed reviews, discussions and presentations by officers of the Company and key functional areas. 
	
XI. Director Insurance, Indemnification and Exculpation
The Company intends to, and the directors will be entitled to have the Company, purchase reasonable directors� and officers� liability insurance on behalf of the directors to the extent reasonably available. In addition, the directors will receive the benefits of indemnification provided by the Company�s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws, as well as the provisions regarding absence of personal liability contained in the Company�s Articles of Incorporation, and the indemnification agreement between each director and the Company.
		
XII. Annual CEO Certification
The Company�s Chief Executive Officer shall certify to the New York Stock Exchange each year that he is not aware of any violation by the Company of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance listing standards. The Chief Executive Officer shall also promptly notify the New York Stock Exchange in writing after any executive officer of the Company becomes aware of any non-compliance with any applicable provisions of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance rules.
		
XIII. Availability of Documents on Company Website
A copy of these guidelines, as well as copies of the Company�s Code of Conduct and written charters for each Board committee, will be made available on the Company�s website. Copies of each of the foregoing will also be available, without charge, upon the written request of a shareholder.

The initial members of the Committee shall be appointed by the Board. Candidates to fill subsequent vacancies on the Committee shall be nominated by the Committee as set forth below and appointed by the Board. Members shall serve at the pleasure of the Board and for such term or terms as the Board may determine.

Working within the Argan community

Fair and Equitable Treatment
Argan strives to build and maintain a productive, motivated workforce by treating all employees fairly and equitably. We select and place employees on the basis of their qualifications for the work to be performed, without regard to race, color, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, religion, physical or mental disability, age, veteran status or other characteristics protected by applicable law. Every employee should be fair and respectful in his or her dealings with fellow employees.

Argan will not tolerate harassment of its employees by anyone, including managers, co-workers, contractors, vendors or customers. Our policies on diversity and equal employment are set forth below.

Diversity and Equal Opportunity
Argan recognizes that diversity brings benefits to the company -- ways of thinking and approaches to decision making that can make us more successful. We value the differences among individuals and welcome diversity within our workforce. Each Argan manager shall ensure that all applicants and employees are afforded an equal opportunity in employment. We support and obey laws that prohibit discrimination everywhere we do business.

Employee Health and Safety
Argan strives to provide each employee with a safe and healthy work environment. Each employee has a responsibility to maintain a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. Employees should report to their supervisor workplace accidents and injuries, as well as unsafe equipment, practices or conditions.

Violence and threatening behavior are not permitted. Employees should report to work in condition to perform their duties, free from the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol. The use or possession of illegal drugs in the workplace is prohibited.

Respect for the Environment
Argan employees will respect the environment by complying with all applicable environmental laws in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. Argan is committed to the protection of the environment by minimizing the environmental impact of our operations. Argan’s employees should notify their supervisor or manager if hazardous materials come into contact with the environment or are improperly handled or discarded.

Working Within the Legal System

Compliance with Laws
Argan's policy is that all employees shall conduct business on behalf of the company in full compliance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. There may be uncertainty with respect to the scope and application of certain of the laws in some jurisdictions. Compliance with our policy requires a good faith effort to satisfy the intent and purpose of the applicable laws, consistent with our policy of ethical and honest business conduct. Any employee who acquires knowledge of a violation of law, or who requires guidance on a matter of law, should consult with their supervisor or manager.

Contracting practices
When Argan is selling or buying products and services, or entering into other commitments, Argan must consider the rights and obligations of each party in appropriate written contracts.  Properly written contracts document the use of Argan funds and assets, define the rights and obligations of Argan and other parties, establish protections against liability, and provide tools for handling disputes.  If you are involved in negotiating with Argan customers, suppliers, other business partners or outside parties, you are required to understand basic principles of business transactions and to abide by Argan contracting policies and guidelines.

You may not commit Argan to undertake any performance, payment or other obligation unless you are authorized under the appropriate delegation of authority policies.

You may not enter into any agreement or engage in any activity that may violate applicable law.  You may not enter into any transaction that facilitates improper revenue recognition, expense treatment or other accounting improprieties on the part of either Argan or the business partner.


Protecting Argan's Assets and Opportunities



Protecting and safeguarding Argan’s assets, including tangible and intangible property, is critical to Argan’s success. We have a duty to use those assets for legitimate business purposes only, to protect them from loss or unauthorized use and to keep them confidential as appropriate.  In no event may Argan assets be used for unlawful or improper purposes.  Every employee has a responsibility to protect our assets. Theft, misuse and waste of assets have an impact on Argan's profitability. Theft, embezzlement or misappropriation of Argan property by any employee is prohibited. Argan equipment should not be used for non-company business.

The obligation of employees to protect Argan's assets includes its proprietary information, such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks, business and marketing plans, engineering and manufacturing ideas and unpublished financial data. Unauthorized use or distribution of proprietary information is a violation of Argan policy.

Finance and Accounting Practices
It is a legal requirement that, as a public company, Argan adheres to strict accounting principles and standards of reporting.  Financial information must be accurate and complete, and there must be internal controls and processes to comply with these accounting and financial reporting laws.  These laws require the proper recording of, and accounting for, revenues and expenses.  If an employee has responsibility or any involvement in these areas, they must understand and adhere to these rules.  Also, these rules prohibit anyone from assisting others to engage in improper accounting practices or make false or misleading financial reports.

Violations of laws associated with accounting and financial reporting can result in fines, penalties, and even imprisonment, and can lead to loss of public faith in a company.  If you become aware of any action related to accounting or financial reporting that you believe may be improper, you should immediately report it to your manager, the Vice President of Finance or by contacting the anonymous Hotline number listed at the end of this Code of Conduct.

Political Activities
Argan employees are encouraged to take an active interest in political and government activities and to support principles, issues, parties or candidates of their own choice. Such activity must remain separate and distinct from employment with Argan.

Argan policy goes beyond federal law, which prohibits the use of company funds, assets, services or facilities on behalf of a federal political party or candidate except under limited circumstances. Our policy is that no Argan assets -- including monetary payments, employees' work time, use of Argan premises or equipment -- may be contributed to any political candidate, political action committee, party, or ballot measure without the written permission of the Chief Financial Officer. An Argan employee will not be compensated or reimbursed, in any form, for a political contribution that the person has made.

Preservation of Certain Records 
For business, accounting and legal reasons our company records must be properly managed.  We create, retain and dispose of our business records and information assets, both written and electronic, as part of our normal course of business in compliance with applicable regulatory and legal requirements.  Information defined as essential must be retained in a recoverable format for as long as it remains essential.  Information that is no longer essential should be disposed of as soon as possible.  For questions regarding what is essential information, contact the Vice President of Finance.

In no case may business records or documents involved in a pending or threatened litigation, government inquiry or under subpoena or other information request, be discarded or destroyed. In addition, you may never destroy, alter, or conceal, with an improper purpose, any record or otherwise impede any official proceeding, either personally, in conjunction with, or by attempting to influence, another person.  You are required to cooperate fully with legal counsel retained in the course of a lawsuit, legal proceeding or investigation.

Confidential Information
Argan has developed and continues to develop and use commercially valuable confidential and/or proprietary technical and non-technical information. Confidential information includes a wide range of non-public information including but not limited to financial and cost data, business plans and strategies, operating reports, pricing information, marketing and sales data, business partner information, proprietary information, personnel records and organization charts.  Appropriate security measures to protect confidential information from improper disclosure should be taken seriously by all employees.

Employees must maintain the confidentiality of such information. You may not, directly or indirectly, disclose, or use for the benefit of yourself or any other person, any of our confidential or proprietary information.

Media Inquiries
Federal law also restricts the manner in which Argan releases material information to the media, security analysts and stockholders. Argan has an obligation to accurately and completely convey all material facts when speaking publicly. In order to ensure that Argan complies with its obligations, employees receiving inquiries regarding material company information or Argan's position on public issues should refer the request to the Corporate headquarters at Argan, Inc., One Church Street, Suite 201, Rockville, MD 20850 or call 301-315-0027.

Inside Information
Federal law prohibits insiders from trading securities while in possession of material nonpublic information. Argan's policy also prohibits such trading. Any employee who is aware of material nonpublic information related to Argan, or to firms which are suppliers or customers of Argan, may not buy or sell common stock of Argan or such other company. You may not disclose such information to any person outside Argan until it has been made public. You cannot "tip" others. Securities trading by your family members, household members or those with whom you have a close, personal relationship can, under some circumstances, result in legal liability to you.

Material information is any information that a reasonable investor would consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell common stock. This includes information about possible acquisitions or divestitures, earnings, new contracts or products, expansion plans and other important corporate developments that have not been publicly disclosed. You should refer to the Argan Trading Policy if you have any questions concerning your buying or selling of Argan common stock.

Many senior-level Argan employees are subject to special rules on insider trading. Unless otherwise advised, these employees can only buy or sell Argan common stock during limited periods following the release of quarterly or annual earnings information.  Such "window" periods are open two days after, the earliest of, any quarterly or annual reporting period press release or SEC filing, but 30 days before the close of a quarterly or annual reporting period.  Refer to Argan’s Insider Trading Policy for further information.

Avoiding Conflicts of Interest

Argan employees are expected to make business decisions based on the best interests of the company and not based on personal relationships or benefits. Conflicts of interest can compromise employees' business ethics. A conflict of interest arises when an activity, investment, interest or association interferes with or appears to interfere with the independent exercise of an employee's judgment as it relates to Argan's interests. A conflict of interest arises if an employee works for or has an ownership interest in a competitor, customer or supplier.

Employees must disclose any situations that may involve conflicts of interest affecting them personally. Waivers of conflicts of interest involving employees require the approval your manager and the Vice President of Finance. Waivers of conflicts of interest involving executive officers require the approval of the Audit Committee or the board of directors.

Business Gifts and Entertainment
Business entertainment and business gifts in a commercial setting are intended to create goodwill and improve working relationships. Such entertainment or gifts should not be used to gain an unfair advantage with suppliers or customers. Such gifts or entertainment should not be offered, given, provided or accepted by any Argan employee or family member of an Argan employee unless it (1) is not a cash gift, (2) is consistent with customary business practices, (3) is not of significant value that would give the appearance of impropriety or that the gift or entertainment was intended in any way to influence a business relationship and (4) does not violate any laws or regulations. Each business unit may have other guidelines to put on business entertainment depending on practices appropriate for that business unit. If you have any questions concerning the appropriateness of gifts or entertainment, you should contact your manager or the Vice President of Finance.

Working with Suppliers and Customers


We must maintain the confidence, respect and trust of our customers, partners, suppliers and government organizations by conducting business responsibly.  We must be committed to acting ethically, lawfully, truthfully and with integrity in all business dealings whether selling or buying or representing Argan in any other capacity.

Advertising, Marketing and Sales Practices
Generally, statements in advertising, promotional materials and product packaging must be fair, factual, complete, capable of being substantiated and may not deceive or mislead current or potential customers.  Argan’s marketing and sales practices reflect Argan’s commitment to honest and fair dealings with its current or potential customers.  You may not make false or misleading statements about products and services of ours or those of competitors in marketing or sales activities.

Purchasing Products
Argan also expects to receive fair and competitive prices and quality services from our suppliers. We select suppliers that are best able to meet our needs based on such factors as quality, value, best or lowest price, technical excellence, service reputation and production capacity.

Argan does not condone reciprocity with suppliers or customers. The materials we require are purchased solely on their merits, just as the products we sell are sold solely on their merits. Personal or family relationships should not influence purchasing or sales decisions.

Dealings with Competitors
Argan believes that a competitive economy is essential to the public interest, to the interests of the business community in general, and to Argan specifically. Argan's policy is to comply with the laws of competition in all jurisdictions in which we operate.

All employees must carry out the policy of Argan to compete vigorously and legally in all areas of its business operations. No employee of Argan has authority to engage in any conduct inconsistent with the laws of competition or to authorize, direct or condone such conduct by any other person. For example, Argan employees shall not: 

Agree on or even discuss with competitors any matter involved in competition between Argan and the competitor (such as sales price, credit terms, marketing strategies, market shares or sales policies) except in those instances where there is a bona fide purchase from or sale to a competitor or bona fide credit checks for commercially reasonable purposes. 

Agree with a competitor to restrict competition by fixing prices, allocating customers or territories or any other means. 
Agree with a supplier or customer on the minimum price at which a product will be resold.

Sell a product below cost with the intent to harm a competitor.

Violations and Waivers

The Audit Committee or Board of Directors shall determine, or designate appropriate persons to determine, remedial actions to be taken in the event of a violation of the Code of Conduct. Such actions shall be reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and promote accountability for adherence to the Code of Conduct. The Audit Committee or Board of Directors has full and discretionary authority to approve any amendment to or waiver from this Code of Conduct; any such amendment or waiver shall be promptly disclosed as required by applicable law or regulation.

Back to Top
Administration

The overall administration of our Code of Conduct rests with the Argan Corporate Headquarters in Rockville, MD.  Argan will not tolerate any threats or acts of retaliation against an employee for any report made in good faith. Employees' reports of Code of Conduct violations will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law and our ability to address specific concerns. Anonymous reports should supply detailed information to allow us to investigate and address the concern. In some instances, employees' names will be needed for us to properly investigate the matter. Some investigations may not allow for complete anonymity.

Acknowledgement 
We ask that employees annually to acknowledge their commitment to the Code of Conduct.  Your signature acknowledges that you have read and understand the Code of Conduct.

Training
You may be required to take a training course covering the Code of Conduct and may be required to take refresher courses from time to time.

Non-retaliation
Under no circumstances will you be subject to any disciplinary or retaliatory action for reporting a possible violation of the Code of Conduct or applicable law or for cooperating in any investigation of a possible violation.  However, knowingly false or malicious reports will not be tolerated and anyone filing such reports will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.

Waivers
Any waiver of this Code of Conduct for directors or executive officers may be made only by the Audit Committee or the board of directors. Requests for waivers from other employees should be addressed to your manager and the Vice President of Finance.

Investigations
Supervisors and managers should be accessible to employees who wish to report any unlawful or unethical conduct that violates this Code of Conduct. Any person receiving an employee report of a violation of this Code of Conduct should notify the Vice President of Finance or the Argan Corporate Headquarters, of the report. Argan will investigate all such employee reports. You are responsible for providing truthful information and cooperating fully in any investigation.

In connection with any investigation, employees must not (1) interfere with the investigation, such as by providing false, misleading or incomplete information, concealing information or encouraging others not to contribute to an investigation or (2) destroy or alter any information relevant to the investigation.

Remediation
Violation of our Code of Conduct is a serious matter and may in some circumstances subject Argan or the employee involved to civil liability or even criminal prosecution.

Employees who violate our Code of Conduct may be disciplined. Disciplinary action will be determined by the applicable business unit management, the Vice President of Finance, the Argan Corporate Headquarters and/or the Audit Committee, based on the circumstances involved. Disciplinary action can include severe consequences, such as termination of employment, suspension from employment without pay, demotion, transfer, withholding of promotion and requiring reimbursement of damages caused.

Questions about our Code of Conduct should be directed to your immediate supervisor, manager, Vice President of Finance, the Argan Corporate Headquarters or the anonymous Hot Line.

INSIDER TRADING POLICY
I. 	PURPOSE 
To comply with federal and state securities laws governing (a) trading in securities of Argan, Inc. (�Company�) while aware of �material nonpublic information� concerning the Company, and (b) tipping or disclosing material nonpublic information to outsiders, and to prevent even the appearance of improper insider trading or tipping, the Company has adopted this Insider Trading Policy (�Policy�) for all of its directors, officers and designated key employees, their family members, and specially designated outsiders who have access to the Company�s material nonpublic information.

The Company may change the procedures or adopt new procedures as the Company considers appropriate in order to carry out the purposes of the Policy.
	
III. 	SECTION 16 INDIVIDUALS AND KEY EMPLOYEES 
A. 	Section 16 Individuals.  Each member of the Company�s Board of Directors (�Board�), those officers of the Company designated by the Board to be �Section 16 officers� of the Company, and their respective family members and others in their households, are subject to the reporting provisions and trading restrictions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (�Exchange Act�) and the underlying rules and regulations promulgated by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (�SEC�) (the �Section 16 Individuals�). 
	
B. 	Key Employees.

The Compliance Officer may designate one or more individuals who may perform the Compliance Officer�s duties in the event that the Compliance Officer is unable or unavailable to perform such duties. 
	
V. 	DEFINITION OF �MATERIAL NONPUBLIC INFORMATION� 
A. 	�Material� Information 
Information about the Company is �material� if there is a substantial likelihood that it would be significant for the investment or voting decisions of a reasonable shareholder or investor, or if there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the information would significantly alter the total mix of information in the marketplace about the Company. If an investor would want to buy or sell securities based on the information, the information should be considered material. In simple terms, material information is any type of information that could reasonably be expected to affect the price of Company securities. While it is not possible to identify all information that would be deemed �material,� the following types of information ordinarily would be considered material: 
	

Financial performance, especially quarterly and year-end earnings and significant changes in financial performance or liquidity. 
		
Potential mergers and acquisitions or the sale of significant Company assets or subsidiaries. 
		
New major contracts, orders, suppliers, customers, or finance sources, or the loss thereof. 
		
Major discoveries or significant changes or developments in products or product lines, research or technologies. 
		
Significant changes or developments in supplies or inventory, including significant product defects, recalls or product returns. 
		
Significant pricing changes. 
		
Stock splits, public or private securities/debt offerings, or changes in Company dividend policies or amounts. 
		
Significant changes in senior management. 
		
Significant labor disputes or negotiations. 
		
Actual or threatened major litigation, or the resolution of such litigation. 
		
Possible proxy fights. 
		
An imminent change in the Company�s credit rating by a rating agency. 
		
Voluntary calls of debt or preferred stock of the Company. 
		
The contents of forthcoming publications that may affect the market price of Company securities. 
		
Statements by stock market analysts regarding the Company and/or its securities. 
		

B. 	�Nonpublic� Information 
Material information is �nonpublic� if it has not been widely disseminated to the public through major newswire services, national news services and financial news services. For the purposes of the Policy, information will be considered public, i.e., no longer �nonpublic,� after the close of trading on the second full trading day following the Company�s widespread public release of the information. 

C. 	Information Concerning Other Companies 
In the course of his or her association with the Company, an Insider may have access to information that is material and nonpublic in relation to other companies, including, but not limited to, customers, partners and competitors of the Company. For example, an Insider may possess nonpublic information that a major prospective customer has chosen to purchase the Company�s products over those of a competitor. Such material and nonpublic information is the property of the Company and trading, tipping or rendering trading advice relating to the securities of such other companies while aware of such material and nonpublic information could violate federal and state securities laws. In addition, inappropriate trading, tipping or trading advice by Insiders could irretrievably damage the Company�s customer or partner relationships. For these reasons, the Company prohibits Insiders from trading, tipping and rendering trading advice relating to other companies while aware of information that is material and nonpublic relating to such companies. 
	
D. 	Consult the Compliance Officer for Guidance 
Any Insider who is unsure whether the information that he or she possesses is material or nonpublic must consult the Compliance Officer for guidance before trading in any Company securities. 
	
VI. 	STATEMENT OF COMPANY POLICY AND PROCEDURES
A. 	Prohibited Activities 
1. 	No Insider may trade (buy or sell) in Company securities while aware of material nonpublic information concerning the Company. 
	
2. 	No Insider may trade in Company securities during any special trading blackout periods applicable to such Insider as designated by the Compliance Officer. 
	
3. 	No Insider may trade in Company securities outside of the applicable �trading windows� described in Section VI.B. below. 
	
4. 	No Insider may �tip� or disclose material nonpublic information concerning the Company to any outside person (including spouses, parents, children, siblings or other persons who are expected to hold such �tip� in confidence, individual investors, or members of the investment community and/or news media), unless required as part of that Insider�s regular duties for the Company and authorized by the Compliance Officer. In particular, no Insider may disclose material nonpublic information to any holder of Company securities, or to any analyst, broker, dealer, investment adviser, investment company, institutional investment manager, or anyone associated with any of these securities professionals, unless required as part of that Insider�s regular duties for the Company and authorized by the Compliance Officer.  In any instance in which such information is disclosed to outsiders, the Company will take such steps as are necessary to preserve the confidentiality of the information, including requiring the outsider to agree in writing to comply with the terms of the Policy and/or to sign a confidentiality agreement.  In the case of inadvertent disclosure to a holder of Company securities or to a securities professional who does not expressly agree to preserve the confidentiality of the information, the Company will take steps as are necessary to disseminate promptly the information to the general public. All inquiries from outsiders regarding material nonpublic information about the Company must be forwarded to the Compliance Officer. 
	
5. 	Any person who owes an Insider an express duty of trust or confidence or with whom the Insider has a history of sharing confidences, such as a spouse, parents, children and siblings, who trades on the basis of material nonpublic information the Insider may have told them, is liable for violating the insider trading rules under what is referred to as the �misappropriation� theory. As a result, Insiders should refrain from �tipping� these people to ensure that they do not trade until the information is public or no longer material. 
	
6. 	No Insider may give trading advice of any kind about the Company to anyone, whether or not such Insider is aware of material nonpublic information about the Company, except that Insiders should advise other Insiders not to trade if trading by such other Insiders might violate the law or the Policy. 
	
7. 	No Insider may trade in any interest or position relating to the future price of Company securities or the securities of the Company�s competitors, such as a put, call or short sale. 
	
8. 	No Insider may, while in possession of material nonpublic information about any other public company gained in the course of employment with the Company, (a) trade in the securities of the other public company while aware of such material nonpublic information concerning that company, (b) �tip� or disclose such material nonpublic information concerning that company to anyone, or (c) give trading advice of any kind to anyone concerning the other public company while aware of such material nonpublic information about that company. 
	
9. 	Without the specific approval of the Chief Executive Officer or the Compliance Officer, no Insider shall respond to market rumors or otherwise make any public statements regarding the Company or its prospects. This includes responding to or commenting on Internet-based bulletin boards or chat rooms. If you become aware of any rumors or false statements, you should report them to the Compliance Officer. 
	
B. 	Trading Windows and Blackout Periods 
1. 	Trading Window for Insiders.   Subject to Section VI.B.2. below and provided none of the restrictions on trading in Company securities set forth in Section VI.A. apply, Insiders may not trade in Company securities during the period beginning at the close of trading on the last full day of trading of the quarter (i.e., January 31, April 30, July 31 or October 31) and ending at the close of trading on the second full trading day following the Company�s widespread public release of quarterly or year-end earnings. 
	
2. 	No Trading During Trading Windows While Aware of Material Nonpublic Information.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section VI.B.1. above, any Insider who is aware of material nonpublic information concerning the Company may trade in Company securities during a trading window only after the close of trading on the second full trading day following the Company�s widespread public release of the material nonpublic information. 
	
3. 	No Trading During Blackout Periods.   No Insiders identified by the Compliance Officer as being subject to a special blackout period may trade in Company securities during such special blackout period. The Compliance Officer may, following consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, declare such special blackout periods from time-to-time as conditions warrant. No Insider, whether or not subject to a special black out period, may disclose to any outside third party that a special blackout period has been designated. 
	
4. 	Exceptions for Hardship Cases.   The Compliance Officer may, on a case-by-case basis, authorize trading in Company securities outside of the applicable trading windows (but not during special blackout periods) due to financial hardship or other hardships, but only in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section VI.C.1 below. 
	
C. 	Procedures for Approving Trades In Hardship Cases 
1. 	Hardship Trades. The Compliance Officer may, on a case-by-case basis, authorize trading in Company securities outside of the applicable trading windows due to financial hardship or other hardships only after: 
	
(a)	the person trading has notified the Compliance Officer in writing of the circumstances of the hardship and the amount and nature of the proposed trade(s), and 
	
(b)	the person trading has certified to the Compliance Officer in writing no earlier than two business days prior to the proposed trade(s) that he or she is not aware of material nonpublic information concerning the Company. 
	
D. 	Employee Benefit Plans.  
1.	Stock Option Plans.	The trading prohibitions and restrictions of the Policy apply to sales of securities by directors, officers and designated key employees acquired through the exercise of stock options granted by the Company, but not to the acquisition of securities through such exercises. 
	
E.	Application of Other Policies
1.	Clawback Policy.  In accordance to the Policy Regarding Repayment or Forfeiture of Certain Compensation, adopted on April 13, 2016, in the event the Board of Directors has to recoup compensation from an individual, the Board may affect the sale of securities during periods of trading restrictions.
	
2. No Pledging Policy and Anti-Hedging Policy.  In accordance to the Policy Regarding the Pledge or Lien of Company Securities and the Policy Regarding Short Term or Speculative Transactions in the Company�s Securities, both adopted on April 13. 2016, certain individuals are prohibited from engaging in certain transactions irrespective of trading windows or blackout periods.   
	
3. Stock Ownership Policy.  In accordance to the Policy Regarding Stock Ownership (�Stock Ownership Policy�), adopted on April 13, 2016, certain individuals are required to achieve and maintain a certain level of stock ownership, and is required to retain his or her required number of shares for as long as that individual is subject to the Stock Ownership Policy.
	
Any Insider who is uncertain whether the application of the policies in this section (E) are applicable to him or her should contact the Compliance Officer.  
	
F. 	Priority of Statutory or Regulatory Trading Restrictions 
The trading prohibitions and restrictions set forth in the Policy will be superseded by any greater prohibitions or restrictions under federal or state securities laws and regulations, such as short-swing trading prohibitions by Section 16 Individuals or restrictions on the sale of securities subject to Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Any Insider who is uncertain whether other prohibitions or restrictions apply should contact the Compliance Officer. 
	
G. 	Exception for Transfers Pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 Plans
(a) 	Rule 10b5-1 Plan.  Under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, persons violate the insider trading rules if they trade in a company�s securities at a time when they are aware of material nonpublic information about the company regardless of whether they used the information in making the trade. However, a person will not violate the rules if, prior to becoming aware of the information, the person entered into a binding contract for the sale or purchase of the securities, provided instructions to another person to execute the trade, or adopted a written plan for trading securities. Such contracts, irrevocable instructions and plans are commonly referred to as Rule 10b5-1 plans. Any person desiring to enter into a Rule 10b5-1 plan must enter into the plan at a time when he or she is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the company whose securities are to be traded. Once entered into, in order to be fully protected such person cannot deviate from the plan in any respect at a time he or she is aware of any material nonpublic information about that company. 
	
(b)	Procedures.  No trades shall be treated as having been made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Plan under the Policy unless: 
	
1.	The Rule 10b5-1 Plan complies with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1; 
	
2.	The Compliance Officer has approved the Rule 10b5-1 Plan, and has certified such approval in writing in advance of the first trade thereunder; and 
	
3.	The person establishing the Rule 10b5-1 Plan has certified to the Compliance Officer in writing that: 
	
(i)	Such person is not in possession of material nonpublic information concerning the Company and all such trades to be made pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 Plan will be made in accordance with the Exchange Act and the Securities Act; and 
	
(ii) The Rule 10b5-1 Plan complies with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1. 
	
No approval by the Compliance Officer shall be considered the Compliance Officer's or the Company's approval that the Rule 10b5-1 Plan satisfies the requirements of Rule 10b5-1. It shall be the sole responsibility of the person establishing the Rule 10b5-1 Plan to ensure that such plan complies with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1. 
	
The existence of the foregoing approval procedures does not in any way obligate the Compliance Officer to approve any Rule 10b5-1 Plan. The Compliance Officer may reject any trading requests or Rule 10b5-1 Plans at his or her sole reasonable discretion. 
	
H.	Confidentiality Guidelines
To provide more effective protection against the disclosure of material non-public information, the Company has adopted the Confidentiality Guidelines attached hereto as Exhibit A. Each Insider must read and be familiar with these guidelines.  These guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive and therefore, additional measures to secure the confidentiality of information should be undertaken as deemed appropriate under the circumstances.  Any Insider who is unsure as to his or her responsibilities under these guidelines must consult the Compliance Officer for guidance before acting.  
	
VII. POTENTIAL CIVIL, CRIMINAL AND DISCIPLINARY SANCTIONS 

A. 	Civil and Criminal Penalties 
The consequences of prohibited insider trading or tipping can be severe. Persons violating insider trading or tipping rules may be required to disgorge the profit made or the loss avoided by the trading, pay the loss suffered by the person who purchased securities from or sold securities to the Insider or tippee, pay civil penalties up to three times the profit made or loss avoided, pay a criminal penalty of up to $1 million, and serve a jail term of up to ten years. The Company in such circumstances may also be required to pay major civil or criminal penalties. 
	
B. 	Company Discipline 
Violation of the Policy or federal or state insider trading or tipping laws by any Insider may, in the case of a director, subject the director to dismissal proceedings and, in the case of an officer or employee, subject the officer or employee to disciplinary action by the Company up to and including termination for cause. 
	
C. 	Reporting of Violations 
	
Any Insider who violates the Policy or any federal or state law governing insider trading or tipping, or knows of any such violation by any other Insider, must report the violation immediately to the Compliance Officer. Upon determining that any such violation has occurred, the Compliance Officer, in consultation with the Company�s Chief Executive Officer and, where appropriate, the Chair of the Audit Committee of the Board, will determine whether the Company should release any material nonpublic information, and, when required by applicable law, shall cause the Company to report the violation to the SEC or other appropriate governmental authority. 
	
VIII. 	INQUIRIES 
Please direct all inquiries regarding any of the provisions or procedures of the Policy to the Compliance Officer. 
	
Receipt and Acknowledgment
Upon first receiving a copy of the Argan, Inc. Insider Trading Policy  or any revised version (the �Policy�), each Section 16 Individual and each Key Employee (as such terms are defined in the Policy), must sign and return to the Compliance Officer (as designated in the Policy) the following receipt and acknowledgement.

ARGANRain




Using natural products to help prevent hair loss is cheaper than trying to replace lost hair once it's already gone. ArganRain can be a fast way to help stop thinning hair, can help stop baldness, and help promote hair growth. Creating a healthy environment on the scalp is key to having thick, full hair growth.



















































“ I have mild to moderate adult acne with combination skin.
Upon reading about all the benefits of Argan oil for a myriad of skin
conditions, I decided to try it for my acne as well as for anti-aging purposes.
After about four weeks of using it, I realized my face had been unusually clear
for a number of days. I still get a few pimples but not as many and the ones I
do get seem to heal faster. My skin just looks better period. When i look in
the mirror I can see me and not the acne. ” 









Lucas H. Belgium




















“ I've always had long pretty hair, then I noticed in
falling out when I brushed it and especially when I shampooed. The shower drain
was FULL. It started to scare me then I found your product on Internet. I use
it exactly the way the direction say, and its now been about 5 weeks and
everything is Great! Took only 2-3 weeks to notice a difference. THANK YOU SO
MUCH! ”

                                Argan oil is best way to get rid of Stretch marks.  I ordered again and it looks like I'm going to continue. As we know Stretch Marks appear on the body in many different places for a variety of reasons. Stretch marks occur when the dermis, the middle layer of your skin, is stretched to a point where its elasticity begins to break down. At this point, microscopic bleeding occurs along with tissue inflammation which gives us the raised reddish purple look of newly formed Stretch Marks .these stretch marks are really looks too bad.

About Argan Oil 

































MOROCCO’S LIQUID GOLD
Argan Oil is frequently called liquid gold of Morrocco, is an oil produced from the kernels of the argan tree, endemic to Morocco, that is valued for its nutritive, cosmetic and numerous medicinal properties. The argan tree grows only in the south west of Morocco. The argan oil has been used for the remedy and cosmetics since the ancient ages. The argan oil is %100 natural, pure and unique. The argan tree is under the protection of UNESCO against extinction. The scientific studies have shown that there isn't any product equivalent to Argan oil.
 Benefits Of Argan Oil For Hair
Argan oil has many benefits, but one of the best ways to use it is for hair and skin care. As the production of pure argan oil is very hard process, pure argan oil for hair does not come cheap, but its effects are nothing short of spectacular. Many hair problems such as dry hair, rough hair, dull hair lacking shine and frizzy hair can be solved with the use of this wonder oil. The reason that it is so effective for repairing damaged hair and has even surpassed the other wellknown oil in popularity is because it is not only rich in vitamin E, but it also contains Omega 3 and Omega 9 unsaturated fatty acids that provides nutrition to hair. In addition to these, it also contains Linoleic and Oleic acid that helps to hydrate and moisturize hair.
 Some of the benefits of using Moroccan argan oil for hair and skin are as follows:
-    Argan oil penetrates deeply into hair follicles( hair grows in follicles) , strenghtens hair and thus help to prevent the hair loss.
-    Due to affecting the blood circulation positie way, argan oil help to keep the skin cell live
-    It helps to repair as well as prevent the occurrence of split ends  caused by several factors.
-    As argan oil contains unsaturated Omega 3 and Omega 9 fatty acids, so it is able to penetrate the hair shaft and repair damaged hair follicles.
-    It also increases shine of lackluster dry hair by locking in the moisture.
-    Unlike other hair oil, argan oil is non greasy and non oily and therefore it does not weight down hair making it limp.
-    Argan oil is ideal for taming rough, dry, frizzy and unmanageable hair.
-    It is light and almost weightless so there is less probability of build up.
-    For those who have damaged their hair with too much of hair straightening and other chemical treatments, argan oil can help in restoring the lost luster.
-    Many people with color treated hair complain of rough hair and color fading. Regular application of argan oil on color treated hair can help in keeping the color intact for a greater duration and it would also prevent any dryness.
-   
-    Argan oil is immediately absorbed by the hair and it restores the lost moisture.
-    It also acts as a shield for harmful UV rays and protects the hair from environmental pollution.
-    Because it has a high content of vitamin E, argan oil is very effective for hair growth too.
-    It nourishes hair from the root, strengthening it, thereby preventing hair loss.
-    Argan oil is very good for uncontrollable and manageable hair. It restores the smoothness of hair make them manageable again.
-    Hair stylists also consider that Argan oil may finally be right choice to heal and restore the damaged, dry and weak hair from environmental extremes,excessive styling practices and perms
 Healing And Protecting
 The active substances called triterpenoids that occur in Argan Oil offer amazing skin protection benefits. These include tissue healing (scars), anti-inflammatory, sun-protective and disinfectant properties.
 The oil contains 80% unsaturated fatty acids and is more resistant to oxidation than olive oil. Argan oil also contains 0.8% unsaponifiables (a large group of compounds also known as plant sterols or sterolins). Sterolins improve skin metabolism, reduce inflammation and promote excellent moisture retention.
 Anti-Aging
Argan is considered an effective anti-aging oil due to properties such as the high levels of vitamin E /tocopherols (anti-oxidants help neutralise free radical damage, which is important for skin exposed to polluted Western environments) and saponins (skin-softening agents). Besides cooling and soothing inflammation, it is also reputed to help reduce wrinkles by restoring the skin`s hydro-lipid layer.
 Medicinal Properties
 Argan oil contains rare plant sterols (schottenol and spinasterol), not found in other oils. It is believed that these phytosterols are unique in their combination and that there are no other vegetable oils with a comparable phytosterol composition. In general phytosterols reduce inflammation and help block cholesterol absorption from the intestines.
 Argan oil facilitates digestion by increasing the concentration of pepsin in the gastric juice. It contains flavonoids that act as a natural anti-inflammatory both internally and externally.
The oil is considered highly beneficial for arthritic or rheumatic conditions.
It is helpful for lowering cholesterol levels, stimulating circulation and strengthening the body`s natural immunity.
It is used to soothe skin ailments like chickenpox, acne, psoriasis, and dry eczema. It is also used to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy.
Traditionally Argan oil is also reputed to have aphrodisiac and tonic properties.
  As it is very hard to extract argan oil and higly demanded product, it is not generally cheap. It takes 30 kilograms of argan kernels to extract just 1 litre of oil and the argan tree where it comes from is endangered and found in very few places. another reason for the rarity of the oil.
 Rich Argan Oil Composition
 Argan Oil has gained an international reputation as nature’s anti-aging skin care product. It is rich in naturally occurring antioxidants, essential fatty acids, carotenoids, ferulic acid, sterols, polyphenols, and contains remarkably high levels of vitamin E. Argan Oil contains Squalene, a unique and rare component which is suggested to protect against skin cancer. Argan Oil amazing inventory of active ingredients provides your skin and body with the nutrients it needs to maintain its healthy radiance.
 A Comprehensive Description Of The Main Components

Essential Fatty Acids are necessary fats that humans cannot synthesize and must be obtained through diet or skin treatments such as Argan Oils™. They are building compounds the body needs to manufacture and repair cell membranes, enabling the cells to obtain optimum nutrition and expel harmful waste products. They are necessary for regulating healthy skin and premature aging. These acids perform an important role in the lipid management of the epidermis, sebum production, and are required for the formation of prostaglandin. They all have water-binding, moisturizing and antioxidant properties.


Prostaglandin is a lipid compound derived enzymatically from essential fatty acids within the cell. It serves as catalysts for a large number of processes. It helps to regulate body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, smooth muscle contraction, circulation, and immune function. Prostaglandin is a natural anti-inflammatory and acts as a controlling factor in overall cell growth and development.


Carotenoids are a class of natural fat-soluble pigments found in plants that serve to protect eyes and skin from UV radiation and free radical damage; to help maintain our immune system; to promote healthy skin and inhibit the growth of cancer cells. They have been shown to lower the risk of arthritis. The class of carotenoids detected in Argan Oil is xanthophylls. They function as an antioxidant and after absorption from food are converted to form vitamin A in the small intestine and stored in the liver. Carotenoids also protect the arteries and heart. Their antioxidant properties help inhibit the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, the “bad cholesterol”, which can lead to build up of plaque in the arteries.


Polyphenols or polyphenolic compounds are natural components of a wide variety of plants and are also known as secondary plant metabolites. These active compounds are known for their antiseptic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergenic, and anti-aging properties. They enhance immune response, enhance cell-to-cell communication, repair DNA damage caused by smoking and other toxic exposures, and assist the body to detoxify carcinogens through the activation of the body’s immune system.


Ferulic Acid is the most abundant phenolic compound found in Argan Oil. This antioxidant helps prevent damage caused by ultraviolet light. Exposure to ultraviolet light actually increases the antioxidant potency of ferulic acid. It is often added as an ingredient of anti-aging supplements. Studies have shown that ferulic acid can decrease blood glucose levels and can be of help to diabetes patients. It seems to protect against many types of caner, bone degeneration and menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes. Like many other antioxidants, ferulic acid reduces the level of cholesterol and triglyceride, thereby reducing the risk of heart disease.


Squalene is a nutrient-rich oil. It is a fat-soluble antioxidant with the unique ability to anchor itself to the body’s cell membrane. It can deactivate the free radical known as a singlet oxygen, the free radical that is generated by exposure to the sun’s UV radiation, and can also absorb and bind fat-soluble toxins, helping to excrete them from the body. Squalene is involved in the process of cell growth. It is able to penetrate deeper and more readily than most other oils. Its compatibility with skin lipids can be attributed to the fact that human sebum, the skin’s own moisturizer, is comprised of 25% squalene. It is proven to have a positive effect on mature and rosacea skin.


Sterols (Phytosterols) are a class of lipid-like compounds that helps to prevent skin aging by improving skin metabolism and reducing inflammation. They promote excellent moisture retention and penetrate quickly. They are vital to the structural integrity of the cell membrane. They work in harmony with human skin because the chemical structure of plant sterols and human sterols is very similar. In the skin, human sterols are the main component of its outermost layer and play a fundamental role in aiding and maintaining optimal skin barrier function. Two of the families of sterols found in Argan oil, schottenol and spinasterol, are known for their anticancer properties and are rarely found in vegetable oils. Additionally, sterols are known to block cholesterol absorption sites in the human intestine thus helping to reduce the overall amount absorbed in the body.


Vitamin E (Tocopherol) is a fat-soluble vitamin. It is a powerful antioxidant and excellent free-radical scavenger. Vitamin E protects essential fatty acids and vitamin A levels in the body. It accumulates in the epidermis and forms a barrier against moisture evaporation from the skin. Vitamin E prevents cellular aging due to oxidation, aids in bringing nourishment to cells, and decreases inflammation and strengthens capillary walls. It has been shown to significantly help in the reduction of scarring from wounds and the appearance of stretch marks. Vitamin E’s antioxidant properties help to prevent oxidation of LDL cholesterol, the so-called “bad cholesterol”. This may lower the risk of heart disease and stroke. Research has suggested a link between vitamin E and the prevention of certain cancers and degenerative diseases.

Testimonials






































Chloe W.  UK 

“ Great product and awesome price! Everything that was
promised in the advertisment. The shipping was very fast and had not issues. I
have purchased this same product about 5 times. ”






Hannah D.  Australia 

“ I am happy with the way it works. Thicker, fuller hair and
using with PURE ARGAN OIL I am getting great hair growth...much more than even
when I was younger. Recommend to others...Good luck to you! ”


 




Aale H. Finland 

“ It works. That's all that really needs to be said. It did
take about 4 months to see results, but the regrowth is noticeable and I will
continue to use ARGANRain products. ”






Lucy C.  USA 

“ Pure Argan oil is non-greasy,leaves skin smooth, and
absorbs immediately into the skin, I use it on my hair, face (it gives a warm
glow), neck, and body. Also, if you are worried about those stretch marks
caused by pregnancy and weight gain situations, your miracle oil can let you
get rid of those marks. I highly recommend this product. A little bit goes a
long way while applying. ”


 




Kristin K.  Italia 

“ This argan oil is organic and cold pressed. Other
companies charge three times as much. I love this oil! I am amazed at how soft
it makes my skin, and that it is not greasy at all!! I highly recommend this. I
also use a few drops to moisturize my arms and legs. Great deal for a great
product! ”






Andrew C. USA 

“ I'm African American and this product works great on my
hair. It really helps my hair grow. My family and friends are now using it. My
friend is Caucasian and says her thinning hair is becoming thicker. Be sure to
follow the directions. Good luck! ”


 




Robert H. Australia 

“ Had heard about argan oil as an ingredient in other
hair/skin products, but wanted a pure, organic oil that would not be mixed with
other additives that might not be as effective or healthy on the skin. This
company sells a certified organic version of the oil at a reasonable price.
They also delivered very quickly... the oil arrived very fast. ”






Nofa K. United Arab Emirates 

“ ARGANRain is absolutely worth the price that you pay for
it. After trying many shampoos I finally came across this. It does exactly what
I wanted it to do. Don't expect to regrow your hair over night however,
constant use is necessary. This is perfect for those that are in the initial
stages of balding, because this STOPS it while you are using the product. DO
NOT stop taking it after you see results, or you will begin losing again. ”


 




Bill D. USA 

“ Good delivery, excellent product. After using it for one
month, I actually see the new hair growth. ”






Farha B. India 

“ I like this hair product - It seems to work as advertised,
and is economical to use. ”


 




Jean Pierre N. Paris/France 

“ This stuff is awesome so far. Normal shedding for a couple
weeks and then significantly decreased shedding. Been using for 1 and 1/2
months and am impressed. Hair loss isn't bad yet, but it seems like this
product may help keep it where it is. I have a good amount of experience using
hair loss products/doing research and this seems to be a winner so far. Other
than stopping the fallout, this product also makes my hair look awesome. ”






Lucas H. Belgium 

“ I have mild to moderate adult acne with combination skin.
Upon reading about all the benefits of Argan oil for a myriad of skin
conditions, I decided to try it for my acne as well as for anti-aging purposes.
After about four weeks of using it, I realized my face had been unusually clear
for a number of days. I still get a few pimples but not as many and the ones I
do get seem to heal faster. My skin just looks better period. When i look in
the mirror I can see me and not the acne. ” 


 




John O. UK 

“ I've always had long pretty hair, then I noticed in
falling out when I brushed it and especially when I shampooed. The shower drain
was FULL. It started to scare me then I found your product on Internet. I use
it exactly the way the direction say, and its now been about 5 weeks and
everything is Great! Took only 2-3 weeks to notice a difference. THANK YOU SO
MUCH! ”






Khris C. USA 

“ My husband and I have been using this product for over a
year. It is  working great, we swear our
hair is thicker and fuller (we are in our 40's). We are using their  pure argan oil too and really like it. I
highy recomment this hair care product and pure argan oil. ”

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Shipping Weight
The Shipping Weight includes the product, protective packaging material and the actual shipping box. In addition, the Shipping Weight may be adjusted for the Dimensional Weight (e.g. length, width &amp; height) of a package. It is important to note that certain types of products (e.g. glass containers, liquids, fragile, refrigerated or ice packed) will often require protective packaging material. As such, these products will reflect a higher Shipping Weight compared to the unprotected product.

Multi-Tasking Moroccan Miracle

Weightless multi-tasking miracle combines the benefits of a moisturizer, primer, brightener, protector & treatment in one!

Glow-Renewing Benefits

100% Pure Illuminating Argan Oil, known as "liquid gold" for its rich conditioning benefits, can improve skin's brightness, tone, texture and elasticity.
This magical ingredient from Morocco transforms skin, smoothing the appearance of fine lines, brightening dull skin and renewing suppleness, helping to enhance skin's youthful looking glow without ever leaving a greasy feel or finish.
The silky texture absorbs instantly and creates an instant boost of radiance so you can apply your makeup flawlessly.






Suggested Use


Gently shake before each use. Apply two to three drops of Oil into the palm of your hand and gently massage into skin, hair and nails twice a day. Apply the Oil to face when it is damp to create a glowing, radiant look. Follow with Argan BB Cream, Bronzer and Blush. Add a drop or two of Argan Oil to your moisturizer or foundation for an exotic glam glow.






Other Ingredients

Argania spinosa (argan) kernel oil, trihydroxystearin, calcium sodium borosilicate, tin oxide, iron oxides.

Shipping Weight
The Shipping Weight includes the product, protective packaging material and the actual shipping box. In addition, the Shipping Weight may be adjusted for the Dimensional Weight (e.g. length, width &amp; height) of a package.

As such, these products will reflect a higher Shipping Weight compared to the unprotected product.

Creates brilliant shine and eliminates frizz 
Protects against damage 
For all hair types


						One of the world's rarest oils, argan oil is derived from the Argan Tree. Rich in essential fatty acids, Omega 6 and Vitamin E, it is valued for its ability to regenerate and nourish dry and damaged hair. One 'n Only Argan Oil is a premium finishing, smoothing and conditioning product. This non-greasy, alcohol-free formula instantly absorbed into the hair, creating brilliant shine without leaving an oily residue. Smooths cuticle for the silky, conditioned and healthy looking hair. This precious oil eliminates frizz and leaves hair more manageable while helping to protect against damage caused by the environment, chemicals or excessive heat from styling irons and dryers. Provides UV protection and long-term conditioning while reducing split ends and breakage. This treatment is ideal for all hair types. One 'n Only Argan Oil reduces drying time and speeds up styling time that produces consistently silky smooth results.
 
“This product is astonishingly good because it gets rid of frizzy hair and it lasts for hours. Definitely, grab this one for the colder months." - Makeup Wearables


						Apply a small amount of Argan Oil Treatment through damp hair after shampooing. Style as usual. For added protection apply a small amount to dry hair.					
					

						Styling and Finishing: Distribute a small amount of oil evenly through clean, towel-dried hair; use heat to style. Distribute a small amount through dry hair to moisturize, reduce frizz and add instant shine.
 
Smoothing and Conditioning: Smooths the hair instantly, leaving it revitalized with a healthy look and feel. Hydrates, protects, revives and detangles natural hair and human hair extensions.

Creates brilliant shine and eliminates frizz 
Protects against damage 
For all hair types


						One of the world's rarest oils, argan oil is derived from the Argan Tree. Rich in essential fatty acids, Omega 6 and Vitamin E, it is valued for its ability to regenerate and nourish dry and damaged hair. One 'n Only Argan Oil is a premium finishing, smoothing and conditioning product. This non-greasy, alcohol-free formula instantly absorbed into the hair, creating brilliant shine without leaving an oily residue. Smooths cuticle for the silky, conditioned and healthy looking hair. This precious oil eliminates frizz and leaves hair more manageable while helping to protect against damage caused by the environment, chemicals or excessive heat from styling irons and dryers. Provides UV protection and long-term conditioning while reducing split ends and breakage. This treatment is ideal for all hair types. One 'n Only Argan Oil reduces drying time and speeds up styling time that produces consistently silky smooth results.
 
“This product is astonishingly good because it gets rid of frizzy hair and it lasts for hours. Definitely, grab this one for the colder months." - Makeup Wearables


						Apply a small amount of Argan Oil Treatment through damp hair after shampooing. Style as usual. For added protection apply a small amount to dry hair.					
					

						Styling and Finishing: Distribute a small amount of oil evenly through clean, towel-dried hair; use heat to style. Distribute a small amount through dry hair to moisturize, reduce frizz and add instant shine.
 
Smoothing and Conditioning: Smooths the hair instantly, leaving it revitalized with a healthy look and feel. Hydrates, protects, revives and detangles natural hair and human hair extensions.
 
Color/Chemical Process: Prior to treatment massage a small amount of oil evenly into hair. Do not rinse. Then mix approximately 1/4 teaspoon of oil with the color, highlighting, straightening or relaxer solution and process as usual. One 'n Only Argan Oil increases absorption of product into hair for enhanced shine and depth of color.

                            Expiration Date
                        

The length of time for the expiration date or "best used before" date depends on the type of product, as well as the brand.
Perishable items (such as flax oils or certain probiotics) generally have shorter expiration dates. Although our warehouse is fully air-conditioned, these more fragile items are put in cold storage (freezer or refrigeration unit) for maximum freshness.
Our receiving department does its best to verify and then enter the correct expiration dates for all incoming products. However, discrepancies do occur from time to time. This being said, the exceptionally high turnover at iHerb ensures that our inventory is among the freshest in the industry.

Shipping Weight
The Shipping Weight includes the product, protective packaging material and the actual shipping box. In addition, the Shipping Weight may be adjusted for the Dimensional Weight (e.g. length, width &amp; height) of a package. It is important to note that certain types of products (e.g. glass containers, liquids, fragile, refrigerated or ice packed) will often require protective packaging material. As such, these products will reflect a higher Shipping Weight compared to the unprotected product.

                            Expiration Date
                        

The length of time for the expiration date or "best used before" date depends on the type of product, as well as the brand.
Perishable items (such as flax oils or certain probiotics) generally have shorter expiration dates. Although our warehouse is fully air-conditioned, these more fragile items are put in cold storage (freezer or refrigeration unit) for maximum freshness.
Our receiving department does its best to verify and then enter the correct expiration dates for all incoming products. However, discrepancies do occur from time to time. This being said, the exceptionally high turnover at iHerb ensures that our inventory is among the freshest in the industry.

Shipping Weight
The Shipping Weight includes the product, protective packaging material and the actual shipping box. In addition, the Shipping Weight may be adjusted for the Dimensional Weight (e.g. length, width &amp; height) of a package. It is important to note that certain types of products (e.g. glass containers, liquids, fragile, refrigerated or ice packed) will often require protective packaging material. As such, these products will reflect a higher Shipping Weight compared to the unprotected product.

Shipping Weight
The Shipping Weight includes the product, protective packaging material and the actual shipping box. In addition, the Shipping Weight may be adjusted for the Dimensional Weight (e.g. length, width &amp; height) of a package. It is important to note that certain types of products (e.g. glass containers, liquids, fragile, refrigerated or ice packed) will often require protective packaging material. As such, these products will reflect a higher Shipping Weight compared to the unprotected product.

Makes my lashes dark, and full without the chemicals that make them fall out.  Love this mascara!  It will smudge if you have eye cream on too heavy  but most mascaras will do that.  Love the gentleness of this one and it smells wonderful.

Great product. Lengthens well and isn't clumpy! 
Smells great and doesn't leave your eyelashes dry and brittle. Very good investment!

Shipping Weight
The Shipping Weight includes the product, protective packaging material and the actual shipping box. In addition, the Shipping Weight may be adjusted for the Dimensional Weight (e.g. length, width &amp; height) of a package. It is important to note that certain types of products (e.g. glass containers, liquids, fragile, refrigerated or ice packed) will often require protective packaging material. As such, these products will reflect a higher Shipping Weight compared to the unprotected product.

Makes my lashes dark, and full without the chemicals that make them fall out.  Love this mascara!  It will smudge if you have eye cream on too heavy  but most mascaras will do that.  Love the gentleness of this one and it smells wonderful.

Great product. Lengthens well and isn't clumpy! 
Smells great and doesn't leave your eyelashes dry and brittle. Very good investment!

Creates brilliant shine and eliminates frizz 
Protects against damage 
For all hair types


						One of the world's rarest oils, argan oil is derived from the Argan Tree. Rich in essential fatty acids, Omega 6 and Vitamin E, it is valued for its ability to regenerate and nourish dry and damaged hair. One 'n Only Argan Oil is a premium finishing, smoothing and conditioning product. This non-greasy, alcohol-free formula instantly absorbed into the hair, creating brilliant shine without leaving an oily residue. Smooths cuticle for the silky, conditioned and healthy looking hair. This precious oil eliminates frizz and leaves hair more manageable while helping to protect against damage caused by the environment, chemicals or excessive heat from styling irons and dryers. Provides UV protection and long-term conditioning while reducing split ends and breakage. This treatment is ideal for all hair types. One 'n Only Argan Oil reduces drying time and speeds up styling time that produces consistently silky smooth results.
 
“This product is astonishingly good because it gets rid of frizzy hair and it lasts for hours. Definitely, grab this one for the colder months." - Makeup Wearables


						Apply a small amount of Argan Oil Treatment through damp hair after shampooing. Style as usual. For added protection apply a small amount to dry hair.					
					

						Styling and Finishing: Distribute a small amount of oil evenly through clean, towel-dried hair; use heat to style. Distribute a small amount through dry hair to moisturize, reduce frizz and add instant shine.
 
Smoothing and Conditioning: Smooths the hair instantly, leaving it revitalized with a healthy look and feel. Hydrates, protects, revives and detangles natural hair and human hair extensions.
 
Color/Chemical Process: Prior to treatment massage a small amount of oil evenly into hair. Do not rinse. Then mix approximately 1/4 teaspoon of oil with the color, highlighting, straightening or relaxer solution and process as usual. One 'n Only Argan Oil increases absorption of product into hair for enhanced shine and depth of color.
					

						Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Fragrance (Parfum), Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Yellow 11 (CI 47000), Red 17 (CI 26100)

One 'n Only Argan Oil is a premium finishing, smoothing and conditioning product. This non-greasy, alcohol-free formula instantly absorbed into the hair, creating brilliant shine without leaving an oily residue. Smooths cuticle for the silky, conditioned and healthy looking hair. This precious oil eliminates frizz and leaves hair more manageable while helping to protect against damage caused by the environment, chemicals or excessive heat from styling irons and dryers. Provides UV protection and long-term conditioning while reducing split ends and breakage. This treatment is ideal for all hair types. One 'n Only Argan Oil reduces drying time and speeds up styling time that produces consistently silky smooth results.
 
“This product is astonishingly good because it gets rid of frizzy hair and it lasts for hours. Definitely, grab this one for the colder months." - Makeup Wearables
