We are pleased with the responsiveness and level of service Universal Fabric Structures has demonstrated to meet the needs of our growing business and we will include them on the bid list for future projects.
Bill KurtainCo-OwnerWinning Touch Tennis, Allentown, PA



This is a very unique building and it’s a tremendous upgrade for us, it’s fully insulated, there is no echo effect, and it retains heat in the winter and cool air in the summer. It’s a fantastic structure and we’re fortunate to have a building of this caliber in Mercer County.
