Effective duration can be measured differently by different analytics tools used by Nuveen or the fund sub-adviser.  The effective duration measures presented here may differ from those used by portfolio teams to manage the portfolios, or in other  presentations describing these portfolios.  Also, this effective duration measure may differ from that used by other fund sponsors, so effective durations of funds in different fund complexes may not be directly comparable.

Income from REIT investments is included in these earnings; however, REIT income is often subsequently re-characterized as a combination of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital after the end of the tax year.
