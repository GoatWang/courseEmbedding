Products – Essence

























































 










Products








Patent Pending
Technology –
“MIST”
Essence Water is proud to introduce a new revolutionary Patent Pending Technology Platform called; (“MIST”) or “Minerals in Solution Technology”.




MIST currently comprises four of the most commonly used minerals – Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium and Zinc; additional minerals are under development in order to create unique blends. Essence water is produced by method to meet applicable GMT standards for dietary supplement ingredients.






Benefits




Help Balance Your Body
- Water helps your body stay in balance.



Antioxidant
- Antioxidant power of organic Hibiscus found in every bottle.



Detoxify your system
- Water effectively flushes acidic toxins from your body.












Hydration
There are things in our daily lives that we depend upon to perform as expected. When we turn the key in the car, we expect the engine to ignite and when an emergency occurs, we expect the brakes to work in order prevent a potentially life-threatening accident







pH10
Chemists, biologists, environmentalists and lab technicians alike all use pH to measure the acidic and alkalinity potentials of a solution. A pH meter is very useful and the most accurate tool available to test pH levels.







Added Hibiscus
Sipping a healthful beverage such as ESSENCE WATER throughout the day allows you to immerse your organs in antioxidants all day long, potentially adding nutritional value to your diet. And wait, what if you add HIBISCUS, yes that large showy flower







Minerals
In addition, a patented mineral blend is added to Essence Water. This nutritional value is added by converting calcium carbonate derived from coral calcium, an organic, natural and the most equivalent mineral to the human body.







Antioxidants
Everyone would probably agree that probably the one thing that individuals value most, and which has the most effect on the many facets of our lives, is personal health.

Notes to
Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

 

NOTE 1 -
CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared by Essense
Water, Inc. (the "Company") without audit. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows at November 30, 2010, and for
all periods presented herein, have been made.

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America have been
condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed
financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Company's August 31,
2010 audited financial statements. The results of operations for
the period ended November 30, 2010 are not necessarily indicative
of the operating results for the full year.

NOTE 2 -
GOING CONCERN

The
Company's financial statements are prepared using generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of
assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of
revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to
continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate
capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If
the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be
forced to cease operations.

In order
to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other
things, additional capital resources. Management's plan is to
obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from
management and other investors sufficient to meet its minimal
operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing.
However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company
will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in
the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of
financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be
necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern.

NOTE 3 -
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The
Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date that the
financial statements were issued. There were no significant
subsequent events that need to be disclosed.

NOTE 4 -
CANCELLATION OF COMPANY'S STOCK OFFERING

On June 9,
2010, the Company received approval from the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to sell up to 8,000,000 shares of its common
stock at $0.025 per share in an effort to raise a total of $200,000
in funding. The Company was unable to raise the minimum level of
funding set forth in the stock offering and, as a result, cancelled
the offering effective November 24, 2010. 

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF
OPERATION.

FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS

This
report contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and
uncertainties. We use words such as "anticipate", "believe",
"plan", "expect", "future", "intend", and similar expressions to
identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware
that all forward- looking statements contained within this filing
are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this
report and actual results may differ materially from historical
results or our predictions of future results.

RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

We are
still in our exploration stage and have generated no revenue to
date.

We
incurred operating expenses of $3,751 for the three months ended
November 30, 2010. Our expenses during the period consisted of
$2,000 in accounting services, $1,000 for legal fees/services, $650
for state corporate filings, and $101 for miscellaneous
expenses.

Our net
loss from inception (January 29, 2009) through November 30, 2010
totals $16,778.

In May
2009, a total of 12,000,000 shares of common stock were issued in
exchange for $2,000, or $.0017 per share. These securities were
issued to Kevin Nichols, the sole officer and director of the
Company.

The
following table provides selected financial data about our Company
for the period ended November 30, 2010.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our cash
balance at November 30, 2010 was $872. In order to achieve and meet
the objectives of our business plan, we will require additional
funding.

The
Company had planned to receive sufficient funding its offering of
registered shares pursuant to a Registration Statement filed on
Form S-1 which became effective on June 9, 2010. The Company was
unsuccessful in this endeavor, failing to raise the "minimum" level
of funds called for by the offering. As a result, the offering was
cancelled by the Company on November 24, 2010.

The
Company will thus continue to utilize funds provided by our sole
officer/director, who has agreed to advance funds for operations
until such time as we receive sufficient funding from other
source(s). However we have no formal commitment, arrangement(s), or
legal obligation with him to advance or loan funds to us. As of
November 30, 2010 our officer/director has loaned and paid expenses
directly on the Company's behalf totaling $11,900. These funds are
payable upon demand and bear no interest.

As a
result of its unsuccessful offering of shares per the S-1 stock
offering, the Company will be focusing efforts to raise additional
funding by other means, such as a private placement(s) of its
shares or by another stock offering. In the meantime, it will be
relying on loans/advances by its funder, as previously discussed,
to keep it operational.

PLAN OF
OPERATION

Our plan
of operation for the 12 to 24 months consists of the following
steps/stages:

1. Seek
additional funding by means other than through the S-1 stock
offering that had been the Company's focus over the previous six
month period. The focus now will be upon private placement(s) of
its shares in return for capital, possible loan(s) from others or
another stock offering, and possibly moving forward by remaining
self-funded by the founder.

While the
Company had hoped to begin testing and formulation of its product
once it received the minimum level of funding from the S-1
offering, it will now not be able to begin any level of operations,
much beyond product formulation, until adequate outside funding is
obtained.

Management
hopes that additional funding can be successfully raised within the
next 90 day timeframe, but until such time as additional funds are
actually obtained, the Company will have little time to work on or
further other development in its business plan as the efforts of
the Company's sole officer/director will be focused on raising
additional funds.

2.
Formulation of our drink product will be of foremost importance in
the early stages of the Company's business cycle. As stated
earlier, the drink will be formulated with added ingredients with
the idea of making it better for you than plain water. We will most
likely endeavor to develop one basic formula rather than several
formulas, and then offer that formula in a few basic
flavors.

-8-

  

Efforts
in this stage will likely be started once additional funding has
been successfully raised. We expect this to be completed over the
next three months. Once additional funds have been raised, this
stage will most likely take three to six months to
complete.

3. Once
our drink formula has been somewhat developed and decided upon, we
will begin working simultaneously on several other key areas in the
furtherance of our business plan. In no particular order, these
areas of development include the following:

- develop
contacts with third-party bott

(1) The Company will reimburse its Founder from the proceeds of this offering 
    for a portion of the amount he has previously advanced/loaned to the 
    Company. As of February 29, 2012, he has advanced to the Company (and is 
    owed by the Company) a total of $26,659. 

The preceding figures set forth above represent only estimated costs. All 
proceeds will be deposited into our corporate bank account and any funds that 
we raise from our offering of 8,000,000 shares will be immediately available 
for our use and will not be returned to investors. We do not have any 
arrangements to place the funds received from our offering of shares into an 
escrow, trust, or similar account. Accordingly, if we file for bankruptcy 
protection or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy is filed by creditors 
against us, your funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and 
administered according to the bankruptcy laws. If a creditor sues us and 
obtains a judgment against us, the creditor could garnish the bank account and 
take possession of the subscriptions. If that happens, you will lose your 
investment and your funds will be used to pay creditors. 

Kevin Nichols, our sole officer/director, has been and is willing to provide 
funds needed to cover our limited operations until such time as this offering 
has been completed, including an amount sufficient to cover the existing 
shortfall between cash on hand and the accrued liabilities (payables) of 
approximately $2,625 showing on our February 29, 2012 financial statements. Mr.
Nichols has agreed that any funds advanced by him will be non-interest bearing 
and payable upon demand. A portion of the Company's liability to Mr. Nichols 
for these funds advanced by him will be repaid from the proceeds of this 
Offering in an amount up to $20,000. See also Note (1) above.


The beverage industry is extremely competitive. The principal areas of 
competition include pricing, packaging, development of new products and 
flavors, and marketing campaigns. The Company's product will be competing 
directly with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of 
manufacturers. Most of these brands have enjoyed broad, well-established 
national recognition for years, through well-funded ad and other marketing 
campaigns. In addition, the companies manufacturing these products generally 
have far greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources than the 
Company will. 

Important factors that will affect our ability to compete successfully include 
taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, the development of
a new, unique cutting edge product, attractive and different packaging, branded
product advertising, and pricing. Each of these factors will be taken into 
consideration as we proceed with our business plan. 

The Company will also be competing to secure distributors who will agree to 
market our product over those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable 
distribution, and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. The extremely 
competitive pressures within the New Age/Functional beverage categories could 
even cause our products to never even be introduced beyond what the Company 
can market locally themselves. 

We believe we will be able to develop and introduce an innovative beverage 
recipe and packaging whose use of premium natural ingredients will provide us 
with a competitive advantage and be keys to our success. 

Our beverage product will compete generally with all liquid refreshments, 
including bottled water and, in particular, with numerous other New Age/
Functional beverages, including: SoBe, Snapple, Arizona, Vitamin Water, 
Gatorade, and Powerade.


Company Description
We are a development-stage company that intends to develop, market, and 
distribute a consumer water-based beverage. This beverage will most likely 
include ingredients that may provide additional benefit to the user beyond 
those derived from just water. The Company's beverages will be targeted to


 the 
growing category of functional beverage consumers who may be looking to get 
more from their bottled beverage than just plain water. 

Essense Water, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on January 29, 2009. We intend 
to use the net proceeds from this offering to further develop our business 
operations. Being a development stage company, we have yet to produce any 
operating revenue and have limited operating history. 

From inception until the date of this filing, we have had limited operating 
activities. Our financial statements from inception (January 29, 2009) through 
February 29, 2012, report no revenues and a net loss of $29,284. Our 
independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion for the 
Company, which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our 
ability to continue as a "going concern." 

We had previously offered our shares for sale by way of a similar Form S-1 
Offering (which became effective June 9, 2010) and concurrently became a 
reporting issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We 
believe that our doing so provides us with greater access to capital, that we 
will become better known, and be better able to obtain financing in the future.

In its previous S-1 Offering, the Company was unsuccessful in raising its 
"minimum" amount of funding as set forth within the Prospectus and, as a 
result, decided to cancel the offering. The minimum amount of funding in that 
offering was set at $20,000, while the maximum offering amount was $200,000. 

The Company expects that its revenues will come from the sale of its water- 
based beverage(s) and we anticipate that our operations will begin to generate 
revenue approximately 6 to 12 months following the date of this Prospectus. 
There is no guarantee that we will ever generate revenues and we have been 
surviving solely by cash advances that have been provided as needed by our 
Founder, Kevin Nichols. There is and has been no agreement in place for him to 
continue providing this funding. 

We are a development stage company with only limited operations to date. Any 
investment in the shares offered herein involves a high degree of risk. You 
should only purchase shares if you can afford a loss of your entire investment.
Our independent registered public accountants have issued an audit opinion 
which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to 
continue as a "going concern." Since there is no minimum amount of shares that 
must be sold by the Company, it is possible that we may receive no proceeds or 
only very minimal proceeds from the offering and potential investors may end up
holding shares in a Company that: 

- has not received enough proceeds from the Offering to begin operations; and 

- has no market for its shares. 

There has been no market for our securities and a public market may never 
develop. Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or quoted on the over-
the-counter market. After the effective date of this registration statement 
relating to this Prospectus, the Company hopes to have a market maker file an 
application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") for our 
common stock to be eligible for trading on the Over-the- Counter Bulletin 
Board.

The Company has no plan, agreement, arrangement, or understanding to engage in 
a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or other 
entity or person.
