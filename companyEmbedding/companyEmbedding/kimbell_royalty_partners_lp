Kimbell Royalty Partners, LP | About | Kimbell Royalty Partners










































ABOUT US
With a simple handshake agreement in 1998, a small group of Fort Worth based investors laid the groundwork for what is now Kimbell Royalty Partners, LP.

With a business plan founded on ethics and investment discipline, Kimbell Royalty Partners has grown from a single investment in the Permian Basin to one of the largest owners of minerals, royalties and overriding royalty interests nationwide.  Since 1998, we have acquired interests in approximately 48,000 wells covering 4.5mm acres in 20 states.  We are now publicly traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol KRP.
The company’s investment philosophy is simple: to acquire premier quality, long-life, shallow decline oil and gas minerals. Integrity guides our approach. We offer fair evaluations for high quality properties, ensuring the best outcome for both parties. We have earned a reputation in the industry for honesty and transparency by sticking to our word and developing and cultivating invaluable relationships. For these reasons and more, we are a trusted leader in the field of oil and gas mineral ownership.
