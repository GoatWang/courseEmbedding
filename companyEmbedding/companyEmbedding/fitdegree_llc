Copyright Policy
fitDEGREE respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of the Service to

applicable law (including the Digital Millennium Copyright or “DMCA” at 17 U.S.C. §512) and are
properly provided to us. If you believe that your Content has been copied in a way that
constitutes copyright infringement, please review the DMCA to ensure your compliance before
you send us any request to remove allegedly-infringing Content (“Takedown Notice”). Each
Takedown Notice must be in English and include the following information: 

Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed
Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of
infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled.
Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (e.g., a detailed
uniform resource locator or “URL”).
Your contact information, including your postal address, telephone number, and an
email address.
A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the Content or other
material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its
agent, or the law.
A statement that the information in the notice is accurate, and, under penalty of
perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to
act on their behalf. 
On our receipt of a Takedown Notice, we may publish the Takedown Notice, or provide a copy
of the Takedown Notice to the user that uploaded or provided the Content. For any Takedown
Notice that is subject to the provisions of the DMCA, the original provider of the Content may
have the right to send a notice to us (“Counter Notice”) demanding that the Content be restored
to the Service. 
In compliance with the DMCA or other applicable law, we may implement any Takedown Notice
by removing the accused Content or other material from public view on the Service, and we may
implement any Counter Notice by restoring the accused Content or other material to public view
on the Service.
Regardless of the DMCA or other applicable laws or regulations, we reserve the right to remove
Content alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to 
you or anyone else. In appropriate circumstances, fitDEGREE will also terminate a user’s
account if we determine the user to be a repeat infringer. Our designated copyright agent for
notice of alleged copyright infringement appearing on the Service is:

Governing Law and Arbitration
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the law of the State of New
Jersey, and the federal laws of the United States of America, without regard to or application of
any conflict of laws provisions or principles. Any dispute between us or arising out of these
Terms, their performance, or the Service shall be determined by one arbitrator in binding
arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its
Commercial Arbitration Rules. The language of the arbitration shall be English.
To accommodate parties and witnesses that may be distant from each other, each hearing shall
be conducted and all testimony shall be entered by audio conference or video conference. The
award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties, and may be entered and
enforced in any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction.

Proceedings will be conducted on an individual basis. Neither you, your Club, nor fitDEGREE may seek to
have a dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other
proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No
arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another proceeding without the prior written
consent of all parties to the arbitration or proceeding. If this class action waiver is found to be
illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, those parts will be severed and will
be administered by the AAA pursuant to its Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations, with the
remaining parts proceeding in individual arbitration.



General

Severability:
								If any provision of these Terms is found by an arbitrator or court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, the provision will be modified so as to render it
enforceable and effective to the maximum extent possible in order to effect the intention of the
parties with respect to the provisions within the context of the overall Terms. If a court or
arbitrator finds the modified provision invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected.

								You may contact us via email at support@fitdegree.com. Or via postal mail or

Entire Agreement:
								These Terms, together with the applicable Club Agreement and the Privacy Policy, which are incorporated
herein by this reference as if set forth herein in its entirety, constitute the entire, complete and
exclusive agreement between you and us regarding the Service, and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, or whether established by custom,
practice, policy or precedent, with respect to the subject matter of these Terms and the Privacy 
Policy.
							

Amendments to these Terms:
								We reserve the right to modify, supplement or replace
these Terms, effective upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to the email
address we have for you. If we have no email address for you, then the modified Terms will
take effect thirty (30) days after we post them on our website at www.fitdegree.com or our
mobile application. Your use of the Service thirty days after any such update or modification
shall confirm your agreement to the modified version of the Terms. If you do not want to
agree to changes to the Terms, you may terminate your account with us, or otherwise
terminate your use of the Service, prior to the modified Terms taking effect, in which case
the prior set of Terms in effect as of the date of termination shall continue to control any
disputes or other issues that may arise regarding your use of the Service. Only
modifications, supplements or replacements of these Terms as stated in this provision shall
be valid and effective to amend the Terms. Any other purported amendments shall be void
and of no force or effect.
							

No Informal Waivers, Agreements or Representations:
								Any failure by any party to act with respect to a
breach of these Terms by you or others does not waive any right to act with respect to that
breach or any subsequent breaches. Except as expressly and specifically
contemplated by the Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers or other acts or
omissions by any part fitDEGREE or its Affiliates shall be deemed legally binding on
the other party or its Affiliates, unless expressly and specifically documented in a
writing that refers to the Terms and states expressly the intent to modify or supplement the
Terms, and that an authorized officer of fitDEGREE has executed physically or electronically. 
							
Assignment and Delegation:
								You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under
the Terms. Any purported assignment and delegation by you shall be ineffective. We may freely
assign or delegate some or all of our rights and obligations under the Terms, Club Agreement and Privacy Policy,

Portions of the Service we currently offer may change from time to time as technology evolves.

Each person who uses the Service is referred to as a “user” or “you” or “your”. If you register 

with us, we will refer to you as a “registered user”.
This document is our statement of our privacy practices (“Privacy Policy”). Among other things,

it explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect 

personally-identifiable information (“Personal Information”) in relation to our Service, and your 

choices about the collection and use of your Personal Information.
By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to

creating Events (as defined below), comments and discussions between users, and other

Information We Collect
Information you provide us directly


Registration information

When you create or reconfigure an account, you provide us with Personal

Information, such as your name, birthday, password and email address. Some of 

this information, for example, your name, may be listed publicly on our Service, 

including on your profile page and in search results (if applicable). We will not 

share your email address or password.
In order to register, you will be asked to set up a new account with your first

name (last name optional), email address, password, gender and birthday.


Profile information

You may further provide us with additional optional profile information to make

public, such as your last name, a short description of yourself, your location

and/or a picture. You may also provide information to customize your account, 

such as a cell phone number for the delivery of short message system (“SMS”) or 

text messages. We may use your contact information to send you information 

about our Service or to market to you.
Although you are not required to provide us with a location, the Service may not

function properly without providing us with a location. You may, however, still be 

able to use the app to find where other users are located by searching via 

Network(s) (as defined below). You may use your account settings to customize 

notifications from fitDEGREE, but in order to turn off notifications entirely, you will 

need to do so through your mobile device’s settings menu, as fitDEGREE does 

not currently provide an option to opt out of notifications. If you email us, we may 

keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your 

request. Providing the additional information described in this paragraph is 

entirely optional.
Your fitDEGREE profile is automatically made public when you sign up for the

Service. However, the only information made available to other fitDEGREE

users are your first name, age, profile photo (if you uploaded one). and the 

description of yourself in your user profile (if you included a description).



Social Media Information: You may provide us with your information from your

Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or other social media account (“Social Media”) in order 

to enable you to send posts and direct messages via these Social Media accounts to 

notify your networks of your use of fitDEGREE. If you elect to provide us with your 

Social Media accounts, you authorize us to access certain Social Media account 

information, including your handle, user name and geo-location. By allowing us to 

access your Social Media accounts, you understand that we will obtain and share 

your user name and a profile picture from each account with other users. All data 

shared with or processed via Social Media is subject to each Social Media provider’s 

privacy policy.


Location Information: You may tell us your location (but you are not required to do

so) when you set your location settings via the fitDEGREE application by providing 

us with a general locale (e.g., New York City), or enable your computer or mobile 

device to send us specific location information (i.e., via a global positioning system 

(“GPS”)). We may use and store information about your location to provide features 

of our Service, to determine the appropriate content to show you, and to improve and 

customize the Service.


Communications between you and other fitDEGREE users: The fitDEGREE

mobile app allows you to communicate directly with other fitDEGREE users through 

the mobile app. Copies of communications between users will stored on 

fitDEGREE’s servers and displayed on user’s phones. You may delete 

communications between individual users and group communications.


Communications between you and fitDEGREE: We may send you Service-related

emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, 

technical and security notices), and we may collect and store these communications. 

Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails from us.


Event Creation:You may create events with main activities (e.g., weights, cardio,

group fitness class) and sub-activities (e.g., weights: chest) for other fitDEGREE 

users to view and join (“Event(s)”). Each Event contains additional information such 

as the specific network for which you are creating the Event (e.g., by school or 

specific gym location) (“Network(s)”), as well as desired partner qualities, such as 

experience level and gender. We will display any Event publicly on the Service. 

When you create a new Event, that information will be stored on fitDEGREE servers 

then made available for users to view on the app.


Information we gather from your use of our Service


Analytics: We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage

trends and other Non-Personal Information for the Service (e.g. date and time when 

you log in and log out of the app). These tools collect information sent by your device 

or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that 

assists us in improving the Service. We collect and combine this analytics 

information with analytics information from other users so that it cannot be used to 

identify any particular individual user.


Metadata: Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with other data,

including Content. For example, metadata can describe how, when and by whom a 

piece of Content was collected and how that Content is formatted. We may store 

metadata to provide you with particular services.


Links: fitDEGREE may keep track of how you interact with links across our Service,

including our email notifications and third-party services by redirecting clicks or 

through other means. We do this to help improve our Service, to provide more 

relevant local data, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how 

many times a particular link was clicked on.


Device Identifiers: For each device you use to access our Service (e.g., laptop

computer, mobile phone, tablet), we may access, collect, monitor, store on your 

device, or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small 

data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your device, which 

uniquely identify your device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection 

with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating 

system or other software, or data sent to the device by fitDEGREE. In the alternative, 

a device identifier may be a serial number or other identification associated with a 

particular type of device or part that is unique to your device (e.g., a “media access 

control” number or “MAC”) that we store to identify and differentiate different devices.

A device identifier may be used to deliver information to us or to a third-party partner 

about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide 

reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not 

function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.


Log Data: Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your

use of the Service. Log Data may include information such as your Internet Protocol 

(“IP”) address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages 

visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and 

cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Service, for 

example, when you visit our website, sign into our Service or interact with our email 

notifications. fitDEGREE uses Log Data to provide our Service and to measure, 

customize, and improve the Service.





How We Store Your Information

We provide the Service from within the United States, and we store all Personal

Information that we currently collect and retain on servers inside the United States. In 

the future, we may store Personal Information on servers located outside the United 

States.
Privacy laws outside of the United States may be more stringent than the privacy laws

within the United States that apply to fitDEGREE. By providing fitDEGREE with your 

Personal Information, you consent to the storage and processing of your personal 

information in the United States as further stated in the current version of this Privacy 

Policy.
Certain types of Content you submit to us might reveal your gender, ethnic origin,

nationality, age, religion, sexual orientation, or other Personal Information about you or 

others.
By using our Service, or by submitting your Personal Information to us, you consent to

the collection, storage, processing and onward transfer of your Personal Information as 

stated in the current version of this Privacy Policy and the current version of the Terms

of Use (“Terms”).




How We Use Your Information
We only share your Personal Information in the following limited circumstances:


With Your Consent: We will share Personal Information with companies, organizations

or individuals outside of fitDEGREE when we have your consent to do so.


Affiliates of fitDEGREE: We may share your Personal Information with our fitDEGREE

affiliates (meaning entities controlled by, controlling or under common control with 

fitDEGREE) as necessary to provide the Service.


Cookies: Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our

systems to recognize your device and to provide features and personalized 

advertisements. Where you access the Service via a browser, the Help feature on most 

browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to 

have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies 

altogether.


Advertisers: fitDEGREE currently permits advertising through our Service. To the

extent we display advertising on fitDEGREE, we may allow advertisers and advertising 

networks to collect information about your mobile device (including mobile device IDs), 

activities, and geographic location to enable them to display targeted ads to you. We will

not provide any personally identifiable information (such as your name or email address) 

to advertisers. Some advertisers may contact users outside of the fitDEGREE mobile 

app.


Service Providers: We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate

our Service (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, marketing and development). These 

third parties may have limited access to your information only to perform these tasks on 

our behalf and are obligated to fitDEGREE not to disclose or use it for other purposes.


Required by Law: We may access, preserve and share your Personal Information in

response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena). We may 

also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is 

necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect 

ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or 

imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed 

and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or 

obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of 

our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.


Change of Control: If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of fitDEGREE or

our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, 

acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your Personal Information such as user 

name and email address, Content and any other information collected through the 

Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your 

Content, but the license you granted in the Terms may be transferred to others.


Non-Personal Information: We may share aggregated information that is not

personally-identifiable information (“Non-Personal Information”) publicly and with 

publishers, marketers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share Non-
Personal Information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. Non-
Personal Information includes collective information about multiple users that does not 

reflect or reference an individually-identifiable user.


Other: In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy

Policy above, we may use your Personal Information that we receive to:

help you efficiently access your information after you sign in.

time you visit the Service.

could include online ads or other forms of marketing.
provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service.
