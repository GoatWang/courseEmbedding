Introduction[edit]
Oil and gas in Province 045 are produced from carbonate and clastic rock reservoirs ranging in age from the Ordovician to the Permian. The 1995 USGS Assessment of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas identified six conventional plays in Province 045, which are listed below in Table 1:[1] One continuous unconventional play, hypothetical "Mississippian Barnett Shale" (4503), was also considered. The cumulative mean of undiscovered resource for conventional plays was: 381 million barrels (60.6×10^6 m3) of oil, 103.6 million barrels (16.47×10^6 m3) of natural gas liquids, 479 billion cubic feet (13.6×10^9 m3) associated gas, and 1,029 billion cubic feet (29.1×10^9 m3) non-associated gas.

Notes:
1. Assessment unit number also indicates time span of stratigraphic units.
The USGS assessment of undiscovered conventional oil and gas and undiscovered continuous (unconventional) gas within Province 045 resulted in estimated means of 26.7 trillion cubic feet (760×10^9 m3) (Tcf) of undiscovered natural gas, 98.5 million barrels (15.66×10^6 m3) of undiscovered oil, and a mean of 1.1 billion barrels (170×10^6 m3) of undiscovered natural gas liquids. Nearly all of the undiscovered gas resource (98%, 2.62 × 1013 cu ft or 7.4 × 1011 m3) is considered to be in continuous accumulations of nonassociated gas trapped in strata of two of the three Mississippian-age Barnett Shale Assessment Units (AUs) - the Greater Newark East Frac-Barrier Continuous Barnett Shale Gas AU and the Extended Continuous Barnett Shale Gas AU (2.62 × 1013 cu ft combined). The remaining 467 billion cubic feet (13.2×10^9 m3) of undiscovered gas resource in the Province is in conventional nonassociated gas accumulations (3.586 × 1011 cu ft or 1.015 × 1010 m3) and associated/dissolved gas in conventional oil accumulations (1.084 × 1011 cu ft or 3.07 × 109 m3). The Barnett-Paleozoic TPS is estimated to contain a mean of 409.2 billion cubic feet (11.59×10^9 m3) of conventional gas, or about 88% of all undiscovered conventional gas, and about 64.6 million barrels (10.27×10^6 m3) of conventional oil, or about 65% of all undiscovered oil in Province 045.
Continuous-type accumulations include fractured shale and fractured chalk oil and gas, basin-centered gas, coal bed gas, and tight reservoir gas. They typically cover large areas, have source rocks in close association with these unconventional reservoir rocks, and are mostly gas (and in some cases oil) charged throughout their extent.[2] Continuous accumulations commonly have transition zones that grade into more conventional accumulations.[3]
Boundary[edit]




Vertical quartzite and slate strata along the eastern flank of the Ouachitas


The Fort Worth Basin and Bend Arch lie entirely within north central Texas covering an area of 54,000 square miles (140,000 km2). The southern and eastern boundaries are defined by county lines that generally follow the Ouachita structural front, although a substantial portion of this structural feature is included near Dallas. The north boundary follows the Texas-Oklahoma State line in the east, where the province includes parts of the Sherman Basin and Muenster Arch. In the west, the north boundary follows the north-east county lines of Oklahoma's three southwestern counties (Harmon, Jackson and Tillman Counties), which include the south flank of the Wichita Mountains and the Hollis Basin. The western boundary trends north-south along county lines defining the junction with the Permian Basin where part of the eastern shelf of the Permian Basin lies in Province 045.
Structural elements[edit]
Major structural features include the Muenster and Red River Arches to the north, and the Bend and Lampasas Arches along the central part of Province 045. Along the east portion is an area that includes the Eastern Shelf and Concho Arch, collectively known as the Concho Platform. The Mineral Wells fault runs northeast-southwest through Palo Pinto, Parker, Wise, Denton Counties and joins with the Newark East fault system. The fault system bisects the Newark East Field (NE-F) creating a zone of poor production in Barnett Shale gas reservoirs. Several faults that cut basement and lower Paleozoic rocks in the southern part of the province are identified at the Ordovician Ellenburger Group stratigraphic level. These faults and associated structures formed during development of the Llano Uplift and Fort Worth Basin with faulting ending by the early Missourian.[4]
Tectonic history[edit]
Fort Worth Basin[edit]
Evolution of the Fort Worth Basin and Bend Arch structures are critical to understanding burial histories and hydrocarbon generation. The asymmetrical, wedge-shaped Fort Worth Basin is a peripheral Paleozoic foreland basin with about 12,000 feet (3,700 m) of strata preserved in its deepest northeast portion and adjacent to the Muenster Arch and Ouachita structural belt. The basin resembles other basins of the Ouachita structural belt, such as the Black Warrior, Arkoma, Val Verde, and Marfa Basins that formed in front of the advancing Ouachita structural belt as it was thrust onto the margin of North America. Thrusting occurred during a late Paleozoic episode of plate convergence.[4]
Bend Arch[edit]
The Bend Arch extends north from the Llano Uplift. It is a broad subsurface, north-plunging, positive structure. The arch formed as a hingeline by down-warping of its eastern flank due to subsidence of the Fort Worth Basin during early stages of development of the Ouachita structural belt in the Late Mississippian and west tilting in the late Paleozoic which formed the Midland Basin. There is disagreement on the structural history of the Bend Arch. Flippen (1982) suggested it acted as a fulcrum and is a flexure and structural high and that only minor uplift occurred in the area to form an erosional surface on the Chester-age limestones that were deposited directly on top of the Barnett. In contrast, Cloud and Barnes (1942) suggested periodic upwarp of the Bend flexure from mid-Ordovician through Early Pennsylvanian time resulted in several unconformities. The Red River Arch and the Muenster Arch also became dominant structural features during the Late Mississippian and Early Pennsylvanian.[4]
General stratigraphy[edit]
Hydrocarbon production from Ordovician, Mississippian, and Early Pennsylvanian rocks is mostly from carbonate rock reservoirs, whereas production in the Mid-Pennsylvanian through Low-Permian is mostly from clastic rock reservoirs. The sedimentary section in the Fort Worth Basin is underlain by Precambrian granite and diorite. Cambrian rocks include granite conglomerate, sandstones, and shale that are overlain by marine carbonate rocks and shale. No production has been reported from Cambrian rocks. The Silurian, Devonian, Jurassic, and Triassic are absent in the Fort Worth Basin.[4]
From Cambrian to Mississippian time, the Fort Worth Basin area was part of a stable cratonic shelf with deposition dominated by carbonates. Ellenburger Group carbonate rocks represent a broad epeiric carbonate platform covering most of Texas during the Early Ordovician. A pronounced drop in sea level sometime between Late Ordovician and Mississippian time resulted in prolonged platform exposure. This erosional event removed any Silurian and Devonian rocks (post Viola Limestone unconformity) that may have been present.[5] Barnett Shale was deposited over the resulting unconformity. Provenance of the terrigenous material that constitutes the Barnett Shale was from Ouachita thrust sheets and the reactivation of older structures such as the Muenster Arch. Post-Barnett deposition continued without interruption as a sequenced of extremely hard and dense limestones were laid down. These limestones have often been confused with the lower part of the overlying Marble Falls Formation, and they have never been formally named in the literature. Since the underlying Barnett is generally assumed to be Late Mississippian Chester in age, the superposed carbonates are often referred to informally as "the Chester Limestones."
Clastic rocks of provenance similar to the Barnett dominate the Pennsylvanian part of the stratigraphic section in the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin. With progressive subsidence of the basin during the Pennsylvanian, the western basin hinge line and carbonate shelf, continued migrating west. Deposition of thick basinal clastic rocks of the Atoka, Strawn, and Canyon Formations occurred at this time.[6] These Mid- and Late Pennsylvanian rocks consist mostly of sandstones and conglomerates with fewer and thinner limestone beds.
Petroleum production history[edit]
Hydrocarbon shows were first encountered in Province 045 during the mid-nineteenth century while drilling water wells. Sporadic exploration began following the Civil War, and the first commercial oil discoveries occurred in the early 1900s.[1] In 1917, discovery of Ranger field stimulated one of the largest exploration and development "booms" in Texas. Ranger field produces from the Atoka-Bend formation, a sandstone-conglomerate reservoir that directly overlies the Barnett formation. Operators drilled more than 1,000 wildcats in and around the Fort Worth basin attempting to duplicate the success of Ranger. These wildcat efforts resulted in the discovery of more fields and production from numerous other reservoirs including Strawn fluvial/deltaic sandstone, Atoka-Bend fluvial/deltaic sandstone and conglomerate, Marble Falls carbonate bank limestone, Barnett siliceous shale, and Ellenburger dolomitic limestone. By 1960, the Province reached a mature stage of exploration and development, as demonstrated by the high density and distribution of well penetrations and production wells. Oil and lesser amounts of gas are found throughout the Paleozoic section, but most hydrocarbons consist of oil in Pennsylvanian reservoirs.
Province 045 is among the more active drilling areas during the resurgence of U.S. drilling, which began after the OPEC oil embargo. It has consistently appeared on the list of the 10 most active provinces in terms of wells completed and footage drilled. 9,177 oil wells and 4,520 gas wells were drilled and completed in this area from 1974 to 1980.
Cumulative production in Province 045 from conventional reservoirs prior to the 1995 USGS Assessment was 2 billion barrels (320×10^6 m3) of oil, 7.8 trillion cubic feet (220×10^9 m3) of gas, and 500 million barrels (79×10^6 m3) of natural gas liquids. Cumulative gas production through 2001 from the continuous Barnett fractured shale play in Wise and Denton counties was about 440 billion cubic feet (12×10^9 m3). Cumulative gas production from the Barnett Shale for the first half of 2002 was 94 billion cubic feet (2.7×10^9 m3);[7] annual production for 2002 was estimated at 200 billion cubic feet (5.7×10^9 m3). Currently, over 2.5 trillion cubic feet (71×10^9 m3) of proven gas reserves are assessed for NE-F. These production and proven reserve figures for the Barnett play, combined with estimates of underdeveloped Barnett resources indicate that technically recoverable continuous gas, and to a lesser extent oil, from fractured Barnett Shale will provide the greatest additions to near-future reserves in Province 045.

Source rock[edit]
The primary source rock of the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin is Mississippian Chester-age Barnett Shale. The Barnett commonly exhibits high gamma-ray log response at the base of the unit. Other potential source rocks of secondary importance are Early Pennsylvanian and include dark fine-grained carbonate rock and shale units within the Marble Falls Limestone and the black shale facies of the Smithwick/Atoka Shale.[8] The Barnett Shale was deposited over much of North-Central Texas; however, because of post-depositional erosion, the present distribution of Barnett is limited to Province 045.[9] The Barnett Shale is over 1,000 feet (300 m) thick along the southwest flank of the Muenster Arch.[10] It is eroded in areas along the Red River-Electra and Muenster Arches to the north, the Llano uplift to the south where it outcrops, and the easternmost portion of the province where the Barnett laps onto the Eastern Shelf-Concho Platform.
Average total organic carbon (TOC) content in the Barnett Shale is about 4% and TOC is as high as 12% in samples from outcrops along the Llano uplift on the south flank of the Fort Worth Basin.[11] It has geochemical characteristics similar to other Devonian-Mississippian black shales found elsewhere in the US (e.g., Woodford, Bakken, New Albany, and Chattanooga Formations). These black shales all contain oil-prone organic matter (Type II kerogen) based on hydrogen indices above 350 milligrams of hydrocarbons per gram of TOC and generate a similar type of high quality oil (low sulfur, >30 API gravity). Although kerogen cracking decomposition is a source of oil and gas from the Barnett Shale, the principal source of gas in the Newark East Field is from cracking of oil and bitumen.[12]
Thermal maturity[edit]
Low maturation levels in the Barnett Shale at vitrinite reflectance (Ro), estimated at 0.6-0.7%, yield oils of 38° API gravity in Brown County. Oils found in Shackelford, Throckmorton, and Callahan Counties as well, as in Montague County, are derived from Barnett Shale at the middle of the zone of oil generation (oil window) thermal maturities levels (≈0.9% Ro). Although condensate is associated with gas production in Wise County, Barnett source rock maturity is generally 1.1% Ro or greater. The zone of wet gas generation is in the 1.1-1.4% Ro range, whereas the primary zone of dry gas generation (main gas window) begins at a Ro of 1.4%.
Thermal maturity of Barnett Shale can also be derived from TOC and Rock-Eval (Tmax) measurements. Although Tmax is not very reliable for high maturity kerogens due to poor pyrolysis peak yields and peak shape, the extent of kerogen transformation can be utilized. For example, Barnett Shale having a 4.5% TOC and a hydrogen index of less than 100 is in the wet or dry gas windows with equivalent Ro values greater than 1.1% TOC. In contrast, low maturity Barnett Shale from Lampasas County outcrops have initial TOC values averaging about 12% with hydrocarbon potentials averaging 9.85% by volume. A good average value for Barnett Shale is derived from the Mitcham #1 well in Brown County where TOC is 4.2% and hydrocarbon potential is 3.37% by volume. Using these data we can determine TOC values will decrease 36% during maturation from the immature stage to the gas-generation window. Samples from the T. P. Simms well in the Newark East gas-producing area have average TOC values of 4.5%, but greater than 90% of the organic matter is converted to hydrocarbons. Thus, its original TOC was about 7.0% with an initial estimated potential of 5.64% by volume. Any oil generated would be expelled into shallow (or deeper) horizons as in the west and north, or cracked to gas where measured vitrinite reflectance is above 1.1% Ro.
Hydrocarbon generation[edit]
The Barnett Shale is thermally mature for hydrocarbon generation over most of its area. Barnett source rock is presently in the oil-generation window along the north and west parts of the province, and in the gas window on the east half of the Barnett-Paleozoic TPS. Expulsion of high-quality oil from the Barnett was episodic and began at low (Ro = 0.6%) thermal maturity. Thirty-two oils from Wise and Jack Counties were analyzed to determine the characteristics of the generating source rock. API gravity and sulfur content were integrated with high-resolution gas chromatography (GC) and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analyses. The API gravity of the oils ranges from 35° to 62° and sulfur contents are low (<0.2%), which is characteristic of high thermal maturity oils. Biomarkers from GCMS analyses show oils were sourced from marine shale, based on sterane distribution and the presence of diasteranes. Carbon isotopic analyses of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions support hydrocarbon generation from a single-source unit. In the main gas-producing area of fractured Barnett Shale, the gas generation window is along a trend sub-parallel to the Ouachita thrust front. Jarvie (2001) reported the British Thermal Unit (BTU) content of Barnett gas is directly proportional to Ro levels.
Reservoir rocks[edit]
Reservoir rocks include clastic and carbonate rocks ranging in age from Ordovician to Early Permian. Most production from conventional reservoirs is from Pennsylvanian rocks, whereas the only recognized production from unconventional accumulations is from Mississippian fractured Barnett Shale and early Pennsylvanian (Atokan?) fractured Marble Falls Limestone. Conglomerate of the Pennsylvanian Bend Group is the main producing reservoir in the Boonsville Bend Field with cumulative production through 2001 exceeding 3 trillion cubic feet (85×10^9 m3) of gas. Oil sourced from Barnett Shale is produced from numerous reservoir rocks in the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin, including Barnett Shale, Caddo Formation, Canyon Group, Chappel Limestone, Bend Group, and Ellenburger Group.
Seal rocks[edit]
Seal rocks in the Barnett-Paleozoic TPS are mostly shale units and dense, low permeability carbonate rock that are distributed on both regional and local scales. Barnett Shale is a major regional seal for older reservoirs, mostly porous carbonate rock reservoirs of the Ellenburger Group. Production from Barnett Shale is largely dependent on the presence or absence of Marble Falls and Viola limestones. Although these formations are not considered seal rocks in areas where they are tight and not water wet, they serve as barriers confining hydraulic-induced fracturing (frac barriers) and help retain formation pressures during well stimulation.[13]
Traps[edit]
Traps for conventional hydrcocarbon accumulations are mostly stratigraphic for carbonate rock reservoirs and both structural and stratigraphic in clastic-rock reservoirs. Combination structural and stratigraphic traps are also common in Pennsylvanian sandstone reservoirs. Stratigraphic traps in carbonate rocks result from a combination of facies and depositional topography, erosion, updip pinchout of facies, and diagenetically controlled enhanced-permeability and porosity zones. A good example of a carbonate stratigraphic trap is the pinnacle reef traps of the Chappel Limestone, where local porous grainstone and packstone are restricted to isolated buildups or reef clusters on low-relief paleotopography of the eroded Ellenburger Group. Chappel pinnacle reefs are draped and sealed by the overlying Barnett Shale. Stratigraphic traps in Pennsylvanian Atoka sandstones and conglomerates are mainly pinch outs related to facies changes or erosional truncation.
Fractured Barnett Shale[edit]
High-quality (35-40° API gravity, low sulfur) oil is produced from Barnett Shale in the province's north and western portions where it exhibits low thermal maturity (Ro ≈ 0.6%). Similar quality oils (40-50° API gravity), and condensates associated with gas are produced in Wise County where the Barnett is of higher thermal maturity. Gas production is from hydraulically fractured black siliceous shale. Calorific values of gases from NE-F commonly range between 1,050-1,300 BTU.[14] The Barnett's main producing facies is a black, organic-rich siliceous shale with a mean composition of about 45% quartz, 27% clay (mostly illite/smectite, and illite), 10% carbonate (calcite, dolomite, and siderite), 5% feldspar, 5% pyrite, and 5% TOC.[15] Average porosity in the productive portions is about 6% and matrix permeability is measured in nanodarcies.[16]
Three assessment units have been proposed for the Barnett Shale continuous accumulations, each with different geologic and production characteristics:

a NE-F gas "sweet spot" where the Barnett is siliceous, thick, within the gas generation window, slightly overpressured, and enclosed by dense, tight overlying Marble Falls Limestone and underlying Viola Limestone and Simpson Group as frac barriers;
an outlying area where the Barnett is within the gas-generation window but the subcrop is the porous Ellenburger and the overlying Marble Falls Limestone barrier may be absent; and
an area of lesser potential where overlying and underlying barriers may be absent and production includes oil and gas from fractured Barnett Shale.

The siliceous nature of the Barnett Shale, and its relation to fracture enhancement in NE-F, was noted by Lancaster. Also, the second assessment unit, where the Barnett Shale subcrop is Ellenburger Group carbonate rocks, is being tested by several operators. The unit's resource potential unit will be guided by the results of current testing with directional wells and various completion methods to determine optimum completion techniques for gas recovery.[13]
Historically, estimated ultimate recoveries (EURs) for Barnett gas wells at NE-F increased with time, as follows:

300 to 500 million cubic feet (8.5 × 106 to 1.4 × 107 m3) of gas before 1990;
600 to 1000 million cubic feet (1.7 × 107 to 2.8 × 107 m3) of gas between 1990 and 1997; and
800 to 1200 million cubic feet (2.3 × 107 to 3.4 × 107 m3) of gas between 1998 and 2000.

In 2002, Devon Energy reported the mean EUR for Newark East Barnett gas wells is 1.25 billion cubic feet (35×10^6 m3) of gas. The progressive increase in EUR in Barnett wells is the result of improved geologic and engineering concepts that guide development of the Barnett continuous gas play. Moreover, recompletion of wells after about five years of production commonly adds 759 million cubic feet (21.5×10^6 m3) to its EUR.[13]

Introduction[edit]
Oil and gas in Province 045 are produced from carbonate and clastic rock reservoirs ranging in age from the Ordovician to the Permian. The 1995 USGS Assessment of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas identified six conventional plays in Province 045, which are listed below in Table 1:[1] One continuous unconventional play, hypothetical "Mississippian Barnett Shale" (4503), was also considered. The cumulative mean of undiscovered resource for conventional plays was: 381 million barrels (60.6×10^6 m3) of oil, 103.6 million barrels (16.47×10^6 m3) of natural gas liquids, 479 billion cubic feet (13.6×10^9 m3) associated gas, and 1,029 billion cubic feet (29.1×10^9 m3) non-associated gas.

The USGS assessment of undiscovered conventional oil and gas and undiscovered continuous (unconventional) gas within Province 045 resulted in estimated means of 26.7 trillion cubic feet (760×10^9 m3) (Tcf) of undiscovered natural gas, 98.5 million barrels (15.66×10^6 m3) of undiscovered oil, and a mean of 1.1 billion barrels (170×10^6 m3) of undiscovered natural gas liquids. Nearly all of the undiscovered gas resource (98%, 2.62 × 1013 cu ft or 7.4 × 1011 m3) is considered to be in continuous accumulations of nonassociated gas trapped in strata of two of the three Mississippian-age Barnett Shale Assessment Units (AUs) - the Greater Newark East Frac-Barrier Continuous Barnett Shale Gas AU and the Extended Continuous Barnett Shale Gas AU (2.62 × 1013 cu ft combined). The remaining 467 billion cubic feet (13.2×10^9 m3) of undiscovered gas resource in the Province is in conventional nonassociated gas accumulations (3.586 × 1011 cu ft or 1.015 × 1010 m3) and associated/dissolved gas in conventional oil accumulations (1.084 × 1011 cu ft or 3.07 × 109 m3). The Barnett-Paleozoic TPS is estimated to contain a mean of 409.2 billion cubic feet (11.59×10^9 m3) of conventional gas, or about 88% of all undiscovered conventional gas, and about 64.6 million barrels (10.27×10^6 m3) of conventional oil, or about 65% of all undiscovered oil in Province 045.
Continuous-type accumulations include fractured shale and fractured chalk oil and gas, basin-centered gas, coal bed gas, and tight reservoir gas. They typically cover large areas, have source rocks in close association with these unconventional reservoir rocks, and are mostly gas (and in some cases oil) charged throughout their extent.[2] Continuous accumulations commonly have transition zones that grade into more conventional accumulations.[3]
Boundary[edit]




Vertical quartzite and slate strata along the eastern flank of the Ouachitas


The Fort Worth Basin and Bend Arch lie entirely within north central Texas covering an area of 54,000 square miles (140,000 km2). The southern and eastern boundaries are defined by county lines that generally follow the Ouachita structural front, although a substantial portion of this structural feature is included near Dallas. The north boundary follows the Texas-Oklahoma State line in the east, where the province includes parts of the Sherman Basin and Muenster Arch. In the west, the north boundary follows the north-east county lines of Oklahoma's three southwestern counties (Harmon, Jackson and Tillman Counties), which include the south flank of the Wichita Mountains and the Hollis Basin. The western boundary trends north-south along county lines defining the junction with the Permian Basin where part of the eastern shelf of the Permian Basin lies in Province 045.
Structural elements[edit]
Major structural features include the Muenster and Red River Arches to the north, and the Bend and Lampasas Arches along the central part of Province 045. Along the east portion is an area that includes the Eastern Shelf and Concho Arch, collectively known as the Concho Platform. The Mineral Wells fault runs northeast-southwest through Palo Pinto, Parker, Wise, Denton Counties and joins with the Newark East fault system. The fault system bisects the Newark East Field (NE-F) creating a zone of poor production in Barnett Shale gas reservoirs. Several faults that cut basement and lower Paleozoic rocks in the southern part of the province are identified at the Ordovician Ellenburger Group stratigraphic level. These faults and associated structures formed during development of the Llano Uplift and Fort Worth Basin with faulting ending by the early Missourian.[4]
Tectonic history[edit]
Fort Worth Basin[edit]
Evolution of the Fort Worth Basin and Bend Arch structures are critical to understanding burial histories and hydrocarbon generation. The asymmetrical, wedge-shaped Fort Worth Basin is a peripheral Paleozoic foreland basin with about 12,000 feet (3,700 m) of strata preserved in its deepest northeast portion and adjacent to the Muenster Arch and Ouachita structural belt. The basin resembles other basins of the Ouachita structural belt, such as the Black Warrior, Arkoma, Val Verde, and Marfa Basins that formed in front of the advancing Ouachita structural belt as it was thrust onto the margin of North America. Thrusting occurred during a late Paleozoic episode of plate convergence.[4]
Bend Arch[edit]
The Bend Arch extends north from the Llano Uplift. It is a broad subsurface, north-plunging, positive structure. The arch formed as a hingeline by down-warping of its eastern flank due to subsidence of the Fort Worth Basin during early stages of development of the Ouachita structural belt in the Late Mississippian and west tilting in the late Paleozoic which formed the Midland Basin. There is disagreement on the structural history of the Bend Arch. Flippen (1982) suggested it acted as a fulcrum and is a flexure and structural high and that only minor uplift occurred in the area to form an erosional surface on the Chester-age limestones that were deposited directly on top of the Barnett. In contrast, Cloud and Barnes (1942) suggested periodic upwarp of the Bend flexure from mid-Ordovician through Early Pennsylvanian time resulted in several unconformities. The Red River Arch and the Muenster Arch also became dominant structural features during the Late Mississippian and Early Pennsylvanian.[4]
General stratigraphy[edit]
Hydrocarbon production from Ordovician, Mississippian, and Early Pennsylvanian rocks is mostly from carbonate rock reservoirs, whereas production in the Mid-Pennsylvanian through Low-Permian is mostly from clastic rock reservoirs. The sedimentary section in the Fort Worth Basin is underlain by Precambrian granite and diorite. Cambrian rocks include granite conglomerate, sandstones, and shale that are overlain by marine carbonate rocks and shale. No production has been reported from Cambrian rocks. The Silurian, Devonian, Jurassic, and Triassic are absent in the Fort Worth Basin.[4]
From Cambrian to Mississippian time, the Fort Worth Basin area was part of a stable cratonic shelf with deposition dominated by carbonates. Ellenburger Group carbonate rocks represent a broad epeiric carbonate platform covering most of Texas during the Early Ordovician. A pronounced drop in sea level sometime between Late Ordovician and Mississippian time resulted in prolonged platform exposure. This erosional event removed any Silurian and Devonian rocks (post Viola Limestone unconformity) that may have been present.[5] Barnett Shale was deposited over the resulting unconformity. Provenance of the terrigenous material that constitutes the Barnett Shale was from Ouachita thrust sheets and the reactivation of older structures such as the Muenster Arch. Post-Barnett deposition continued without interruption as a sequenced of extremely hard and dense limestones were laid down. These limestones have often been confused with the lower part of the overlying Marble Falls Formation, and they have never been formally named in the literature. Since the underlying Barnett is generally assumed to be Late Mississippian Chester in age, the superposed carbonates are often referred to informally as "the Chester Limestones."
Clastic rocks of provenance similar to the Barnett dominate the Pennsylvanian part of the stratigraphic section in the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin. With progressive subsidence of the basin during the Pennsylvanian, the western basin hinge line and carbonate shelf, continued migrating west. Deposition of thick basinal clastic rocks of the Atoka, Strawn, and Canyon Formations occurred at this time.[6] These Mid- and Late Pennsylvanian rocks consist mostly of sandstones and conglomerates with fewer and thinner limestone beds.
Petroleum production history[edit]
Hydrocarbon shows were first encountered in Province 045 during the mid-nineteenth century while drilling water wells. Sporadic exploration began following the Civil War, and the first commercial oil discoveries occurred in the early 1900s.[1] In 1917, discovery of Ranger field stimulated one of the largest exploration and development "booms" in Texas. Ranger field produces from the Atoka-Bend formation, a sandstone-conglomerate reservoir that directly overlies the Barnett formation. Operators drilled more than 1,000 wildcats in and around the Fort Worth basin attempting to duplicate the success of Ranger. These wildcat efforts resulted in the discovery of more fields and production from numerous other reservoirs including Strawn fluvial/deltaic sandstone, Atoka-Bend fluvial/deltaic sandstone and conglomerate, Marble Falls carbonate bank limestone, Barnett siliceous shale, and Ellenburger dolomitic limestone. By 1960, the Province reached a mature stage of exploration and development, as demonstrated by the high density and distribution of well penetrations and production wells. Oil and lesser amounts of gas are found throughout the Paleozoic section, but most hydrocarbons consist of oil in Pennsylvanian reservoirs.
Province 045 is among the more active drilling areas during the resurgence of U.S. drilling, which began after the OPEC oil embargo. It has consistently appeared on the list of the 10 most active provinces in terms of wells completed and footage drilled. 9,177 oil wells and 4,520 gas wells were drilled and completed in this area from 1974 to 1980.
Cumulative production in Province 045 from conventional reservoirs prior to the 1995 USGS Assessment was 2 billion barrels (320×10^6 m3) of oil, 7.8 trillion cubic feet (220×10^9 m3) of gas, and 500 million barrels (79×10^6 m3) of natural gas liquids. Cumulative gas production through 2001 from the continuous Barnett fractured shale play in Wise and Denton counties was about 440 billion cubic feet (12×10^9 m3). Cumulative gas production from the Barnett Shale for the first half of 2002 was 94 billion cubic feet (2.7×10^9 m3);[7] annual production for 2002 was estimated at 200 billion cubic feet (5.7×10^9 m3). Currently, over 2.5 trillion cubic feet (71×10^9 m3) of proven gas reserves are assessed for NE-F. These production and proven reserve figures for the Barnett play, combined with estimates of underdeveloped Barnett resources indicate that technically recoverable continuous gas, and to a lesser extent oil, from fractured Barnett Shale will provide the greatest additions to near-future reserves in Province 045.

Source rock[edit]
The primary source rock of the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin is Mississippian Chester-age Barnett Shale. The Barnett commonly exhibits high gamma-ray log response at the base of the unit. Other potential source rocks of secondary importance are Early Pennsylvanian and include dark fine-grained carbonate rock and shale units within the Marble Falls Limestone and the black shale facies of the Smithwick/Atoka Shale.[8] The Barnett Shale was deposited over much of North-Central Texas; however, because of post-depositional erosion, the present distribution of Barnett is limited to Province 045.[9] The Barnett Shale is over 1,000 feet (300 m) thick along the southwest flank of the Muenster Arch.[10] It is eroded in areas along the Red River-Electra and Muenster Arches to the north, the Llano uplift to the south where it outcrops, and the easternmost portion of the province where the Barnett laps onto the Eastern Shelf-Concho Platform.
Average total organic carbon (TOC) content in the Barnett Shale is about 4% and TOC is as high as 12% in samples from outcrops along the Llano uplift on the south flank of the Fort Worth Basin.[11] It has geochemical characteristics similar to other Devonian-Mississippian black shales found elsewhere in the US (e.g., Woodford, Bakken, New Albany, and Chattanooga Formations). These black shales all contain oil-prone organic matter (Type II kerogen) based on hydrogen indices above 350 milligrams of hydrocarbons per gram of TOC and generate a similar type of high quality oil (low sulfur, >30 API gravity). Although kerogen cracking decomposition is a source of oil and gas from the Barnett Shale, the principal source of gas in the Newark East Field is from cracking of oil and bitumen.[12]
Thermal maturity[edit]
Low maturation levels in the Barnett Shale at vitrinite reflectance (Ro), estimated at 0.6-0.7%, yield oils of 38° API gravity in Brown County. Oils found in Shackelford, Throckmorton, and Callahan Counties as well, as in Montague County, are derived from Barnett Shale at the middle of the zone of oil generation (oil window) thermal maturities levels (≈0.9% Ro). Although condensate is associated with gas production in Wise County, Barnett source rock maturity is generally 1.1% Ro or greater. The zone of wet gas generation is in the 1.1-1.4% Ro range, whereas the primary zone of dry gas generation (main gas window) begins at a Ro of 1.4%.
Thermal maturity of Barnett Shale can also be derived from TOC and Rock-Eval (Tmax) measurements. Although Tmax is not very reliable for high maturity kerogens due to poor pyrolysis peak yields and peak shape, the extent of kerogen transformation can be utilized. For example, Barnett Shale having a 4.5% TOC and a hydrogen index of less than 100 is in the wet or dry gas windows with equivalent Ro values greater than 1.1% TOC. In contrast, low maturity Barnett Shale from Lampasas County outcrops have initial TOC values averaging about 12% with hydrocarbon potentials averaging 9.85% by volume. A good average value for Barnett Shale is derived from the Mitcham #1 well in Brown County where TOC is 4.2% and hydrocarbon potential is 3.37% by volume. Using these data we can determine TOC values will decrease 36% during maturation from the immature stage to the gas-generation window. Samples from the T. P. Simms well in the Newark East gas-producing area have average TOC values of 4.5%, but greater than 90% of the organic matter is converted to hydrocarbons. Thus, its original TOC was about 7.0% with an initial estimated potential of 5.64% by volume. Any oil generated would be expelled into shallow (or deeper) horizons as in the west and north, or cracked to gas where measured vitrinite reflectance is above 1.1% Ro.
Hydrocarbon generation[edit]
The Barnett Shale is thermally mature for hydrocarbon generation over most of its area. Barnett source rock is presently in the oil-generation window along the north and west parts of the province, and in the gas window on the east half of the Barnett-Paleozoic TPS. Expulsion of high-quality oil from the Barnett was episodic and began at low (Ro = 0.6%) thermal maturity. Thirty-two oils from Wise and Jack Counties were analyzed to determine the characteristics of the generating source rock. API gravity and sulfur content were integrated with high-resolution gas chromatography (GC) and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analyses. The API gravity of the oils ranges from 35° to 62° and sulfur contents are low (<0.2%), which is characteristic of high thermal maturity oils. Biomarkers from GCMS analyses show oils were sourced from marine shale, based on sterane distribution and the presence of diasteranes. Carbon isotopic analyses of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions support hydrocarbon generation from a single-source unit. In the main gas-producing area of fractured Barnett Shale, the gas generation window is along a trend sub-parallel to the Ouachita thrust front. Jarvie (2001) reported the British Thermal Unit (BTU) content of Barnett gas is directly proportional to Ro levels.
Reservoir rocks[edit]
Reservoir rocks include clastic and carbonate rocks ranging in age from Ordovician to Early Permian. Most production from conventional reservoirs is from Pennsylvanian rocks, whereas the only recognized production from unconventional accumulations is from Mississippian fractured Barnett Shale and early Pennsylvanian (Atokan?) fractured Marble Falls Limestone. Conglomerate of the Pennsylvanian Bend Group is the main producing reservoir in the Boonsville Bend Field with cumulative production through 2001 exceeding 3 trillion cubic feet (85×10^9 m3) of gas. Oil sourced from Barnett Shale is produced from numerous reservoir rocks in the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin, including Barnett Shale, Caddo Formation, Canyon Group, Chappel Limestone, Bend Group, and Ellenburger Group.
Seal rocks[edit]
Seal rocks in the Barnett-Paleozoic TPS are mostly shale units and dense, low permeability carbonate rock that are distributed on both regional and local scales. Barnett Shale is a major regional seal for older reservoirs, mostly porous carbonate rock reservoirs of the Ellenburger Group. Production from Barnett Shale is largely dependent on the presence or absence of Marble Falls and Viola limestones. Although these formations are not considered seal rocks in areas where they are tight and not water wet, they serve as barriers confining hydraulic-induced fracturing (frac barriers) and help retain formation pressures during well stimulation.[13]
Traps[edit]
Traps for conventional hydrcocarbon accumulations are mostly stratigraphic for carbonate rock reservoirs and both structural and stratigraphic in clastic-rock reservoirs. Combination structural and stratigraphic traps are also common in Pennsylvanian sandstone reservoirs. Stratigraphic traps in carbonate rocks result from a combination of facies and depositional topography, erosion, updip pinchout of facies, and diagenetically controlled enhanced-permeability and porosity zones. A good example of a carbonate stratigraphic trap is the pinnacle reef traps of the Chappel Limestone, where local porous grainstone and packstone are restricted to isolated buildups or reef clusters on low-relief paleotopography of the eroded Ellenburger Group. Chappel pinnacle reefs are draped and sealed by the overlying Barnett Shale. Stratigraphic traps in Pennsylvanian Atoka sandstones and conglomerates are mainly pinch outs related to facies changes or erosional truncation.
Fractured Barnett Shale[edit]
High-quality (35-40° API gravity, low sulfur) oil is produced from Barnett Shale in the province's north and western portions where it exhibits low thermal maturity (Ro ≈ 0.6%). Similar quality oils (40-50° API gravity), and condensates associated with gas are produced in Wise County where the Barnett is of higher thermal maturity. Gas production is from hydraulically fractured black siliceous shale. Calorific values of gases from NE-F commonly range between 1,050-1,300 BTU.[14] The Barnett's main producing facies is a black, organic-rich siliceous shale with a mean composition of about 45% quartz, 27% clay (mostly illite/smectite, and illite), 10% carbonate (calcite, dolomite, and siderite), 5% feldspar, 5% pyrite, and 5% TOC.[15] Average porosity in the productive portions is about 6% and matrix permeability is measured in nanodarcies.[16]
Three assessment units have been proposed for the Barnett Shale continuous accumulations, each with different geologic and production characteristics:

a NE-F gas "sweet spot" where the Barnett is siliceous, thick, within the gas generation window, slightly overpressured, and enclosed by dense, tight overlying Marble Falls Limestone and underlying Viola Limestone and Simpson Group as frac barriers;
an outlying area where the Barnett is within the gas-generation window but the subcrop is the porous Ellenburger and the overlying Marble Falls Limestone barrier may be absent; and
an area of lesser potential where overlying and underlying barriers may be absent and production includes oil and gas from fractured Barnett Shale.

The siliceous nature of the Barnett Shale, and its relation to fracture enhancement in NE-F, was noted by Lancaster. Also, the second assessment unit, where the Barnett Shale subcrop is Ellenburger Group carbonate rocks, is being tested by several operators. The unit's resource potential unit will be guided by the results of current testing with directional wells and various completion methods to determine optimum completion techniques for gas recovery.[13]
Historically, estimated ultimate recoveries (EURs) for Barnett gas wells at NE-F increased with time, as follows:

300 to 500 million cubic feet (8.5 × 106 to 1.4 × 107 m3) of gas before 1990;
600 to 1000 million cubic feet (1.7 × 107 to 2.8 × 107 m3) of gas between 1990 and 1997; and
800 to 1200 million cubic feet (2.3 × 107 to 3.4 × 107 m3) of gas between 1998 and 2000.

In 2002, Devon Energy reported the mean EUR for Newark East Barnett gas wells is 1.25 billion cubic feet (35×10^6 m3) of gas. The progressive increase in EUR in Barnett wells is the result of improved geologic and engineering concepts that guide development of the Barnett continuous gas play. Moreover, recompletion of wells after about five years of production commonly adds 759 million cubic feet (21.5×10^6 m3) to its EUR.[13]

					The Fort Worth Basin  



 










The Fort Worth Basin 
					is the footprint of an ancient ocean.   The 
					Barnett Shale 
					is the organic structure this ancient ocean leaves behind 
					proving that this areas was flooded and in fact an ocean 
					that existed at three different times flooding out this area 
					now known as the Fort Worth Basin.  The Barnett Shale 
					is a natural gas source bed rock that stretches over 16 to 
					21 North Texas counties and is still actively being 
					discovered.  Its 6,000 + square-mile reservoir is already 
					the second largest producing on-shore domestic natural gas 
					field in the United States after the San Juan Basin in New 
					Mexico and Colorado. At three different times spread out by 
					100 million years, Texas was actually a shallow ocean that 
					stretched up the central plains and even carried up into and 
					through Canada.  The first 100 feet of ocean is considered 
					the Photo Eukaric Zone since light can penetrate the first 
					100 feet.  With light and heat being a factor in this 
					shallow body of water we can assume these oceans had a huge 
					phytoplankton and zooplankton population and with that, 
					massive coral reef beds were created by filtering the 
					massive plankton population.  This was the environment in 
					most of Texas some 300 to 600 million years ago as the ocean 
					came in and out at least three different times in the Fort 
					Worth Basin.  The Barnett Shale gas field was discovered by 
					wildcatters in the early 1950's who were pioneering the 
					Conglomerate, Marble Falls, Pregnant Shale, and Strawn 
					Zones. 


The technology to produce from The 
					Barnett Shale did not evolve until 1980. This is the 
					first area in the entire world where we are pioneering the 
					art of producing natural gas from a source bed rock and it 
					is alive and anaerobic.  


Chris Sanders has 
					revolutionized the art of turning CO2 into Oxygen and 
					Natural Gas while simultaneously reducing CO2 in the 
					atmosphere the result is the first "circle of life" between 
					our ecosystem and the petroleum anaerobic bacterial world. The 
					vast majority of the industry is unconcerned with the oxygen 
					output, CO2 reduction, or the circle of life, instead an 
					industry wide success rate of 97% and 5% of the nations 
					natural gas supply make this field the most active onshore 
					drilling play in the United States. contact chris at:
					
					chris.sanders@yahoo.com 





					Texas Environmental Energy Group, Inc. 
					- (TEEG)
 In fact, in every other area of the 
					world, every drop of oil and natural gas has already escaped 
					from the source and has been actively working its way on up 
					to the surface only to be trapped by structure and horizons 
					of geological time zones.  In these upper production 
					zones, a degree of permeability and porosity must exist so 
					that we can produce from the formation.  The Barnett 
					Shale has almost no porosity and no permeability which was 
					the reason why until now source bed rocks have not been 
					produced from.  Therefore it is safe to say that these 
					explorers will spread their knowledge of source bed rock 
					stimulation and production throughout the world. So what is 
					going on here in Texas is extremely different because every 
					operator and producer here is a pioneer in the most advanced 
					cutting edge and active play in the world. 



Shale consists of very fine grained 
					particles of quartz and clay minerals.  It is 
					consolidated mud that has been deposited in lakes, seas, 
					inland oceans, and other similar environments.  About,  
					forty five (45%) percent of all exposed sedimentary rocks 
					are shales.  



Organic 
					Sedimentary Rocks are formed from organic debris.  
					It is the deposit of once-living organisms all collected and 
					sealed into a medley of what once was. (shells, corals, 
					calcareous algae, wood, plants, bones etc.)  Although 
					they are a form of clastic rock, organic rocks tend to 
					contain a larger amount of immaculately preserved fossils, 
					which laid down near the place where the animal, coral, 
					plant, or plankton once lived.  



As the rocky 
						mountains formed, several separate ocean beds were 
						created in the state of Texas and are identified as The 
						Delaware Basin, The Permian Basin and The Fort Worth 
						Basin. The Barnett Shale is in the Fort Worth Basin and 
						because of its maturity and age we are able to frackture 
						and produce from this blanket formation. The Permian 
						basin sets an example from its exploration history and 
						research being from coral reef beds itself.  The 
						word "frack" is used as a term out on the oil patch that 
						describes our ability to frackture and stimulate zones 
						horizontally by creating new channels and areas while 
						increasing the porosity and permeability of an area out 
						side of the production pipe we have just perforated.  
						Perforating is shooting through the production casing 
						and into our zone.  In this case the "Barnett Shale 
						Zone" is the organic settlement of life itself proving 
						the theories of oceans, ice ages, volcanoes, and 
						meteorite impacts.  However, this field is 
						completely different in many aspects.  This ancient 
						shallow ocean in which the Barnett Shale is believed to 
						be divided in two zones; the upper and lower Barnett 
						Shale. By producing and reviewing logs in the primary 
						core of the Barnett shale I have noticed three zones; 
						this proves three flooding events.  Under the 
						primary core and three layers you will find a thick 
						layer of obsidian 
						(obsidian is a blackish translucent glass). This is 
						probably the result of a meteorite impact in conjunction 
						with several triggered volcanic eruptions, which then 
						caused the ice ages and eventually the oceans.  The 
						first two ocean occurrences were closer together in time 
						and defined as the "lower zone"; the third one spanned 
						at least 100 million years later which is now called the 
						"upper zone".
						 



Time zones are 
					geologically missing from this shale area, which perplexes 
					others as to what happened to this time frame in the Barnett 
					Shale.  My only assumption is that the oceans 
					continually existed in this time and either eroded or 
					absorbed the span of these missing formations.  We have 
					three faults and three times that the ocean came in and out 
					of the Fort Worth Basin spread out over 300-700 million 
					years we also have three vertical faults in the shale.  
					Unlike most formations these Barnett Shale faults are areas 
					to avoid because they are incapable of producing any gas or 
					form of production such as the Muenster Arch Basin fault 
					zone.   Add plate tectonic action and 200 million 
					more years for maturity and we have our current situation 
					today. At the core area of the Barnett Shale we find the 
					third zone in this shale which is the existence of the first 
					ocean sediment itself. Also in this lower level there is 
					more maturity and higher levels of gas and condensate with a 
					higher (BTU) British Thermal Unit rating. 


Obsidian is found 
					underneath this third layer proving some meteorite and 
					volcanic activity before the creation of these oceans.  
					The northern and older part of the Barnett Shale between 
					Denton and Decatur produces a higher 1278-BTU rating as we 
					follow the Shale south to Fort Worth the BTU drops to 
					966-BTU.  I have noticed that some operators are only 
					successful in certain areas and most of this has to do with 
					their frack techniques in conjunction with either the low 
					BTU or High BTU areas. CO2 stimulation is what I would 
					scientifically recommend to induce breathing in an anaerobic 
					organic environment. Major oil companies have decided to 
					concentrate in different areas of this shale and even other 
					new shale discoveries because of their different frackturing 
					techniques, beliefs, discoveries, and abilities. By inducing 
					the anaerobic environment with CO2 we stimulate oxygen and 
					natural gas.  We can then separate the natural gas into 
					Hydrogen and CO2 we then use the Hydrogen and return the 
					"CO2" to the "anaerobic bacteria environment" to produce 
					more "Oxygen" and more "Natural Gas"; the result is the 
					first major "circle of life" between our ecosystem and 
					sustainable natural gas production in the Barnett Shale.


The reason for failure in the Barnett 
					Shale Play is simple.  Spacing and depth are the essentials 
					in producing from this zone.  A fine layer of obsidian 
					covers the Ellenberger Zone which must be watched and 
					avoided. 60 acre spacing seems to be a common norm for 
					safety in vertical wells.  If a well hits the Ellenberger it 
					will produce water and we consider the well "Killed".  
					Horizontal wells require at least 4 times the normal 
					spacing.  Problems: If one of the fracktures goes into the 
					Ellenberger Zone which is below the Barnett Shale then all 
					of the gas will follow the path of least resistance and flow 
					into the Ellenberger zone which is mainly water here in this 
					area.  Certain new companies have learned how to find this 
					gas now trapped in the Ellenberger and are working on a 
					purification process which extracts all of the gases and 
					precious metals from the water. Some of the water will be 
					used to maintain the water level of Lake Bridgeport. 


What is creating all 
					of this gas and why is it considered a source bed rock?  
					The Shale is basically compacted organic composition and 
					living at a high temperature.  Inside this compacted 
					shale we find that it has life and that there is anaerobic 
					bacteria feeding on a decomposed coral reef shale producing 
					gas.  The bacteria I believe lives in an anaerobic 
					environment and can be stimulated with CO2, the bacteria in 
					turn is stimulated and literally excretes methane.  
					However the rock is so dense that a lot of the gas stays 
					trapped uniformly perfect and even in the rock.  What 
					happens with this other gas that leaves through the surface 
					of the shale?  It rises and is trapped in other 
					structures and feeds other zones such as the conglomerate.  
					Most of these zones were discovered before we discovered the 
					shale because we did not go deeper.  The Barnet Shale 
					is about at 8900 to 8400 feet deep along highway 380 in 
					between Denton and Decatur Texas.  We know that the 
					ocean  / Ellenberger is at around 8000' - 10,000' here. 
					The inorganic theory suggests that petroleum can come from 
					an inorganic- or nonliving source; this theory has failed to 
					produce a single drop of oil or natural gas.  The 
					Barnett Shale is 100% percent organic and produced from an 
					organic source ( an old dead ocean) it is like having a huge 
					anaerobic digester trapped miles deep and if maintained 
					correctly could last indefinitely.  I use the earth 
					itself as an anaerobic digester much like the one below - 
					but instead of building a container at the surface - I use 
					the shale very much in the same fashion except 7,000 - 
					10,0000 deep.  Truthfully, many cities could take 
					advantage of this same principle using large Carsts or 
					Caverns in connection with the cities sewage systems - the 
					results would immediately produce usable gas just like we 
					are doing in the shale.  Look at the anaerobic digester 
					below using cotton hulls it can power over 300 homes in 
					Texas -talk about a use for waste! 





					The
					
					United States Geological Survey estimates that the 
					entire Barnett Shale field contains 27 trillion cubic feet 
					of gas.  Estimates of the size of Barnett Shales 
					reserves are rapidly increasing; the field is starting to 
					make a big impact on the nations gas business at a time of 
					declining domestic production and projections of rising 
					demand. Gas executives predict that the current production 
					of 1.5 billion cubic feet a day  2.5 percent of the 
					national output  has the potential to climb to 3 billion to 
					4 billion cubic feet a day in a few years.  New 
					discoveries in the "outer fringes" of the shale define as 
					what Mr. Jim Leatherwood calls "the Paleo landscape" this 
					term correctly defines the reason for success and failure 
					due to the result of the ancient ocean's floor and channel 
					contour. The "Paleo landscape" is now the wildcatters 
					frontier in the Barnett shale.  
Questions and 
					concerns?  Extremely high gas pressures leak into 
					shallow to deep fresh ground water fields.  The 
					problem.  The annulus in between the production casing 
					and the earth / dirt or ground itself creates a passageway 
					for gas to escape into different horizons.  Gas can 
					work its way up a small channel that can develop in between 
					the production casing and the dirt we call this channel the 
					annulus this channel can grow because of extreme lower gas 
					zone pressures and poison large shallow fresh water 
					reserves.  Is there a solution?  Yes!  In 
					Artesia New Mexico they noticed a great natural resource 
					early on with their artesian fresh water springs - they did 
					not want to contaminate their naturally carbonated water.  
					So, they cement around the pipe the whole way down 
					destroying the annulus.  Yes its more expensive, but 
					water is really more of a precious resource than gas.


The Interstate I-35 
					E was the edge of this ocean and as a result it is the edge 
					of the Barnett Shale Zone.  A history of the drilling 
					activity teaches us that the "primary zone" of this Barnett 
					Shale is in between Denton and Decatur Texas stretching down 
					to Fort Worth Texas.  We know that the zone is thicker 
					and richer in natural gas the further north in the Barnett 
					shale and has a higher BTU rating @1200 and the further 
					south towards Fort Worth we find a BTU rating @ 996.  
					Unlike other source beds we have learned to avoid the fault 
					lines that exist because they do not produce gas and are 
					accurately mapped by geo map on active production in the 
					area.  


Frank Dux the 
					legendary world champion martial arts Bloodsport & Kumite 
					master is using money from the Barnett Shale to save the 
					rainforests and children throughout the world.  The 
					three men run Dux Inc. and are Asian Ambassadors for the 
					Clean 
					
					World Wide Water Plan.  The plan combines solar 
					panels and wind generators which feed water dehumidifiers 
					for constant clean water and constant hydrogen energy. These 
					three men not only hold the key to world wide freedom but 
					they educate everyone about the answer to save everyone by 
					providing clean water to every child, animal, crop, and city 
					throughout the world, by using the sun, the wind, and 
					commercial dehumidifiers together as the sustainable 
					solution.  The water extracted in the atmosphere is the 
					cleanest water ever tested according to the Environmental 
					Protection Agency (EPA).  The cost of water extraction 
					is free because of sustainable integration (solar & wind) 
					the results are the keys to world wide freedom and peace.  
					The technology is the exact reverse of what is done in the 
					Barnett shale to stimulate anaerobic life.


The most interesting 
					thing about this Barnett Shale is how solid it is.  
					Typically when we measure for permeability or porosity we 
					calculate in darceys as a form of measurement.  
					However, in the Barnett Shale we calculate our porosity and 
					permeability in anchstroms or shall I say, atomic measure.  
					This means that the shale is so tight that gas has a hard 
					time escaping it.  Drilling through the shale is like 
					drilling through a Brunswick pool table or bowling ball.  
					Yet we find several interesting factors in the shale itself 
					such as micro fractures that travel from the north east to 
					the southwest.  We use these micro fractures when we 
					horizontally drill to utilize the structure in combination 
					with the multi stage frac job.  Halliburton has several 
					multi frac techniques that will literally amaze you.  
					Using micro radio transmission devices and special fluids 
					the company is literally able to follow each fracture in 
					amazing detail. You get what you pay for and horizontal frac 
					jobs can go easily between 4$ and 12$ million.  Devon 
					itself claims that the work itself is very costly and still 
					an educational process.  James Hall of Devon is leading 
					the industry in horizontal production discoveries and 
					results.


Many smaller 
					operators are experiencing the same dramatic results using 
					standard old vertical techniques and open hole completions. 
					Open hole completions?  Yes, you heard me right.  
					The shale is so very solid that it is more stable than what 
					we could put down there and it allows us to cover more area.  
					The trick in developing this field is spacing.  60 
					acre's seems to be a safe space for wells in the Barnett 
					Shale.  Many of the majors have killed off some of 
					their nearby wells by drilling to close or having a huge 
					horizontal with a bad frack job cross flood the area.  
					The trick in this field is not finding the zone - its not 
					getting greedy.  If you pass the Barnett Shale you have 
					entered the ocean you hit the ocean you ruined your project.  
					Engineers, be ready to spot obsidian which covers the 
					Ellenberger Zone- the zone you must avoid.  If a nearby 
					well hits the ocean and has fractured into your zone that 
					well has just ruined your production region. That gas will 
					shoot out into the ocean instead of up your hole.


George Mitchell 
					pioneered the lower Barnett Shale and Devon has seen its 
					capital gain merely by perforating the upper zones in their 
					existing wells.  However, I believe a majority of their 
					wells were slim hole completed- making a rework not an 
					option.  Nevertheless, this company holds about 75% of 
					the Barnett Shale and its Oil and Gas Leases by production.  
					The story of this Barnett Shale and its production evolution 
					actually began with the early Texas wildcatters that 
					discovered the area and defined the conglomerate.   



The most successful 
					wildcatter in Texas history is my father, C.W. Sanders (32°) 
					with a wildcat success rate of 87.5% in the days before 
					advanced  3D seismic technology.  He used two very 
					conventional methods for drilling success; one he coined 
					"lineology", whereas you would draw a straight line between 
					two good wells and create a location.  The other 
					involved taking off into the air which was common for us 
					back in the seventies and eighties and then spotting a 
					location from a birds eye perspective which then led to us 
					chasing the cattle off of some dirt road in the middle of 
					nowhere before  making a location.  He is an 
					amazing pilot and would fly high in the sky to get a birds 
					eye view which allowed him to examine the remains of the 
					prehistoric oceans that once covered the lands and since all 
					natural gas and oil comes from the remains of these dead 
					prehistoric oceans this gave us a perfect view because from 
					up above you can see the fault lines, and where the ocean 
					edges existed at different times. He discovered the outer 
					most fringes of these ocean channels later defined as the 
					conglomerate zone which he revealed were fed by an organic 
					source- today it is called the Barnett Shale.


This picture was 
					taken in 1979, in the back stands Texas legendary golden 
					wildcatter C.W. Sanders as he discovered evidence of this 
					Barnett Shale in his logs.  The kid in the picture is 
					me 27 years ago and even at this age I had witnessed my 
					father drill countless successful wildcat wells even in 
					areas now considered to be the core of the Barnett Shale.  
					Even then my father was questioning ways to produce from 
					this zone - however because of production technology at the 
					time and  returns we stimulated zones which were higher 
					in porosity and permeability - something that the Barnett 
					Shale does not have. So we produced the gas that had already 
					escaped the Barnett Shale - trapped under structure and 
					ready to burst - this "conglomerate zone" was an exciting 
					early discovery that was ready to be produced and defined.  
					"Chris this Barnett Shale is the source bed rock for natural 
					gas" - my father has been saying this since 1974.

If you have Minerals 
					or are able to execute an Oil & Gas lease in the Barnett 
					Shale please contact us as there are many oil and gas 
					companies ready to drill in this highly active and 
					successful area. (Currently, I am working on expanding the 
					Barnett Shale to the north in Wise and Montague and to the 
					west in Jack and Palo Pinto.  - ( I am interested in 
					anything in Denton (west of 1-35), Archer, Clay, Cooke, 
					Denton, Jack, Johnson, Montague, Palo Pinto, Parker, 
					Tarrant, Wichita, and Wise county Texas.)  In Arkansas we 
					will pursue a 30,000 acre study of the shale where we will 
					duplicate some of our fracturing techniques on this new 
					discovery that I call "the circle of life" because we create 
					oxygen from our friends the anaerobic bacteria that breath 
					in CO2 and breathe out O2 while producing NG - the Barnett 
					Shale is a living anaerobic digester.  


The Paleo Landscape 
					and the Birth of the Barnett Shale began with the defining 
					of the Fort Worth Basin and also the Conglomerate Zone 
					discovered by early Wildcatters such as Coke Gage, P. 
					Ellenberger, T.B. Pickens, George Mitchell, Norman Stovall, 
					C.W. "Chuck" Sanders, Frank Pitts, F.M. "Doc" Wigington, and 
					William ZuHone. But George Mitchell discovered how to 
					stimulate this zone and with that and the established 
					conglomerate zone above it a blanket coverage was quickly 
					defined to be the "Barnett Shale".  It was soon later 
					known through science that this layer was in fact 
					responsible for feeding the above zones with natural gas and 
					that this was in fact the source bed rock.



					Mitchell Energy / George Mitchell was acquired by Devon in 
					January 2002, and began developing the Barnett Shale in the 
					Fort Worth Basin in the northeast sector of central Texas in 
					1981. His down hole man F.M. Wigington a.k.a. "Doc" has now 
					teamed up with the Natural Gas Group, Organic Inc., and 
					Dedica and is expected to begin production in southern Jack 
					County early in 2006. This team along with William Zuhone of 
					Dedica have the most experience in the shale today.   
					The Mississippian-age Barnett Shale is one of the most 
					uniform stratigraphic units in the basin, outcropping along 
					the flanks of the Llano uplift in central Texas, where it is 
					about 30 to 50 feet thick. The Barnett Shale dips gently and 
					thickens to the north, reaching a maximum depth of around 
					8,900 feet and a maximum width of almost 1,000 feet near the 
					Texas-Oklahoma border.



Large fracktures in 
					the Barnett Shale are created by tectonic stresses created 
					after deposition about 300 million years ago. Huge grids of 
					small sized fracktures extend northeast southwest across the 
					area, but could not be produced until onset of newer 
					frackturing techniques. Barnett Shale production was first 
					established in the Newark East Field in Wise and Denton 
					counties, where it grew from less than one billion cubic 
					feet of gas from 25 wells in 1985 to 19.2 billion cubic feet 
					from 306 wells in 1995. During the past five years, 
					production has more than doubled to 40.6 billion cubic feet 
					from over 500 wells.



The Barnett Shale is 
					really only to the west of I-35 and leaves Dallas County 
					pretty much out of the play.  Chris Sanders has created 
					several new entities which all demand earth friendly and 
					sustainable projects that are combined into his Barnett 
					Shale projects.  The new family geared to save the 
					children on the planet are called Sustainable Angels.  
					Sanders Drilling is now negotiating a drilling program with 
					1.7 million acres that are both ready for natural gas and 
					wind farms.  The firm continues to expand its play area 
					with twenty wells in Southeast Jack County. In 1998 Rich 
					Green / Chevron / LNG and Chris Sanders experimented with a 
					new stimulation technique that employed water as the 
					fracturing fluid, required significantly less proppant and 
					was about 60 percent less expensive than the conventional 
					stimulation treatments. The technique proved successful and 
					has since been implemented field wide.  September of 
					2005 the team completed its 77 successful well in the 
					Barnett Shale using this process with the injection of 
					treated carbon dioxide in water.  They also provide 
					millions of cubic feet of oxygen to the atmosphere for our 
					breathing environment because the substrate in the shale 
					transforms this CO2 into both natural gas and oxygen. Since 
					then a new frack method called the "soda pop" has been 
					developed with 12 wells that have already pushed 22 million 
					dollars in natural gas returns.  Currently, they are 
					concentrating on the oil returns of the shale in the North 
					West region of the play.
					 



Devon with James 
					Hall demonstrated a technique for economically completing 
					the upper Barnett Shale interval, increasing reserves in 
					their core area by 25 percent, or 250 million cubic feet per 
					well, and expanding the play to previously marginal areas. 
					This new completion technique in combination with a 60-acre 
					spacing infill well drilling program is expected to allow 
					Devon Energy to increase its Barnett Shale gas production 
					and open up new areas for exploitation. (Devon perforated 
					the upper zone which George Mitchell did not stimulate)


Natural Gas (NG) is 
					Hydrogen (H) the only difference is removing the  
					(CO2).
					Air Products and Sanco have discussed two joint venture 
					programs involving CO2 extraction technologies from both the 
					well head and also from the environment itself.  "The 
					CO2 belongs under the surface of the earth where it can be 
					anatomically changed - just as the plants do here on the 
					surface - this substrate does under the earth - because of 
					my findings I have mandated sustainable energy integration 
					field wide on all of my locations and projects so that we 
					can do something for the environment.  By using 
					our natural gas more effectively the same amount of natural 
					gas it takes to heat a sky scrapper can be converted into 
					enough electricity to power an entire city! 
California Governor 
					Arnold Schwarzenegger and New Mexico Governor Bill 
					Richardson are now a part of the Hydrogen HWY and family - 
					The group pushes for Texas because of its proven natural gas 
					resources and areas like the Barnett Shale which currently 
					produce 5% of the nations natural gas supply that can be 
					converted to provide 100% of the nations electrical and 
					hydrogen needs from hydrogen fuel cell technology that 
					provide oxygen as emissions.

Regional Geology

 

 



The subject prospect occurs in 
					the Fort Worth Basin, which is one of most intensively 
					drilled areas in the United States. There are several 
					prominent pay zones as listed below, shallowest first: >
					



STRAWN SANDS

Usually above 5000' ; 
							occurs as channel sands, extremely productive 
							locally.



CADDO LIME

Occurs below the last 
							Strawn Sand and may be thick and prolific as at 
							Breckenridge.



CADDO CONGLOMERATES

A series of 
							coarse-grained sands particularly prolific in 
							Montague County just to the northwest.



CONGLOMERATES

The major pay in this 
							area producing over 3 trillion cubic feet of gas in 
							Wise County.



CONGLOMERATES 
							ATOKA-BEND

The major pay in this 
							area producing over 3 trillion cubic feet of gas in 
							Wise County.



MARBLE FALLS LIME

A zone above the 
							Barnett at about 7000&apos;. This may produce in the 
							Fletcher well.



BARNETT SHALE

"SOURCE BED ROCK" 
							Thick hydrocarbon rich shale between 100&apos; 
							-1000&apos; thick occurring at depths below 
							7000&apos; to as deep as 9000&apos;.



OBSIDIAN

Evidence of a massive 
							explosion or super volcano. - perhaps Yellowstone



MISSISSIPPIAN REEF

Thick and prolific but 
							rare, reefs produce mostly to the west or in the 
							Bend Arch.



VIOLA LIME

Locally productive on 
							structures in the northern portion of the Fort Worth 
							Basin needs a structural trap.



Ellenberger

The deepest pay at 
							nearly 10,000' deep in the deeper portion of the 
							Fort worth Basin needs a structural trap. two major 
							epics the Devonian is missing Silurian is missing 
							100 of millions of years.






Key 
					Advantages of Drilling and Producing in the Barnett Shale



The three 
					key advantages of shale gas plays are as follows: moderate 
					development costs, high success rates, and slow production 
					decline rates. The rapid growth in the late 1980s and early 
					1990s in the Barnett Shale which is being repeated today in 
					the Antrim Shale, and San Juan basins, is driven by the 
					powerful economic incentives of low risks and low reserve 
					finding costs. Recent technological advances in hydraulic 
					fracturing, coupled with the application of multiple 
					fracture stimulations over the life of a well to recover 
					additional reserves create an attractive opportunity to 
					produce in the Barnett Shale.


Over 700 hundred 
					wells have been
					
					drilled in the Barnett without a dry hole. Many of these 
					will produce over 1 BCF with the best at 2 BCF; some areas 
					produce less with an average of about .5 BCF. The Barnett 
					Shale gas has a BTU from 950 in the south to about 1250 in 
					the Fletcher area, garnering a premium from $0.30 to 
					$0.50/MCF. Barnett Shale wells have been producing for over 
					14 years, thus some wells may produce for 20 years or more.


For many large 
					producers, their high overhead costs prohibit aggressively 
					pursuing small, yet highly productive areas like the Barnett 
					Shale.  However, for smaller operators like Carrillo, 
					Chief, Conoco, Crown, Diablo, Eden Oil, Kiri Inc., EOG, 
					Devon (DVN), LLANO, Magnetic, Marathon, Navajo, TNWO, 
					Organic, Phillips 66, Photosynthesis, Prime Resources, Star 
					of Texas,
					
					Texas Environmental Energy Group (TEEG) ,  TEMA, 
					TRINITY, NESS, Maverick, 7777, (LNG) and ZuHone -  with 
					operating and overhead cost structures streamlined, the 
					Barnett Shale play truly becomes a success simply because of 
					reserve potential and blanket coverage. - If you would like 
					to offer a lease or property to any of these companies 
					contact
					the 
					county landman.






					Angel Investors are dedicated to bring clean water and

Renault profit leaps but shares decline 
              
              Renault SA (RNO.FR) reported a 59% jump in first-half profit on Friday that failed to excite investors who bid down the stock on fears the French car maker's earnings have peaked. Shares in the French auto maker traded 5.7% lower at 76.40 euros ($89.42) in late morning trading in Paris. Renault said net income increased to EUR2.38 billion in the six months to the end of June from EUR1.5 billion in the same period last year as the company increased volume and received a larger payout from its holding in Nissan Motor Co.

Amazon earnings forecast shows spending expected to continue
              
              Amazon.com Inc. suffered in late trading Thursday after earnings showed higher spending than expected, but the company's forecast suggests that it expects to continue spending rapidly in the current quarter. Amazon predicted third-quarter revenue will be in a range of $39.25 billion to $41.75 billion, after posting sales of $32.7 billion in the third quarter last year. However, Amazon said it expects operating income to be in a range from a loss of $400 million to a gain of $300 million, after posting operating income of $575 million a year ago. The profit forecast was well lower than what analysts expected, even as the sales forecast was strong: Analysts on average expected third-quarter operating income of $931 million on sales of $39.98 billion. Amazon shares were down about 3% in late trading Thursday.

NuVasive shares fell 13% to $66.75 after hours. The company said Jason Hannon, president and COO, was stepping down to pursue other interests, while CFO Quentin Blackford resigned, effective Aug. 25.  The company reported second-quarter net income of $12.7 million, or 22 cents a share, compared to $30.2 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings were 46 cents a share. Revenue rose to $260.6 million from $236.2 million in the year ago period. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated 44 cents a share on revenue of $262.2 million. For the full year, NuVasive estimates adjusted earnings of $2 a share on revenue of $1.07 billion. Analysts expect $2.01 a share on $1.07 billion.

Introduction[edit]
Oil and gas in Province 045 are produced from carbonate and clastic rock reservoirs ranging in age from the Ordovician to the Permian. The 1995 USGS Assessment of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas identified six conventional plays in Province 045, which are listed below in Table 1:[1] One continuous unconventional play, hypothetical "Mississippian Barnett Shale" (4503), was also considered. The cumulative mean of undiscovered resource for conventional plays was: 381 million barrels (60.6×10^6 m3) of oil, 103.6 million barrels (16.47×10^6 m3) of natural gas liquids, 479 billion cubic feet (13.6×10^9 m3) associated gas, and 1,029 billion cubic feet (29.1×10^9 m3) non-associated gas.

Notes:
1. Assessment unit number also indicates time span of stratigraphic units.
The USGS assessment of undiscovered conventional oil and gas and undiscovered continuous (unconventional) gas within Province 045 resulted in estimated means of 26.7 trillion cubic feet (760×10^9 m3) (Tcf) of undiscovered natural gas, 98.5 million barrels (15.66×10^6 m3) of undiscovered oil, and a mean of 1.1 billion barrels (170×10^6 m3) of undiscovered natural gas liquids. Nearly all of the undiscovered gas resource (98%, 2.62 × 1013 cu ft or 7.4 × 1011 m3) is considered to be in continuous accumulations of nonassociated gas trapped in strata of two of the three Mississippian-age Barnett Shale Assessment Units (AUs) - the Greater Newark East Frac-Barrier Continuous Barnett Shale Gas AU and the Extended Continuous Barnett Shale Gas AU (2.62 × 1013 cu ft combined). The remaining 467 billion cubic feet (13.2×10^9 m3) of undiscovered gas resource in the Province is in conventional nonassociated gas accumulations (3.586 × 1011 cu ft or 1.015 × 1010 m3) and associated/dissolved gas in conventional oil accumulations (1.084 × 1011 cu ft or 3.07 × 109 m3). The Barnett-Paleozoic TPS is estimated to contain a mean of 409.2 billion cubic feet (11.59×10^9 m3) of conventional gas, or about 88% of all undiscovered conventional gas, and about 64.6 million barrels (10.27×10^6 m3) of conventional oil, or about 65% of all undiscovered oil in Province 045.
Continuous-type accumulations include fractured shale and fractured chalk oil and gas, basin-centered gas, coal bed gas, and tight reservoir gas. They typically cover large areas, have source rocks in close association with these unconventional reservoir rocks, and are mostly gas (and in some cases oil) charged throughout their extent.[2] Continuous accumulations commonly have transition zones that grade into more conventional accumulations.[3]
Boundary[edit]




Vertical quartzite and slate strata along the eastern flank of the Ouachitas


The Fort Worth Basin and Bend Arch lie entirely within north central Texas covering an area of 54,000 square miles (140,000 km2). The southern and eastern boundaries are defined by county lines that generally follow the Ouachita structural front, although a substantial portion of this structural feature is included near Dallas. The north boundary follows the Texas-Oklahoma State line in the east, where the province includes parts of the Sherman Basin and Muenster Arch. In the west, the north boundary follows the north-east county lines of Oklahoma's three southwestern counties (Harmon, Jackson and Tillman Counties), which include the south flank of the Wichita Mountains and the Hollis Basin. The western boundary trends north-south along county lines defining the junction with the Permian Basin where part of the eastern shelf of the Permian Basin lies in Province 045.
Structural elements[edit]
Major structural features include the Muenster and Red River Arches to the north, and the Bend and Lampasas Arches along the central part of Province 045. Along the east portion is an area that includes the Eastern Shelf and Concho Arch, collectively known as the Concho Platform. The Mineral Wells fault runs northeast-southwest through Palo Pinto, Parker, Wise, Denton Counties and joins with the Newark East fault system. The fault system bisects the Newark East Field (NE-F) creating a zone of poor production in Barnett Shale gas reservoirs. Several faults that cut basement and lower Paleozoic rocks in the southern part of the province are identified at the Ordovician Ellenburger Group stratigraphic level. These faults and associated structures formed during development of the Llano Uplift and Fort Worth Basin with faulting ending by the early Missourian.[4]
Tectonic history[edit]
Fort Worth Basin[edit]
Evolution of the Fort Worth Basin and Bend Arch structures are critical to understanding burial histories and hydrocarbon generation. The asymmetrical, wedge-shaped Fort Worth Basin is a peripheral Paleozoic foreland basin with about 12,000 feet (3,700 m) of strata preserved in its deepest northeast portion and adjacent to the Muenster Arch and Ouachita structural belt. The basin resembles other basins of the Ouachita structural belt, such as the Black Warrior, Arkoma, Val Verde, and Marfa Basins that formed in front of the advancing Ouachita structural belt as it was thrust onto the margin of North America. Thrusting occurred during a late Paleozoic episode of plate convergence.[4]
Bend Arch[edit]
The Bend Arch extends north from the Llano Uplift. It is a broad subsurface, north-plunging, positive structure. The arch formed as a hingeline by down-warping of its eastern flank due to subsidence of the Fort Worth Basin during early stages of development of the Ouachita structural belt in the Late Mississippian and west tilting in the late Paleozoic which formed the Midland Basin. There is disagreement on the structural history of the Bend Arch. Flippen (1982) suggested it acted as a fulcrum and is a flexure and structural high and that only minor uplift occurred in the area to form an erosional surface on the Chester-age limestones that were deposited directly on top of the Barnett. In contrast, Cloud and Barnes (1942) suggested periodic upwarp of the Bend flexure from mid-Ordovician through Early Pennsylvanian time resulted in several unconformities. The Red River Arch and the Muenster Arch also became dominant structural features during the Late Mississippian and Early Pennsylvanian.[4]
General stratigraphy[edit]
Hydrocarbon production from Ordovician, Mississippian, and Early Pennsylvanian rocks is mostly from carbonate rock reservoirs, whereas production in the Mid-Pennsylvanian through Low-Permian is mostly from clastic rock reservoirs. The sedimentary section in the Fort Worth Basin is underlain by Precambrian granite and diorite. Cambrian rocks include granite conglomerate, sandstones, and shale that are overlain by marine carbonate rocks and shale. No production has been reported from Cambrian rocks. The Silurian, Devonian, Jurassic, and Triassic are absent in the Fort Worth Basin.[4]
From Cambrian to Mississippian time, the Fort Worth Basin area was part of a stable cratonic shelf with deposition dominated by carbonates. Ellenburger Group carbonate rocks represent a broad epeiric carbonate platform covering most of Texas during the Early Ordovician. A pronounced drop in sea level sometime between Late Ordovician and Mississippian time resulted in prolonged platform exposure. This erosional event removed any Silurian and Devonian rocks (post Viola Limestone unconformity) that may have been present.[5] Barnett Shale was deposited over the resulting unconformity. Provenance of the terrigenous material that constitutes the Barnett Shale was from Ouachita thrust sheets and the reactivation of older structures such as the Muenster Arch. Post-Barnett deposition continued without interruption as a sequenced of extremely hard and dense limestones were laid down. These limestones have often been confused with the lower part of the overlying Marble Falls Formation, and they have never been formally named in the literature. Since the underlying Barnett is generally assumed to be Late Mississippian Chester in age, the superposed carbonates are often referred to informally as "the Chester Limestones."
Clastic rocks of provenance similar to the Barnett dominate the Pennsylvanian part of the stratigraphic section in the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin. With progressive subsidence of the basin during the Pennsylvanian, the western basin hinge line and carbonate shelf, continued migrating west. Deposition of thick basinal clastic rocks of the Atoka, Strawn, and Canyon Formations occurred at this time.[6] These Mid- and Late Pennsylvanian rocks consist mostly of sandstones and conglomerates with fewer and thinner limestone beds.
Petroleum production history[edit]
Hydrocarbon shows were first encountered in Province 045 during the mid-nineteenth century while drilling water wells. Sporadic exploration began following the Civil War, and the first commercial oil discoveries occurred in the early 1900s.[1] In 1917, discovery of Ranger field stimulated one of the largest exploration and development "booms" in Texas. Ranger field produces from the Atoka-Bend formation, a sandstone-conglomerate reservoir that directly overlies the Barnett formation. Operators drilled more than 1,000 wildcats in and around the Fort Worth basin attempting to duplicate the success of Ranger. These wildcat efforts resulted in the discovery of more fields and production from numerous other reservoirs including Strawn fluvial/deltaic sandstone, Atoka-Bend fluvial/deltaic sandstone and conglomerate, Marble Falls carbonate bank limestone, Barnett siliceous shale, and Ellenburger dolomitic limestone. By 1960, the Province reached a mature stage of exploration and development, as demonstrated by the high density and distribution of well penetrations and production wells. Oil and lesser amounts of gas are found throughout the Paleozoic section, but most hydrocarbons consist of oil in Pennsylvanian reservoirs.
Province 045 is among the more active drilling areas during the resurgence of U.S. drilling, which began after the OPEC oil embargo. It has consistently appeared on the list of the 10 most active provinces in terms of wells completed and footage drilled. 9,177 oil wells and 4,520 gas wells were drilled and completed in this area from 1974 to 1980.
Cumulative production in Province 045 from conventional reservoirs prior to the 1995 USGS Assessment was 2 billion barrels (320×10^6 m3) of oil, 7.8 trillion cubic feet (220×10^9 m3) of gas, and 500 million barrels (79×10^6 m3) of natural gas liquids. Cumulative gas production through 2001 from the continuous Barnett fractured shale play in Wise and Denton counties was about 440 billion cubic feet (12×10^9 m3). Cumulative gas production from the Barnett Shale for the first half of 2002 was 94 billion cubic feet (2.7×10^9 m3);[7] annual production for 2002 was estimated at 200 billion cubic feet (5.7×10^9 m3). Currently, over 2.5 trillion cubic feet (71×10^9 m3) of proven gas reserves are assessed for NE-F. These production and proven reserve figures for the Barnett play, combined with estimates of underdeveloped Barnett resources indicate that technically recoverable continuous gas, and to a lesser extent oil, from fractured Barnett Shale will provide the greatest additions to near-future reserves in Province 045.

Source rock[edit]
The primary source rock of the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin is Mississippian Chester-age Barnett Shale. The Barnett commonly exhibits high gamma-ray log response at the base of the unit. Other potential source rocks of secondary importance are Early Pennsylvanian and include dark fine-grained carbonate rock and shale units within the Marble Falls Limestone and the black shale facies of the Smithwick/Atoka Shale.[8] The Barnett Shale was deposited over much of North-Central Texas; however, because of post-depositional erosion, the present distribution of Barnett is limited to Province 045.[9] The Barnett Shale is over 1,000 feet (300 m) thick along the southwest flank of the Muenster Arch.[10] It is eroded in areas along the Red River-Electra and Muenster Arches to the north, the Llano uplift to the south where it outcrops, and the easternmost portion of the province where the Barnett laps onto the Eastern Shelf-Concho Platform.
Average total organic carbon (TOC) content in the Barnett Shale is about 4% and TOC is as high as 12% in samples from outcrops along the Llano uplift on the south flank of the Fort Worth Basin.[11] It has geochemical characteristics similar to other Devonian-Mississippian black shales found elsewhere in the US (e.g., Woodford, Bakken, New Albany, and Chattanooga Formations). These black shales all contain oil-prone organic matter (Type II kerogen) based on hydrogen indices above 350 milligrams of hydrocarbons per gram of TOC and generate a similar type of high quality oil (low sulfur, >30 API gravity). Although kerogen cracking decomposition is a source of oil and gas from the Barnett Shale, the principal source of gas in the Newark East Field is from cracking of oil and bitumen.[12]
Thermal maturity[edit]
Low maturation levels in the Barnett Shale at vitrinite reflectance (Ro), estimated at 0.6-0.7%, yield oils of 38° API gravity in Brown County. Oils found in Shackelford, Throckmorton, and Callahan Counties as well, as in Montague County, are derived from Barnett Shale at the middle of the zone of oil generation (oil window) thermal maturities levels (≈0.9% Ro). Although condensate is associated with gas production in Wise County, Barnett source rock maturity is generally 1.1% Ro or greater. The zone of wet gas generation is in the 1.1-1.4% Ro range, whereas the primary zone of dry gas generation (main gas window) begins at a Ro of 1.4%.
Thermal maturity of Barnett Shale can also be derived from TOC and Rock-Eval (Tmax) measurements. Although Tmax is not very reliable for high maturity kerogens due to poor pyrolysis peak yields and peak shape, the extent of kerogen transformation can be utilized. For example, Barnett Shale having a 4.5% TOC and a hydrogen index of less than 100 is in the wet or dry gas windows with equivalent Ro values greater than 1.1% TOC. In contrast, low maturity Barnett Shale from Lampasas County outcrops have initial TOC values averaging about 12% with hydrocarbon potentials averaging 9.85% by volume. A good average value for Barnett Shale is derived from the Mitcham #1 well in Brown County where TOC is 4.2% and hydrocarbon potential is 3.37% by volume. Using these data we can determine TOC values will decrease 36% during maturation from the immature stage to the gas-generation window. Samples from the T. P. Simms well in the Newark East gas-producing area have average TOC values of 4.5%, but greater than 90% of the organic matter is converted to hydrocarbons. Thus, its original TOC was about 7.0% with an initial estimated potential of 5.64% by volume. Any oil generated would be expelled into shallow (or deeper) horizons as in the west and north, or cracked to gas where measured vitrinite reflectance is above 1.1% Ro.
Hydrocarbon generation[edit]
The Barnett Shale is thermally mature for hydrocarbon generation over most of its area. Barnett source rock is presently in the oil-generation window along the north and west parts of the province, and in the gas window on the east half of the Barnett-Paleozoic TPS. Expulsion of high-quality oil from the Barnett was episodic and began at low (Ro = 0.6%) thermal maturity. Thirty-two oils from Wise and Jack Counties were analyzed to determine the characteristics of the generating source rock. API gravity and sulfur content were integrated with high-resolution gas chromatography (GC) and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analyses. The API gravity of the oils ranges from 35° to 62° and sulfur contents are low (<0.2%), which is characteristic of high thermal maturity oils. Biomarkers from GCMS analyses show oils were sourced from marine shale, based on sterane distribution and the presence of diasteranes. Carbon isotopic analyses of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions support hydrocarbon generation from a single-source unit. In the main gas-producing area of fractured Barnett Shale, the gas generation window is along a trend sub-parallel to the Ouachita thrust front. Jarvie (2001) reported the British Thermal Unit (BTU) content of Barnett gas is directly proportional to Ro levels.
Reservoir rocks[edit]
Reservoir rocks include clastic and carbonate rocks ranging in age from Ordovician to Early Permian. Most production from conventional reservoirs is from Pennsylvanian rocks, whereas the only recognized production from unconventional accumulations is from Mississippian fractured Barnett Shale and early Pennsylvanian (Atokan?) fractured Marble Falls Limestone. Conglomerate of the Pennsylvanian Bend Group is the main producing reservoir in the Boonsville Bend Field with cumulative production through 2001 exceeding 3 trillion cubic feet (85×10^9 m3) of gas. Oil sourced from Barnett Shale is produced from numerous reservoir rocks in the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin, including Barnett Shale, Caddo Formation, Canyon Group, Chappel Limestone, Bend Group, and Ellenburger Group.
Seal rocks[edit]
Seal rocks in the Barnett-Paleozoic TPS are mostly shale units and dense, low permeability carbonate rock that are distributed on both regional and local scales. Barnett Shale is a major regional seal for older reservoirs, mostly porous carbonate rock reservoirs of the Ellenburger Group. Production from Barnett Shale is largely dependent on the presence or absence of Marble Falls and Viola limestones. Although these formations are not considered seal rocks in areas where they are tight and not water wet, they serve as barriers confining hydraulic-induced fracturing (frac barriers) and help retain formation pressures during well stimulation.[13]
Traps[edit]
Traps for conventional hydrcocarbon accumulations are mostly stratigraphic for carbonate rock reservoirs and both structural and stratigraphic in clastic-rock reservoirs. Combination structural and stratigraphic traps are also common in Pennsylvanian sandstone reservoirs. Stratigraphic traps in carbonate rocks result from a combination of facies and depositional topography, erosion, updip pinchout of facies, and diagenetically controlled enhanced-permeability and porosity zones. A good example of a carbonate stratigraphic trap is the pinnacle reef traps of the Chappel Limestone, where local porous grainstone and packstone are restricted to isolated buildups or reef clusters on low-relief paleotopography of the eroded Ellenburger Group. Chappel pinnacle reefs are draped and sealed by the overlying Barnett Shale. Stratigraphic traps in Pennsylvanian Atoka sandstones and conglomerates are mainly pinch outs related to facies changes or erosional truncation.
Fractured Barnett Shale[edit]
High-quality (35-40° API gravity, low sulfur) oil is produced from Barnett Shale in the province's north and western portions where it exhibits low thermal maturity (Ro ≈ 0.6%). Similar quality oils (40-50° API gravity), and condensates associated with gas are produced in Wise County where the Barnett is of higher thermal maturity. Gas production is from hydraulically fractured black siliceous shale. Calorific values of gases from NE-F commonly range between 1,050-1,300 BTU.[14] The Barnett's main producing facies is a black, organic-rich siliceous shale with a mean composition of about 45% quartz, 27% clay (mostly illite/smectite, and illite), 10% carbonate (calcite, dolomite, and siderite), 5% feldspar, 5% pyrite, and 5% TOC.[15] Average porosity in the productive portions is about 6% and matrix permeability is measured in nanodarcies.[16]
Three assessment units have been proposed for the Barnett Shale continuous accumulations, each with different geologic and production characteristics:

a NE-F gas "sweet spot" where the Barnett is siliceous, thick, within the gas generation window, slightly overpressured, and enclosed by dense, tight overlying Marble Falls Limestone and underlying Viola Limestone and Simpson Group as frac barriers;
an outlying area where the Barnett is within the gas-generation window but the subcrop is the porous Ellenburger and the overlying Marble Falls Limestone barrier may be absent; and
an area of lesser potential where overlying and underlying barriers may be absent and production includes oil and gas from fractured Barnett Shale.

The siliceous nature of the Barnett Shale, and its relation to fracture enhancement in NE-F, was noted by Lancaster. Also, the second assessment unit, where the Barnett Shale subcrop is Ellenburger Group carbonate rocks, is being tested by several operators. The unit's resource potential unit will be guided by the results of current testing with directional wells and various completion methods to determine optimum completion techniques for gas recovery.[13]
Historically, estimated ultimate recoveries (EURs) for Barnett gas wells at NE-F increased with time, as follows:

300 to 500 million cubic feet (8.5 × 106 to 1.4 × 107 m3) of gas before 1990;
600 to 1000 million cubic feet (1.7 × 107 to 2.8 × 107 m3) of gas between 1990 and 1997; and
800 to 1200 million cubic feet (2.3 × 107 to 3.4 × 107 m3) of gas between 1998 and 2000.

In 2002, Devon Energy reported the mean EUR for Newark East Barnett gas wells is 1.25 billion cubic feet (35×10^6 m3) of gas. The progressive increase in EUR in Barnett wells is the result of improved geologic and engineering concepts that guide development of the Barnett continuous gas play. Moreover, recompletion of wells after about five years of production commonly adds 759 million cubic feet (21.5×10^6 m3) to its EUR.[13]

Introduction[edit]
Oil and gas in Province 045 are produced from carbonate and clastic rock reservoirs ranging in age from the Ordovician to the Permian. The 1995 USGS Assessment of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas identified six conventional plays in Province 045, which are listed below in Table 1:[1] One continuous unconventional play, hypothetical "Mississippian Barnett Shale" (4503), was also considered. The cumulative mean of undiscovered resource for conventional plays was: 381 million barrels (60.6×10^6 m3) of oil, 103.6 million barrels (16.47×10^6 m3) of natural gas liquids, 479 billion cubic feet (13.6×10^9 m3) associated gas, and 1,029 billion cubic feet (29.1×10^9 m3) non-associated gas.

The USGS assessment of undiscovered conventional oil and gas and undiscovered continuous (unconventional) gas within Province 045 resulted in estimated means of 26.7 trillion cubic feet (760×10^9 m3) (Tcf) of undiscovered natural gas, 98.5 million barrels (15.66×10^6 m3) of undiscovered oil, and a mean of 1.1 billion barrels (170×10^6 m3) of undiscovered natural gas liquids. Nearly all of the undiscovered gas resource (98%, 2.62 × 1013 cu ft or 7.4 × 1011 m3) is considered to be in continuous accumulations of nonassociated gas trapped in strata of two of the three Mississippian-age Barnett Shale Assessment Units (AUs) - the Greater Newark East Frac-Barrier Continuous Barnett Shale Gas AU and the Extended Continuous Barnett Shale Gas AU (2.62 × 1013 cu ft combined). The remaining 467 billion cubic feet (13.2×10^9 m3) of undiscovered gas resource in the Province is in conventional nonassociated gas accumulations (3.586 × 1011 cu ft or 1.015 × 1010 m3) and associated/dissolved gas in conventional oil accumulations (1.084 × 1011 cu ft or 3.07 × 109 m3). The Barnett-Paleozoic TPS is estimated to contain a mean of 409.2 billion cubic feet (11.59×10^9 m3) of conventional gas, or about 88% of all undiscovered conventional gas, and about 64.6 million barrels (10.27×10^6 m3) of conventional oil, or about 65% of all undiscovered oil in Province 045.
Continuous-type accumulations include fractured shale and fractured chalk oil and gas, basin-centered gas, coal bed gas, and tight reservoir gas. They typically cover large areas, have source rocks in close association with these unconventional reservoir rocks, and are mostly gas (and in some cases oil) charged throughout their extent.[2] Continuous accumulations commonly have transition zones that grade into more conventional accumulations.[3]
Boundary[edit]




Vertical quartzite and slate strata along the eastern flank of the Ouachitas


The Fort Worth Basin and Bend Arch lie entirely within north central Texas covering an area of 54,000 square miles (140,000 km2). The southern and eastern boundaries are defined by county lines that generally follow the Ouachita structural front, although a substantial portion of this structural feature is included near Dallas. The north boundary follows the Texas-Oklahoma State line in the east, where the province includes parts of the Sherman Basin and Muenster Arch. In the west, the north boundary follows the north-east county lines of Oklahoma's three southwestern counties (Harmon, Jackson and Tillman Counties), which include the south flank of the Wichita Mountains and the Hollis Basin. The western boundary trends north-south along county lines defining the junction with the Permian Basin where part of the eastern shelf of the Permian Basin lies in Province 045.
Structural elements[edit]
Major structural features include the Muenster and Red River Arches to the north, and the Bend and Lampasas Arches along the central part of Province 045. Along the east portion is an area that includes the Eastern Shelf and Concho Arch, collectively known as the Concho Platform. The Mineral Wells fault runs northeast-southwest through Palo Pinto, Parker, Wise, Denton Counties and joins with the Newark East fault system. The fault system bisects the Newark East Field (NE-F) creating a zone of poor production in Barnett Shale gas reservoirs. Several faults that cut basement and lower Paleozoic rocks in the southern part of the province are identified at the Ordovician Ellenburger Group stratigraphic level. These faults and associated structures formed during development of the Llano Uplift and Fort Worth Basin with faulting ending by the early Missourian.[4]
Tectonic history[edit]
Fort Worth Basin[edit]
Evolution of the Fort Worth Basin and Bend Arch structures are critical to understanding burial histories and hydrocarbon generation. The asymmetrical, wedge-shaped Fort Worth Basin is a peripheral Paleozoic foreland basin with about 12,000 feet (3,700 m) of strata preserved in its deepest northeast portion and adjacent to the Muenster Arch and Ouachita structural belt. The basin resembles other basins of the Ouachita structural belt, such as the Black Warrior, Arkoma, Val Verde, and Marfa Basins that formed in front of the advancing Ouachita structural belt as it was thrust onto the margin of North America. Thrusting occurred during a late Paleozoic episode of plate convergence.[4]
Bend Arch[edit]
The Bend Arch extends north from the Llano Uplift. It is a broad subsurface, north-plunging, positive structure. The arch formed as a hingeline by down-warping of its eastern flank due to subsidence of the Fort Worth Basin during early stages of development of the Ouachita structural belt in the Late Mississippian and west tilting in the late Paleozoic which formed the Midland Basin. There is disagreement on the structural history of the Bend Arch. Flippen (1982) suggested it acted as a fulcrum and is a flexure and structural high and that only minor uplift occurred in the area to form an erosional surface on the Chester-age limestones that were deposited directly on top of the Barnett. In contrast, Cloud and Barnes (1942) suggested periodic upwarp of the Bend flexure from mid-Ordovician through Early Pennsylvanian time resulted in several unconformities. The Red River Arch and the Muenster Arch also became dominant structural features during the Late Mississippian and Early Pennsylvanian.[4]
General stratigraphy[edit]
Hydrocarbon production from Ordovician, Mississippian, and Early Pennsylvanian rocks is mostly from carbonate rock reservoirs, whereas production in the Mid-Pennsylvanian through Low-Permian is mostly from clastic rock reservoirs. The sedimentary section in the Fort Worth Basin is underlain by Precambrian granite and diorite. Cambrian rocks include granite conglomerate, sandstones, and shale that are overlain by marine carbonate rocks and shale. No production has been reported from Cambrian rocks. The Silurian, Devonian, Jurassic, and Triassic are absent in the Fort Worth Basin.[4]
From Cambrian to Mississippian time, the Fort Worth Basin area was part of a stable cratonic shelf with deposition dominated by carbonates. Ellenburger Group carbonate rocks represent a broad epeiric carbonate platform covering most of Texas during the Early Ordovician. A pronounced drop in sea level sometime between Late Ordovician and Mississippian time resulted in prolonged platform exposure. This erosional event removed any Silurian and Devonian rocks (post Viola Limestone unconformity) that may have been present.[5] Barnett Shale was deposited over the resulting unconformity. Provenance of the terrigenous material that constitutes the Barnett Shale was from Ouachita thrust sheets and the reactivation of older structures such as the Muenster Arch. Post-Barnett deposition continued without interruption as a sequenced of extremely hard and dense limestones were laid down. These limestones have often been confused with the lower part of the overlying Marble Falls Formation, and they have never been formally named in the literature. Since the underlying Barnett is generally assumed to be Late Mississippian Chester in age, the superposed carbonates are often referred to informally as "the Chester Limestones."
Clastic rocks of provenance similar to the Barnett dominate the Pennsylvanian part of the stratigraphic section in the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin. With progressive subsidence of the basin during the Pennsylvanian, the western basin hinge line and carbonate shelf, continued migrating west. Deposition of thick basinal clastic rocks of the Atoka, Strawn, and Canyon Formations occurred at this time.[6] These Mid- and Late Pennsylvanian rocks consist mostly of sandstones and conglomerates with fewer and thinner limestone beds.
Petroleum production history[edit]
Hydrocarbon shows were first encountered in Province 045 during the mid-nineteenth century while drilling water wells. Sporadic exploration began following the Civil War, and the first commercial oil discoveries occurred in the early 1900s.[1] In 1917, discovery of Ranger field stimulated one of the largest exploration and development "booms" in Texas. Ranger field produces from the Atoka-Bend formation, a sandstone-conglomerate reservoir that directly overlies the Barnett formation. Operators drilled more than 1,000 wildcats in and around the Fort Worth basin attempting to duplicate the success of Ranger. These wildcat efforts resulted in the discovery of more fields and production from numerous other reservoirs including Strawn fluvial/deltaic sandstone, Atoka-Bend fluvial/deltaic sandstone and conglomerate, Marble Falls carbonate bank limestone, Barnett siliceous shale, and Ellenburger dolomitic limestone. By 1960, the Province reached a mature stage of exploration and development, as demonstrated by the high density and distribution of well penetrations and production wells. Oil and lesser amounts of gas are found throughout the Paleozoic section, but most hydrocarbons consist of oil in Pennsylvanian reservoirs.
Province 045 is among the more active drilling areas during the resurgence of U.S. drilling, which began after the OPEC oil embargo. It has consistently appeared on the list of the 10 most active provinces in terms of wells completed and footage drilled. 9,177 oil wells and 4,520 gas wells were drilled and completed in this area from 1974 to 1980.
Cumulative production in Province 045 from conventional reservoirs prior to the 1995 USGS Assessment was 2 billion barrels (320×10^6 m3) of oil, 7.8 trillion cubic feet (220×10^9 m3) of gas, and 500 million barrels (79×10^6 m3) of natural gas liquids. Cumulative gas production through 2001 from the continuous Barnett fractured shale play in Wise and Denton counties was about 440 billion cubic feet (12×10^9 m3). Cumulative gas production from the Barnett Shale for the first half of 2002 was 94 billion cubic feet (2.7×10^9 m3);[7] annual production for 2002 was estimated at 200 billion cubic feet (5.7×10^9 m3). Currently, over 2.5 trillion cubic feet (71×10^9 m3) of proven gas reserves are assessed for NE-F. These production and proven reserve figures for the Barnett play, combined with estimates of underdeveloped Barnett resources indicate that technically recoverable continuous gas, and to a lesser extent oil, from fractured Barnett Shale will provide the greatest additions to near-future reserves in Province 045.

Source rock[edit]
The primary source rock of the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin is Mississippian Chester-age Barnett Shale. The Barnett commonly exhibits high gamma-ray log response at the base of the unit. Other potential source rocks of secondary importance are Early Pennsylvanian and include dark fine-grained carbonate rock and shale units within the Marble Falls Limestone and the black shale facies of the Smithwick/Atoka Shale.[8] The Barnett Shale was deposited over much of North-Central Texas; however, because of post-depositional erosion, the present distribution of Barnett is limited to Province 045.[9] The Barnett Shale is over 1,000 feet (300 m) thick along the southwest flank of the Muenster Arch.[10] It is eroded in areas along the Red River-Electra and Muenster Arches to the north, the Llano uplift to the south where it outcrops, and the easternmost portion of the province where the Barnett laps onto the Eastern Shelf-Concho Platform.
Average total organic carbon (TOC) content in the Barnett Shale is about 4% and TOC is as high as 12% in samples from outcrops along the Llano uplift on the south flank of the Fort Worth Basin.[11] It has geochemical characteristics similar to other Devonian-Mississippian black shales found elsewhere in the US (e.g., Woodford, Bakken, New Albany, and Chattanooga Formations). These black shales all contain oil-prone organic matter (Type II kerogen) based on hydrogen indices above 350 milligrams of hydrocarbons per gram of TOC and generate a similar type of high quality oil (low sulfur, >30 API gravity). Although kerogen cracking decomposition is a source of oil and gas from the Barnett Shale, the principal source of gas in the Newark East Field is from cracking of oil and bitumen.[12]
Thermal maturity[edit]
Low maturation levels in the Barnett Shale at vitrinite reflectance (Ro), estimated at 0.6-0.7%, yield oils of 38° API gravity in Brown County. Oils found in Shackelford, Throckmorton, and Callahan Counties as well, as in Montague County, are derived from Barnett Shale at the middle of the zone of oil generation (oil window) thermal maturities levels (≈0.9% Ro). Although condensate is associated with gas production in Wise County, Barnett source rock maturity is generally 1.1% Ro or greater. The zone of wet gas generation is in the 1.1-1.4% Ro range, whereas the primary zone of dry gas generation (main gas window) begins at a Ro of 1.4%.
Thermal maturity of Barnett Shale can also be derived from TOC and Rock-Eval (Tmax) measurements. Although Tmax is not very reliable for high maturity kerogens due to poor pyrolysis peak yields and peak shape, the extent of kerogen transformation can be utilized. For example, Barnett Shale having a 4.5% TOC and a hydrogen index of less than 100 is in the wet or dry gas windows with equivalent Ro values greater than 1.1% TOC. In contrast, low maturity Barnett Shale from Lampasas County outcrops have initial TOC values averaging about 12% with hydrocarbon potentials averaging 9.85% by volume. A good average value for Barnett Shale is derived from the Mitcham #1 well in Brown County where TOC is 4.2% and hydrocarbon potential is 3.37% by volume. Using these data we can determine TOC values will decrease 36% during maturation from the immature stage to the gas-generation window. Samples from the T. P. Simms well in the Newark East gas-producing area have average TOC values of 4.5%, but greater than 90% of the organic matter is converted to hydrocarbons. Thus, its original TOC was about 7.0% with an initial estimated potential of 5.64% by volume. Any oil generated would be expelled into shallow (or deeper) horizons as in the west and north, or cracked to gas where measured vitrinite reflectance is above 1.1% Ro.
Hydrocarbon generation[edit]
The Barnett Shale is thermally mature for hydrocarbon generation over most of its area. Barnett source rock is presently in the oil-generation window along the north and west parts of the province, and in the gas window on the east half of the Barnett-Paleozoic TPS. Expulsion of high-quality oil from the Barnett was episodic and began at low (Ro = 0.6%) thermal maturity. Thirty-two oils from Wise and Jack Counties were analyzed to determine the characteristics of the generating source rock. API gravity and sulfur content were integrated with high-resolution gas chromatography (GC) and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analyses. The API gravity of the oils ranges from 35° to 62° and sulfur contents are low (<0.2%), which is characteristic of high thermal maturity oils. Biomarkers from GCMS analyses show oils were sourced from marine shale, based on sterane distribution and the presence of diasteranes. Carbon isotopic analyses of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions support hydrocarbon generation from a single-source unit. In the main gas-producing area of fractured Barnett Shale, the gas generation window is along a trend sub-parallel to the Ouachita thrust front. Jarvie (2001) reported the British Thermal Unit (BTU) content of Barnett gas is directly proportional to Ro levels.
Reservoir rocks[edit]
Reservoir rocks include clastic and carbonate rocks ranging in age from Ordovician to Early Permian. Most production from conventional reservoirs is from Pennsylvanian rocks, whereas the only recognized production from unconventional accumulations is from Mississippian fractured Barnett Shale and early Pennsylvanian (Atokan?) fractured Marble Falls Limestone. Conglomerate of the Pennsylvanian Bend Group is the main producing reservoir in the Boonsville Bend Field with cumulative production through 2001 exceeding 3 trillion cubic feet (85×10^9 m3) of gas. Oil sourced from Barnett Shale is produced from numerous reservoir rocks in the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin, including Barnett Shale, Caddo Formation, Canyon Group, Chappel Limestone, Bend Group, and Ellenburger Group.
Seal rocks[edit]
Seal rocks in the Barnett-Paleozoic TPS are mostly shale units and dense, low permeability carbonate rock that are distributed on both regional and local scales. Barnett Shale is a major regional seal for older reservoirs, mostly porous carbonate rock reservoirs of the Ellenburger Group. Production from Barnett Shale is largely dependent on the presence or absence of Marble Falls and Viola limestones. Although these formations are not considered seal rocks in areas where they are tight and not water wet, they serve as barriers confining hydraulic-induced fracturing (frac barriers) and help retain formation pressures during well stimulation.[13]
Traps[edit]
Traps for conventional hydrcocarbon accumulations are mostly stratigraphic for carbonate rock reservoirs and both structural and stratigraphic in clastic-rock reservoirs. Combination structural and stratigraphic traps are also common in Pennsylvanian sandstone reservoirs. Stratigraphic traps in carbonate rocks result from a combination of facies and depositional topography, erosion, updip pinchout of facies, and diagenetically controlled enhanced-permeability and porosity zones. A good example of a carbonate stratigraphic trap is the pinnacle reef traps of the Chappel Limestone, where local porous grainstone and packstone are restricted to isolated buildups or reef clusters on low-relief paleotopography of the eroded Ellenburger Group. Chappel pinnacle reefs are draped and sealed by the overlying Barnett Shale. Stratigraphic traps in Pennsylvanian Atoka sandstones and conglomerates are mainly pinch outs related to facies changes or erosional truncation.
Fractured Barnett Shale[edit]
High-quality (35-40° API gravity, low sulfur) oil is produced from Barnett Shale in the province's north and western portions where it exhibits low thermal maturity (Ro ≈ 0.6%). Similar quality oils (40-50° API gravity), and condensates associated with gas are produced in Wise County where the Barnett is of higher thermal maturity. Gas production is from hydraulically fractured black siliceous shale. Calorific values of gases from NE-F commonly range between 1,050-1,300 BTU.[14] The Barnett's main producing facies is a black, organic-rich siliceous shale with a mean composition of about 45% quartz, 27% clay (mostly illite/smectite, and illite), 10% carbonate (calcite, dolomite, and siderite), 5% feldspar, 5% pyrite, and 5% TOC.[15] Average porosity in the productive portions is about 6% and matrix permeability is measured in nanodarcies.[16]
Three assessment units have been proposed for the Barnett Shale continuous accumulations, each with different geologic and production characteristics:

a NE-F gas "sweet spot" where the Barnett is siliceous, thick, within the gas generation window, slightly overpressured, and enclosed by dense, tight overlying Marble Falls Limestone and underlying Viola Limestone and Simpson Group as frac barriers;
an outlying area where the Barnett is within the gas-generation window but the subcrop is the porous Ellenburger and the overlying Marble Falls Limestone barrier may be absent; and
an area of lesser potential where overlying and underlying barriers may be absent and production includes oil and gas from fractured Barnett Shale.

The siliceous nature of the Barnett Shale, and its relation to fracture enhancement in NE-F, was noted by Lancaster. Also, the second assessment unit, where the Barnett Shale subcrop is Ellenburger Group carbonate rocks, is being tested by several operators. The unit's resource potential unit will be guided by the results of current testing with directional wells and various completion methods to determine optimum completion techniques for gas recovery.[13]
Historically, estimated ultimate recoveries (EURs) for Barnett gas wells at NE-F increased with time, as follows:

300 to 500 million cubic feet (8.5 × 106 to 1.4 × 107 m3) of gas before 1990;
600 to 1000 million cubic feet (1.7 × 107 to 2.8 × 107 m3) of gas between 1990 and 1997; and
800 to 1200 million cubic feet (2.3 × 107 to 3.4 × 107 m3) of gas between 1998 and 2000.

In 2002, Devon Energy reported the mean EUR for Newark East Barnett gas wells is 1.25 billion cubic feet (35×10^6 m3) of gas. The progressive increase in EUR in Barnett wells is the result of improved geologic and engineering concepts that guide development of the Barnett continuous gas play. Moreover, recompletion of wells after about five years of production commonly adds 759 million cubic feet (21.5×10^6 m3) to its EUR.[13]

Introduction[edit]
Oil and gas in Province 045 are produced from carbonate and clastic rock reservoirs ranging in age from the Ordovician to the Permian. The 1995 USGS Assessment of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas identified six conventional plays in Province 045, which are listed below in Table 1:[1] One continuous unconventional play, hypothetical "Mississippian Barnett Shale" (4503), was also considered. The cumulative mean of undiscovered resource for conventional plays was: 381 million barrels (60.6×10^6 m3) of oil, 103.6 million barrels (16.47×10^6 m3) of natural gas liquids, 479 billion cubic feet (13.6×10^9 m3) associated gas, and 1,029 billion cubic feet (29.1×10^9 m3) non-associated gas.

The USGS assessment of undiscovered conventional oil and gas and undiscovered continuous (unconventional) gas within Province 045 resulted in estimated means of 26.7 trillion cubic feet (760×10^9 m3) (Tcf) of undiscovered natural gas, 98.5 million barrels (15.66×10^6 m3) of undiscovered oil, and a mean of 1.1 billion barrels (170×10^6 m3) of undiscovered natural gas liquids. Nearly all of the undiscovered gas resource (98%, 2.62 × 1013 cu ft or 7.4 × 1011 m3) is considered to be in continuous accumulations of nonassociated gas trapped in strata of two of the three Mississippian-age Barnett Shale Assessment Units (AUs) - the Greater Newark East Frac-Barrier Continuous Barnett Shale Gas AU and the Extended Continuous Barnett Shale Gas AU (2.62 × 1013 cu ft combined). The remaining 467 billion cubic feet (13.2×10^9 m3) of undiscovered gas resource in the Province is in conventional nonassociated gas accumulations (3.586 × 1011 cu ft or 1.015 × 1010 m3) and associated/dissolved gas in conventional oil accumulations (1.084 × 1011 cu ft or 3.07 × 109 m3). The Barnett-Paleozoic TPS is estimated to contain a mean of 409.2 billion cubic feet (11.59×10^9 m3) of conventional gas, or about 88% of all undiscovered conventional gas, and about 64.6 million barrels (10.27×10^6 m3) of conventional oil, or about 65% of all undiscovered oil in Province 045.
Continuous-type accumulations include fractured shale and fractured chalk oil and gas, basin-centered gas, coal bed gas, and tight reservoir gas. They typically cover large areas, have source rocks in close association with these unconventional reservoir rocks, and are mostly gas (and in some cases oil) charged throughout their extent.[2] Continuous accumulations commonly have transition zones that grade into more conventional accumulations.[3]
Boundary[edit]




Vertical quartzite and slate strata along the eastern flank of the Ouachitas


The Fort Worth Basin and Bend Arch lie entirely within north central Texas covering an area of 54,000 square miles (140,000 km2). The southern and eastern boundaries are defined by county lines that generally follow the Ouachita structural front, although a substantial portion of this structural feature is included near Dallas. The north boundary follows the Texas-Oklahoma State line in the east, where the province includes parts of the Sherman Basin and Muenster Arch. In the west, the north boundary follows the north-east county lines of Oklahoma's three southwestern counties (Harmon, Jackson and Tillman Counties), which include the south flank of the Wichita Mountains and the Hollis Basin. The western boundary trends north-south along county lines defining the junction with the Permian Basin where part of the eastern shelf of the Permian Basin lies in Province 045.
Structural elements[edit]
Major structural features include the Muenster and Red River Arches to the north, and the Bend and Lampasas Arches along the central part of Province 045. Along the east portion is an area that includes the Eastern Shelf and Concho Arch, collectively known as the Concho Platform. The Mineral Wells fault runs northeast-southwest through Palo Pinto, Parker, Wise, Denton Counties and joins with the Newark East fault system. The fault system bisects the Newark East Field (NE-F) creating a zone of poor production in Barnett Shale gas reservoirs. Several faults that cut basement and lower Paleozoic rocks in the southern part of the province are identified at the Ordovician Ellenburger Group stratigraphic level. These faults and associated structures formed during development of the Llano Uplift and Fort Worth Basin with faulting ending by the early Missourian.[4]
Tectonic history[edit]
Fort Worth Basin[edit]
Evolution of the Fort Worth Basin and Bend Arch structures are critical to understanding burial histories and hydrocarbon generation. The asymmetrical, wedge-shaped Fort Worth Basin is a peripheral Paleozoic foreland basin with about 12,000 feet (3,700 m) of strata preserved in its deepest northeast portion and adjacent to the Muenster Arch and Ouachita structural belt. The basin resembles other basins of the Ouachita structural belt, such as the Black Warrior, Arkoma, Val Verde, and Marfa Basins that formed in front of the advancing Ouachita structural belt as it was thrust onto the margin of North America. Thrusting occurred during a late Paleozoic episode of plate convergence.[4]
Bend Arch[edit]
The Bend Arch extends north from the Llano Uplift. It is a broad subsurface, north-plunging, positive structure. The arch formed as a hingeline by down-warping of its eastern flank due to subsidence of the Fort Worth Basin during early stages of development of the Ouachita structural belt in the Late Mississippian and west tilting in the late Paleozoic which formed the Midland Basin. There is disagreement on the structural history of the Bend Arch. Flippen (1982) suggested it acted as a fulcrum and is a flexure and structural high and that only minor uplift occurred in the area to form an erosional surface on the Chester-age limestones that were deposited directly on top of the Barnett. In contrast, Cloud and Barnes (1942) suggested periodic upwarp of the Bend flexure from mid-Ordovician through Early Pennsylvanian time resulted in several unconformities. The Red River Arch and the Muenster Arch also became dominant structural features during the Late Mississippian and Early Pennsylvanian.[4]
General stratigraphy[edit]
Hydrocarbon production from Ordovician, Mississippian, and Early Pennsylvanian rocks is mostly from carbonate rock reservoirs, whereas production in the Mid-Pennsylvanian through Low-Permian is mostly from clastic rock reservoirs. The sedimentary section in the Fort Worth Basin is underlain by Precambrian granite and diorite. Cambrian rocks include granite conglomerate, sandstones, and shale that are overlain by marine carbonate rocks and shale. No production has been reported from Cambrian rocks. The Silurian, Devonian, Jurassic, and Triassic are absent in the Fort Worth Basin.[4]
From Cambrian to Mississippian time, the Fort Worth Basin area was part of a stable cratonic shelf with deposition dominated by carbonates. Ellenburger Group carbonate rocks represent a broad epeiric carbonate platform covering most of Texas during the Early Ordovician. A pronounced drop in sea level sometime between Late Ordovician and Mississippian time resulted in prolonged platform exposure. This erosional event removed any Silurian and Devonian rocks (post Viola Limestone unconformity) that may have been present.[5] Barnett Shale was deposited over the resulting unconformity. Provenance of the terrigenous material that constitutes the Barnett Shale was from Ouachita thrust sheets and the reactivation of older structures such as the Muenster Arch. Post-Barnett deposition continued without interruption as a sequenced of extremely hard and dense limestones were laid down. These limestones have often been confused with the lower part of the overlying Marble Falls Formation, and they have never been formally named in the literature. Since the underlying Barnett is generally assumed to be Late Mississippian Chester in age, the superposed carbonates are often referred to informally as "the Chester Limestones."
Clastic rocks of provenance similar to the Barnett dominate the Pennsylvanian part of the stratigraphic section in the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin. With progressive subsidence of the basin during the Pennsylvanian, the western basin hinge line and carbonate shelf, continued migrating west. Deposition of thick basinal clastic rocks of the Atoka, Strawn, and Canyon Formations occurred at this time.[6] These Mid- and Late Pennsylvanian rocks consist mostly of sandstones and conglomerates with fewer and thinner limestone beds.
Petroleum production history[edit]
Hydrocarbon shows were first encountered in Province 045 during the mid-nineteenth century while drilling water wells. Sporadic exploration began following the Civil War, and the first commercial oil discoveries occurred in the early 1900s.[1] In 1917, discovery of Ranger field stimulated one of the largest exploration and development "booms" in Texas. Ranger field produces from the Atoka-Bend formation, a sandstone-conglomerate reservoir that directly overlies the Barnett formation. Operators drilled more than 1,000 wildcats in and around the Fort Worth basin attempting to duplicate the success of Ranger. These wildcat efforts resulted in the discovery of more fields and production from numerous other reservoirs including Strawn fluvial/deltaic sandstone, Atoka-Bend fluvial/deltaic sandstone and conglomerate, Marble Falls carbonate bank limestone, Barnett siliceous shale, and Ellenburger dolomitic limestone. By 1960, the Province reached a mature stage of exploration and development, as demonstrated by the high density and distribution of well penetrations and production wells. Oil and lesser amounts of gas are found throughout the Paleozoic section, but most hydrocarbons consist of oil in Pennsylvanian reservoirs.
Province 045 is among the more active drilling areas during the resurgence of U.S. drilling, which began after the OPEC oil embargo. It has consistently appeared on the list of the 10 most active provinces in terms of wells completed and footage drilled. 9,177 oil wells and 4,520 gas wells were drilled and completed in this area from 1974 to 1980.
Cumulative production in Province 045 from conventional reservoirs prior to the 1995 USGS Assessment was 2 billion barrels (320×10^6 m3) of oil, 7.8 trillion cubic feet (220×10^9 m3) of gas, and 500 million barrels (79×10^6 m3) of natural gas liquids. Cumulative gas production through 2001 from the continuous Barnett fractured shale play in Wise and Denton counties was about 440 billion cubic feet (12×10^9 m3). Cumulative gas production from the Barnett Shale for the first half of 2002 was 94 billion cubic feet (2.7×10^9 m3);[7] annual production for 2002 was estimated at 200 billion cubic feet (5.7×10^9 m3). Currently, over 2.5 trillion cubic feet (71×10^9 m3) of proven gas reserves are assessed for NE-F. These production and proven reserve figures for the Barnett play, combined with estimates of underdeveloped Barnett resources indicate that technically recoverable continuous gas, and to a lesser extent oil, from fractured Barnett Shale will provide the greatest additions to near-future reserves in Province 045.

Source rock[edit]
The primary source rock of the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin is Mississippian Chester-age Barnett Shale. The Barnett commonly exhibits high gamma-ray log response at the base of the unit. Other potential source rocks of secondary importance are Early Pennsylvanian and include dark fine-grained carbonate rock and shale units within the Marble Falls Limestone and the black shale facies of the Smithwick/Atoka Shale.[8] The Barnett Shale was deposited over much of North-Central Texas; however, because of post-depositional erosion, the present distribution of Barnett is limited to Province 045.[9] The Barnett Shale is over 1,000 feet (300 m) thick along the southwest flank of the Muenster Arch.[10] It is eroded in areas along the Red River-Electra and Muenster Arches to the north, the Llano uplift to the south where it outcrops, and the easternmost portion of the province where the Barnett laps onto the Eastern Shelf-Concho Platform.
Average total organic carbon (TOC) content in the Barnett Shale is about 4% and TOC is as high as 12% in samples from outcrops along the Llano uplift on the south flank of the Fort Worth Basin.[11] It has geochemical characteristics similar to other Devonian-Mississippian black shales found elsewhere in the US (e.g., Woodford, Bakken, New Albany, and Chattanooga Formations). These black shales all contain oil-prone organic matter (Type II kerogen) based on hydrogen indices above 350 milligrams of hydrocarbons per gram of TOC and generate a similar type of high quality oil (low sulfur, >30 API gravity). Although kerogen cracking decomposition is a source of oil and gas from the Barnett Shale, the principal source of gas in the Newark East Field is from cracking of oil and bitumen.[12]
Thermal maturity[edit]
Low maturation levels in the Barnett Shale at vitrinite reflectance (Ro), estimated at 0.6-0.7%, yield oils of 38° API gravity in Brown County. Oils found in Shackelford, Throckmorton, and Callahan Counties as well, as in Montague County, are derived from Barnett Shale at the middle of the zone of oil generation (oil window) thermal maturities levels (≈0.9% Ro). Although condensate is associated with gas production in Wise County, Barnett source rock maturity is generally 1.1% Ro or greater. The zone of wet gas generation is in the 1.1-1.4% Ro range, whereas the primary zone of dry gas generation (main gas window) begins at a Ro of 1.4%.
Thermal maturity of Barnett Shale can also be derived from TOC and Rock-Eval (Tmax) measurements. Although Tmax is not very reliable for high maturity kerogens due to poor pyrolysis peak yields and peak shape, the extent of kerogen transformation can be utilized. For example, Barnett Shale having a 4.5% TOC and a hydrogen index of less than 100 is in the wet or dry gas windows with equivalent Ro values greater than 1.1% TOC. In contrast, low maturity Barnett Shale from Lampasas County outcrops have initial TOC values averaging about 12% with hydrocarbon potentials averaging 9.85% by volume. A good average value for Barnett Shale is derived from the Mitcham #1 well in Brown County where TOC is 4.2% and hydrocarbon potential is 3.37% by volume. Using these data we can determine TOC values will decrease 36% during maturation from the immature stage to the gas-generation window. Samples from the T. P. Simms well in the Newark East gas-producing area have average TOC values of 4.5%, but greater than 90% of the organic matter is converted to hydrocarbons. Thus, its original TOC was about 7.0% with an initial estimated potential of 5.64% by volume. Any oil generated would be expelled into shallow (or deeper) horizons as in the west and north, or cracked to gas where measured vitrinite reflectance is above 1.1% Ro.
Hydrocarbon generation[edit]
The Barnett Shale is thermally mature for hydrocarbon generation over most of its area. Barnett source rock is presently in the oil-generation window along the north and west parts of the province, and in the gas window on the east half of the Barnett-Paleozoic TPS. Expulsion of high-quality oil from the Barnett was episodic and began at low (Ro = 0.6%) thermal maturity. Thirty-two oils from Wise and Jack Counties were analyzed to determine the characteristics of the generating source rock. API gravity and sulfur content were integrated with high-resolution gas chromatography (GC) and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analyses. The API gravity of the oils ranges from 35° to 62° and sulfur contents are low (<0.2%), which is characteristic of high thermal maturity oils. Biomarkers from GCMS analyses show oils were sourced from marine shale, based on sterane distribution and the presence of diasteranes. Carbon isotopic analyses of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions support hydrocarbon generation from a single-source unit. In the main gas-producing area of fractured Barnett Shale, the gas generation window is along a trend sub-parallel to the Ouachita thrust front. Jarvie (2001) reported the British Thermal Unit (BTU) content of Barnett gas is directly proportional to Ro levels.
Reservoir rocks[edit]
Reservoir rocks include clastic and carbonate rocks ranging in age from Ordovician to Early Permian. Most production from conventional reservoirs is from Pennsylvanian rocks, whereas the only recognized production from unconventional accumulations is from Mississippian fractured Barnett Shale and early Pennsylvanian (Atokan?) fractured Marble Falls Limestone. Conglomerate of the Pennsylvanian Bend Group is the main producing reservoir in the Boonsville Bend Field with cumulative production through 2001 exceeding 3 trillion cubic feet (85×10^9 m3) of gas. Oil sourced from Barnett Shale is produced from numerous reservoir rocks in the Bend Arch–Fort Worth Basin, including Barnett Shale, Caddo Formation, Canyon Group, Chappel Limestone, Bend Group, and Ellenburger Group.
Seal rocks[edit]
Seal rocks in the Barnett-Paleozoic TPS are mostly shale units and dense, low permeability carbonate rock that are distributed on both regional and local scales. Barnett Shale is a major regional seal for older reservoirs, mostly porous carbonate rock reservoirs of the Ellenburger Group. Production from Barnett Shale is largely dependent on the presence or absence of Marble Falls and Viola limestones. Although these formations are not considered seal rocks in areas where they are tight and not water wet, they serve as barriers confining hydraulic-induced fracturing (frac barriers) and help retain formation pressures during well stimulation.[13]
Traps[edit]
Traps for conventional hydrcocarbon accumulations are mostly stratigraphic for carbonate rock reservoirs and both structural and stratigraphic in clastic-rock reservoirs. Combination structural and stratigraphic traps are also common in Pennsylvanian sandstone reservoirs. Stratigraphic traps in carbonate rocks result from a combination of facies and depositional topography, erosion, updip pinchout of facies, and diagenetically controlled enhanced-permeability and porosity zones. A good example of a carbonate stratigraphic trap is the pinnacle reef traps of the Chappel Limestone, where local porous grainstone and packstone are restricted to isolated buildups or reef clusters on low-relief paleotopography of the eroded Ellenburger Group. Chappel pinnacle reefs are draped and sealed by the overlying Barnett Shale. Stratigraphic traps in Pennsylvanian Atoka sandstones and conglomerates are mainly pinch outs related to facies changes or erosional truncation.
Fractured Barnett Shale[edit]
High-quality (35-40° API gravity, low sulfur) oil is produced from Barnett Shale in the province's north and western portions where it exhibits low thermal maturity (Ro ≈ 0.6%). Similar quality oils (40-50° API gravity), and condensates associated with gas are produced in Wise County where the Barnett is of higher thermal maturity. Gas production is from hydraulically fractured black siliceous shale. Calorific values of gases from NE-F commonly range between 1,050-1,300 BTU.[14] The Barnett's main producing facies is a black, organic-rich siliceous shale with a mean composition of about 45% quartz, 27% clay (mostly illite/smectite, and illite), 10% carbonate (calcite, dolomite, and siderite), 5% feldspar, 5% pyrite, and 5% TOC.[15] Average porosity in the productive portions is about 6% and matrix permeability is measured in nanodarcies.[16]
Three assessment units have been proposed for the Barnett Shale continuous accumulations, each with different geologic and production characteristics:

a NE-F gas "sweet spot" where the Barnett is siliceous, thick, within the gas generation window, slightly overpressured, and enclosed by dense, tight overlying Marble Falls Limestone and underlying Viola Limestone and Simpson Group as frac barriers;
an outlying area where the Barnett is within the gas-generation window but the subcrop is the porous Ellenburger and the overlying Marble Falls Limestone barrier may be absent; and
an area of lesser potential where overlying and underlying barriers may be absent and production includes oil and gas from fractured Barnett Shale.

The siliceous nature of the Barnett Shale, and its relation to fracture enhancement in NE-F, was noted by Lancaster. Also, the second assessment unit, where the Barnett Shale subcrop is Ellenburger Group carbonate rocks, is being tested by several operators. The unit's resource potential unit will be guided by the results of current testing with directional wells and various completion methods to determine optimum completion techniques for gas recovery.[13]
Historically, estimated ultimate recoveries (EURs) for Barnett gas wells at NE-F increased with time, as follows:

300 to 500 million cubic feet (8.5 × 106 to 1.4 × 107 m3) of gas before 1990;
600 to 1000 million cubic feet (1.7 × 107 to 2.8 × 107 m3) of gas between 1990 and 1997; and
800 to 1200 million cubic feet (2.3 × 107 to 3.4 × 107 m3) of gas between 1998 and 2000.

In 2002, Devon Energy reported the mean EUR for Newark East Barnett gas wells is 1.25 billion cubic feet (35×10^6 m3) of gas. The progressive increase in EUR in Barnett wells is the result of improved geologic and engineering concepts that guide development of the Barnett continuous gas play. Moreover, recompletion of wells after about five years of production commonly adds 759 million cubic feet (21.5×10^6 m3) to its EUR.[13]

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?              
              
            

5:47 p.m. July 27, 2017






First Solar shares jump 14% on big earnings beat, strong outlook
              
              First Solar Inc.  shares rallied in the extended session Thursday after the solar-panel company soundly beat Wall Street estimates for both its quarterly results and outlook. First Solar shares surged 14% to $51.26 after hours. The company reported second-quarter net income of $52 million, or 50 cents a share, versus a loss of $11.4 million, or 11 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings were 64 cents a share. Revenue fell to $623.3 million from $1.02 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated earnings of 4 cents a share on revenue of $571.5 million. For the full year, First Solar estimates adjusted earnings of $2 to $2.50 a share on revenue of $3 billion to $3.1 billion. Analysts had previously forecast 57 cents a share on $2.9 billion.

Oil notches another 2-month high, heading for a 7% weekly gain
              
              Oil prices notch another two-month high Thursday, as support from four weeks of falling U.S. crude supplies contributes to a fourth-consecutive session of gains.              
              
            

3:46 p.m. July 27, 2017







Exxon earnings: Will stock trade higher on expected second-quarter beat?
              
              Exxon Mobil is expected to report second-quarter earnings on July 28.               
              
            

2:42 p.m. July 27, 2017






Oil prices up a fourth session in a row
              
              Oil prices climbed for a fourth session Thursday to notch another settlement at a two-month high. Four-consecutive weeks of declines in U.S. crude supplies and pledged cutbacks in exports from some members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have helped support prices, setting them up for a gain of roughly 7% for the week. September WTI crude  rose 29 cents, or 0.6%, to settle $49.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.               
              
            

2:40 p.m. July 27, 2017







European stocks clipped by earnings reports, euro strength  
              
              European stocks end modestly lower Thursday as investors send shares of German lender Deutsche Bank AG down and those for Anheuser-Busch InBev SA’s and Diageo higher amid a barrage of corporate quarterly results.              
              
            

1:05 p.m. July 27, 2017






Dow industrials tag technical target, S&P 500 crawls to latest record high
              
              U.S. stocks are higher early Thursday, rising as a strong second-quarter earnings season continues to take shape.  Against this backdrop, the Dow industrials have tagged a near-term technical target — Dow 21,780 — while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have also concurrently registered all-time highs.              
              
            

11:34 a.m. July 27, 2017






EIA reports a smaller-than-expected rise in U.S. natural-gas supplies
              
              The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported Thursday that domestic supplies of natural gas rose by 17 billion cubic feet for the week ended July 21. Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts forecast a build of 22 billion cubic feet. Total stocks now stand at 2.990 trillion cubic feet, down 302 billion cubic feet from a year ago, but 111 billion cubic feet above the five-year average, the government said. August natural gas  was up 4.1 cents, or 1.4%, from Wednesday's settlement to $2.965 per million British thermal units. It traded at $2.934 before the data.

West Texas’ Permian basin holds nearly as many active oil and gas drilling rigs as the rest of the United States combined — and that includes offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. That’s according to the Energy Information Administration’s November drilling productivity report, which also showed that the Permian is the only region where crude oil production was expected to increase for the third straight month.










The Permian was back in the news this week as two major oil-and-gas companies announced multibillion-dollar deals to snap up land in the area.

Related:  Oil climbs to 1-week highs after Saudi energy minister’s comments  Oil futures have hovered a bit above $50 a barrel this year, following an uptick late last year after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on production cuts with non-OPEC producers. Also late last year, the U.S. Geological Survey announced that it assessed the Permian’s Wolfcamp shale and estimated that it contains 20 billion barrels of oil and 16 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that are “technically recoverable” — they can be produced using existing, available technology and industry practices.   Read also: Energy companies are about ready to loosen the purse strings  The estimate is nearly three times as large as that what the USGS assessed in North Dakota’s Bakken-Three Forks in 2013, “making this the largest estimated continuous oil accumulation that USGS has assessed in the United States to date,” the USGS said.  Even in areas that have produced billions of barrels of oil, there is still the potential to find billions more, Walter Guidroz, program coordinator for the USGS Energy Resources Program, said in a statement.  “Changes in technology and industry practices can have significant effects on what resources are technically recoverable, and that’s why we continue to perform resource assessments throughout the United States and the world,” he said.  The definition of “technically recoverable” does not cover whether it would be profitable to produce these resources.  Hopes for higher crude prices have heated up mergers and acquisitions for oil companies, even though they are still suffering from the effects of low oil prices.

Newark East (Barnett Shale) field, Fort Worth Basin, Texas, is currently the most productive gas field in Texas in terms of daily production and is growing at an annual rate of more than 10%. However, despite the fact that the Barnett play has been studied intensely by very capable geologists and engineers from several companies over a period of many years, there continues to be several misunderstandings concerning fundamental factors controlling the success of the Barnett play of north Texas.
Barnett gas production is poorer in areas near faults and structural flexures (anticlines and synclines). Fractures, which are most abundant in these structural settings, are detrimental to Barnett production. Open natural fractures are rare in the Barnett and have little or nothing to do with Barnett productivity. In areas where Barnett Shale is thermally mature with respect to gas generation, it is slightly overpressured (about 0.52 psi/ft [11.76 kPa/m]). Limestone beds within the Barnett formation are the product of debris flows that originated on a carbonate shelf to the north of the present basin center. It appears that the Barnett can be used as an exploration model for other basins, especially analogous basins of the Ouachita trend.
The history of the development of the Barnett reservoir in north Texas provides an excellent example of how persistence can lead to success in nonconventional gas plays.
Kent A. Bowker has been studying the Barnett Shale since 1997, when Chevron's Non-Conventional Gas Team drilled a vertical wildcat well in Johnson County. He began his career with Gulf Oil in 1980 after earning his master's degree from Oklahoma State University. He worked at Mitchell Energy from 1998 to 2002 and is now an independent producer and consultant.
INTRODUCTION
In December 2001, Newark East (Barnett Shale) field in the Fort Worth Basin became the largest single producing gas field in Texas (in terms of daily production). Currently, the field is producing more than 1.3 bcf/day of gas, and annual production growth is substantially higher than 10%. More than 99% of Barnett production in north Texas is from the Newark East field. Several individuals who have worked in the Barnett play believe that the greater Newark East field will eventually surpass the Hugoton field of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas as the largest onshore gas field in the conterminous United States. However, despite being studied intensely by very capable geologists and engineers from several companies over a period of many years, contention and misunderstandings surrounding several fundamental issues concerning Barnett production continue. In this article, I review several of these contentious issues. I have had discussions with numerous geologists and engineers that are familiar with the Barnett play; to many of them, it appears simple: it is a fractured-shale play, just like other producing gas-shale reservoirs. However, the Barnett is not like the Antrim, Lewis, New Albany, the Devonian shale production of the Appalachian Basin, or any other productive shale in the United States. An exception may be the recent success in the Fayetteville Shale of the Arkoma Basin, but additional data from that nascent play are needed before that can be determined. I do not believe anyone currently understands the true complexity of the largest producing gas field in Texas; but one thing is certain; it is not just a fractured-shale play. Several factors, however, are key elements that make the Barnett such a prolific reservoir.
The purpose of this article is to clarify many of the misconceptions among the cadre of Barnett workers and to illuminate some of the unresolved issues so that those pursuing the Barnett play may benefit from the collected knowledge of geologists and engineers who, although not currently working on the Barnett, are familiar with these unresolved issues because of previous experience with similar unconventional reservoirs.
A vast literature exists (e.g., Wignall, 1994) concerning organic-rich shales that is little used by most involved in Barnett or other shale-gas plays. In particular, the Russian literature is an excellent source of research and information on black shales (e.g., Yudovich and Ketris, 1997, with 4931 references, half in Russian).
Some basic understanding of the Barnett Shale gas play will be required for the reader to place the issues discussed here into their proper context. Articles by Bowker (2003), Pollastro (2003), and Montgomery et al. (2005), and articles in this volume that review the basic geology and engineering of the Barnett will aid the general reader in understanding the issues discussed here.

RELATIONSHIP OF OPEN NATURAL FRACTURES, FAULTS, AND STRUCTURAL FLEXURES TO PRODUCTION

Introduction
The subject of open natural fractures is the most contentious within the community of Barnett workers. When first working with the Barnett Shale, many, including me, have presumed that open natural fractures are critical to Barnett gas production even when informed by experienced colleagues that this is not the case. In fact, if there was an abundance of open natural fractures within the Barnett, there would be a much smaller gas accumulation present within the reservoir. Open natural fractures, if they existed, would have led to major expulsion and migration of gas out of the shale into overlying rocks, substantially decreasing pore pressure within the Barnett and, hence, the amount of gas in place. The Barnett would not be overpressured (that is, overpressured relative to the bounding strata) if copious open natural fractures existed. Note that the Barnett is not just the gas reservoir, but also the source, trap, and seal for the gas; if the seal is fractured and inefficient, then the present gas in place would be much less because the free gas would be lost, and only the adsorbed gas would remain in the shale (a similar situation to that of the Antrim Shale of northern Michigan).
The initial exploration and exploitation strategy for many operators new to the play (including Mitchell Energy and Chevron when they first entered the play) is to test the Barnett near faults, with the assumption that there is increased natural fracture density (i.e., higher permeability) in these areas. This assumption is true: the density of natural fractures is highest near faults, but they are invariably completely healed with carbonate cements. Matrix porosity present in the Barnett near faults is also partially occluded with calcite (i.e., there is lower matrix porosity) near faults. The history of fracture-filling cementation within the Barnett has not been studied, but it is apparent from the macroscopic precipitation banding present in the larger fractures that there were several episodes of fracture filling. This evidence indicates that fractures were once open, but hot, mineral-laden water, probably from the underlying Ellenburger and possibly Viola (see Hill et al., 2007, for a stratigraphic column of the basin), moved up through the fractures, forming these carbonate cements (Bethke and Marshak, 1990).


Open Natural Fractures
It generally takes about 2–3 yr of experience in the Barnett Shale play of north Texas for the geologist or engineer to realize that open natural fractures are insignificant to the productivity of the Barnett. Open natural fractures are of little importance to Barnett production because they do not exist (except in very rare and isolated examples; I have only observed three open natural fractures, each about 0.5 in. [1 cm] long, in the hundreds of feet of core I have examined). That is not to say that natural fractures are not abundant in Barnett cores; they are, but they are nearly always healed with cement, commonly calcite (this counters the argument that we do not see the open natural fractures because we are relying on a vertical core, an orientation that presumably would reduce the odds of finding natural, near-vertical, fractures). Our natural bias as conventionally trained engineers and geologists is to identify a fracture-permeability network that will transmit gas from the matrix of the rock to the wellbore. The usual logic of those new to the Barnett is that induced fractures created during completion operations must enhance the existing open natural-fracture network. The matrix permeability of the Barnett is measured in nanodarcys, so it appears that this rock is too tight to transmit the large volumes of gas produced without the aid of natural open fractures. To envision how gas could move through such dense shale (which has the lowest matrix permeability of any strata within the sedimentary column of the Fort Worth Basin) without the presence of open natural fractures is difficult. How can one of the most productive reservoirs in Texas also be the least permeable?
Open natural fractures may not be a factor in Barnett gas production, but several completion engineers active in the Barnett believe that the healed natural fractures act to enhance the effectiveness of the induced fracture treatments (e.g., H. L. Matthews and R. Suarez-Rivera, 2004, personal communication). Their argument is persuasive: the healed fractures act as zones of weakness that serve to deflect the growing induced fracture. The following thought experiment helps to illustrate the point (R. Suarez-Rivera, 2005, personal communication). If one drills a hole in a thick block of glass that is under anisotropic lateral strain and then pressurizes the hole with water, the glass will crack along a single plane. However, if we first shatter the glass and then glue the pieces back together perfectly (so that there are no remaining voids) and repeat the procedure, the block of glass will fracture along many planes. The presence of open natural fractures would actually inhibit the growth of induced fractures. When a crack forms in a steel beam or piece of sheet metal, the propagation of the fracture can be halted by drilling a hole at the tip of the fracture. By eliminating the stress point at the tip of the fracture, the stresses causing the propagation of the fracture are dispersed, and the fracture no longer grows.
I believe that the combination of diffusion, a very high gas concentration within the Barnett, and the rock's ability to fracture is what makes the play successful. The Barnett is not a fractured-shale play; it is a shale-that-can-be-fractured play (D. Miller, 2004, personal communication).


Faults and Structural Flexures
As noted above, the Barnett is highly fractured near major fault zones. These fractures, although now healed, appear to weaken the physical integrity of the Barnett within the fault zone. This weakness, in turn, allows the energy and fluid from our hydraulic-fracture stimulations to be diverted along the fault plane and into the underlying, commonly more porous, and commonly water-saturated Ellenburger Group carbonates. Several companies have drilled wells as close as 500 ft (152.4 m) to known major fault zones where induced fractures did not propagate into Ellenburger water, but wells located within fault zones have not been successful to date.
On average, wells located on structural flexures (anticlines and synclines) and karst tend to be poorer producers than those not associated with structures (Zhao, 2004). Again, because of natural fractures in these structural folds, hydraulic-fracture stimulations may not be contained within the Barnett, but may be diverted downward into underlying Viola and/or Ellenburger formations, thus resulting in the Barnett being understimulated.


GAS GENERATION VERSUS PRESSURE PRESERVATION IN NONCONVENTIONAL RESERVOIRS: THE SOURCE OF OVERPRESSURE IN THE BARNETT SHALE
A debate has been ongoing among respected colleagues concerning the overpressure found in various gas basins (including the Greater Green River and Fort Worth basins). The debate centers on a central issue: the cause of present-day overpressuring in some basin-centered (continuous-type) gas deposits. Generally, two hypotheses are championed to explain this phenomenon.

Hypothesis 1
The overpressured formations, which are commonly not only the reservoir but also the source rock for the gas, are in the hydrocarbon-generation window. For example, the Barnett reservoir (and, hence, hydrocarbon source) in Newark East field currently averages approximately 180°F (82°C), putting it barely into the hydrocarbon-generating window. The Barnett has an average total organic carbon (TOC) within the field of 4.5 wt.%, classifying it as very rich. Therefore, hydrocarbons are currently being generated within the Barnett, thus causing overpressure. This hypothesis is commonly promulgated by workers that have a difficult time understanding the mechanics of hypothesis 2 described below (that is, they do not have a full comprehension of the power of capillary pressure). The problem with hypothesis 1 is a misunderstanding of basic chemical kinetics. Any basin not currently experiencing progressive burial (or increased heat flow) equivalent at least to the maximum burial depth and heat flow reached during its geologic history (i.e., every cratonic basin in North America) cannot be presently generating hydrocarbons (D. M. Jarvie, 2003, personal communication). The reason is that as organic material (i.e., kerogen) is subjected to increased heat, complex molecules are broken down into smaller molecules. For any given precursor organic matter, the chemical bonds that hold the complex molecules together will break at a given temperature. As burial depth increases and, hence, the temperature rises, progressively simpler molecules will be generated by the breakdown (i.e., cracking) of more complex precursor molecules. Once a basin stops subsiding (or there is no increase in heat flow), this cracking of the more complex molecules ceases. As a basin subsides, the temperature (and, hence, the activation energy) experienced by the organic matter in the source rocks increases. Chemical bonds that are broken at, say, 200°F (93°C), will be broken during burial as the source rock passes down through the 200°F (93°C) thermocline. During uplift, the source rock may yet again be exposed to 200°F (93°C), but the bonds that would be broken at 200°F (93°C) have already been broken during burial; thus, no additional hydrocarbons can be generated. For the Barnett to generate more hydrocarbons, it will have to be exposed to a higher temperature (i.e., to a higher activation energy) than it experienced in the past.


Hypothesis 2
The present-day overpressure (approximately 0.52 psi/ft [11.76 kPa/m]) is actually preserved from a normal pressure gradient (or slightly overpressured gradient formed by the generation of hydrocarbons at the time of maximum heat flow) established in the geologic past. The extremely low permeability (more precisely, the extremely high capillary pressure) of the Barnett permits this. Vitrinite reflectance profiles and basin modeling (Pollastro et al., 2007) from the Fort Worth Basin indicate that several thousand feet of upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments have been eroded since the time of maximum burial in the Permian. The current average depth of the Barnett in Newark East field is about 7500 ft (2300 m); hence, the average reservoir pressure in the Barnett is  If we assume a normal hydrostatic pressure gradient of 0.44 psi/ft (9.95 kPa/m) (which is the pore-pressure gradient of the Ellenburger in the basin), we only need to have eroded  of overburden to account for the 0.52 psi/ft (11.76 kPa/m) seen in the Barnett. We know that the Barnett is the source of nearly all the hydrocarbons now found in the Fort Worth Basin (Jarvie et al., 2001, 2003; Pollastro, 2003; Pollastro et al., 2004; Montgomery et al., 2005), so the Barnett must have been leaking throughout the time of hydrocarbon generation and subsequent uplift. More so, Barnett-sourced gas is presently migrating to the surface in the basin; however, the Barnett is tight enough (Figure 1) to absorb the 600 psi (4136 kPa) differential (this value is taken at the average depth of 7500 ft [2300 m] cited above) across the formation boundaries above and below the shale itself and retard the complete depressurization of itself.Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 1 Typical mercury-porosimetery curve for the organic-rich facies of the Barnett Shale. Note that the average pore-throat radius is 50 Å. The Barnett is a very efficient seal, in addition to being one of the most prolific gas reservoirs in Texas.
Several formal presentations (primarily by personnel from Devon) report that the Barnett Shale outside the core producing areas of Wise, Denton, and northern Tarrant counties (i.e., Johnson County) is not overpressured. I do not believe this is the case based on three lines of reasoning. First, the geologic history and processes that caused overpressure in the Barnett within the core area are similar to those outside the core area (Johnson County). The Barnett burial history in Johnson County would thus have to be much different than in the core area for the Barnett not to be overpressured, but stratigraphic and vitrinite reflectance profiles constructed for both areas show similar geologic histories. Second, I suspect that those who state that the Barnett in Johnson County is not overpressured are unfamiliar with how the Barnett was determined to be overpressured in the core area in the first place. When Mitchell Energy initiated the development of the Barnett in the Newark East core area, the company performed numerous prefracture-treatment, 10-day pressure dip-in tests (following limited casing perforation and a very limited breakdown of those perforations, the well is shut in for 10 days; a pressure bomb is then run in the hole to measure the bottom-hole pressure) to locate areas of pressure depletion caused by faulting. The dip-in tests actually measure formation deliverability better than they measure formation pore pressure. Of the more than 30 tests performed, only a few showed gradients of 0.52 psi/ft (11.76 kPa/m). The remaining tests with lower gradients did not indicate lower reservoir pressure in the area of the tested well, only that there was lower permeability. Because the maximum recorded pressure gradient was 0.52 psi/ft (11.76 kPa/m), this value for the Barnett was reported by various Mitchell workers in the literature (Lancaster et al., 1993). In Johnson County, only a few pressure buildup tests prior to fracture treatment were performed to definitively characterize the reservoir pressure gradient; however, I suspect that reservoir pressures are similar to Newark East at 0.52 psi/ft (11.76 kPa/m). Finally, recent excellent production results from horizontal wells drilled in Johnson County (some of the best producing wells to date in the play are in Johnson County) indicates that the Barnett is similarly overpressured as in the Newark East core area.


ORIGIN OF LIMESTONE BEDS AND CALCAREOUS NODULES WITHIN THE BARNETT
There has been some discrepancy among Barnett workers regarding the nature of numerous limestone beds, most of them less than 3 ft (0.91 m) thick, within the Barnett, including the Forestburg limestone unit. Some believe (for example, Johnson, 2003) that these limestone units resulted from marine regression and the resultant formation of carbonate shoals, similar to those described as Bahamian banks and shoals. Limestone beds within the Barnett can be correlated for miles across the basin. The origin of these limestone beds is of economic interest because, although they are rarely productive, any increased carbonate content lowers the volume of shale gas in place. Thus, any depositional model that can predict location, distribution, and thickness of these limestone beds would be helpful in the exploration and exploitation of the Barnett. The shoaling model is, however, unreasonable. Unfortunately, most Barnett workers have apparently not had access to Barnett core and have, therefore, based their interpretation solely on electrical-image logs.
Evidence from visual core analysis indicates that these limestone beds within the Barnett originated from submarine debris flows with a possible provenance in southern Oklahoma. An additional source of this carbonate debris has been proposed by Hall (2003) in the then nascent Muenster arch, but this seems unlikely because the Muenster arch does not appear to have had any prominent relief until after the Barnett was deposited.


Core examination clearly shows that the carbonate material was deposited in beds that contain many of the defining characteristics of a debris flow: scoured basal contact containing rip-up clasts of Barnett Shale in a chaotic mixture with fossil debris, fining-upward sequence exhibiting characteristics of continuous deposition within a single event, and upward gradation into black-shale deposition (Figures 2, 3).

Isolith mapping of the Forestburg limestone within the Barnett clearly indicates that the greatest thickness of limestone within the Barnett is where the Barnett was (and currently is) structurally deepest (Figure 4). It seems unlikely that if the limestones truly represent shoaling sequences, they would be concentrated in the deepest part of the basin.

Limestone nodules in the Barnett are occasionally observed on electrical-image well logs. I believe that not all carbonate nodules in the Barnett are of diagenetic origin, but some may be the result of soft-sediment deformation (the formation of recumbent folds within carbonate layers caused by sediment instability). Similar structures have been described in the Green River Formation oil shales by Grabowski and Pevear (1985). Examination of Barnett core bolsters this contention. However, recent work by P. K. Papazis (2005, personal communication) indicates that some carbonate nodules are indeed diagenetic in origin.

WHY SOME PARTS OF THE CORE AREA OF THE FIELD ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS
Within the main producing area of the Newark East field (called the “core” producing areas by Barnett workers), there are at least two well-defined areas where the Barnett is most productive. One is in southeast Wise County (centered on the Pearl Cox lease), and the other is in northern Tarrant County (centered on the Bonds Ranch lease). Why these two areas are more productive, no matter the completion technique, is not certain, but it must be for one (or a combination) of the following reasons: (1) these areas have a better gas-transmission mechanism, or (2) more gas in place exists (i.e., higher gas concentration). Understanding the geologic reasons why these two areas have higher productivity would aid in the exploration and exploitation efforts of the play, but currently, the reason(s) are unknown.

Gas Transmission
No published study has systematically examined the permeability and diffusivity of the Barnett, and to my knowledge, no such study exists in industry. Wire-line logs do not directly determine permeability and diffusivity in the Barnett; thus, we can only use measurements from core. Further, only Devon Energy has sufficient core material across the field to conduct a systematic study.


Gas in Place
In the Barnett, gas is stored in pore spaces and adsorbed onto organic matter (clay does not appear to adsorb gas in the Barnett based on limited adsorption experiments run on only the clay fraction extracted from the Barnett). In the Barnett core area where production is greatest, there may be a higher concentration of organic matter in the Barnett resulting in higher gas-in-place volumes. Only estimates of the concentration of organic matter present in the Barnett can be derived from standard wire-line logs, and it is not apparent from these wire-line logs that, in fact, there is an increased concentration of organic matter in these two areas. Again, only the analysis of core samples can best provide the answer to these questions. In addition, differences in shale diagenesis in one area compared to another would directly affect the petrophysical properties of the shale and may explain local variations in gas production.


BASIN HISTORY AND THE ROLE OF OUACHITA HEATING
The many foreland basins of the Ouachita system (with the possible exception of sections of the Permian Basin of west Texas) have experienced abnormally high thermal gradients in the geologic past (Bethke and Marshak, 1990). These basins (namely, the Arkoma, Fort Worth, certain subbasins of the Permian Basin, and, to some extent, the Black Warrior) have historically produced dry gas in the regions adjacent to the Ouachita thrusting. In the Fort Worth Basin, it has been shown that the proximity to the Ouachita front and not the depth of burial is the major controlling factor in thermal maturity (Bowker, 2003; Pollastro et al., 2004). Hot brine squeezed out in front of the advancing Ouachita system and moving forward through the Ellenburger (Bethke and Marshak, 1990; Kupecz and Land, 1991) appears to be the source of the increased heat flow.
Because the movement of hot fluid through the Ellenburger appears to have controlled the thermal maturity of the Barnett, structural features (predominantly faults) are a factor in determining the Barnett's thermal maturity because (1) hot water probably flowed up faults into the overlying Barnett, increasing the thermal maturity in some fault blocks more than in others; and (2) faults could have acted as baffles and diverted hot Ellenberger water around certain fault blocks. The calorific content of produced Barnett gas varies systemically within a major fault block, with the lower British thermal unit content closest to the Ouachita front. However, the British thermal unit content will jump by several tens of British thermal units across a major fault, e.g., the Mineral Wells fault that cuts across the northern core area of Newark East field. The calorific value of gas produced from the Barnett (or even shallower reservoirs) can be used to map major fault trends. A systematic examination of Ellenberger core across the Fort Worth Basin may illuminate the thermal history of the basin.

THE BARNETT AS AN EXPLORATION MODEL
Once one acquires a basic understanding of what makes the Barnett so productive, exploring for similar accumulations is straightforward. The explorationist should not look for fractured, gas-saturated shales, but instead, for gas-saturated shales that can be fractured. The details are, of course, more complex, but they are fundamentally associated with two primary related variables: (1) shale composition (mineralogy) and (2) resulting gas-in-place volumes.

Gas in Place
To have an economic shale-gas play, there must be a sufficient amount of gas in place within the shale. Thus, the shale must also be a hydrocarbon source rock that generated large volumes of either thermal or biogenic gas. To have generated such large volumes of gas, the shale needs to have been rich in organic matter, relatively thick, and have been exposed to a source of heat in excess of usual global geothermal gradients. Gas is stored in the Barnett via two mechanisms. Gas is stored in the matrix porosity and/or adsorbed onto organic matter (Bowker, 2003). Thus, the shale in question has to have sufficient organic matter and/or enough matrix porosity to store quantities of gas sufficient to make the shale viable as an exploration target.

Concentration of Organic Matter
The organic carbon concentration in the Barnett ranges from less than 0.5 to more than 6 wt.%, with an average of about 4.5 wt.% (Bowker, 2003), and the amount of adsorbed gas is proportional to the amount of organic carbon in the Barnett (Mavor, 2003). Intervals with higher concentrations of organic carbon commonly exhibit higher gas in place and, generally, the highest matrix porosity and the lowest clay content. All three of these factors probably act to make higher TOC zones more prospective. The minimum TOC required for a prospective shale to become a viable exploration target is not known, but appears to be about 2.5–3 wt.%.


Thickness
Geoscientists do not know how thin the Barnett can be and still produce economic quantities of gas. In the Michigan Basin, the productive zone within the Antrim is about 30 ft (10 m) thick in the productive fairway. For the Barnett, it appears that 100 ft (30 m) will prove to be thick enough for commercial production (although in areas where the Barnett is that thin, it is also thermally less mature, and it is relatively shallow), but 50 ft (15 m) may be too thin.


Thermal Maturation
The prospective shale must have been well within the thermal gas-generation window to be a potential exploration target for shale-gas production. Jarvie et al. (2007) reviews the various techniques and analyses that can be used to assess thermal maturation. To produce economic rates of gas, the Barnett must be well within the gas window.


Matrix Porosity
Some geoscientists think that approximately half the gas at Newark East field is stored in matrix porosity (Bowker, 2003). However, there is a growing belief among some Barnett workers, and based on apparently proprietary data, that substantially more than 50% of the gas in place is stored in matrix porosity. Novel techniques, first developed under contract of the Gas Research Institute, must be employed to accurately measure porosity in rocks as impermeable as the Barnett; conventional laboratory measurements are not adequate. Few laboratories are capable of determining these measurements accurately. Water saturation is even more difficult to measure in shales. Of course, both porosity and water saturation must be known to adequately assess the viability of a new exploration play. The organic-rich parts of the Barnett average approximately 5.5% porosity and 25% water saturation (Bowker, 2003).



Mineralogy
Most shales contain a high concentration of clay minerals; conversely, the Barnett and many of the other productive shales do not. In prospecting for Barnett-type shales, the explorationist must look for rock that can be fractured, that is, shale with a low enough concentration (generally less than 50%) of clay minerals to allow it to be successfully fracture stimulated. These types of shales were mostly deposited in restricted areas and only during specific geologic time intervals; e.g., the Devonian–Mississippian Antrim Shale of Michigan or the subject Barnett Shale.


SHORT NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF PRODUCTION FROM THE BARNETT IN NORTH TEXAS
Figure 5 shows the production history of Newark East field; it is unique in the oil and gas industry. The most apparent feature is the large increase in production that began in 1999. What happened in that year? Why did it take 17 yr for production to take off (and why did Mitchell Energy stay with the play so long with so little to show for it productionwise)? Another unusual aspect of the field's production history is that the combined production from wells that were completed before 1999 actually have higher total yearly production in 2003 than they did in 1998. I cannot explain why Mitchell stuck with the Barnett for so long without seeing any real success; I trust that history will be chronicled soon by those that were at Mitchell during that period. Two reasons exist for the large production increase in 1999: the discovery that the true gas in place is nearly four times what was previously believed and the successful application of water fractures (basically a combination of water, friction reducer, bactericide, scale inhibitor, and low sand concentration) in the play that decreased the total well costs substantially. These two discoveries led to the restimulation of existing wells (hence, the increase in the production from pre-1999 wells mentioned above), downspacing, successful completions in the previously unproductive upper Barnett, and a huge overall improvement in the economics of the play. (See Bowker, 2003, for a detailed account of how the gas content of the Barnett was determined and Walker et al., 1998, for a review of water fractures in the Barnett of north Texas.)Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure 5 Newark East (Barnett Shale) field yearly production curve (data through September 2005). Production is color coded based on the year of completion. Note the steep increase in gas production starting in 1999. Data are from the Texas Railroad Commission (2005).
The production curve (Figure 5) has steadily increased thanks to improved understanding of the Barnett and, most significantly, the widespread deployment of horizontal drilling techniques in the play starting in 2002.

SUMMARY
Misunderstanding and confusion continue regarding the prolific Barnett Shale reservoir of north Texas. This article is an attempt to clarify some of these issues, including the insignificance of open natural fractures in the productivity of the Barnett, the origin of limestone beds found in the Barnett, the source of the relatively high heat flow in the basin, and the origin of overpressuring in the Barnett. Many important aspects of the Barnett continue to be a mystery; no one completely understands the prolific nature of gas production from the Barnett at the present time. The Barnett play continues to grow at an astonishing rate, and it is serving as a model for similar gas-shale plays now being developed.
Acknowledgments
Most of my understanding of shale reservoirs came from discussions with numerous colleagues over the past several years, starting with my teammates on Chevron's Non-Conventional Gas (NCG) Team, especially Deane Foss (who brought me into the team) and Bryan Cotner. Back in 1992, the former president of Chevron USA Production Company, Ray Galvin, had the foresight to anticipate the importance of nonconventional gas sources to the nation's supply, so he formed the NCG Team. My involvement in the team changed the direction of my career, for which I am very grateful. I am also thankful to my colleagues and management at Mitchell Energy, where I had the pleasure and privilege to participate in the explosive growth of Barnett gas production. George P. Mitchell is owed the highest gratitude from me and the rest of those that are benefiting from his patience during the extended (and hardly economic) Barnett learning period. Besides the Barnett, many of the nascent shale plays in the world would not have even been contemplated without G. P. Mitchell's steadfastness during the first 17 yr of Barnett development.
Ron Hill, Rich Pollastro (who reviewed an earlier version of the manuscript), and the other editors of this special issue have been more than patient with me during the preparation of this article; and I thank them for the opportunity to address some of the critical issues in the Barnett play of north Texas. Comments and suggestions by John D. Bredehoeft, Nick Tew, and an anonymous AAPG Bulletin reviewer improved the manuscript substantially.
