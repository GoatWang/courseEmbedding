The online resource for catastrophe bond and insurance linked investments





















Kinesis

Apr 5th, 2014 by Editor | Comments Off on Kinesis 





AUM: ~ <$1 billion
Established: 2013
Highlights: Specialises in multi-class collateralised reinsurance and retrocession; third-party capital division of Lancashire Holdings Limited; significant expertise in both elemental and non-elemental insurance.
 
Investment strategy
Kinesis writes contracts at two periods each year and at other times when KCM determines there is an attractive reinsurance market opportunity. The fund will operate independently whilst accessing Lancashire’s underwriting expertise.
Fund Structures
Kinesis Re is both a Segregated Account Company (SAC) and Special Purpose Insurer, while Kinesis Holdings is a SAC. Investors own preference shares of Kinesis Holdings, which are linked to the different reinsurance contracts written by Kinesis Re.
Kinesis Capital Management Limited was incorporated in June 2013. It currently provides underwriting and other services via an underwriting services agreement with Kinesis Reinsurance I Limited (Kinesis Re), a special purpose insurer that underwrites multi-class reinsurance business on a fully-collateralized basis on its own balance sheet. Third party investors subscribe for shares in Kinesis Holdings I Limited, the parent of Kinesis Re, which is a segregated account holding company. Its segregated accounts will be identified with particular segregated accounts of Kinesis Re writing the reinsurance contracts.
History
2005: Lancashire Holdings Limited is incorporated in Bermuda.
2006: Sirocco, an energy sidecar, is launched to profit from the spike is energy insurance prices.
2011: Accordion Re, a worldwide retro sidecar, is launched to profit from the retro market pricing dislocation after the large number of events that have occurred throughout that year.
2012: Saltire Re, a multi-class sidecar, is launched to provide capacity in the multi-class space where supply is scarce.
2013: Kinesis is launched.
Ownership
Lancashire Holdings Limited, KCM employees and certain employees of the Lancashire group.
