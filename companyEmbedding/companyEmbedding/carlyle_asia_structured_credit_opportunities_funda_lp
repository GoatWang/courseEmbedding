Structured Credit










 









 Overview


The Structured Credit team invests in corporate loans and bonds through structured vehicles and managed accounts. Linda Pace oversees the U.S. Structured Credit team and Colin Atkins oversees the European Structured Credit team.



 Investment Approach
The Carlyle Structured Credit team generally focuses on performing senior secured bank loans rated below investment grade in the U.S. and European markets. Investment professionals practice a disciplined, anticipatory investment approach that is focused on identifying investment opportunities and proactively managing credit and market risk. Through stringent credit selection and monitoring, the team seeks to avoid defaults and maximize recoveries. The team also engages in active trading to improve credit quality. Carlyle Structured Credit strives to achieve high current income from quarterly or semi-annual cash distributions.
The Structured Credit team has long-standing close relationships with arrangers of leveraged finance and secondary market makers, and also has the benefit of Carlyle’s extensive network and strong relationships with the financial community. The team sources assets from both the primary and secondary market and has deal flow relationships with all major counterparties active in the U.S. and European leveraged finance markets, as well as strong relationships with nearly all private equity sponsors in these regions.
Carlyle Structured Credit's investment approach is highlighted as follows:
Leverage the investment team's demonstrated analytical, trading and investment management expertise with The Carlyle Group’s superior industry, company and market knowledge.
Source investment ideas through The Carlyle Group's extensive industry relationships and network of contacts.
Invest in quality companies that offer high current income with a low risk of principal loss using fundamental credit analysis.
Construct and actively manage portfolio asset allocations based upon fund objectives and expectations for macro economic performance.

The D.C.-based private equity giant The Carlyle Group(NASDAQ: CG) is opening up new investments in Asia with a fresh $235 million investment fund, according to recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
The Carlyle Asia Structured Credit Opportunities Fund-A LP was first formed on Dec. 5, 2014, but closed its year-long pooled investment funding round on Dec. 4, 2015.

The Carlyle Group declined to comment. But an earlier statement on The Carlyle Group’s website regarding the new fund highlighted an imbalance of supply and demand for access to capital in Asia, and there is a long-term opportunity for “attractive returns” on investment.




The structured credit fund will apparently focus on “securitization” — grouping a series of loans and assets that generate regular payments together into an investment product — of corporate and consumer loans that are sold in pieces known as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs).
Carlyle’s structured credit business issued $4.9 billion in CLOs across America and Europe in 2014 and reached a total of $17 billion in assets under management at the end of 2014.
The company made news recently when it swung to a sudden loss in the third quarter. The Carlyle Group posted a loss of $84 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2015, down from a profit of $25 million in the same quarter of last year.
The sudden drop was driven largely by the market valuations of the companies in its portfolio on the final day of September, when the market saw significant swings, co-founder David Rubenstein said in an earnings call with analysts, and rebounded as the market continued to strengthen.
