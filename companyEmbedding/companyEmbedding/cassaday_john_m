Our Commitment To You






Our goal is to produce results that help you reach your objectives. Our staff leverages their intellectual and experiential firepower to craft leading edge solutions that address your challenges. Our culture of collaboration means that your dedicated team of experts design and construct a comprehensive, integrated wealth management plan that provides an ongoing continuum of proactive advice and guidance.
Team highlights:

Client service excellence is our hallmark. Our size and structure enable us to be agile, adaptive, and responsive. No recordings, no robots, no annoying phone menus but real professional people who know you personally and are attentive to your specific needs. Our support staff averages 18 years of industry tenure, and has the resources, skill, and judgment necessary to provide prompt, comprehensive professional assistance.
Our employees think like owners and are motivated to put clients first. Every employee is paid based on the firm’s gross revenue. Our livelihood is directly related to your continued satisfaction. We work collaboratively, hold each other accountable, and set high expectations for one another to identify the best possible outcomes for you.
Continuity of advice. A major concern today is that clients may outlive their financial advisor, and no one wants to be looking for a new advisor at age 80. To address this, our seasoned professionals are training the next generation of advisors and staff to serve our clients for decades to come. Our average employee is 33 years old and this is by design. We want our clients to be secure knowing their wealth management will be applied proactively and continuously, and will span decades and generations.
Continuity. Less than 20% of advisory firms have a succession plan according to Cerulli and Associates. We believe that providing for an orderly transition is part of our fiduciary duty. Our succession agreement provides for an orderly and seamless transfer of firm ownership and governance.
We give you access to resources, techniques, and strategies that are typically only available to large institutions and ultra high net worth investors. Our credentialed team pursues continuous improvement through ongoing education and training, allowing the application of best practices to our wealth management process. While many firms outsource their investment research, trading, and financial planning services, these services are provided in-house at Cassaday & Company, Inc. and are included in your fee—which means highly sophisticated, integrated solutions for you at a reasonable price.
We make it a top priority to identify, attract, and retain top-notch employees. The low turnover at our firm shows the value we place in continuity and stability for our workforce. Employee satisfaction, professional development, and workplace excellence are key components for a sustainable enterprise with satisfied clients.

John M. Cassaday, president and CEO, Corus Entertainment



 
By Strategy Staff
 

                                                                January 1, 2006                            






John M. Cassaday, president and CEO, Corus Entertainment 
John Cassaday is like that over-achieving kid you hated yet secretly admired in high school. It seems like no matter what marketing effort he has attempted, Cassaday, head of Corus since 1999, has excelled.
In the 1980s, while president of Campbell’s Soup, he both retrenched the position of the company’s soup products and expanded its iconic red label into the growing market of frozen food entrees, says current president Philip Donne. As well, Cassaday helped to position Campbell’s soup as a staple in the then-emerging category of comfort food.
When he helmed CTV in 1989, Cassaday took that CPG view of marketing and made the net more appealing to buyers. Radical for the time, he recalls: ‘We set out to gain an understanding of our clients’ interests and try to create integrated solutions. That started to change the relationships between media players, agencies and clients, where previously there was never much contact between media and client.’
Cassaday has brought that same philosophy to Corus and refined it. YTV, Treehouse and Discovery Kids in particular have attracted and held not only viewers but also toy marketers. ‘You see [it] in the incredibly integrated activities that we [have] with clients like Hasbro and Mattel.’
Observers credit his success to an ability to quickly grasp the challenges of change in an industry. In the fast-paced media world, says Andrew Black, president/CEO of Virgin Mobile Canada and award judge, ‘there are lots of moving parts when you are dealing with pop culture and changes in regulations,’ he says, adding, ‘That’s quite different than selling soup.’

David Bloom
Winner 2011
Shopper's Drug Mart
David Bloom, the ebullient and energetic executive who scripted the rise of Shoppers Drug Mart into a dominant role as Canada’s only national drug store chain, retired from the company in 2001 after 18 years as its chairman and chief executive.That Shoppers Drug can dub itself a “world-class retailer” is due in no small part to Bloom’s leadership. Beginning as a Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacist in Toronto’s Yorkdale community in 1967, he moved on a fast management trajectory that culminated with his appointment as president and chief executive in 1983, at the age of 39. Bloom succeeded Shoppers Drug Mart founder Murray Koffler as chairman three years later upon Koffler’s retirement.As the company’s top officer, Bloom led a doubling of store count, a fourfold increase in sales and a tenfold jump in earnings. In fiscal 1999, the last year for which figures are available, Shoppers reached C$4.3 billion in sales ($2.8 billion at current exchange), with sales per square foot reaching (U.S.) $558. Net earnings that year rose 30 percent to (U.S.) $157 million. Since becoming a private company Shoppers Drug no longer reports financial results.More significant to Shoppers’ future, Bloom also pushed a culture of restless innovation and self-renewal. That drive led to Project Eagle, a re-engineering of all aspects of Shoppers’ supply chain and distribution management, purchasing, store merchandising and operations, which began in 1995.The result, noted Shoppers, is “state-of-the-art distribution, purchasing and merchandising systems.” Bloom is also credited for his role in the launch of such private label brands as Life, Quo and Rialto, as well as the creation and branding of marketing and service programs like Health-Watch, PharmExpert and the extremely successful Shoppers Optimum loyalty card.

Ed Marra
Winner 2008
Nestle Canada
Right up until his untimely death at age 54 from pancreatic cancer, Ed Marra lived with an intense ‘passion to win.’ This statement – included as the signature line of all his emails – drove every decision he made, both personally and professionally.
After graduating with an MBA from Concordia after earning his B.Comm from Loyola, Marra began his lifelong affair with food at Robin Hood Multi-Foods, soon working on the Stouffer’s brand. After five years at Robin Hood, Marra jumped to Nestlé when it acquired the license to market the Stouffer’s brand from Robin Hood.
He held a series of positions in the Nestlé organization, including several senior management positions in the U.S. and the managing director title in Canada before ultimately being named Executive Vice-President at Nestlé S.A. head office in Switzerland.
A constant innovator, he famously launched the new Lean Cuisine frozen dinner in Canada by serving it to trade buyers right in the plastic tray on Royal York Hotel’s best china, and hired then-risky Tina Turner as after-dinner entertainment.
Marra’s contributions at Nestlé established a legacy that continues today. His passion for marketing excellence, commitment to effective trade relationships, thirst for customer insight and open leadership style are cornerstones of his legacy. To commemorate his contribution, Nestlé Canada has instituted the annual Ed Marra Marketing Excellence Awards.
As a 30-year veteran of the packaged-goods industry, Marra served on the executive committees of such organizations as the Food Industry Association, and the Food and Consumer Product Manufacturers of Canada, and as a member of the Grocery Industry Foundation.

Andrew Brandt
Winner 2007
LCBO
Born in London, Ontario, Andrew Brandt moved to Sarnia in the 1960s where he established a successful company importing and selling musical instruments.

In 1971, he entered politics and embarked on a long and distinguished career in public service, serving on Sarnia City Council for almost a decade, including three terms as mayor. In 1981, he was elected as MPP for Sarnia and served as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Labour.

George Cohon
Winner 2007
McDonald's Restaurants of Canada
George Cohon, a practicing lawyer from Chicago, moved to Toronto in 1967 as the Licensee of McDonald’s Corporation for Eastern Canada. He expanded the McDonald’s business in this part of the country at a very rapid pace through the years 1968, ’69 and ’70. George was one of McDonald’s Corporation’s largest licensees in July 1971, at which time McDonald’s Corporation acquired his license agreement. George continued to lead the brand, however, as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer when McDonald’s Restaurants of Canada was formed in 1971, a position he held for 25 years
Mr. Cohon spearheaded the opening of McDonald’s in the former Soviet Union. Negotiations began in 1976, culminating in the opening in 1990 of the first Moscow McDonald’s restaurant.
McDonald’s Restaurants in Canada today includes over 1,375 restaurants, sales of over $2.55 billion per year and employs over 77,000 people. Today there are 152 McDonald’s restaurants in Russia, 18,000 employees in the Russian Company serving 600,000 customers each day. Moscow’s Pushkin Square site still ranks as the world’s busiest McDonald’s.
A part of what has made McDonald’s so successful in Canada is grass roots marketing. While the notion of grass roots marketing has only come onto the radars of companies in recent times, it has been a part of McDonald’s DNA in Canada from its earliest days. Whether it’s through on-site birthday parties (a highly successful community program), innovative use of local radio, and sponsorships of local kids’ teams, local community initiatives have driven the brand’s success.
Mr. Cohon is the founding patron of Ronald McDonald Houses in Canada and Russia. These help children in need, and Ronald McDonald, as a brand icon, is constantly advocating for children through self-esteem and active lifestyle programs. He also created McHappy Day in Canada, which has since evolved into World Children’s Day. His autobiography, To Russia with Fries, was published in 1997.
Mr. Cohon was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1992. He has received the Order of Ontario for his charitable endeavors. He was awarded Russia’s Order of Friendship (one of Russia’s highest public service award) from Russian President Boris Yeltsin. He has received the Israel Prime Minister’s Medal (Israel’s highest public service award).
Today, George maintains the role of “Founder” McDonald’s Restaurants of Canada and Russia.

Donald L. Triggs
Winner 2006
Vincor International
Growing up in rural Manitoba, Donald L. Triggs’ passion for the land and its fruits started at an early age. This passion, married with his obvious business acumen, has come full circle as he now lends his talents to Canada’s fastest growing wine company, Jackson-Triggs, along with its parent company, Vincor International Inc. and his newest undertaking, Delaine Vineyard.
Triggs’ university education prepared him well for the success he now enjoys. After receiving a B.Sc. (Honours) in agriculture from the University of Manitoba, he continued his studies at the University of Western Ontario, where he earned his MBA.
A marketer at heart, Triggs got his start at Colgate-Palmolive in product management. After rising through the marketing ranks, he went on to manage John Labatt’s wine businesses in Canada and then in the United States. In the 1980s, he ran the North American and then global, horticultural business of Fisons PLC. However, his most important career move came in 1989, when he joined with friend, Allan Jackson, to negotiate the management buyout of Labatt’s Canadian wine interests.
Since that time, Triggs has steered the new company, now called Vincor International, through a series of strategic mergers and acquisitions. Publicly traded since 1996, Vincor is the leading vintner in Canada, and the fourth-largest wine producer in North America.
Complementing his work for Vincor, Triggs has been able to express his personal love of viticulture, and the art and science of winemaking, through Jackson-Triggs. Together with Allan Jackson, Triggs established the Jackson-Triggs brand in 1993, introducing two classic wines, which were exceptionally well received by consumers and the industry. Today, an extensive portfolio of Proprietors’ Selection and VQA Proprietors’ Reserve and Grand Reserve wines is produced in both the Okanagan Valley and the Niagara Peninsula.
Triggs’ has recently taken on another role within the Canadian wine industry, this time as grapegrower in the Niagara Peninsula. In partnership with his wife, Elaine, he purchased close to 100 acres of prized fruitland along the Niagara Parkway in 1998, thus creating Delaine Vineyard (after the Triggs’ first names.) Designed to provide premium quality vinifera grapes for Vincor’s Niagara Region wineries, and Jackson-Triggs Niagara Estate in particular, the 95-acre vineyard also serves as a research centre dedicated to maximizing fruit quality. Delaine Vineyard has released its first wines, the 2001 and 2002 vintages, under the Jackson-Triggs Niagara Estate label to much market acclaim.
Committed to furthering the science of viticulture and winemaking in Canada, Don and Elaine recently created the Triggs Premium Vinifera Lecture Series at Brock University’s Cool Climate Oenology and Viticultural Institute (CCOVI). CCOVI was created in 1997, at which time, Vincor International, under Don’s leadership, made the founding donation of $600,000.
Triggs has also been presented with a number of prestigious awards: an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Brock University (2004), the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award (2003); Christopher Newton Award for Extraordinary Vision in Business (2003); Tony Aspler Award of Excellence (2001); the American Marketing Association’s Marketer of Year (2000); and was awarded the titles of “Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin” (2002) and “Commandeur d’Honneur du Bontemps de Médoc et des Graves” (2000). He is active in several professional associations, including the Canadian Vintners Association as past Chairman, the Public Policy Forum as Founding, and Honorary Director, and the Ontario Wine Council as a former Director and Chairman.
A member of the Advisory Board for the University of Western Ontario’s Richard Ivey School of Business, and of the Board of Directors of Samsonite Corporation, Triggs has also served as Director, and past Chairman of the Board of AboutFace, an organization that assists those who are facially different, and was recently honoured with a Ten Year Volunteer Service Award by the Government of Ontario. He is a former member of the Board of Trustees of Brock University, a former Director of the Shaw Festival, and is a member of the Ontario Chapter of WPO, the World Presidents’ Organization, and the Chief Executive Officers’ Organization.
With joint venture partnerships with leading French wine producers, the new Jackson-Triggs estate winery in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Frank Gehry designing a new winery in Jordan, over 1,000 acres of new vineyards under development in the Okanagan Valley, and the purchase of leading wineries in British Columbia (Sumac Ridge and Hawthorne Mountain Vineyards), in California (R.H. Phillips), in Washington State (Hogue Cellars), in Australia (Goundrey and Amberley Estate), in New Zealand (Kim Crawford Wines), and in South Africa (Kumala), Triggs shows remarkable leadership and innovation. His goal, quite simply, is to produce super premium quality wine in Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and in other new world wine regions, for wine lovers the world over.

Christine Magee
Winner 2005
Sleep Country Canada
Sleep Country Canada was founded in October of 1994 by Christine Magee and her two partners, Stephen Gunn and Gordon Lownds.

Judy Elder
Winner 2005
Microsoft, IBM & Olgilvy & Mather
Judy Elder was a well-known and respected business leader in Canada until her untimely passing on March 28, 2002 at the age of 47. Through her intelligence, tenacity, and ambition, she reached the top ranks in several organizations including Ogilvy & Mather, IBM Canada, the Canadian Marketing Association, and most recently Microsoft Canada.
She was an advocate for career women, encouraging them to acknowledge and be proud of their ambition, to have an impact, make a difference and make things happen.
The following story related by her husband sums up in many resonant ways how her beliefs were inspiring for others…
On March 7, 2002, Judy gave a speech to the Women’s Television Network series “Gift of Wisdom”. It was called “Mothers, Fathers, Men, Ambition: The people and values that motivate and shape women’s success”.
After her speech, a number of people stayed behind to ask questions. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a young woman holding back. After about a half an hour, the last questioner had gone and this woman stepped forward. She said to Judy, she said with some feeling, everything you have said is all well and good, but how do you handle it when you suffer from a chronic illness?
This gives you a sense of her personal motivation. She was taken aback. How did this woman know? Had she seen Judy in hospital or at her doctor’s office?
Then Judy realized that, in asking the question, this woman was talking about herself and not about Judy. This woman, too, was suffering from a chronic illness.
So, I asked Judy, did you tell her about your condition? Judy said no. She didn’t think it worthwhile getting into a discussion over whose illness was worse.
Instead, she said, I tried not to appear patronizing but I passed on three things what I had worked out for myself.
First, she told the young woman: “don’t be afraid, at least try not to be afraid. Fear undermines everything. It immobilizes you.”
Second, be honest with yourself. Decide what really matters to you and do it. Do it now because there may not be a later.
And third, whatever you choose to do, do it well. Make your time worthwhile. Whatever really matters to you, make a difference and make it happen.
The Judy Project was established in memory of Judy Elder. The Judy Project, An Enlightened Leadership Forum for Executive Women, is designed to advance more women into CEO positions and build stronger organizations. The week long forum, collaboratively created by some of Canada’s senior women executives in partnership with the Rotman School of Management, well-respected academics and business leaders, hosts about 30 senior women executives annually, is the leading executive program for women in Canada.
The Canadian Marketing Association bestowed its highest honour, the CMA Lifetime Achievement Award, posthumously to Judy Elder on Friday, November 14, 2003.
