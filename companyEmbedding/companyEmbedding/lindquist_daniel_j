      Click Here to View Tribute Video      Daniel J Griffiths passed away peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, on Thursday, February 3, 2011.       He was born December 10, 1921 in Clarkston, Utah to John H. and Maybell Buttars Griffiths.  He was their only son surrounded by sisters. He graduated from North Cache High School and USAC, now Utah State University.  He served in the US Navy Air Corp and US Navy during World War II.       On February 21, 1947, Dan married Wilma Mae Anderson in the Logan LDS Temple.  They spent 63 wonderful years together and were blessed with seven children, Gregory Jack Griffiths, (deceased), Jerry Jerel Griffiths, Jeanne (Allan) Lonas, Ann (David, deceased) Balls, Scott Daniel Griffiths, Sue Dawn (Scott) Barney and April (Eric) Storey.       Dan was an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  He served as ward finance clerk for ten years under three bishops. He and Wilma served in the Mississippi Jackson Mission.      He taught high school for a combined 34 years at Weber and Bonneville High Schools.        He loved farming, and he loved his land. He could repair any farm equipment, or anything else for that matter. Fishing was his favorite past time, and he enjoyed games and doing mind puzzles.       Dan was preceded in death by his wife, an infant son, Gregory, his parents, and two sisters, LeArta Hammond and Reba Jardine.       Surviving are six children, 17 grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, with one on the way, a sister, Gretta (Earl) Ericksen, and many other family members.      The family expresses special thanks to Seini, his caregiver.       Funeral services will be held Tuesday, February 8th at 11 a.m. at the Washington Terrace 7th Ward Chapel, 4855 South 300 West.       The family will meet friends on Monday from 6 to 8 p.m. at Lindquist''s Ogden Mortuary, 3408 Washington Blvd. and Tuesday from 9:45 to 10:45 a.m. at the church.       Interment, Clarkston Cemetery, Clarkston, Utah at 3:30 p.m.  Email condolences to the family at: www.lindquistmortuary.com
