			San Jose: KB Home rolls out Apple-compatible smart home features

By Troy Wolverton | PUBLISHED: November 18, 2016 at 7:45 am | UPDATED: February 23, 2017 at 10:15 amSAN JOSE — Silicon Valley home buyers who want not only a new place but a smart one can now get a house that’s pre-configured to be controlled by their Apple devices.
KB Home on Friday announced that it’s offering a package of home automation features designed to be controlled by iPhones and iPads as an option on houses in two of its new neighborhoods, one in San Jose and the other in Fremont. The move marks the first time nationwide the home builder has offered buyers such an option.
Jacob Atalla, vice president of sustainability initiatives at KB, compared the home industry to the car business. In recent years, the number of advanced technological features included in cars — from large touch-screen displays to automatic braking — has rapidly increased. Consumers are starting to expect such advanced technological features in all the products they buy, Atalla said.

“We are focused on innovation,” he said. “It’s important to people’s lifestyles.”
The basic option package, which will cost around $4,000, includes an automatic door lock, a smart thermostat and lights and a fan that can be remote controlled. Users can add other devices to the system either when they design their homes or after moving in.
The package will also come with an iPad to control the home automation system inside the house and an Apple TV that will allow homeowners to interact with their smart home devices remotely. KB will offer complimentary concierge service to help homeowners set up their systems.
Atalla views the “scenes” he can use inside Apple’s Home app to control the various smart home devices inside the model home in the company’s Promenade development on Communications Hill. Troy Wolverton/Mercury News
Homeowners will interact with the smart home devices using the Home app, a new feature built into iOS 10, the latest version of the operating system underlying iPhones and iPads. The Home app not only allows users to control individual devices — dimming a particular light bulb or closing an automatic shade partway — it allows users to create “scenes” that can control multiple devices at once.
The Home app also enables users to control their smart home devices using Siri, Apple’s voice controlled intelligent assistant that’s built into iOS. For example, if a homeowner told Siri, “I’m home,” it might turn on the lights in the living room, open the shades and turn on the air conditioner all at once.
KB has been offering home automation products as an option in its houses for about 10 years, Atalla said. But it wasn’t an ideal situation, because homeowners typically had to use a different app for each one of the different smart home products in their houses.


What makes Apple’s Home app and HomeKit environment exciting to KB Home is that it allows consumers to access all those devices in one place and interact with many at one time, he said.
“This is what we were waiting for,” he said.
An Apple representative declined to comment.

In some respects, what KB Home’s doing makes sense, said Jonathan Gaw, a research manager who focuses on the consumer Internet of Things market for tech consulting firm IDC. It’s much easier and more efficient to have some smart home products like light switches installed by a home builder when a house is constructed, he said. Also, rolling the costs for those products into the home mortgage allows home buyers to more easily afford them upfront — and helps builders sell a higher priced home.
But the way KB Home is rolling this out looks a bit gimmicky, Gaw said. Home automation — at least for the mass market — is still a nascent industry. It’s not clear yet exactly what products consumers will really want or use or even what smart home product companies will be around in five or ten years, he said. Customers may find in six months or a couple years that they don’t use the products they have or that they’re defunct or no longer supported.
“There have already been instances of this,” Gaw noted, where consumers have bought a particular smart home product and then the company goes out of business. Instead of a cool home automation product, he added, “you have a doorstop or a paperweight.”
Given that, it would make a lot more sense for consumers if KB Home were offering its smart home options as an ongoing service, which offered ongoing support to customers and could allow them to easily change out outdated products, Gaw said.
“I’m skeptical of approaches to (Internet of Things) solutions that look at these things as devices or product and not as services or solutions,” he said.
KB is offering a service element with its smart home option in the form of the concierge service. Included with its Home-enabled home automation packages will be two hours of support that’s intended to help customers set up their systems and learn how to add additional devices or create new scenes in the future. But it’s unclear the degree to which KB will help customers install or configure new products in the future.
Many of the smart home products KB is offering as part of its options package are compatible with other home automation systems and devices, like Android smartphones and Amazon’s Echo smart speaker, Atalla said. But for now, KB is only offering to customize the smart home features for Apple devices.
KB will be offering the packages as options in its Promenade at Communications Hill development in San Jose and its Magnolia at Patterson Ranch neighborhood in Fremont. The company has set up a model home in its San Jose development to showcase the smart home features.

ENERGY STAR® Legacy and Impact  Since joining ENERGY STAR in 2000, we have built more than 90,000 ENERGY STAR certified homes. The EPA estimates that homeowners living in these homes save more than $28 million on utility bills while preventing greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to those from 32,000 passenger vehicles each year.











WATER WISE
WATER-CONSERVING HOMES — SAVINGS IN EVERY DROP.






All KB homes include a number of water-saving features to help reduce usage and help save money. The standard water-efficient features included in every new KB home, at no added cost to our buyers, result in an estimated annual utility bill savings of up to $300 when compared to a typical existing home that lacks these features.
Every KB home includes WaterSense® labeled faucets, toilets and shower heads. These fixtures help maximize water efficiency without sacrificing performance. Dishwashers installed in every KB home are not only ENERGY STAR® certified for energy efficiency, but also use significantly less water than standard models. Additional water-efficient options are available at the KB Home Design Studio, including alternative fixtures and appliances.
To date, KB Home has constructed the most WaterSense labeled new homes in the nation. We are the only builder to be recognized as a WaterSense Partner of the Year for four years in a row (2011-2014) and a 2015 WaterSense Sustained Excellence Award winner.











HEALTHY HOME
BETTER HOME — IMPROVING THE INDOOR ENVIRONMENT.






All KB homes incorporate a combination of materials, construction techniques and products that works together to help deliver better indoor air quality, especially when compared to most resale homes on the market today.
Each KB home features sealed combustion appliances, low-VOC interior paint and low-VOC carpeting. KB homes also come with whole-house mechanical ventilation and MERV 8-rated air filters that together provide a constant source of filtered air to help reduce indoor air pollutants and help remove finer airborne particles, improving indoor air quality.













SMART SYSTEMS







Your KB home has an edge over resale homes – it is designed to support your connected lifestyle. For example, you can conveniently and efficiently charge your mobile devices at the built-in USB outlet in the kitchen, which eliminates the need for a converter plug.
Select home automation features, including smart thermostats, lighting controls and Internet-connected door locks, that can help you stay connected in your new state-of-the-art KB home. Other technology options, like Whirlpool® smart appliances and electric vehicle charging stations, are also available at KB Home Design Studio.

KB Home Adds LP TechShield Radiant Barrier as Standard Feature
Project Summary
As one of the nation’s premier homebuilders, KB Home sought a way to improve the standard offerings of its Built to Order homes that would improve energy efficiency and help KB Home continue to meet ENERGY STAR® criteria for all of its new homes. KB Home became the first national builder to make LP® TechShield® Radiant Barrier Sheathing a standard feature on all of its new homes. The product helps block heat in the roof sheathing from entering the attic, reducing the heat load on the air handling system and helping homeowners save up to 17 percent on monthly cooling costs.


Download Case Study




SUMMARY
KB Home (NYSE: KBH), one of the nation’s premier homebuilders, has delivered over half a million quality homes for families since its founding in 1957. The Los Angeles–based company is distinguished by its Built to Order homebuilding approach that puts a custom home experience within reach of its customers at an affordable price. KB Home has been named the No. 1 Green Homebuilder in a study by Calvert Investments and the No. 1 Homebuilder on FORTUNE magazine’s 2011 World’s Most Admired Companies list.
OBJECTIVES
With a focus on continually improving its homes, KB Home sought a way to take its new Built to Order homes to the next level. Because of the company’s commitment to building ENERGY STAR® qualified homes, it wanted to add a feature that would play an integral role in meeting ENERGY STAR criteria and provide its customers with significant energy savings.
IMPLEMENTATION
KB Home found the solution among a host of upgrades it had been offering its customers: LP® TechShield® Radiant Barrier Sheathing. After seven years of providing LP TechShield Sheathing as an upgrade option to homeowners, KB Home decided to make the product a standard feature on all of its homes at no added cost to its customers.
“Initially we started using TechShield as an upgrade option to increase the energy efficiency of the homes,” said Jacob Atalla, senior director of sustainability for KB Home. “As energy efficiency codes and construction codes have become more stringent and as KB Home has continued to grow our commitment to building more energy-efficient homes, shifting from using TechShield as an option to installing it as a standard feature became a no-brainer.”
Constructed with a thin, durable sheet of laminated aluminum to LP® OSB Sheathing, LP TechShield Radiant Barrier Sheathing builds energy efficiency directly into the home. The radiant barrier helps block up to 97 percent of radiant heat in the roof sheathing from entering the attic, reducing the heat load on the air handling system.
“Features like TechShield open the door to further educate homebuyers on the availability of building materials with environmental benefits and long-term cost savings for them personally,” said Dan Bridleman, senior vice president of sustainability for KB Home. “ In today’s market consumers want to understand the impact on the environment, but also need to see the cost benefit to their pocketbooks.”
Because LP TechShield Radiant Barrier Sheathing can lower attic temperatures by as much as 30 degrees, the product can help homeowners save up to 17 percent on monthly cooling costs.
“TechShield offers KB Home more than energy savings for our customers,” Atalla explained. “It’s easy to install with no long-term maintenance, and it represents the quality we’ve come to trust from LP Building Products.”
LP TechShield Radiant Barrier Sheathing installs like conventional roof sheathing, requiring no additional labor. And with the patented VaporVentsTM technology, it dries more quickly from construction moisture than other radiant barriers.
OUTCOME
KB Home is the first national builder to make LP TechShield Radiant Barrier Sheathing a standard feature in all of its new homes. Because it is ENERGY STAR certified and uses SFI certified forest management and wood procurement systems, the product has helped KB Home maintain its commitment to sustainability.
“This product works beautifully in delivering efficiency, and it has excellent marketing and customer service support behind it. The relationship we have with the LP team is exemplary,” Atalla said. “The product works well. The partnership works well.”

LP TechShield Radiant Barrier Sheathing Helps John Howard Companies Cut Costs and Callbacks
Located in Mobile, Alabama, John Howard Companies was founded more than 40 years ago with a focus on superior customer service, product reliability, and quality construction, according to president and CEO John Howard. In Mobile, average daily high temperatures in the summer hover around 90° F, with some days measuring at 100° F or more. This heat can cause attic temperatures to reach up to 160° F and force the HVAC equipment to work even harder to produce adequate air to cool a home. John Howard Companies turned to LP® TechShield® Radiant Barrier Sheathing, helping them lower attic temperatures and reduce the tonnage required by the HVAC systems in their homes. This, according to John Howard Companies, has allowed them to save on costs and callbacks. Howard said his experience with LP TechShield Sheathing has been so positive that he’s been including it as a standard feature in all of his homes for more than three years.

Moved in Oct 2015. During and after construction I have had continuing problems with the quality of construction of my KB homes. Everything from Windows/Appliances/Roof, you name it. It took almost a year to get most of the items corrected. I paid quite a bit extra for an "upgraded" front door. After a little over a year I noticed several cracks in the door and daylight coming through (middle of the door). I complained - was informed it was my fault due to "negligence" (not sure what that means). I think most people would expect a new door to last for years.read more Helpful?yesnobookmarkBookmark this reviewshareShare this review Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on Google plusemailJohn of San Antonio, TXJuly 13, 2017Verified ReviewerVerified BuyerSatisfaction RatingOK. I'd give the home quality a 7.8 on a scale of 1 to 10. Upgrades too expensive. They don't respond to issues with the new home. Been in the home almost 2 weeks. Garbage disposal never worked, can't switch utilities into my name until the builder turns in the inspection paperwork.

To achieve our dream and give our children the family home we always wanted ourselves, we saved all that we could, took out from our 401K and LITERALLY invested everything we had into purchasing this KB Home. But it's been nothing but a nightmare. We have written multiple emails to customer service, division president and even the CEO of KB. And they simply reply back that it's within industry standards, and just evading our requests. Our home was built with no care. As we moved to Santa Clarita from Corona, which is a 3 hr drive one way, we were not lucky enough to see our home being built. We had trusted KB in building our home correctly and safely.For the past nine months, we have had submitted over 600 claims in defects of this newly built KB home. They have only fixed about 15 of those claims, and some of the "fixed" claims created more damage and more claims to be open. We have even hired a third party inspector to check the structure of our home, as I will attach the report with this letter. Some of the things that were found were absolutely ridiculous. I will mention just a few:Our attic isn't even attached correctly. (The metal plates aren't even attached.) They forgot to attach caps on our roof, which may have cause wood rot because of all the rain this past year. There are more than 10 broken tiles on our roof. The brick wall caps are not even cemented down and come right off. There is a 10 point checklist and that was not finished and signed. Missing wood beams on our stairs. The carpet was not installed correctly, every corner is not stapled to the ground and can be lifted out. We found nails, screws, staples and a 9 inch razor blade that my 4year old son found and started to play with. Just last week, I found over 20 birds living under our roof tiles because they didn't close off the corners of our roof. Our flooring downstairs has bubbling throughout the house. Our air conditioning unit had missing screws and it's not even leveled.These problems should not be problems at all for a brand new home. Obviously, there was no quality control and their inspector did nothing but pass and sign the inspection reports. As some of the checkpoints were not even signed off, which is why there is so much debris under our floors. I am writing this because it has brought so much stress on me and my family. They treat us with no respect and express that our claims are a joke. Even to fix one claim, they come look at it and tell us to be home on a certain day from 10-3pm, and a vendor will show up and fix that ONE claim. I would have to stay home, ask someone to pick up my daughter from 1st grade and later, without a phone call, they weren't able to make it out because the vendor is still working on another home. Another time, our flooring wasn't flushed to the kitchen island and KB sent a man to repair it. It took him 5 hours to "cover" the mistake. They did not even fix the problem but simply just put a mold to cover their mistake and told me again that it was industry standards.Five years ago, I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. After the birth of my son, my body seemed to have been overstressed and I was unable to walk. With lots of testings and Dr. visits, we found the cause and treated it right away. I have been stable and healthy with the infusion I get monthly that helps with my overactive immune system. I haven't had any flare ups. However, with all the stress KB has given me, my body seems to slowly be dying. I had a seizure five months ago in our new KB home, landed right on my face in the back yard and broke three of my front teeth. I was hospitalized for 3 days. And just last month, I was diagnosed with lupus and celiac disease. My body has exponentially deteriorated. I am a mother of two and weigh only 100 pounds. I now see a therapist two times a week to alleviate my stress. My rheumatologist said that all the stress from KB is exasperating my immune system and more diseases are arising. The infusion I took for years, is no longer working and creating antigens. I now take anti anxiety medicine 3 times a day. From all this, my husband and I pleaded and repeatedly asked them to help us fix all the mistakes. We have three months left until our 1year warranty expires and hardly anything got fixed. I'm terrified for my children's safety, this home, and my body shutting down.One day, I was so terrified that I went to the division president's office, pleading/crying to help us out. He didn't even let me enter his office and kicked me out. He said, "I have no time for you!" He told me to leave and never come back. I drove back home crying and devastated. In that time, he had already emailed to my husband, stating that, the next time I come, I will be escorted out and have a restraining order... and a lot more.

A few years later I decided to paint the inside. I found that the electrical outlets were held in place by the face plate screw ONLY! The outlet was not anchored or attached to anything, just hanging loose. Also, my home is the same size as the other homes next to me and yet the other houses have 4 heat vents on the roof and my house only has one! I got an estimate from a roofer and it will cost me from $800 to $1,000 to have the other 3 vents put in. Another point, I had a lot of problems with the airflow from the air conditioner. I had the flow tested and turns out I had 5, yes that's right 5 feet of holes in my air conditioning VENTS. I was told that IF actual metal vents were used that it would NOT BE POSSIBLE to have that much holes in the vents. This is insane.read more Helpful?yesnobookmarkBookmark this reviewshareShare this review Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on Google plusemailXai of Fresno, CAMay 27, 2017Verified ReviewerVerified BuyerSatisfaction RatingRegardless of what happened, we love our KB Home. Thank you. Maybe because it is our first time buying a house, our experience came out to be like this. We didn't always have questions when we meet up with the sale staff and when we do, he didn't always have the answer, there was many times he had to get back to us. When we met with the construction staff, we learned a lot about the house and regret a lot about certain upgrades because the sale staff didn't tell us about certain things. Seems like he was more about making a sale. But the construction staff was great, (Scott) he told us about everything. Even things we didn't think of, so he was great. Another thing was the loan officer, she was hard to get to when we had questions. It was really hard for my husband because he didn't want me to sign anything before meeting in person, asked our questions, and clarify certain parts of the document. Because this is something very big for us and we wanted to get it right the first time and understand what we are signing for. So because reaching out to her was very hard, it made this process hard for us. We sign documents and wait until there's more things for us to sign. We just thought the loan process would have been a lot different where we are all on the same page on everything. As to everything in life, there are the ups and downs, and for KB Homes, it was an 8 overall satisfaction for us. Last of all, we want to thank KB Home, we love our new house.read more 4 people found this review helpfulHelpful?yesnobookmarkBookmark this reviewshareShare this review Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on Google plusemailJoshua of San Antonio, TXMay 26, 2017Verified ReviewerVerified BuyerSatisfaction RatingIncredible house for my family.

        	Top
        	Energy-saving featuresMany homebuilders offer a wide variety of energy-saving features that can save you money each month on your utility bills, while protecting the environment.Energy-efficient windows: Homes can be built with enhanced insulated-glass windows that do a better job of keeping homes warmer in winter and cooler in summer while still admitting plenty of natural sunlight.
                                    Solar paneling: Some homebuilders can install solar panels for a more energy-efficient way to produce hot water and electricity.
                                    Natural gas vs electric: Homes can be built that run on natural gas or propane rather than depending on electricity to power appliances, water heaters or heating systems.
                                    Complete customizationSome homebuilders allow you to customize your home in many different ways, including number of rooms, floor layout, paint colors, countertop and flooring options, siding type and color, style of cabinetry, and choice of plumbing fixtures, to name a few.Work from consumers' plans: You can bring your own home-building plans to the builder rather than choosing from a book of existing plans.
                                    Room specifications: Homeowners can specify the number of rooms they want, the size of the rooms, and special features of each room, such as crown molding, wainscoting, ceiling fans, and window size and placement.
                                    Number of floors: Consumers can specify how large the house is to be, including how many floors and what rooms to include on each floor. They may also be able to specify whether they want a basement or attic.
                                    WarrantiesMost homebuilders offer warranties on the homes they build at little or no cost to you.Repair warranties: These warranties allow homebuyers to get free repairs on structural damage, whether that damage is minor or major.
                                    Replacement warranties: If something related to the building of the home causes the home to become unsuitable for living and cannot be repaired easily, the homebuilder may build a replacement home at no additional cost.
                                    System repairs: There may be warranties on the installation of electrical wiring, plumbing pipes, furnace, gas lines and other mechanical systems.
                                    Inspected and approvedPrior to move in, the home must pass inspection to certify that it is built safely and meets local or state standards.Inspections throughout the process: Some homebuilders allow consumers to visit the site as the home is being built to view progress and inspect already-completed parts of the home. Be sure to schedule any visits ahead of time with the builder; active jobsites can be dangerous places.
                                    State inspections: The homebuilder may provide the services of a certified inspector, licensed by the state, to look at the home and determine its safety. The town’s building department will schedule routine inspections throughout the construction process to ensure the home is being built to code.
                                    Pre-move in repairs: The consumer can request repairs after inspection and before move-in to make the home safer.
                                    Options for upgradesHomebuilders may offer standard features with the ability to pay extra to upgrade the home.Energy efficiency: Solar panels, triple-pane windows, or other energy-saving upgrades may cost extra and can be installed at the homeowner's request.
                                    Adding outlets to more rooms: The homebuilder can upgrade the electrical system by adding extra outlets in bathrooms, bedrooms, home offices and other areas where you need more electricity.
                                    Extra garages and rooms: Prior to the start of construction, most builders are amenable to altering the existing blueprint if you’d like to add another room, enlarge an existing room, or build a garage. Be sure to get all changes in writing with detailed information about cost, size and materials.
                                    Model homesMost homebuilders offer model homes for potential buyers to tour prior to signing a contract to build their home. Model homes give buyers a chance to see the quality, style and fixtures they can expect in their own home.Different sizes and features: Many builders offer model homes of different sizes and architectural styles with upgraded features so potential homebuyers can get an idea of the builder's work. However, be aware that model homes are often loaded with fixtures and finishes that aren’t included in the base price. For example, the model might have granite counters, tiled foyer, whirlpool tub and backyard deck, which might all cost extra. When touring a model home, be sure to ask which features are upgrades and which ones are included in the base price.
                                    Duplicate orders: If consumers see a model home they really like, they can order an exact replica to be built on their lot.
                                    Get an idea of lot size: The lot size is as important to some consumers as the house size; touring model homes can help users decide how big a yard they want to have as well as how big a home they want to have. However, be sure to ask if the model-home lot is the same size as your home’s lot.
