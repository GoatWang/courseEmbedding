Consensus Rating: The average of analysts recommendations for a single entity. As many brokers have different ratings systems, their recommendations must be standardized so that a consensus can be calculated. The Thomson Financial I/B/E/S ratings are calculated using a standard set of recommendations, maintained by Thomson Financial I/B/E/S, each with an assigned numeric value:1 = Strong Buy2 = Buy3 = Hold4 = Underperform5 = SellMean Recommendation Each recommendation received from the analysts is mapped to one of the Thomson Financial I/B/E/S standard ratings. Assigning a numeric value to the broker text enables Thomson Financial I/B/E/S to calculate a consensus recommendation. This consensus recommendation appears as the mean (average) of the assigned values.  The color coding assigns a value of Very Positive to Very Negative. The Color Key, below, indicates the assigned values and a possible explanation for the rating. However, it is important to note that each value should be looked at in combination with other factors. The Stock Comparison page should serve as one among many informational tools for comparing stocks and should not be the only basis for a buy or sell decision. ADVICE FROM A SECURITIES PROFESSIONAL IS STRONGLY ADVISED.  Please visit our disclaimer page for our full disclaimer.Color Key: Very Positive Positive Neutral Negative Very Negative

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.
