Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Farley was born the elder of two children to a working-class Irish Catholic family on October 10, 1942 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.[1] He was the son of John Farley, a postal worker and part-time musician, and Barbara Farley, a receptionist.[2] Farley attended grade school at St. Leo's School in Pawtucket, and later became a recruited high school athlete and student at St. Raphael Academy,[2] his father's high school. Farley graduated from St. Raphael's in 1960.[3]
Farley attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, from 1960–1964, where he majored in government and earned an academic scholarship. At Bowdoin, he was a varsity athlete in football, swimming, and baseball.[4] He received a Juris Doctorate from Boston College in 1969.
Professional career[edit]
Early years[edit]
After graduating from Bowdoin in 1964, Farley traveled across the U.S. and Mexico for six months, eventually settling in Los Angeles.[1] In Los Angeles., Farley sold Collier's Encyclopedia door to door.[2] Within two years he was the company's leading salesman, and was appointed head of training for the national sales force.[5] Farley entered the Boston College Law School in 1966, earning a J.D. in 1969.
NL Industries and Lehman Brothers[edit]
After law school, Farley moved to New York City, where he took a job in the mergers and acquisitions division of NL Industries, a manufacturing company with a number of subsidiaries. At NL Industries, Farley did analysis on potential acquisition targets, and rose to director of long range planning and acquisitions. During this time, he pursued an M.B.A. at New York University.[2] In 1972, Farley was transferred to Chicago, where he functioned as the regional manager of NL Industries' metals division.[4]
In 1973, Farley left NL Industries and took a position as an associate in the corporate finance division of Lehman Brothers in Chicago.
Farley Industries[edit]
In 1976 NL Industries contacted Farley at Lehman Brothers) to see if he knew of a potential buyer for Anaheim Citrus Products Co., a small subsidiary that produced pectin, a thickening agent used in foods and other products. In October 1976, at age 33, he executed his first leveraged buyout for $1.9 million. To facilitate the buyout, Farley founded Farley Industries, a private holdings company in the Sears Tower in Chicago.[6] After six months, Farley had raised the funds for the buyout, including his life savings of $25,000, plus $1.7 million in loans and notes borrowed against the company assets.[7]
Within two years after the buyout, Anaheim Citrus had doubled its sales. In 1977, Farley purchased Baumfolder Corporation, a struggling manufacturing company, using funds from equipment sales at Anaheim Citrus. Farley quit Lehman and moved to Ohio to oversee the Baumfolder turnaround.[1][2] He later sold Baumfolder to its employees for $10 million.[8]
In 1982, Farley purchased NL Metals, the same group he used to run at NL. The purchase price was $118 million, making NL Metals the first in a line of significantly larger acquisitions that Farley would make over the next decade.[5]
Farley Industries soon encompassed numerous companies within the manufacturing, mining, and apparel industries. The largest acquisition was Northwest Industries, for $1.4 billion in July 1985.[8] Farley Industries had 50,000 employees and nearly $4 billion in annual sales by the late 1980s.
In 1991 Farley Industries entered bankruptcy and was dismantled.[9][10]
West Point Pepperell[edit]
In 1988, Farley completed a hostile takeover of West Point Pepperell, Inc., a textile company that had been family-owned in West Point, Georgia, and surrounding communities for more than 100 years. Farley paid $1.5 billion for the company, eclipsing the mark of $1.4 billion he had paid a year prior for Northwest Industries. Farley financed his purchase of 95.3 percent of the company through bank debt and high-yield junk bonds. The hostile takeover did not sit well with employees and community citizens, especially as Farley's promises to "modernize and expand" the company never came to fruition.[11] Less than four years later, the company filed bankruptcy, and Farley resigned to focus his efforts on Fruit of the Loom. [12] Fruit of the Loom would ultimately declare bankruptcy in 1999; Farley walked away from that company as well.
Fruit of the Loom[edit]
Though Farley eventually sold most businesses within the Farley/Northwest Holding Corp. conglomerate, he kept Fruit of the Loom Inc.[13][14] In March 1987, Farley completed a successful $565 million public offering of Fruit of the Loom shares.[15]
Farley served as president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom from 1985 to 2000. During that time, Fruit of the Loom's revenue grew from $500 million to almost $2.5 billion. At its peak, Farley Industries employed over 30,000 employees worldwide.[2] During his tenure as president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom, revenues rose nearly fivefold, from $500 million to almost $2.5 billion. At its peak, in 1997, Fruit of the Loom was trading at roughly $44 per share. The press teased Farley about the company's unconventional advertisements, featuring Farley.[16]
Even while the company's revenue was rising sharply, its debt proved increasingly unwieldy amid the shifting economy. In 1999 Fruit of the Loom posted a net loss of $576 million and the company filed for bankruptcy. Farley left Fruit of the Loom that same year. In 2002, Fruit of the Loom was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway.[17] The Fruit of the Loom bankruptcy was Farley's third in 11 years, preceded by the failures under his leadership of Farley Industries and West Point Pepperell.
Junk bond failures[edit]
While Farley's success in the 1980's had made him wealthy, his junk-bond processes failed miserably in the 1990's, ultimately leading to bankruptcy for several companies he had attempted to take over. [18]
Zrii, LLC[edit]
In May 2008, Farley launched a brand-new multi-level marketing health and beauty company based out of Salt Lake City, Utah. The company, Zrii, LLC, had more than 4,000 independent distributors attend its launch at the Salt Lake City Convention Center.
Zrii, a Sanskrit word which means "light, luster, splendor, and prosperity", was endorsed by lifestyle guru Deepak Chopra and the Chopra Center for Wellbeing. The basis of its namesake product was a juice extracted from the amalaki fruit, which is grown exclusively in India at the base of the Himalayas.[19]
In February 2009, 35 employees staged a walkout of Zrii headquarters and demanded that Farley resign.[citation needed]. The employees had formed their own company and attempted to make an offer to take over Zrii, but Farley refused to step down. He sued the top managers, claiming that their goal was to force him out in order to purchase the company for a reduced cost; the lawsuit further claimed that the employees had deliberately raided and sabotaged company computers before the walk-out.
In December 2009, Farley won $400,000 in a settlement agreement with LifeVantage Corporation, where many of his former employees were hired.[20] LifeVantage admitted no interference with Zrii's operations in the settlement agreement.
Management style[edit]
Farley spent over $3 million a year on programs at his subsidiaries that encouraged physical fitness, good nutrition, and smoking cessation.[4] He traveled to work sites and solicited employees' opinions about the quality of their food and facilities, making improvements if his workers weren't satisfied.[21] Farley installed baseball fields, tracks, and other fitness facilities at plants and factories.[1]
Farley was also known for his relentless work ethic, and his schedule often demanded brutal hours; he occasionally held meetings with managers late at night if there was no available time during the day.[8]
Farley also preferred to keep his companies small and efficiently organized: He is known for insisting that company hierarchies be trimmed down to reduce the number of layers between the lowest-level workers and top-level executives.[22]
Philanthropic activity[edit]
A firm believer in education, Farley has contributed millions of dollars to his alma maters. His largest single contribution was a $3.5 million gift to Bowdoin College in 1984,[2] which resulted in Farley Field House, an indoor athletic facility with a track, indoor tennis courts, and spectator areas.[23][24] He also founded scholarship programs for students at Boston College Law School,[22] and made a $1.5 million donation to endow the William F. Farley Chair at the law school. In May 1996, Farley made a $1 million donation to his high school, St. Raphael Academy, which went toward science and computer resources, tuition assistance, and the athletic department.[25] In 1998 and in honor of Farley's contributions to the school, the West Annex Building at St. Raphael was renamed Barbara Farley Hall, in honor of Farley's mother.[3]
Farley has made numerous contributions over the years to the American Heart Association, and he's been a donor to and board member of various civic and cultural organizations in his adopted hometown of Chicago, Illinois (including the Goodman Theater, the Lyric Opera House, and the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations).[5][23] He has also sat on the board of directors for the Horatio Alger Association.[15]
Awards and honors[edit]

1984: Farley is recognized as Outstanding Business Graduate of the Year by the Boston College Law School Alumni Association.[15]
1986: Farley receives the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans award. The award is given to "community leaders who demonstrate individual initiative and a commitment to excellence, as exemplified by remarkable achievements accomplished through honesty, hard work, self-reliance and perseverance over adversity."[26]
1988: Farley is inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame,[27] and is honored by the Boys & Girls Club of America as a Business/Community Honoree of the Year.
1997: Honored by the Ireland-U.S. Council for Commerce and Industry for outstanding achievement for his work in economics, business, and commercial activity. He also is named one of Irish-America magazine's top 100 businessmen,[15] and receives the White House's Presidential Award for Entrepreneurial Excellence.[28]
2008: Farley is honored with a Freedom Award from America's Freedom Festival at Provo.[29]

Personal life[edit]
Farley was a high school athlete at St. Raphael Academy in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and played three varsity sports (football, swimming, and baseball) at Bowdoin. He provided financial support to the athletic departments at St. Raphael and Bowdoin.
In the 1980s, Farley became a minority owner of the Chicago White Sox.[4]
Farley was an active member in the Young Presidents Organization; he is currently a member of the World Presidents Organization. He has also been a member of the Chicago Club and the University Associates of Northwestern University for years.[15]
Farley lives in Chicago with his wife, Shelley, a cabaret singer who has performed Michael Feinstein, George Burns, and President Bill Clinton.[30] Farley has three sons; the youngest, Liam, lives in Chicago with him. His two older sons, Hayes MacArthur and Scott, live in Los Angeles.

Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Farley was born the elder of two children to a working-class Irish Catholic family on October 10, 1942 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.[1] He was the son of John Farley, a postal worker and part-time musician, and Barbara Farley, a receptionist.[2] Farley attended grade school at St. Leo's School in Pawtucket, and later became a recruited high school athlete and student at St. Raphael Academy,[2] his father's high school. Farley graduated from St. Raphael's in 1960.[3]
Farley attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, from 1960–1964, where he majored in government and earned an academic scholarship. At Bowdoin, he was a varsity athlete in football, swimming, and baseball.[4] He received a Juris Doctorate from Boston College in 1969.
Professional career[edit]
Early years[edit]
After graduating from Bowdoin in 1964, Farley traveled across the U.S. and Mexico for six months, eventually settling in Los Angeles.[1] In Los Angeles., Farley sold Collier's Encyclopedia door to door.[2] Within two years he was the company's leading salesman, and was appointed head of training for the national sales force.[5] Farley entered the Boston College Law School in 1966, earning a J.D. in 1969.
NL Industries and Lehman Brothers[edit]
After law school, Farley moved to New York City, where he took a job in the mergers and acquisitions division of NL Industries, a manufacturing company with a number of subsidiaries. At NL Industries, Farley did analysis on potential acquisition targets, and rose to director of long range planning and acquisitions. During this time, he pursued an M.B.A. at New York University.[2] In 1972, Farley was transferred to Chicago, where he functioned as the regional manager of NL Industries' metals division.[4]
In 1973, Farley left NL Industries and took a position as an associate in the corporate finance division of Lehman Brothers in Chicago.
Farley Industries[edit]
In 1976 NL Industries contacted Farley at Lehman Brothers) to see if he knew of a potential buyer for Anaheim Citrus Products Co., a small subsidiary that produced pectin, a thickening agent used in foods and other products. In October 1976, at age 33, he executed his first leveraged buyout for $1.9 million. To facilitate the buyout, Farley founded Farley Industries, a private holdings company in the Sears Tower in Chicago.[6] After six months, Farley had raised the funds for the buyout, including his life savings of $25,000, plus $1.7 million in loans and notes borrowed against the company assets.[7]
Within two years after the buyout, Anaheim Citrus had doubled its sales. In 1977, Farley purchased Baumfolder Corporation, a struggling manufacturing company, using funds from equipment sales at Anaheim Citrus. Farley quit Lehman and moved to Ohio to oversee the Baumfolder turnaround.[1][2] He later sold Baumfolder to its employees for $10 million.[8]
In 1982, Farley purchased NL Metals, the same group he used to run at NL. The purchase price was $118 million, making NL Metals the first in a line of significantly larger acquisitions that Farley would make over the next decade.[5]
Farley Industries soon encompassed numerous companies within the manufacturing, mining, and apparel industries. The largest acquisition was Northwest Industries, for $1.4 billion in July 1985.[8] Farley Industries had 50,000 employees and nearly $4 billion in annual sales by the late 1980s.
In 1991 Farley Industries entered bankruptcy and was dismantled.[9][10]
West Point Pepperell[edit]
In 1988, Farley completed a hostile takeover of West Point Pepperell, Inc., a textile company that had been family-owned in West Point, Georgia, and surrounding communities for more than 100 years. Farley paid $1.5 billion for the company, eclipsing the mark of $1.4 billion he had paid a year prior for Northwest Industries. Farley financed his purchase of 95.3 percent of the company through bank debt and high-yield junk bonds. The hostile takeover did not sit well with employees and community citizens, especially as Farley's promises to "modernize and expand" the company never came to fruition.[11] Less than four years later, the company filed bankruptcy, and Farley resigned to focus his efforts on Fruit of the Loom. [12] Fruit of the Loom would ultimately declare bankruptcy in 1999; Farley walked away from that company as well.
Fruit of the Loom[edit]
Though Farley eventually sold most businesses within the Farley/Northwest Holding Corp. conglomerate, he kept Fruit of the Loom Inc.[13][14] In March 1987, Farley completed a successful $565 million public offering of Fruit of the Loom shares.[15]
Farley served as president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom from 1985 to 2000. During that time, Fruit of the Loom's revenue grew from $500 million to almost $2.5 billion. At its peak, Farley Industries employed over 30,000 employees worldwide.[2] During his tenure as president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom, revenues rose nearly fivefold, from $500 million to almost $2.5 billion. At its peak, in 1997, Fruit of the Loom was trading at roughly $44 per share. The press teased Farley about the company's unconventional advertisements, featuring Farley.[16]
Even while the company's revenue was rising sharply, its debt proved increasingly unwieldy amid the shifting economy. In 1999 Fruit of the Loom posted a net loss of $576 million and the company filed for bankruptcy. Farley left Fruit of the Loom that same year. In 2002, Fruit of the Loom was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway.[17] The Fruit of the Loom bankruptcy was Farley's third in 11 years, preceded by the failures under his leadership of Farley Industries and West Point Pepperell.
Junk bond failures[edit]
While Farley's success in the 1980's had made him wealthy, his junk-bond processes failed miserably in the 1990's, ultimately leading to bankruptcy for several companies he had attempted to take over. [18]
Zrii, LLC[edit]
In May 2008, Farley launched a brand-new multi-level marketing health and beauty company based out of Salt Lake City, Utah. The company, Zrii, LLC, had more than 4,000 independent distributors attend its launch at the Salt Lake City Convention Center.
Zrii, a Sanskrit word which means "light, luster, splendor, and prosperity", was endorsed by lifestyle guru Deepak Chopra and the Chopra Center for Wellbeing. The basis of its namesake product was a juice extracted from the amalaki fruit, which is grown exclusively in India at the base of the Himalayas.[19]
In February 2009, 35 employees staged a walkout of Zrii headquarters and demanded that Farley resign.[citation needed]. The employees had formed their own company and attempted to make an offer to take over Zrii, but Farley refused to step down. He sued the top managers, claiming that their goal was to force him out in order to purchase the company for a reduced cost; the lawsuit further claimed that the employees had deliberately raided and sabotaged company computers before the walk-out.
In December 2009, Farley won $400,000 in a settlement agreement with LifeVantage Corporation, where many of his former employees were hired.[20] LifeVantage admitted no interference with Zrii's operations in the settlement agreement.
Management style[edit]
Farley spent over $3 million a year on programs at his subsidiaries that encouraged physical fitness, good nutrition, and smoking cessation.[4] He traveled to work sites and solicited employees' opinions about the quality of their food and facilities, making improvements if his workers weren't satisfied.[21] Farley installed baseball fields, tracks, and other fitness facilities at plants and factories.[1]
Farley was also known for his relentless work ethic, and his schedule often demanded brutal hours; he occasionally held meetings with managers late at night if there was no available time during the day.[8]
Farley also preferred to keep his companies small and efficiently organized: He is known for insisting that company hierarchies be trimmed down to reduce the number of layers between the lowest-level workers and top-level executives.[22]
Philanthropic activity[edit]
A firm believer in education, Farley has contributed millions of dollars to his alma maters. His largest single contribution was a $3.5 million gift to Bowdoin College in 1984,[2] which resulted in Farley Field House, an indoor athletic facility with a track, indoor tennis courts, and spectator areas.[23][24] He also founded scholarship programs for students at Boston College Law School,[22] and made a $1.5 million donation to endow the William F. Farley Chair at the law school. In May 1996, Farley made a $1 million donation to his high school, St. Raphael Academy, which went toward science and computer resources, tuition assistance, and the athletic department.[25] In 1998 and in honor of Farley's contributions to the school, the West Annex Building at St. Raphael was renamed Barbara Farley Hall, in honor of Farley's mother.[3]
Farley has made numerous contributions over the years to the American Heart Association, and he's been a donor to and board member of various civic and cultural organizations in his adopted hometown of Chicago, Illinois (including the Goodman Theater, the Lyric Opera House, and the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations).[5][23] He has also sat on the board of directors for the Horatio Alger Association.[15]
Awards and honors[edit]

1984: Farley is recognized as Outstanding Business Graduate of the Year by the Boston College Law School Alumni Association.[15]
1986: Farley receives the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans award. The award is given to "community leaders who demonstrate individual initiative and a commitment to excellence, as exemplified by remarkable achievements accomplished through honesty, hard work, self-reliance and perseverance over adversity."[26]
1988: Farley is inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame,[27] and is honored by the Boys & Girls Club of America as a Business/Community Honoree of the Year.
1997: Honored by the Ireland-U.S. Council for Commerce and Industry for outstanding achievement for his work in economics, business, and commercial activity. He also is named one of Irish-America magazine's top 100 businessmen,[15] and receives the White House's Presidential Award for Entrepreneurial Excellence.[28]
2008: Farley is honored with a Freedom Award from America's Freedom Festival at Provo.[29]

Personal life[edit]
Farley was a high school athlete at St. Raphael Academy in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and played three varsity sports (football, swimming, and baseball) at Bowdoin. He provided financial support to the athletic departments at St. Raphael and Bowdoin.
In the 1980s, Farley became a minority owner of the Chicago White Sox.[4]
Farley was an active member in the Young Presidents Organization; he is currently a member of the World Presidents Organization. He has also been a member of the Chicago Club and the University Associates of Northwestern University for years.[15]
Farley lives in Chicago with his wife, Shelley, a cabaret singer who has performed Michael Feinstein, George Burns, and President Bill Clinton.[30] Farley has three sons; the youngest, Liam, lives in Chicago with him. His two older sons, Hayes MacArthur and Scott, live in Los Angeles.

Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Farley was born the elder of two children to a working-class Irish Catholic family on October 10, 1942 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.[1] He was the son of John Farley, a postal worker and part-time musician, and Barbara Farley, a receptionist.[2] Farley attended grade school at St. Leo's School in Pawtucket, and later became a recruited high school athlete and student at St. Raphael Academy,[2] his father's high school. Farley graduated from St. Raphael's in 1960.[3]
Farley attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, from 1960–1964, where he majored in government and earned an academic scholarship. At Bowdoin, he was a varsity athlete in football, swimming, and baseball.[4] He received a Juris Doctorate from Boston College in 1969.
Professional career[edit]
Early years[edit]
After graduating from Bowdoin in 1964, Farley traveled across the U.S. and Mexico for six months, eventually settling in Los Angeles.[1] In Los Angeles., Farley sold Collier's Encyclopedia door to door.[2] Within two years he was the company's leading salesman, and was appointed head of training for the national sales force.[5] Farley entered the Boston College Law School in 1966, earning a J.D. in 1969.
NL Industries and Lehman Brothers[edit]
After law school, Farley moved to New York City, where he took a job in the mergers and acquisitions division of NL Industries, a manufacturing company with a number of subsidiaries. At NL Industries, Farley did analysis on potential acquisition targets, and rose to director of long range planning and acquisitions. During this time, he pursued an M.B.A. at New York University.[2] In 1972, Farley was transferred to Chicago, where he functioned as the regional manager of NL Industries' metals division.[4]
In 1973, Farley left NL Industries and took a position as an associate in the corporate finance division of Lehman Brothers in Chicago.
Farley Industries[edit]
In 1976 NL Industries contacted Farley at Lehman Brothers) to see if he knew of a potential buyer for Anaheim Citrus Products Co., a small subsidiary that produced pectin, a thickening agent used in foods and other products. In October 1976, at age 33, he executed his first leveraged buyout for $1.9 million. To facilitate the buyout, Farley founded Farley Industries, a private holdings company in the Sears Tower in Chicago.[6] After six months, Farley had raised the funds for the buyout, including his life savings of $25,000, plus $1.7 million in loans and notes borrowed against the company assets.[7]
Within two years after the buyout, Anaheim Citrus had doubled its sales. In 1977, Farley purchased Baumfolder Corporation, a struggling manufacturing company, using funds from equipment sales at Anaheim Citrus. Farley quit Lehman and moved to Ohio to oversee the Baumfolder turnaround.[1][2] He later sold Baumfolder to its employees for $10 million.[8]
In 1982, Farley purchased NL Metals, the same group he used to run at NL. The purchase price was $118 million, making NL Metals the first in a line of significantly larger acquisitions that Farley would make over the next decade.[5]
Farley Industries soon encompassed numerous companies within the manufacturing, mining, and apparel industries. The largest acquisition was Northwest Industries, for $1.4 billion in July 1985.[8] Farley Industries had 50,000 employees and nearly $4 billion in annual sales by the late 1980s.
In 1991 Farley Industries entered bankruptcy and was dismantled.[9][10]
West Point Pepperell[edit]
In 1988, Farley completed a hostile takeover of West Point Pepperell, Inc., a textile company that had been family-owned in West Point, Georgia, and surrounding communities for more than 100 years. Farley paid $1.5 billion for the company, eclipsing the mark of $1.4 billion he had paid a year prior for Northwest Industries. Farley financed his purchase of 95.3 percent of the company through bank debt and high-yield junk bonds. The hostile takeover did not sit well with employees and community citizens, especially as Farley's promises to "modernize and expand" the company never came to fruition.[11] Less than four years later, the company filed bankruptcy, and Farley resigned to focus his efforts on Fruit of the Loom. [12] Fruit of the Loom would ultimately declare bankruptcy in 1999; Farley walked away from that company as well.
Fruit of the Loom[edit]
Though Farley eventually sold most businesses within the Farley/Northwest Holding Corp. conglomerate, he kept Fruit of the Loom Inc.[13][14] In March 1987, Farley completed a successful $565 million public offering of Fruit of the Loom shares.[15]
Farley served as president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom from 1985 to 2000. During that time, Fruit of the Loom's revenue grew from $500 million to almost $2.5 billion. At its peak, Farley Industries employed over 30,000 employees worldwide.[2] During his tenure as president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom, revenues rose nearly fivefold, from $500 million to almost $2.5 billion. At its peak, in 1997, Fruit of the Loom was trading at roughly $44 per share. The press teased Farley about the company's unconventional advertisements, featuring Farley.[16]
Even while the company's revenue was rising sharply, its debt proved increasingly unwieldy amid the shifting economy. In 1999 Fruit of the Loom posted a net loss of $576 million and the company filed for bankruptcy. Farley left Fruit of the Loom that same year. In 2002, Fruit of the Loom was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway.[17] The Fruit of the Loom bankruptcy was Farley's third in 11 years, preceded by the failures under his leadership of Farley Industries and West Point Pepperell.
Junk bond failures[edit]
While Farley's success in the 1980's had made him wealthy, his junk-bond processes failed miserably in the 1990's, ultimately leading to bankruptcy for several companies he had attempted to take over. [18]
Zrii, LLC[edit]
In May 2008, Farley launched a brand-new multi-level marketing health and beauty company based out of Salt Lake City, Utah. The company, Zrii, LLC, had more than 4,000 independent distributors attend its launch at the Salt Lake City Convention Center.
Zrii, a Sanskrit word which means "light, luster, splendor, and prosperity", was endorsed by lifestyle guru Deepak Chopra and the Chopra Center for Wellbeing. The basis of its namesake product was a juice extracted from the amalaki fruit, which is grown exclusively in India at the base of the Himalayas.[19]
In February 2009, 35 employees staged a walkout of Zrii headquarters and demanded that Farley resign.[citation needed]. The employees had formed their own company and attempted to make an offer to take over Zrii, but Farley refused to step down. He sued the top managers, claiming that their goal was to force him out in order to purchase the company for a reduced cost; the lawsuit further claimed that the employees had deliberately raided and sabotaged company computers before the walk-out.
In December 2009, Farley won $400,000 in a settlement agreement with LifeVantage Corporation, where many of his former employees were hired.[20] LifeVantage admitted no interference with Zrii's operations in the settlement agreement.
Management style[edit]
Farley spent over $3 million a year on programs at his subsidiaries that encouraged physical fitness, good nutrition, and smoking cessation.[4] He traveled to work sites and solicited employees' opinions about the quality of their food and facilities, making improvements if his workers weren't satisfied.[21] Farley installed baseball fields, tracks, and other fitness facilities at plants and factories.[1]
Farley was also known for his relentless work ethic, and his schedule often demanded brutal hours; he occasionally held meetings with managers late at night if there was no available time during the day.[8]
Farley also preferred to keep his companies small and efficiently organized: He is known for insisting that company hierarchies be trimmed down to reduce the number of layers between the lowest-level workers and top-level executives.[22]
Philanthropic activity[edit]
A firm believer in education, Farley has contributed millions of dollars to his alma maters. His largest single contribution was a $3.5 million gift to Bowdoin College in 1984,[2] which resulted in Farley Field House, an indoor athletic facility with a track, indoor tennis courts, and spectator areas.[23][24] He also founded scholarship programs for students at Boston College Law School,[22] and made a $1.5 million donation to endow the William F. Farley Chair at the law school. In May 1996, Farley made a $1 million donation to his high school, St. Raphael Academy, which went toward science and computer resources, tuition assistance, and the athletic department.[25] In 1998 and in honor of Farley's contributions to the school, the West Annex Building at St. Raphael was renamed Barbara Farley Hall, in honor of Farley's mother.[3]
Farley has made numerous contributions over the years to the American Heart Association, and he's been a donor to and board member of various civic and cultural organizations in his adopted hometown of Chicago, Illinois (including the Goodman Theater, the Lyric Opera House, and the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations).[5][23] He has also sat on the board of directors for the Horatio Alger Association.[15]
Awards and honors[edit]

1984: Farley is recognized as Outstanding Business Graduate of the Year by the Boston College Law School Alumni Association.[15]
1986: Farley receives the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans award. The award is given to "community leaders who demonstrate individual initiative and a commitment to excellence, as exemplified by remarkable achievements accomplished through honesty, hard work, self-reliance and perseverance over adversity."[26]
1988: Farley is inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame,[27] and is honored by the Boys & Girls Club of America as a Business/Community Honoree of the Year.
1997: Honored by the Ireland-U.S. Council for Commerce and Industry for outstanding achievement for his work in economics, business, and commercial activity. He also is named one of Irish-America magazine's top 100 businessmen,[15] and receives the White House's Presidential Award for Entrepreneurial Excellence.[28]
2008: Farley is honored with a Freedom Award from America's Freedom Festival at Provo.[29]

Personal life[edit]
Farley was a high school athlete at St. Raphael Academy in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and played three varsity sports (football, swimming, and baseball) at Bowdoin. He provided financial support to the athletic departments at St. Raphael and Bowdoin.
In the 1980s, Farley became a minority owner of the Chicago White Sox.[4]
Farley was an active member in the Young Presidents Organization; he is currently a member of the World Presidents Organization. He has also been a member of the Chicago Club and the University Associates of Northwestern University for years.[15]
Farley lives in Chicago with his wife, Shelley, a cabaret singer who has performed Michael Feinstein, George Burns, and President Bill Clinton.[30] Farley has three sons; the youngest, Liam, lives in Chicago with him. His two older sons, Hayes MacArthur and Scott, live in Los Angeles.

Prosperity
       Over the past 30 years, I've created international enterprises worth billions of dollars as a result of persistent hard work, vision and passion.   Work is one of my great joys in life: I find that work rarely feels like work because my work is a true labor of love.
		A willingness to take risks is necessary for great success. Many people could be as successful as I am, or more so, but fear of failure often holds them back.  I overcame my own fear of failure by focusing with passion on my dream and my vision; doing something each day to get me one step closer to my goal; and not letting failures along the way deter me.
		Great success means overcoming great obstacles. I guided Fruit of the Loom from a $500 million domestic company to a $5 billion global clothing giant, and along the way, I experienced intense trials. I have been on top of the highest mountain and in the depths of the lowest valleys. Through it all, I have set positive intentions, stayed passionate about everything I do, and treated the people around me with kindness and respect.
		Don't give up!  One of the biggest reasons many people fail is that they give up too soon. Steady, consistent effort toward a goal over a long period of time is required. The results of your effort will come. 
		Dare to dream big.  I come from a poor family, and my first job was delivering newspapers as a boy. I wasn’t earning much – mostly nickels – but I dared to dream big. 
		Ask for what you want, without qualification. Many people are scared to ask for their dreams directly and confidently. Accept no limits, and your success will know no limits.

What is 1 of 1 billion dollars? 200,000 REWARD FOR WORKING!  27ZriiJason DomingoTyler Daniels Canada Iowa MarcelTalesha Charlene BONNIE  28Without a bit of hesitation, Donald Trump answered, I would find a good network marketing company and get to work. Audiences of the David Letterman show began to hoot and boo Donald Trump, a guest on the show. He very sternly looked into the audience and said. "That's why I'm sitting up here and you are all sitting out there."  29In the last few years Wall Street has finally figured out what we have known for years, that MLM companies have some tremendous advantages over traditional businesses. In September 2002, Warren Buffet, CEO of multi-billion dollar strong Berkshire Hathaway and the second richest man in America, purchased Pampered Chef for 1.5 billion. According to Fortune Magazine, Buffet purchased Pampered Chef because it has no debt, high profit margins, a gung-ho management team, and world markets to conquer. Some of the worlds most successful investment firms have purchased well-established MLM companies for enormous sums. Why? Because they understand the value of a good investment.   30 JUST LOOK AT THE CALIBER OF PEOPLE JOINING ZRII  CHIROPRACTORS  Acupuncturist  FAMILY PRACTITIONERS  INTERNAL MEDICINE DOCTORS  Massage therapists  Law Enforcement Professionals  Owner of a Medical Spa  A FORMER TELEVISION STATION EXECUTIVE  An Advertising Agency and Media Buying Specialist  A Blue Ocean Business Strategy Expert Teacher  The Producer and Co-Creator of Television Shows  A MILLION-DOLLAR-A-YEAR MOTAVITONAL SPEAKER  The Owner of several large Regional Insurance Agencies  The Owner of an Entertainment Company  Internet Search Engine Marketing and Optimization Specialists  ATHLETES FROM THE NFL AND NBA  The Owner of a Direct Sales Company that did over 150 million in sales in its first 18 months  31OUR COMMITMENT TO YOULEAD BY EXAMPLE DO WHAT WE SAY BE AVAILABLE TEACH, COACH,  LEAD  32The 3 Reasons People Quit This BusinessTHEY DONT Make money Receive help from the person who introduced them to the business.

FARLEY STICKING TO FORMULA


By STEPHEN PHILLIPS, Special to the New York Times


Published: April 26, 1986









CHICAGO, April 25— 
                    William F. Farley, who turned a $25,000 investment into a $2 billion empire in less than 10 years, likes to talk in the jargon of baseball.        

                    Mr. Farley, a 43-year-old part-owner of the Chicago White Sox, rates one of his less successful deals, the Condec Corporation, as a single, and boasts how his $1.4 billion acquisition last year of Northwest Industries has ''home run potential.''        

                    In his eagerness to pile up runs for Farley Industries, the umbrella organization for his holdings, he is willing to make an occasional sacrifice play. Various operations have been sold and inventory adjustments have been made to improve overall performance, even though the moves have produced lower revenues and losses.        

                    For example, Farley/Northwest Industries, the name Mr. Farley gave to Chicago-based Northwest, lost $72.9 million last year, after earning $77.5 million a year earlier. Condec, a maker of electronic controls acquired in 1984, has lost more than $24 million in the last two years while it was also suffering declines in sales.        

                    There are those who see some perils in the Farley situation. ''Things are pretty tight,'' said Steven Brooks, a senior analyst with Moody's Investor Services, which recently downgraded the senior debt ratings on both Farley/Northwest and Condec because of their heavy debt. ''Given how leveraged up he is, he doesn't have a lot of leeway.''        

                    But Mr. Farley argues that the right moves are being made. ''If you're private,'' he said, ''you don't try to maximize reported earnings.''        

                    ''We're hardly under water,'' the trim, tan executive said in the spacious headquarters in the Sears Tower that he and his corporate staff of 25 inherited with the Northwest deal. ''We just paid off millions of dollars of bank debt.''        

                    Also, company officials have indicated that an announcement of a ''major restructuring'' involving Condec will be made soon. Some Moves Are Praised        

                    Most analysts agree with Mr. Farley that his pruning of Northwest, in particular, has been worthwhile. Among the moves he has made are taking a $52.6 million loss on the sale of the Pogo Producing Company, an oil and gas exploration company, and selling for $225 million the agrichemical division of the troubled Velsicol Chemical Corporation. He plans to sell the small remaining portion of Velsicol by the end of the year.        

                    What remains in the Northwest unit are one stellar business - Union Underwear, which markets under the Fruit of the Loom and B.V.D. labels - and two solid, but less impressive, operations - the General Battery Corporation, the nation's second-largest maker of replacement batteries for cars, and Acme Boot, whose products include the Dingo footwear line.        

                    A slimmer Northwest, beefed up by increased spending for such things as advertising, has considerable profit potential, according to Leon D. Black, a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.        

                    ''The picture had been cloudy because of Velsicol,'' he said, ''but with the asset sales, the numbers have already improved in a short period.'' What remains at Northwest, he said, ''is a future that looks very good.'' Two Leading Brands        

                    With Fruit of the Loom and B.V.D., Union controls 72 percent of the mass-merchandise underwear market. The unit had 1985 sales of $580 million and operating income of about $95 million, generating about 90 percent of the Northwest unit's operating income.        

                    Analysts say Union has a strong history. ''Fruit of the Loom did to men's underwear, what Hanes did to ladies' nylons,'' said W. Dudley Herr, an analyst with Duff & Phelps. ''They marketed underwear away from department stores to just about any retail outlet - grocery stores, five and dimes, you name it.''        

                    And it is here that Mr. Farley has his biggest plans. Hoping to capitalize on its distribution base, Farley will begin to strongly promote women's underwear as well as add men's and women's socks and sweatshirts to Union's product line later this year. According to Mr. Farley's estimates, socks and sweatshirts will add about $50 million in sales in 1986.        

                    Increasing Union's product line will not be easy, cautioned W. Dudley Herr, an analyst at Duff & Phelps. ''Stores just don't give a lot of play to Fruit of the Loom products now,'' he said. ''How he's going to get places like K Mart to clear even more shelf space is anybody's guess.''        

                    If Union is the strongest part of the Farley empire, analysts say Condec is the weak spot. In 1984, he bought the 90 percent of Condec that he did not own for $139 million.        

                    For the year ending in July 1985, the latest figures available, Condec had a loss of $9.75 million, on revenues of $215.5 million. In 1984 it lost $14.65 million. Mr. Farley said Condec was not very healthy when he purchased it - an assertion that is disputed by some former Condec officials. A Pentagon Investigation        

                    The Condec troubles have not been limited to finances. Condiesel, a unit, has been the target of a $20 million Department of Defense overcharge investigation. To make matters worse, its largest contract, carriage assemblies for howitzer armored vehicles, expired this month.

11 F.3d 1385 (1993)


UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
William F. FARLEY, Defendant-Appellee.


United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit.
Argued September 21, 1993.
Decided December 15, 1993.








Attorney(s) appearing for the Case
  Fred Foreman, U.S. Atty., Crim. Div., Catherine R. Fuller, F.T.C., Chicago, IL, James W. Lowe, Dept. of Justice Antitrust Div., Appellate Section, (argued), John W. Clark, U.S. Dept. of Justice, Reid B. Horwitz, Robert N. Cook, Ernest A. Nagata, Morris A. Bloom, F.T.C., Robert B. Nicholson, Dept. of Justice, Washington, DC, for U.S.
Lee A. Watson, Donald E. Egan (argued), Jaye Quadrozzi, Katten, Muchin & Zavis, Chicago, IL, for William F. Farley.
Before POSNER, Chief Judge, and CUMMINGS and CUDAHY, Circuit Judges.




CUMMINGS, Circuit Judge.
In January 1992 the United States filed a complaint alleging that William F. Farley violated Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18a, commonly called the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act ("HSR Act"). The complaint alleges that on March 24, 1988, Farley failed to notify the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") when his purchases of the stock of West Point-Pepperell, Inc. ("West Point") exceeded $15 million, the point at which the reporting requirements of the HSR Act contained in 15 U.S.C. § 18a(a)(3)(B) are triggered. The violation allegedly extended for 91 days until June 22, 1988. In accordance with 15 U.S.C. § 18a(g), the government sought a civil penalty of $910,000, the maximum daily civil penalty for violating the HSR Act reporting requirements. The district court dismissed the government's complaint with prejudice when, in response to a district court order, the government declined to produce nine internal FTC documents it alleged were protected by the work product and deliberative process privileges. The documents in question have recently been submitted to us for in camera review. We reverse.
STATUTE
The HSR Act prohibits anyone with substantial assets or sales from acquiring voting securities from another firm with substantial assets or sales if the acquisition would result in the purchaser holding at least $15 million of that firm's voting securities, unless (a) the purchaser first notifies the Department of Justice and the FTC and (b) complies with the statutory waiting period of 15 days for a cash tender offer, 30 days for other transactions, and 10 days in the case of bankruptcy filings. 15 U.S.C. § 18a(a), (b). There is an exemption for acquisitions of voting securities solely for the purpose of investment if they do not exceed 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer. 15 U.S.C. § 18a(c)(9). The notification requirements are intended to give antitrust enforcement agencies an opportunity to identify transactions that might violate Section 7A of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. § 18a).
FACTS
In 1988 defendant Farley was the majority stockholder and chief executive officer of Farley, Inc.,1 a holding company then engaged in the apparel, footwear and precision metals businesses. The principal executive office of Farley, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is located in Chicago. In February of 1988 Farley, Inc. borrowed $500 million through Drexel Burnham Lambert, Incorporated. Of this sum, $200 million was to pay off existing debt and the balance was to be invested in, inter alia, equity securities and possible acquisition candidates.
On March 9, 1988, Farley began purchasing West Point stock, and the value of that stock passed $15 million on March 24, 1988. Farley made no HSR filing at that time, but continued to purchase West Point stock. On April 11, he held almost 5% of the West Point stock, whose value was then about $50 million. Farley thus exceeded the HSR reporting  threshold by approximately $35 million.
On May 23, 1988, Farley filed an HSR Act pre-merger notification report seeking to acquire 25% of West Point stock. The HSR waiting period expired on June 23, 1988, without the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice seeking additional information. On October 24, 1988, Farley made a second HSR Act filing seeking approval to purchase up to 100% of West Point voting securities. The waiting period under the Act expired on November 7, again without any action by federal enforcement agencies. On April 5, 1989, Farley completed his acquisition of West Point. This suit concerns only his March 24, 1988, failure to report the purchase of $15 million of West Point stock in contravention of 15 U.S.C. § 18a(a)(3)(B).
COMPLAINT BY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
In early 1989 the FTC commenced investigating whether Farley violated the HSR Act's reporting and waiting period requirements when he passed the $15 million West Point stock threshold on March 24, 1988. Thereafter the FTC recommended that the Department of Justice bring this action against Farley for violating the HSR Act. As a result this suit was filed on February 12, 1992, seeking recovery of a $910,000 statutory penalty under 15 U.S.C. § 18a(g)(1).
Farley's answer claimed, among other defenses,2 that he was not required to report his March and April 1988 West Point purchases because they fell within the investment-only exemption contained in the HSR Act which exempts "acquisitions, solely for the purpose of investment, of voting securities, if, as a result of such acquisition, the securities acquired or held do not exceed 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer." 15 U.S.C. § 18a(c)(9).
After the FTC had recommended to the Justice Department that this suit be brought but before the complaint was filed, Raymond Randall — an FTC attorney who had worked on the investigation — without the permission of the FTC delivered internal FTC documents relating to the Farley investigation to one of Farley's law firms. That firm's ethics counsel returned the original documents to the FTC but retained copies.
After the complaint was filed, Farley demanded production of 16 years' worth of FTC and Department of Justice files relating to the interpretation and application of the investment-only exemption in the HSR Act (15 U.S.C. § 18a(c)(9)). This request covered over 1,000 documents and attachments. Shortly thereafter Farley requested the documents that FTC attorney Randall had improperly released. The government produced all documents relating to the investment-only exemption and the Farley investigation (over 400 documents) except 39 documents and attachments the FTC alleged were protected by the work product and deliberative process privileges. The 39 documents withheld included most of the documents wrongfully disclosed by Randall.
The district judge referred this and other open discovery matters to Magistrate Judge Lefkow. Farley moved to compel the production of all documents not yet produced relating, among other things, to the investigation of his acquisitions, including any communications with West Point or its counsel.
After reviewing the disputed documents in camera, the magistrate judge ordered certain of them be disclosed to Farley. The government filed objections to Magistrate Judge Lefkow's decision as to nine of the documents (identified on the government's privilege log as numbers 119-B, 210-B, 221-B, 221-D, 244-C, 249-B, 286, 287-B-1, 288-A-1),3 again relying on the work product and deliberative process privileges. The nine  documents included memoranda of FTC staff members and discussions of the Farley matter, as well as documents containing the FTC staff's views on the investment-only exemption and recommendations for future action. Without inspecting the disputed documents, Judge Duff refused to overturn the magistrate judge's disclosure order because of his expressed confidence in her ruling. Consequently, in accordance with the procedure approved in United States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677, 678-681, 78 S.Ct. 983, 984-986, 2 L.Ed.2d 1077, the government suggested dismissal of the case solely in order to obtain appellate review. Thereafter the action was dismissed with prejudice on January 26, 1993, and this appeal subsequently was filed.
ANALYSIS
(A) Deliberative Process and Work Product Privileges
The magistrate judge ruled that the documents in question were covered by the deliberative process or work product privilege but that the documents should nonetheless be disclosed. The deliberative process privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process of a governmental agency. NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150-152, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 1516-1517, 44 L.Ed.2d 29. Since frank discussion of legal and policy matters is essential to the decision-making process of a governmental agency, communications made prior to and as a part of an agency determination are protected from disclosure. Id. at 151, 95 S.Ct. at 1516-17. Communications made subsequent to an agency decision are, however, not similarly protected. Id. at 152, 95 S.Ct. at 1517. The deliberative process privilege may be overcome where there is a sufficient showing of a particularized need to outweigh the reasons for confidentiality. Cf. Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 868 (D.C.Cir.1980) (the privilege should be applied "as narrowly as consistent with efficient government operation"); Black v. Sheraton Corp. of America, 564 F.2d 531, 545 (D.C.Cir.1977).
After examining the documents, this Court concludes that the documents were clearly part of the deliberative process leading to the decision to sue. Document No. 244-C is the referral memorandum from the FTC staff to the Department of Justice. Having been rendered prior to the Department's decision to bring an action against Farley, the document is within the Department's deliberative process privilege. Since the document was pre-decisional and deliberative, the fact that the document passed from one agency to another does not terminate its privileged status. Renegotiation Board v. Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp., 421 U.S. 168, 188, 95 S.Ct. 1491, 1502, 44 L.Ed.2d 57; Bureau of Nat'l Affairs, Inc. v. United States Dep't of Justice, 742 F.2d 1484, 1497 (D.C.Cir.1984). The other disputed documents are staff memoranda to senior agency officials with recommendations, legal interpretations and drafts of litigation documents, documents clearly part of the FTC's deliberations on the Farley matter and therefore exempt from production. Formaldehyde Institute v. Department of Health & Human Services, 889 F.2d 1118, 1122-1125 (D.C.Cir. 1989) (collecting cases). The deliberative process extends to these pre-decisional communications — if communications such as these were exposed the candor of government staff would be tempered "with a concern for appearances * * * to the detriment of the decisionmaking process." United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 705, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3106, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039; Sears, Roebuck, 421 U.S. at 150-151, 95 S.Ct. at 1516-1517. Moreover, since the documents reflect an agency's preliminary positions about how to exercise discretion on a policy, they are privileged. Petroleum Information Corp. v. United States Dep't of Interior, 976 F.2d 1429, 1435 (D.C.Cir.1992).
Since the documents at issue are within the scope of the deliberative process privilege, the government could only be required to produce them if Farley made a showing that his need for the documents outweighed the government's interest in not disclosing them. Coastal States Gas Corp., 617 F.2d at 868; Black, 564 F.2d at 545. Farley, however, has never shown such a particularized need. Farley's only assertion  of need was his claim that they are relevant and generally important to his affirmative defenses. Yet relevance alone is an insufficient reason for breaching the deliberative process privilege. It was essential that the magistrate judge balance Farley's particularized need for the documents against their nature and the effect of disclosure on the government. This balancing was never done. Instead the magistrate judge merely determined that the documents were relevant to Farley's defense and ordered their disclosure. Since the required balancing was not done, the documents should not have been ordered to be produced.
The magistrate judge also held the work product privilege epitomized in Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451, applied to certain documents, but nevertheless ordered disclosure to assist defendant's defense. Documents protected by the work product privilege, however, need only be disclosed upon a showing of substantial need. Id. at 511-512, 67 S.Ct. at 393-394. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(3). It does not appear from the record that such a substantial need was ever shown.
(B) Relevance
Although this Court believes that the magistrate failed to determine properly whether Farley had shown sufficient need to overcome the two privileges, we need not remand this case for such a determination. Since the documents at issue are not relevant to the controversy before us, Farley cannot, as a matter of law, make a showing of need.
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contemplate broad discovery, permitting discovery "regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action." Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1) (emphasis supplied). The rules of discovery are, however, not broad enough to require the discovery of the material here at issue. The discovery proposed here is not relevant to the issue presented by the government's complaint, whether Farley was required to report on March 24, 1988, that his holdings in West Point had exceeded the $15 million threshold. To resolve this issue, the court need only compare Farley's acquisitions and filings to the HSR Act's reporting requirements. Nor is the proposed discovery relevant to any of Farley's affirmative defenses. Farley's affirmative defenses are:
(1) that the government's complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted;
(2) that the complaint is barred by the doctrine of estoppel because Farley relied to his detriment on the FTC's then existing public interpretations of the investment-only exemption;
(3) that Farley's purchases were exempt from HSR Act requirements under the investment-only exemption;
(4) that the FTC regulation defining the exemption, 16 C.F.R. § 802.9, is impermissibly vague;
(5) that enforcement of that regulation would be arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act; and
(6) that Farley had no notice that the investment-only exemption would not apply to his initial acquisitions.
The FTC documents are definitely not relevant to Farley's claim that his purchases fell within the investment-only exemption to the HSR Act's reporting requirements. This defense requires only that the district court interpret the statutory exemption and determine whether Farley's purchases were within the scope of that exemption. The suppositions of FTC staff members expressed in internal memoranda as to requirements of the Act are not pertinent to this task. In its attempt to decipher the meaning of a statute a court may rely on various tools, including official agency interpretations. Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 864-866, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2792, 81 L.Ed.2d 694. Courts may not, however, rely on unpublished opinions of agency staff. International Paper Co. v. Federal Power Comm'n, 438 F.2d 1349, 1358-1359 (2d Cir.1971), certiorari denied, 404 U.S. 827, 92 S.Ct. 61, 30 L.Ed.2d 56 ("[V]iews of individual members of the [agency's] staff are not legally germane."). The documents at issue here clearly fall in the latter category and as such are not germane to the court's inquiry.
 Similarly, the documents at issue have no bearing on Farley's claim that the government is estopped from pursuing the interpretation of the investment-only exemption urged by the FTC because Farley supposedly relied to his detriment on the agency's previously announced interpretations of the HSR Act. The merit of this defense turns not on the substance of intra-agency communications but on the content of publicly articulated policy. The views of agency employees contained in intra-agency documents are not, however, expressions of FTC policy. Id. Rather they are part of the exchange of ideas—the give and take—central to the formulation of such policy. Farley's detrimental reliance claim, therefore, is not a basis for admitting the documents in question.
Nor do any of Farley's other defenses provide a basis for discovery. The FTC's internal documents are not relevant to Farley's claim that the FTC regulation defining the investment-only exemption, 16 C.F.R. § 802.9, is impermissibly vague. This is a matter of statutory interpretation and constitutional analysis, a process which does not require the court to review the postulations of agency staff members as to the meaning of the investment-only exemption. The FTC documents are also not relevant to Farley's contention that the government has failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted —this is a question of law on which the FTC documents can shed no light. Nor are the documents relevant to Farley's claim that the FTC's regulations did not provide adequate notice that he was required to report his initial West Point investments. Since the documents in question were for intra-agency use and not general distribution, they reveal nothing about the adequacy of the public notice provided by the regulations. Post-publication discourse among FTC staff about the meaning of the HSR regulations is irrelevant to the central issue of this defense— determining whether Farley should, after reading the regulations, have understood that his purchases did not fall within the definition of the investment-only exemption set out therein. To resolve this question, the court need look only to the language of the regulation and any official, public interpretations of it. Cf. International Paper Co., 438 F.2d at 1358-1359.
Farley's remaining defense is that the application of 16 C.F.R. § 802.9 to his acquisitions constitutes arbitrary and capricious action in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act ("APA"), 5 U.S.C. § 706.4 Judicial review under the APA is of official agency action. 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). Comments made in internal FTC documents are not official agency actions and therefore not legally relevant to a court's review under the APA.
CONCLUSION
This Court's inspection of the documents at issue shows that they were clearly covered by the deliberative process and work product privileges. Ordering their disclosure without a proper assessment of Farley's need for the documents was an error. Moreover, as the documents are as a matter of law not relevant to the present controversy, a showing of sufficient need is not possible. Consequently, the disclosure and dismissal orders were erroneous.
REVERSED AND REMANDED.


FootNotes 
1. Farley and Farley, Inc. are used interchangeably herein because defendant was the "ultimate parent entity" of Farley, Inc., as defined in 16 C.F.R. § 801.1(3), and was the person responsible for the notifications required by the HSR Act. 16 C.F.R. § 803.2(a).

2. Farley's other defenses are set out infra p. 1390. The district judge denied plaintiff's motion to strike some of the six affirmative defenses as insufficiently pled under Fed.R.Civ.P. 8, but postponed a determination of whether the defenses were legally sufficient. Joint App. 52-55 (indicating that defenses might be struck for legal insufficiency "in a motion for summary judgment or some other proceeding later in the case").

3. Farley appears to believe that the magistrate judge's order covers more than these nine documents. That dispute need not be resolved since the issues underlying the magistrate judge's order are the same for all documents in dispute.

4. We note that it is unclear whether the FTC has taken any action with regard to Farley that is reviewable under the APA. The APA provides for judicial review of "final agency action," 5 U.S.C. § 704, defined to include an agency "rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act." 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). The only action taken by the FTC with regard to Farley was its referral of his case to the Department of Justice, and this referral may not be a "final agency action," but merely "a threshold determination that further inquiry is warranted. ..." FTC v. Standard Oil of California, 449 U.S. 232, 241, 101 S.Ct. 488, 493, 66 L.Ed.2d 416. It is also unclear whether the district court presently has jurisdiction over a challenge to an action taken by the FTC since the FTC is not a party to this action. This Court will not resolve these issues here since we believe that regardless of the outcome of those issues Farley does not have a right to discover the documents in question. However, so that further relevancy and discovery problems can be minimized, the district court judge should determine whether this— and any other defenses—should be stricken as legally insufficient.

Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Farley was born the elder of two children to a working-class Irish Catholic family on October 10, 1942 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.[1] He was the son of John Farley, a postal worker and part-time musician, and Barbara Farley, a receptionist.[2] Farley attended grade school at St. Leo's School in Pawtucket, and later became a recruited high school athlete and student at St. Raphael Academy,[2] his father's high school. Farley graduated from St. Raphael's in 1960.[3]
Farley attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, from 1960–1964, where he majored in government and earned an academic scholarship. At Bowdoin, he was a varsity athlete in football, swimming, and baseball.[4] He received a Juris Doctorate from Boston College in 1969.
Professional career[edit]
Early years[edit]
After graduating from Bowdoin in 1964, Farley traveled across the U.S. and Mexico for six months, eventually settling in Los Angeles.[1] In Los Angeles., Farley sold Collier's Encyclopedia door to door.[2] Within two years he was the company's leading salesman, and was appointed head of training for the national sales force.[5] Farley entered the Boston College Law School in 1966, earning a J.D. in 1969.
NL Industries and Lehman Brothers[edit]
After law school, Farley moved to New York City, where he took a job in the mergers and acquisitions division of NL Industries, a manufacturing company with a number of subsidiaries. At NL Industries, Farley did analysis on potential acquisition targets, and rose to director of long range planning and acquisitions. During this time, he pursued an M.B.A. at New York University.[2] In 1972, Farley was transferred to Chicago, where he functioned as the regional manager of NL Industries' metals division.[4]
In 1973, Farley left NL Industries and took a position as an associate in the corporate finance division of Lehman Brothers in Chicago.
Farley Industries[edit]
In 1976 NL Industries contacted Farley at Lehman Brothers) to see if he knew of a potential buyer for Anaheim Citrus Products Co., a small subsidiary that produced pectin, a thickening agent used in foods and other products. In October 1976, at age 33, he executed his first leveraged buyout for $1.9 million. To facilitate the buyout, Farley founded Farley Industries, a private holdings company in the Sears Tower in Chicago.[6] After six months, Farley had raised the funds for the buyout, including his life savings of $25,000, plus $1.7 million in loans and notes borrowed against the company assets.[7]
Within two years after the buyout, Anaheim Citrus had doubled its sales. In 1977, Farley purchased Baumfolder Corporation, a struggling manufacturing company, using funds from equipment sales at Anaheim Citrus. Farley quit Lehman and moved to Ohio to oversee the Baumfolder turnaround.[1][2] He later sold Baumfolder to its employees for $10 million.[8]
In 1982, Farley purchased NL Metals, the same group he used to run at NL. The purchase price was $118 million, making NL Metals the first in a line of significantly larger acquisitions that Farley would make over the next decade.[5]
Farley Industries soon encompassed numerous companies within the manufacturing, mining, and apparel industries. The largest acquisition was Northwest Industries, for $1.4 billion in July 1985.[8] Farley Industries had 50,000 employees and nearly $4 billion in annual sales by the late 1980s.
In 1991 Farley Industries entered bankruptcy and was dismantled.[9][10]
West Point Pepperell[edit]
In 1988, Farley completed a hostile takeover of West Point Pepperell, Inc., a textile company that had been family-owned in West Point, Georgia, and surrounding communities for more than 100 years. Farley paid $1.5 billion for the company, eclipsing the mark of $1.4 billion he had paid a year prior for Northwest Industries. Farley financed his purchase of 95.3 percent of the company through bank debt and high-yield junk bonds. The hostile takeover did not sit well with employees and community citizens, especially as Farley's promises to "modernize and expand" the company never came to fruition.[11] Less than four years later, the company filed bankruptcy, and Farley resigned to focus his efforts on Fruit of the Loom. [12] Fruit of the Loom would ultimately declare bankruptcy in 1999; Farley walked away from that company as well.
Fruit of the Loom[edit]
Though Farley eventually sold most businesses within the Farley/Northwest Holding Corp. conglomerate, he kept Fruit of the Loom Inc.[13][14] In March 1987, Farley completed a successful $565 million public offering of Fruit of the Loom shares.[15]
Farley served as president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom from 1985 to 2000. During that time, Fruit of the Loom's revenue grew from $500 million to almost $2.5 billion. At its peak, Farley Industries employed over 30,000 employees worldwide.[2] During his tenure as president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom, revenues rose nearly fivefold, from $500 million to almost $2.5 billion. At its peak, in 1997, Fruit of the Loom was trading at roughly $44 per share. The press teased Farley about the company's unconventional advertisements, featuring Farley.[16]
Even while the company's revenue was rising sharply, its debt proved increasingly unwieldy amid the shifting economy. In 1999 Fruit of the Loom posted a net loss of $576 million and the company filed for bankruptcy. Farley left Fruit of the Loom that same year. In 2002, Fruit of the Loom was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway.[17] The Fruit of the Loom bankruptcy was Farley's third in 11 years, preceded by the failures under his leadership of Farley Industries and West Point Pepperell.
Junk bond failures[edit]
While Farley's success in the 1980's had made him wealthy, his junk-bond processes failed miserably in the 1990's, ultimately leading to bankruptcy for several companies he had attempted to take over. [18]
Zrii, LLC[edit]
In May 2008, Farley launched a brand-new multi-level marketing health and beauty company based out of Salt Lake City, Utah. The company, Zrii, LLC, had more than 4,000 independent distributors attend its launch at the Salt Lake City Convention Center.
Zrii, a Sanskrit word which means "light, luster, splendor, and prosperity", was endorsed by lifestyle guru Deepak Chopra and the Chopra Center for Wellbeing. The basis of its namesake product was a juice extracted from the amalaki fruit, which is grown exclusively in India at the base of the Himalayas.[19]
In February 2009, 35 employees staged a walkout of Zrii headquarters and demanded that Farley resign.[citation needed]. The employees had formed their own company and attempted to make an offer to take over Zrii, but Farley refused to step down. He sued the top managers, claiming that their goal was to force him out in order to purchase the company for a reduced cost; the lawsuit further claimed that the employees had deliberately raided and sabotaged company computers before the walk-out.
In December 2009, Farley won $400,000 in a settlement agreement with LifeVantage Corporation, where many of his former employees were hired.[20] LifeVantage admitted no interference with Zrii's operations in the settlement agreement.
Management style[edit]
Farley spent over $3 million a year on programs at his subsidiaries that encouraged physical fitness, good nutrition, and smoking cessation.[4] He traveled to work sites and solicited employees' opinions about the quality of their food and facilities, making improvements if his workers weren't satisfied.[21] Farley installed baseball fields, tracks, and other fitness facilities at plants and factories.[1]
Farley was also known for his relentless work ethic, and his schedule often demanded brutal hours; he occasionally held meetings with managers late at night if there was no available time during the day.[8]
Farley also preferred to keep his companies small and efficiently organized: He is known for insisting that company hierarchies be trimmed down to reduce the number of layers between the lowest-level workers and top-level executives.[22]
Philanthropic activity[edit]
A firm believer in education, Farley has contributed millions of dollars to his alma maters. His largest single contribution was a $3.5 million gift to Bowdoin College in 1984,[2] which resulted in Farley Field House, an indoor athletic facility with a track, indoor tennis courts, and spectator areas.[23][24] He also founded scholarship programs for students at Boston College Law School,[22] and made a $1.5 million donation to endow the William F. Farley Chair at the law school. In May 1996, Farley made a $1 million donation to his high school, St. Raphael Academy, which went toward science and computer resources, tuition assistance, and the athletic department.[25] In 1998 and in honor of Farley's contributions to the school, the West Annex Building at St. Raphael was renamed Barbara Farley Hall, in honor of Farley's mother.[3]
Farley has made numerous contributions over the years to the American Heart Association, and he's been a donor to and board member of various civic and cultural organizations in his adopted hometown of Chicago, Illinois (including the Goodman Theater, the Lyric Opera House, and the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations).[5][23] He has also sat on the board of directors for the Horatio Alger Association.[15]
Awards and honors[edit]

1984: Farley is recognized as Outstanding Business Graduate of the Year by the Boston College Law School Alumni Association.[15]
1986: Farley receives the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans award. The award is given to "community leaders who demonstrate individual initiative and a commitment to excellence, as exemplified by remarkable achievements accomplished through honesty, hard work, self-reliance and perseverance over adversity."[26]
1988: Farley is inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame,[27] and is honored by the Boys & Girls Club of America as a Business/Community Honoree of the Year.
1997: Honored by the Ireland-U.S. Council for Commerce and Industry for outstanding achievement for his work in economics, business, and commercial activity. He also is named one of Irish-America magazine's top 100 businessmen,[15] and receives the White House's Presidential Award for Entrepreneurial Excellence.[28]
2008: Farley is honored with a Freedom Award from America's Freedom Festival at Provo.[29]

Personal life[edit]
Farley was a high school athlete at St. Raphael Academy in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and played three varsity sports (football, swimming, and baseball) at Bowdoin. He provided financial support to the athletic departments at St. Raphael and Bowdoin.
In the 1980s, Farley became a minority owner of the Chicago White Sox.[4]
Farley was an active member in the Young Presidents Organization; he is currently a member of the World Presidents Organization. He has also been a member of the Chicago Club and the University Associates of Northwestern University for years.[15]
Farley lives in Chicago with his wife, Shelley, a cabaret singer who has performed Michael Feinstein, George Burns, and President Bill Clinton.[30] Farley has three sons; the youngest, Liam, lives in Chicago with him. His two older sons, Hayes MacArthur and Scott, live in Los Angeles.

Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Farley was born the elder of two children to a working-class Irish Catholic family on October 10, 1942 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.[1] He was the son of John Farley, a postal worker and part-time musician, and Barbara Farley, a receptionist.[2] Farley attended grade school at St. Leo's School in Pawtucket, and later became a recruited high school athlete and student at St. Raphael Academy,[2] his father's high school. Farley graduated from St. Raphael's in 1960.[3]
Farley attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, from 1960–1964, where he majored in government and earned an academic scholarship. At Bowdoin, he was a varsity athlete in football, swimming, and baseball.[4] He received a Juris Doctorate from Boston College in 1969.
Professional career[edit]
Early years[edit]
After graduating from Bowdoin in 1964, Farley traveled across the U.S. and Mexico for six months, eventually settling in Los Angeles.[1] In Los Angeles., Farley sold Collier's Encyclopedia door to door.[2] Within two years he was the company's leading salesman, and was appointed head of training for the national sales force.[5] Farley entered the Boston College Law School in 1966, earning a J.D. in 1969.
NL Industries and Lehman Brothers[edit]
After law school, Farley moved to New York City, where he took a job in the mergers and acquisitions division of NL Industries, a manufacturing company with a number of subsidiaries. At NL Industries, Farley did analysis on potential acquisition targets, and rose to director of long range planning and acquisitions. During this time, he pursued an M.B.A. at New York University.[2] In 1972, Farley was transferred to Chicago, where he functioned as the regional manager of NL Industries' metals division.[4]
In 1973, Farley left NL Industries and took a position as an associate in the corporate finance division of Lehman Brothers in Chicago.
Farley Industries[edit]
In 1976 NL Industries contacted Farley at Lehman Brothers) to see if he knew of a potential buyer for Anaheim Citrus Products Co., a small subsidiary that produced pectin, a thickening agent used in foods and other products. In October 1976, at age 33, he executed his first leveraged buyout for $1.9 million. To facilitate the buyout, Farley founded Farley Industries, a private holdings company in the Sears Tower in Chicago.[6] After six months, Farley had raised the funds for the buyout, including his life savings of $25,000, plus $1.7 million in loans and notes borrowed against the company assets.[7]
Within two years after the buyout, Anaheim Citrus had doubled its sales. In 1977, Farley purchased Baumfolder Corporation, a struggling manufacturing company, using funds from equipment sales at Anaheim Citrus. Farley quit Lehman and moved to Ohio to oversee the Baumfolder turnaround.[1][2] He later sold Baumfolder to its employees for $10 million.[8]
In 1982, Farley purchased NL Metals, the same group he used to run at NL. The purchase price was $118 million, making NL Metals the first in a line of significantly larger acquisitions that Farley would make over the next decade.[5]
Farley Industries soon encompassed numerous companies within the manufacturing, mining, and apparel industries. The largest acquisition was Northwest Industries, for $1.4 billion in July 1985.[8] Farley Industries had 50,000 employees and nearly $4 billion in annual sales by the late 1980s.
In 1991 Farley Industries entered bankruptcy and was dismantled.[9][10]
West Point Pepperell[edit]
In 1988, Farley completed a hostile takeover of West Point Pepperell, Inc., a textile company that had been family-owned in West Point, Georgia, and surrounding communities for more than 100 years. Farley paid $1.5 billion for the company, eclipsing the mark of $1.4 billion he had paid a year prior for Northwest Industries. Farley financed his purchase of 95.3 percent of the company through bank debt and high-yield junk bonds. The hostile takeover did not sit well with employees and community citizens, especially as Farley's promises to "modernize and expand" the company never came to fruition.[11] Less than four years later, the company filed bankruptcy, and Farley resigned to focus his efforts on Fruit of the Loom. [12] Fruit of the Loom would ultimately declare bankruptcy in 1999; Farley walked away from that company as well.
Fruit of the Loom[edit]
Though Farley eventually sold most businesses within the Farley/Northwest Holding Corp. conglomerate, he kept Fruit of the Loom Inc.[13][14] In March 1987, Farley completed a successful $565 million public offering of Fruit of the Loom shares.[15]
Farley served as president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom from 1985 to 2000. During that time, Fruit of the Loom's revenue grew from $500 million to almost $2.5 billion. At its peak, Farley Industries employed over 30,000 employees worldwide.[2] During his tenure as president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom, revenues rose nearly fivefold, from $500 million to almost $2.5 billion. At its peak, in 1997, Fruit of the Loom was trading at roughly $44 per share. The press teased Farley about the company's unconventional advertisements, featuring Farley.[16]
Even while the company's revenue was rising sharply, its debt proved increasingly unwieldy amid the shifting economy. In 1999 Fruit of the Loom posted a net loss of $576 million and the company filed for bankruptcy. Farley left Fruit of the Loom that same year. In 2002, Fruit of the Loom was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway.[17] The Fruit of the Loom bankruptcy was Farley's third in 11 years, preceded by the failures under his leadership of Farley Industries and West Point Pepperell.
Junk bond failures[edit]
While Farley's success in the 1980's had made him wealthy, his junk-bond processes failed miserably in the 1990's, ultimately leading to bankruptcy for several companies he had attempted to take over. [18]
Zrii, LLC[edit]
In May 2008, Farley launched a brand-new multi-level marketing health and beauty company based out of Salt Lake City, Utah. The company, Zrii, LLC, had more than 4,000 independent distributors attend its launch at the Salt Lake City Convention Center.
Zrii, a Sanskrit word which means "light, luster, splendor, and prosperity", was endorsed by lifestyle guru Deepak Chopra and the Chopra Center for Wellbeing. The basis of its namesake product was a juice extracted from the amalaki fruit, which is grown exclusively in India at the base of the Himalayas.[19]
In February 2009, 35 employees staged a walkout of Zrii headquarters and demanded that Farley resign.[citation needed]. The employees had formed their own company and attempted to make an offer to take over Zrii, but Farley refused to step down. He sued the top managers, claiming that their goal was to force him out in order to purchase the company for a reduced cost; the lawsuit further claimed that the employees had deliberately raided and sabotaged company computers before the walk-out.
In December 2009, Farley won $400,000 in a settlement agreement with LifeVantage Corporation, where many of his former employees were hired.[20] LifeVantage admitted no interference with Zrii's operations in the settlement agreement.
Management style[edit]
Farley spent over $3 million a year on programs at his subsidiaries that encouraged physical fitness, good nutrition, and smoking cessation.[4] He traveled to work sites and solicited employees' opinions about the quality of their food and facilities, making improvements if his workers weren't satisfied.[21] Farley installed baseball fields, tracks, and other fitness facilities at plants and factories.[1]
Farley was also known for his relentless work ethic, and his schedule often demanded brutal hours; he occasionally held meetings with managers late at night if there was no available time during the day.[8]
Farley also preferred to keep his companies small and efficiently organized: He is known for insisting that company hierarchies be trimmed down to reduce the number of layers between the lowest-level workers and top-level executives.[22]
Philanthropic activity[edit]
A firm believer in education, Farley has contributed millions of dollars to his alma maters. His largest single contribution was a $3.5 million gift to Bowdoin College in 1984,[2] which resulted in Farley Field House, an indoor athletic facility with a track, indoor tennis courts, and spectator areas.[23][24] He also founded scholarship programs for students at Boston College Law School,[22] and made a $1.5 million donation to endow the William F.

Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Farley was born the elder of two children to a working-class Irish Catholic family on October 10, 1942 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.[1] He was the son of John Farley, a postal worker and part-time musician, and Barbara Farley, a receptionist.[2] Farley attended grade school at St. Leo's School in Pawtucket, and later became a recruited high school athlete and student at St. Raphael Academy,[2] his father's high school. Farley graduated from St. Raphael's in 1960.[3]
Farley attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, from 1960–1964, where he majored in government and earned an academic scholarship. At Bowdoin, he was a varsity athlete in football, swimming, and baseball.[4] He received a Juris Doctorate from Boston College in 1969.
Professional career[edit]
Early years[edit]
After graduating from Bowdoin in 1964, Farley traveled across the U.S. and Mexico for six months, eventually settling in Los Angeles.[1] In Los Angeles., Farley sold Collier's Encyclopedia door to door.[2] Within two years he was the company's leading salesman, and was appointed head of training for the national sales force.[5] Farley entered the Boston College Law School in 1966, earning a J.D. in 1969.
NL Industries and Lehman Brothers[edit]
After law school, Farley moved to New York City, where he took a job in the mergers and acquisitions division of NL Industries, a manufacturing company with a number of subsidiaries. At NL Industries, Farley did analysis on potential acquisition targets, and rose to director of long range planning and acquisitions. During this time, he pursued an M.B.A. at New York University.[2] In 1972, Farley was transferred to Chicago, where he functioned as the regional manager of NL Industries' metals division.[4]
In 1973, Farley left NL Industries and took a position as an associate in the corporate finance division of Lehman Brothers in Chicago.
Farley Industries[edit]
In 1976 NL Industries contacted Farley at Lehman Brothers) to see if he knew of a potential buyer for Anaheim Citrus Products Co., a small subsidiary that produced pectin, a thickening agent used in foods and other products. In October 1976, at age 33, he executed his first leveraged buyout for $1.9 million. To facilitate the buyout, Farley founded Farley Industries, a private holdings company in the Sears Tower in Chicago.[6] After six months, Farley had raised the funds for the buyout, including his life savings of $25,000, plus $1.7 million in loans and notes borrowed against the company assets.[7]
Within two years after the buyout, Anaheim Citrus had doubled its sales. In 1977, Farley purchased Baumfolder Corporation, a struggling manufacturing company, using funds from equipment sales at Anaheim Citrus. Farley quit Lehman and moved to Ohio to oversee the Baumfolder turnaround.[1][2] He later sold Baumfolder to its employees for $10 million.[8]
In 1982, Farley purchased NL Metals, the same group he used to run at NL. The purchase price was $118 million, making NL Metals the first in a line of significantly larger acquisitions that Farley would make over the next decade.[5]
Farley Industries soon encompassed numerous companies within the manufacturing, mining, and apparel industries. The largest acquisition was Northwest Industries, for $1.4 billion in July 1985.[8] Farley Industries had 50,000 employees and nearly $4 billion in annual sales by the late 1980s.
In 1991 Farley Industries entered bankruptcy and was dismantled.[9][10]
West Point Pepperell[edit]
In 1988, Farley completed a hostile takeover of West Point Pepperell, Inc., a textile company that had been family-owned in West Point, Georgia, and surrounding communities for more than 100 years. Farley paid $1.5 billion for the company, eclipsing the mark of $1.4 billion he had paid a year prior for Northwest Industries. Farley financed his purchase of 95.3 percent of the company through bank debt and high-yield junk bonds. The hostile takeover did not sit well with employees and community citizens, especially as Farley's promises to "modernize and expand" the company never came to fruition.[11] Less than four years later, the company filed bankruptcy, and Farley resigned to focus his efforts on Fruit of the Loom. [12] Fruit of the Loom would ultimately declare bankruptcy in 1999; Farley walked away from that company as well.
Fruit of the Loom[edit]
Though Farley eventually sold most businesses within the Farley/Northwest Holding Corp. conglomerate, he kept Fruit of the Loom Inc.[13][14] In March 1987, Farley completed a successful $565 million public offering of Fruit of the Loom shares.[15]
Farley served as president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom from 1985 to 2000. During that time, Fruit of the Loom's revenue grew from $500 million to almost $2.5 billion. At its peak, Farley Industries employed over 30,000 employees worldwide.[2] During his tenure as president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom, revenues rose nearly fivefold, from $500 million to almost $2.5 billion. At its peak, in 1997, Fruit of the Loom was trading at roughly $44 per share. The press teased Farley about the company's unconventional advertisements, featuring Farley.[16]
Even while the company's revenue was rising sharply, its debt proved increasingly unwieldy amid the shifting economy. In 1999 Fruit of the Loom posted a net loss of $576 million and the company filed for bankruptcy. Farley left Fruit of the Loom that same year. In 2002, Fruit of the Loom was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway.[17] The Fruit of the Loom bankruptcy was Farley's third in 11 years, preceded by the failures under his leadership of Farley Industries and West Point Pepperell.
Junk bond failures[edit]
While Farley's success in the 1980's had made him wealthy, his junk-bond processes failed miserably in the 1990's, ultimately leading to bankruptcy for several companies he had attempted to take over. [18]
Zrii, LLC[edit]
In May 2008, Farley launched a brand-new multi-level marketing health and beauty company based out of Salt Lake City, Utah. The company, Zrii, LLC, had more than 4,000 independent distributors attend its launch at the Salt Lake City Convention Center.
Zrii, a Sanskrit word which means "light, luster, splendor, and prosperity", was endorsed by lifestyle guru Deepak Chopra and the Chopra Center for Wellbeing. The basis of its namesake product was a juice extracted from the amalaki fruit, which is grown exclusively in India at the base of the Himalayas.[19]
In February 2009, 35 employees staged a walkout of Zrii headquarters and demanded that Farley resign.[citation needed]. The employees had formed their own company and attempted to make an offer to take over Zrii, but Farley refused to step down. He sued the top managers, claiming that their goal was to force him out in order to purchase the company for a reduced cost; the lawsuit further claimed that the employees had deliberately raided and sabotaged company computers before the walk-out.
In December 2009, Farley won $400,000 in a settlement agreement with LifeVantage Corporation, where many of his former employees were hired.[20] LifeVantage admitted no interference with Zrii's operations in the settlement agreement.
Management style[edit]
Farley spent over $3 million a year on programs at his subsidiaries that encouraged physical fitness, good nutrition, and smoking cessation.[4] He traveled to work sites and solicited employees' opinions about the quality of their food and facilities, making improvements if his workers weren't satisfied.[21] Farley installed baseball fields, tracks, and other fitness facilities at plants and factories.[1]
Farley was also known for his relentless work ethic, and his schedule often demanded brutal hours; he occasionally held meetings with managers late at night if there was no available time during the day.[8]
Farley also preferred to keep his companies small and efficiently organized: He is known for insisting that company hierarchies be trimmed down to reduce the number of layers between the lowest-level workers and top-level executives.[22]
Philanthropic activity[edit]
A firm believer in education, Farley has contributed millions of dollars to his alma maters. His largest single contribution was a $3.5 million gift to Bowdoin College in 1984,[2] which resulted in Farley Field House, an indoor athletic facility with a track, indoor tennis courts, and spectator areas.[23][24] He also founded scholarship programs for students at Boston College Law School,[22] and made a $1.5 million donation to endow the William F. Farley Chair at the law school. In May 1996, Farley made a $1 million donation to his high school, St. Raphael Academy, which went toward science and computer resources, tuition assistance, and the athletic department.[25] In 1998 and in honor of Farley's contributions to the school, the West Annex Building at St. Raphael was renamed Barbara Farley Hall, in honor of Farley's mother.[3]
Farley has made numerous contributions over the years to the American Heart Association, and he's been a donor to and board member of various civic and cultural organizations in his adopted hometown of Chicago, Illinois (including the Goodman Theater, the Lyric Opera House, and the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations).[5][23] He has also sat on the board of directors for the Horatio Alger Association.[15]
Awards and honors[edit]

1984: Farley is recognized as Outstanding Business Graduate of the Year by the Boston College Law School Alumni Association.[15]
1986: Farley receives the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans award. The award is given to "community leaders who demonstrate individual initiative and a commitment to excellence, as exemplified by remarkable achievements accomplished through honesty, hard work, self-reliance and perseverance over adversity."[26]
1988: Farley is inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame,[27] and is honored by the Boys & Girls Club of America as a Business/Community Honoree of the Year.
1997: Honored by the Ireland-U.S. Council for Commerce and Industry for outstanding achievement for his work in economics, business, and commercial activity. He also is named one of Irish-America magazine's top 100 businessmen,[15] and receives the White House's Presidential Award for Entrepreneurial Excellence.[28]
2008: Farley is honored with a Freedom Award from America's Freedom Festival at Provo.[29]

Personal life[edit]
Farley was a high school athlete at St. Raphael Academy in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and played three varsity sports (football, swimming, and baseball) at Bowdoin. He provided financial support to the athletic departments at St. Raphael and Bowdoin.
In the 1980s, Farley became a minority owner of the Chicago White Sox.[4]
Farley was an active member in the Young Presidents Organization; he is currently a member of the World Presidents Organization. He has also been a member of the Chicago Club and the University Associates of Northwestern University for years.[15]
Farley lives in Chicago with his wife, Shelley, a cabaret singer who has performed Michael Feinstein, George Burns, and President Bill Clinton.[30] Farley has three sons; the youngest, Liam, lives in Chicago with him. His two older sons, Hayes MacArthur and Scott, live in Los Angeles.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
