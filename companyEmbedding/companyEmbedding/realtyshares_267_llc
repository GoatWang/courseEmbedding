About RealtyShares
Founded by Nav Athwal, RealtyShares is a crowdfunding website for real estate developments that claims to help you diversify your portfolio and invest in pre-screened and professionally managed residential, commercial, retail, and mixed-use projects. Not only does RealtyShares claim to help you purchase shares in private real estate investments, but the company also claims to help companies access a new source of funding to raise capital for their investments.
How Does RealtyShares Claim To Work?
By now, you’re almost certainly familiar with crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, GoFundMe, and Booster.com, which help people raise money for their business ventures and personal needs. Using these websites, all you have to do is list your project, and if other people are interested in helping you out, they can contribute as much money as they’re comfortable with.
Recently though, a new era of crowdfunding has entered the market with websites like RealtyShares, which claims to serve two primary purposes: 1) to help accredited investors invest in a variety of real estate projects, and 2) help companies fund their real estate projects without having to go through traditional banks or other large lenders.
Since coming online in late 2013, RealtyShares has garnered quite a lot of media attention, having been featured on the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, CNN Money, Business Times, and more, due in no small part to their claimed focus on helping individuals invest in real estate projects from their living rooms, and giving them everything they need to invest intelligently.
In short, RealtyShares acts as a centralized area where companies who need funds for their private real estate projects can meet with investors who are willing to purchase shares in these projects. And according to the company, they give you the ability to make real estate investments in 5 simple steps:

Sign up for a RealtyShares account.
Browse investments securely. If you find one you’re interested in, you’ll then be able to access a detailed page explaining the offering, including “financials, property information, legal and financial documents and investment manager bios.”
Finalize your investment directly through the RealtyShares website. The company even claims all documents can be signed electronically using DocuSign and funds can be transferred via Balanced.
Next, each investment comes with a specific funding goal that must be met before you officially own a share. While you’re waiting for this to occur, your money will be held in an FDIC insured escrow account. And if this goal isn’t reached, then 100% of your money will be refunded.
All RealtyShares members have access to a personalized dashboard where you can monitor your investments and returns and manage your documents. You’ll also receive quarterly updates about the project via email, and tax documents are provided once per year.

You’ve worked diligently over the years to make smart investment decisions, and this new breed of real estate crowdfunding websites has piqued your interest, but you’re wondering if they’re ultimately worth your time, or are just a passing fad. After all, you invest carefully and aren’t in the habit of losing your hard-earned money.
But is RealtyShares a company that you can count on to help you make wise investment decisions? Consider the following:
You Have Options When it Comes to Real Estate Investing
First and foremost, if you’re thinking about using a real estate crowdfunding website, keep in mind that RealtyShares isn’t your only option, as other sites such as Fundrise, Realty Mogul, CrowdStreet, Collaperty, and many more are vying for your business.
With this said, according to RealtyShares’ CEO, the company differentiates itself from other real estate crowdfunding websites by offering lower fees, complete transparency, a seamless investment process, and access to a wider range of investment opportunities.
How Much Risk Are You Willing to Take On?
Next, like any other type of investment, real estate projects come with a certain level of risk, so you’re not guaranteed to make any money. In fact, in a worst-case scenario, you could end up losing your entire investment.
Also, remember that real estate investments are not liquid, which means that your money might be tied up for long periods of time. As such, you’ll need to thoroughly vet any investment you’re thinking about becoming involved with it.
RealtyShares’ Investor Guidelines
If you’re thinking about investing in a real estate project featured on RealtyShares, the most important thing you need to know is that you must be qualified as an Accredited Investor. According to the RealtyShares FAQ, this means you must be “a natural person with (1) a net worth or joint net worth with the person’s spouse exceeding $1 million, not including the value of the primary residence, and / or (2) annual income of $200,000 in each of the two most recent years, or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000 for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income in the current year.”
On top of this, you must have a minimum of $5,000 to contribute to a project, although some investments may go as low as $1,000. There is no maximum investment amount, and you can even qualify as a foreign investor.
RealtyShares’ Investment Options
If you qualify as an investor, you’ll have two options: Debt investment and equity investment.
Debt investment means that your contribution funds a loan for the company who’s responsible for the project, and depending on your level of investment, your portion of the money earned from monthly interest charges will be deposited into your account. On the other hand, an equity investment pays a percentage of cash flow from rent on a monthly basis, or on the profits if the project is sold.
Regardless of the type, each investment will come with its own ‘hold period,” which references the expected amount of time that will pass before investors recoup their money after a project has been paid off or sold. This information will be available on the project’s Investment Overview page, and can last anywhere from less than 6 months to more than 5 years.
RealtyShares’ Company Guidelines
According to the company’s website, RealtyShares only provides loans (e.g. debt investments) for 1-4 unit residential properties, and some commercial properties, such as apartment buildings. Specifically, the website’s FAQ states projects must be:

Cash-flowing/Value-Add equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments, retail, office and pools of single family homes;
Equity investments in Fix & Flips located in high demand/low supply markets;
Loans secured by residential and commercial real estate.

On top of this, borrowers must have a minimum 650 credit score, a loan to purchase price of less than 80%, and an “estimated loan to after repair value (once the property is rehabbed) less than 65%.” As such, the RealtyShares will not work for construction or ground-up development projects.
On top of this, RealtyShares claims to closely screen all new projects prior to being listed, including background and credit checks, comps, projected returns, geography, property type and quality, investment structure, a knowledgeable team, and a proven track record.
Although RealtyShares doesn’t guarantee successful funding, the company claims that most projects listed are funded within 5-7 days. However, for any projects listed on RealtyShares, companies will not be able to advertise them elsewhere in order to remain in compliance with Regulation D Rule 506(b).
Finally, RealtyShares’ funding methods are claimed to help you focus on operating the investment instead of communicating with numerous investors, since all funds are pooled into a single LLC.
The Difference Between RealtyShares & REITs
When compared to REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts), RealtyShares claims to give investors the ability to choose the specific type of property or groups of properties they’d like to invest in, whereas REITs traditionally only allow you to invest in specific asset classes or projects based on geography. In addition, RealtyShares claims to charge substantially lower fees than REITs (we’ll talk more about this in a moment).
What Are Other Investors Saying About RealtyShares?
RealtyShares, Inc. has only been in business since late 2013, and there were no individual reviews available online at the time of our research.
However, most professional reviews from large websites such as Forbes and TechCrunch seem to be favorable, not just for RealtyShares, but for the growth of the real estate crowdfunding industry in general.
RealtyShares Pricing
RealtyShares is free to sign up for an account, whether you’re an individual looking to invest or a company looking for funding. However, according to the company’s FAQ, they “will charge a fee to cover ongoing investor reporting and communications for the investment,” although the specific fee for each investment can vary, and will be outlined in the project’s operating agreement.
After a project has been funded, the money is pooled and moved into an individual LLC, which is the entity that will actually provide the loan or hold equity in the investment. As such, you will be a shareholder in this LLC.
Compared to many other real estate crowdfunding websites, RealtyShares accepts Bitcoin for investments, either through Coinbase or your Bitcoin Address, although distributions will be paid in US Dollars.
In order to ask questions about fees, payments, or anything else, you can contact RealtyShares’ customer service department at 866-202-2023.
Can RealtyShares Help You Wisely Diversify Your Investment Portfolio?
Chopping to the Point: Considering the fact that RealtyShares has received a fair amount of positive media attention, that the real estate crowdfunding industry is in a growth phase, and that there aren’t any negative online reviews for the company, they appear to be a solid choice for purchasing shares in real estate projects.

Very positive experience. I've always wanted to invest in real estate, but there haven't been many great options. I was able to invest in 10 different investments (with as little as $5,000) and get exposure to diverse markets and product types.
The user experience is simple, and everything is streamlined.


Bottom Line: Yes, I would recommend this to a friend

                                            Duping investors

I invested two years ago in few offerings and so far, everything is in deep red. "Triwest" who sponsored 12954 Blairwood Dr & 12090 Chalon Rd. investment and Paragon who sponsored 1651 Gilbert Road, have stopped making payments. They have given lame excuses for delays. 
They are running a Ponzi scheme to dupe investors and RealtyShares did not do any due diligence before offering this deal and luring investors. Don't get caught in this poor dealings.


Bottom Line: No, I would not recommend this to a friend

TriWest certainly has been a disaster. Fortunately, they managed to sell the property I had investments in and made some money, but nothing like their claimed return. Even though the property sold for more than the original financial estimate.
I agree that RealtyShares does minimal due diligence. What is shocking is you can't get access to the agreement with the sponsor, only the RealtyShares LLC., you are investing in, so the real terms and conditions aren't available.
They are also easy to dupe, they did an investment that claimed it would put no debt on the property and the sponsor secretly went to another website and got another big loan on the property while claiming it was unencumbered. RealtyShares has been almost completely unresponsive to emails about issues but they certainly keep sending out emails about new opportunities.
A strong buyer beware. Not only does RealityShares do little to no due diligence, but they make it impossible for you to do so either. Go ahead and ask if the sponsor has other projects at RealityShares and they won't answer.
I went back to making my own hard money loans so I have access to the property, the borrower and can track things closely.

It seems natural to approach with caution, since most people don't have much experience with this specific concept. My experience has been very positive. RealtyShares has been very professional and responsible. Any real estate project has risks by default, but I have had no issues after making more than 35 investments using the RealtyShares platform. RealtyShares does a great job screening prospective deal sponsors; because of that, projects that might include underfunded developers, crackpots, slackers or sponsors who are challenged with planning and organization get screened out before any deal is offered on the platform. The return/risk equation has seemed promising to me on the vast majority of the deals offered. I would - and have - recommended RealtyShares to good friends.


Bottom Line: Yes, I would recommend this to a friend

RealtySharesSign Up for RealtySharesBack to PlatformsSimilar Real Estate Crowdfunding PlatformsAcquirePatch of LandFundriseRealtyShares ReviewAverage Rating:  2 reviewsSummaryRealtyShares has some strong points including adequate capital, support from savvy backers, a user-friendly website and some good press. Investors also like its low minimums ($1,000 for your first deal, generally $5,000 thereafter) and hold periods as short as six months. It is also trying some innovative things such as accepting Bitcoin and providing market-specific products aimed at its core investor base among IT professionals in five cities.
But the platform’s investments are weighted toward single family home flips, a riskier niche in which projects tend to be put together by individuals and smaller operators. The site does have some funds and multi-family/commercial projects, but on the whole its deal flow is lower quality than some of the top names in the RE crowdfunding universe.
Investors who like the deals it offers will find RealtyShares a likeable and easy to navigate platform. But it is only accessible to accredited investors and it’s imperative that you fully grasp the risks involved.
BACKGROUND
Founded in Q2 2013 by CEO Nav Athwal, RealtyShares has received $11.9 million in three rounds of fundraising from five investors including $10 million in a Series A funding in April 2015. Its backers include well known venture capitalists Menlo Ventures, General Catalyst Partners and 500 Startups.
Menlo Ventures’ Managing Director John Jarve, who sits on the board of hot automated investing service Betterment, is on the RealtyShares board.
RealtyShares has been compared to a Lending Club for real estate, offering a new way for investors to put small amounts into real estate projects. It funds about 10 to 20 projects a month.
The inspiration for Athwal was to disrupt the slow and inefficient process by which developers borrowed money from banks to fund property development. Those loans usually take weeks or months to close – compared to as little as four days for crowdfunded deals on RealtyShares. After the financial crisis of 2007, traditional loans were difficult to impossible for many project sponsors to access.

PROS

Low minimum of $1,000 for first investment (otherwise usually $5,000), focus on deals with short lifecycles



CONS

Deal quality is not high, weighted to single family home flip market, only for accredited investors, high fees



BOTTOM LINE
RealtyShares is a smaller player in the real-estate crowdfunding arena. It has some differentiators that may help it make the cut including deals with short lifecycles and low minimum investments. But its deal flow includes many single family home flips, which are considered riskier and lower quality than typical projects on other platforms. Its fees are considered higher than average too.
PHILOSOPHY
RealtyShares’ founder Athwal says that RealtyShares is intended to fill a niche that banks have not adequately served, especially small real estate developers and house flippers. The process of borrowing money from banks is fraught for these operators as banks reined in their lending after the 2007 economic crisis. They often will not lend to individuals without W2 income.
Crowdfunding via an online platform is more streamlined and offers investors a chance to earn better returns. In one case covered by CNBC, Chicago house flipper Ben Walhood said he can get full funding from RealtyShares in as little as an hour. Investors in his deals would earn around 11% vs loans around 4% if backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in traditional financing.
RealtyShares is “able to provide quicker, more efficient capital that helps meet the needs of these investors who are looking for speed of execution and the ability to be flexible with their terms as well as with the underwriting standards. Banks just aren’t meeting that need,” Athwal said.
TYPICAL PROJECTS AND GEOGRAPHY
At the time of our test, there were five live deals on the site including a fund, two single family flips and two apartment buildings. Three were in California and the others in New York and Florida. RealtyShares has done transactions in 18 states and seems to have a strong representation in past deals from Florida, California, Illinois and Texas.
The deals we saw ranged in size from $160,000 to $1.6 million for the RealtyShares portion and were a mix of debt and equity transactions. Minimum investment ranged from $2,000 to $25,000 and hold terms from eight months to five years.
RealtyShares says it welcomes cash-flowing/value add equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments, retail, office and pools of single family homes; equity investment in fix and flips in high demand/low supply markets and loans secured by residential and commercial real estate.
TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC
RealtyShares is only open to accredited investors, meaning those with net worth of $1 million or income of $200,000 a year. The platform says it is aimed at investors interested in sub institutional projects in the $2 million to $30 million range and all types of cash-flowing residential and commercial projects.
RealtyShares says that its investors prefer hold periods ranging from six months to two years.
Many of its users are technology professionals who are natural early adopters of the online crowdfunding model. RealtyShares said in 2014 that 10 to 15% of its investors are abroad but its website currently states that foreign investors cannot participate.
INTEREST IN INNOVATION
Athwal says most investors who have joined the platform so far have been technology professionals looking for new investment opportunities. Unique among real estate crowdfunding platforms, the company has identified five markets with rising tech and real estate sectors where it sees attractive opportunities. It is creating market-specific products to enable developers in Seattle, Dallas, Austin, Miami and Chicago to raise funding from local investors.
RealtyShares’ interest in innovation led it in 2014 to become the first crowdfunding platform to accept the digital currency bitcoin as a form of payment. The platform says this is a more cost-effective and streamlined way for investors to send money, especially if they are abroad, because it involves lower transaction fees and faster transfers.
WEBSITE POPULARITY
As of June 2015, RealtyShares has an estimated 90,000 monthly unique visitors via desktop who spend an average of about 4 minute on the site with 4.04 page views.  About 92% of the traffic is from the United States. As of mid-May 2015, RealtyShares ranked sixth among real estate crowdfunding sites in the United States.
LEADERSHIP TEAM
RealtyShares’ founder Athwal trained as an electrical engineer and lawyer. He worked as a developer and broker for his own real estate company and then as a real estate and land use attorney representing California and national developers and REITs in the San Francisco Bay area. He doesn’t have the star power of some other crowdfunding entrepreneurs but his credentials are solid.
The management team is rounded out by eight specialists with hands-on experience in operations, transactions, engineering and other disciplines. Again, they have strong resumes but not high name recognition. RealtyShares’ leadership earned a B grade in one review.
WHAT DO THE EXPERTS THINK?
RealtyShares has received funding from some investors with track records for betting on successful ventures such as 500 Startups, so that represents a vote of confidence in the platform. But it has gotten fewer accolades than some other sites, and media coverage has tended to focus on its potential for financing single family home flip projects or more novel features such as acceptance of bitcoin.
Blogger Mark Robertson wrote about his experience with five investments on RealtyShares. While he describes several of the projects as having some unanticipated occurrences such as higher than budgeted taxes or permitting delays, he said they have met or beat expectations.
SUMMARY
RealtyShares looks like a solid platform with long-term potential. While its low minimum investments are attractive, it loses points for its lower quality deal flow and higher than average fees. It is open exclusively to accredited investors and focuses on shorter hold deals, especially fix and flip single family home projects. It’s not a good starting point for novices and may not even be a good first choice for more seasoned investors.
DEAL STRUCTURE
Investors can access both debt investments in the form of first or second-position loans usually yielding a fixed interest rate of 8-12% annually as well as equity investments in residential and commercial properties offering cash flows during the hold period and/or a portion of the profits upon a sale of the property.
HOW DOES REALTYSHARES SCREEN INVESTMENTS?
RealtyShares reviews the sponsors first, looking for companies with experience. It says it runs background and credit checks. Then it reviews proposed transactions including financials, geography, property type and quality, and investment structure.
“While each investment includes risk and RealtyShares cannot guarantee results, our vetting process seeks to ensure that only quality investment properties are listed on the platform,” it says. “Once an investment opportunity is listed on the platform, investors have full discretion as to whether to personally invest in the opportunity, and if so, how much.”
So, like other crowdfunded real estate sites, it’s up to you to do your due diligence.
UNDERWRITING/DEAL FLOW
CEO Athwal said that as of spring 2015 RealtyShares had no defaults or major issues with any of its projects and only lists about 1 in 10 properties that are offered to it.  “I think that really goes to our underwriting criteria and the strictness with which we adhere to when we are looking at a property,” he said.
However, the site more than other real estate crowdfunding platforms focuses on single family home flips. These are often sponsored by solo or smaller operators, and experts consider them generally to be riskier and lower-quality deals than bigger budget projects.
FEES
RealtyShares says it charges a fee when you invest in a specific offering to cover investor reporting and communications. But the site is quite opaque on the details and directs you to the deal operating agreement. The ones we viewed were 40-plus page legal agreements similar to a prospectus that are not for the novice to decipher.
As best we could tell, the ongoing fees to RealtyShares as manager of the transaction LLC amounted to 1% a year. RealtyShares could do a whole lot better explaining the costs and ongoing fees in its deals.
This article says RealtyShares takes an administrative fee on funds raised through the website of 2 percent to 3 percent. It also takes the annual fee in order to service the investment (including providing investors with tax documents and distributions) through the platform. A RealtyShares presentation for a funding round in February 2014 showed it earning fees of 3-5%.
That is comparatively high among RE crowdfunding platforms and reduces the earning potential of your investment.
EASE OF USE
RealtyShares has a more involved sign-up process than other platforms we have test driven. While some sites initially ask only for an email address and password, RealtyShares seeks your phone number, address, employer, amount you want to invest and type of deal that interests you.
If you are just wanting to explore the site without making a commitment, that might make you leery. But it also suggests RealtyShares wants to offer an experience tailored to your interests, so it could be a plus for some. It offers a chance to check boxes signaling interest in such things as residential flips with 11-14% return, 6-9 month hold, unsecured to cash flow retail and long hold apartment deals.
After signing up, you see a countdown clock on the 30-day cooling off period. You are also directed to a helpful eight-minute webinar introducing the site and how to navigate it. We liked this feature a lot.
LISTINGS
The page for individual offerings is nicely laid out and easy to follow. There’s a deal dashboard, and tabs allow you to view an overview, financials, documents, photos, background on management and FAQs. One closed deal we looked at had an audio recording of a webinar the sponsor gave discussing the project, which provided a wealth of information.
WHAT AM I BUYING ON REALTYSHARES?
RealtyShares explains what you are actually buying this way: RealtyShares sets up a separate Limited Liability Company (LLC), for each investment opportunity that is listed on the platform.  That LLC in turn will make a loan on a real estate property (in the case of a debt investment) or hold equity in an LLC or LP that in turn owns real estate property (in the case of an equity investment).  When you invest through RealtyShares, you own shares in that LLC.  Using this structure, you will have the benefit of limited financial exposure while also avoiding taxes at the entity level.
If you invest in a debt deal, the fund you invest in will be secured by a residential or commercial property and will receive monthly interest payments.  A share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account.  If you invest in an equity investment opportunity (usually in a residential or commercial property or group of properties), the fund you invest in will receive periodic payments of cash flow from rents and/or a share of the proceeds when the property is eventually sold. As with debt investments, a share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account.
HOW SAFE IS MY MONEY?
As we’ve said before, real estate crowdfunding is not for investing novices, and that holds even truer for RealtyShares. Experts point out the niche is in its infancy and there has not yet been a chance to watch a complete life cycle of many deals. Real estate by its nature can be a risky investment, and RealtyShares is weighted toward single family home flips which have more inherent risks than other types of deals.
While offering documents list risk factors ad nauseum, RealtyShares could do a much better job of making its site transparent. It says it is currently affiliated with WealthForge, a registered broker-dealer with FINRA and member of SIPC (both of which are securities industry bodies aimed at protecting investors), and that WealthForge provides compliance and regulatory oversight to RealtyShares.
But it’s unclear if SIPC protections apply to RealtyShares investments. Even if they do, they do not protect against loss in value, liquidity issues or financial problems with sponsors. They would only protect the custody function of the broker dealer.
In truth, it is up to you to research carefully and understand fully the risks of any deal you enter, and that is a big reason why only accredited investors are allowed to participate.

There are various pluses and minuses with the service, but RealtyShares would work better if it didn’t have the requirement for accredited investors. Crowdfunding generally democratizes investing, making it available to even the smallest investors. The accredited investor requirement limits the platform to use by high income and high net worth individuals. We’ll give RealtyShares a rating of 4.0 out of 5.0 stars, with the accredited investor requirement being the biggest negative.


Crowdfunding Website Reviews

We have singled out RealtyShares for the purpose of our first Real Estate Crowdfunding Site review due to a few recent stories that caught our eye. Not the least of which is their forward-thinking leadership giving potential investors the ability to invest using BitCoin. We love the idea of taking a “virtual currency” and turning it in to the most tangible of investments. This move has the potential of bringing a new crowd to real estate investing, the Tech Crowd.

Why Crowdfunding Is a Potential Boon for Real Estate Investors


Written By: Mark Spera




























Crowdfunding platforms typically offer a range of investment opportunities. At RealtyShares, investors have the ability to choose between debt and equity investments involving both residential and commercial property types. That’s an important benefit for investors who want to diversify their portfolio by adding in real estate holdings but may be concerned about spreading out risk. 
Because real estate crowdfunding platforms require much lower minimum investments than traditional private real estate deals, it’s possible for investors to pick and choose where they want to put their money. Instead of sinking $50,000 into a single property, investors can break the money up into 5 or 10 different investments. If one underperforms, it’s less likely to drag down their entire portfolio. 



Founder and CEO, Athwal says that investments on the platform have paid back over $15 million in capital so far. Q3'15 saw $30 million of investment activity on the platform. We're not allowed to share specific returns because of SEC regulations, but there are some homes and commercial properties. You can investigate further by signing up here.

RealtyShares offers investors 15 million reasons to consider real estate crowdfunding.


Investing in real estate is no longer an exclusive club







Like rewards-based or loan crowdfunding, real estate crowdfunding operates based on the premise of pooled funds. Multiple investors can hold equity stakes in a particular property or invest in the property’s mortgage note, with each of them sharing in the investment returns. This reflects the types of investment options available through platforms like RealtyShares. 
Though still in its infancy, real estate crowdfunding has had a significant impact on real estate as a whole. From an investor perspective, this alternative path offers a number of potential advantages over the traditional real estate investing model. 
Investing in real estate can be a rewarding venture but traditionally, access to private deals has been limited to a select few. Specifically, investing in high-level properties meant having the right connections and a large-enough bankroll to get in on the ground floor. Fortunately, the crowdfunding industry has eliminated some of the barriers that once prevented certain investors from gaining entry to the real estate market.Instead of needing $50,000 or $100,000 to participate in a private real estate investment, it’s now possible to start at a lower price point. With RealtyShares, for example, accredited investors can gain access to deals with as little as $5,000. The fact that it costs nothing to sign up for an account and browse available deals only adds to the appeal.
