Corning Incorporated is an American manufacturer of glass, ceramics, and related materials, primarily for industrial and scientific applications. The company was known as Corning Glass Works until 1989, when it changed its name to Corning Incorporated.[2] In 1998, Corning divested itself of its consumer lines of CorningWare and Corelle tableware and Pyrex and Visions cookware by selling the Corning Consumer Products division (now known as World Kitchen) to Borden, but still holds an interest of about 8%. As of 2014[update], Corning had five major business sectors: Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences, Optical Communications, and Specialty Materials. Corning is involved in two joint ventures: Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning. Quest Diagnostics and Covance were spun off from Corning in 1996.[3] Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc. since working with Steve Jobs in 2007 to develop the iPhone.[4]

History[edit]




One of the first optic headlamp lenses, the Corning Conaphore. Selective yellow "Noviol" glass version shown.


Corning Glass Works was founded in 1851 by Amory Houghton, in Somerville, Massachusetts, originally as the Bay State Glass Co. It later moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works. The company moved again to its ultimate home and namesake, the city of Corning, New York, in 1868 under leadership of the founder's son, Amory Houghton, Jr.
Over 147 years later, Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning, N.Y. The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in 1908. It continues to expand the nearby research and development facility, as well as operations associated with catalytic converters and diesel engine filter product lines. Corning has a long history of community development and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown.[5]
The California Institute of Technology's 200-inch (5.1 m) telescope mirror at Palomar Observatory was cast by Corning during 1934–1936 out of low expansion borosilicate glass.[6] In 1932, George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project. A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed. Corning's first attempt was a failure, the cast blank having voids. Using lessons learned, Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank. After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, in 1935 the blank was completed. The first blank now resides in Corning's Museum of Glass.
In 1935, Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker Owens-Illinois, which formed the company known today as Owens Corning. Owens Corning was spun off as a separate company in 1938.




1917 advertisement for the Corning Conaphore headlamp lens shown above.


The company had a history of science-based innovations following World War II and the strategy by management was research and "disruptive" and "on demand" product innovation.[7]
In 1962 Corning developed Chemcor, a new toughened automobile windshield designed to be thinner and lighter than existing windshields, which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed.[8] This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer, and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a "fusion process" in special furnaces that Corning built in its Blacksburg, Virginia facility.[7][9] Corning developed it as an alternative to laminated windshields with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier.[7] After being installed as side glass in a limited run of 1968 Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts, Chemcor windshields debuted on the 1970 model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation (AMC).[9] As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields, the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products.[7][9] Corning terminated its windshield project in 1971, after it turned out to be one of the company's "biggest and most expensive failures."[9] However, like many Corning innovations, the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business.
In the fall of 1970, the company announced that researchers Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an optical fiber with a low optical attenuation of 17 dB per kilometer by doping silica glass with titanium. [10] A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4 dB/km, using germanium oxide as the core dopant. Such low attenuations made fiber optics practical for telecommunications and networking. Corning became the world's leading manufacturer of optical fiber.
In 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning's Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business.[11]
Company profits soared in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly with several new plants. The company also entered the photonics market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems. Failure to succeed in photonics and the collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, as of 2007[update] the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance.

The turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a screen solution for its upcoming phone model, the iPhone. Eventually, all the major Android vendors also adopted its Gorilla glass screen.[citation needed] In 2011 Corning announced the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of a Gen 10 facility co-located with the Sharp Corporation manufacturing complex in Sakai, Osaka, Japan.[12] The LCD glass substrate is produced without heavy metals. Corning is a leading manufacturer of the glass used in liquid crystal displays[citation needed].
The company continues to produce optical fiber and cable for the communications industry at its Wilmington and Concord plants in North Carolina. It is also a major manufacturer of ceramic emission control devices for catalytic converters in cars and light trucks that use gasoline engines. The company is also investing in the production of ceramic emission control products for diesel engines as a result of tighter emission standards for those engines both in the U.S. and abroad.
In 2007 Corning introduced an optic fiber, ClearCurve, which uses nanostructure technology to facilitate the small radius bending found in FTTX installations.




Corning's Gorilla Glass is used on the Nokia N8's screen


Gorilla Glass, an outgrowth of the 1960s Chemcor project, is a high-strength alkali-aluminosilicate thin sheet glass used as a protective cover glass offering scratch resistance and durability in many handheld devices with touchscreens, went on sale in 2008.[13] According to the book "Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson, Gorilla Glass was used in the first iPhone released in 2007.[14]
On October 25, 2011 Corning unveiled Lotus Glass, an environmentally friendly and high-performance glass developed for OLED and LCD displays.[15][16]
Corning invests about 10% of revenue in research and development, and has allocated US$300 million towards further expansion of its Sullivan Park research facility near headquarters in Corning, New York.[17]
Corning Incorporated also manufactures a high-purity fused silica employed in microlithography systems, a low expansion glass utilized in the construction of reflective mirror blanks, windows for U.S. space shuttles, and Steuben art glass. The number of Corning facilities still employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years, but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or finished glass of many types.
Corning is engaged in research and development on green lasers, mercury abatement, microreactors, photovoltaics, and silicon on glass. Through its Life Sciences division, the company offers products to support life science research, including stem-cell culture products.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Corning employs roughly 34,000 people worldwide and had sales of $10.217 billion in 2014.[1] The company has been listed for many years among Fortune magazine's 500 largest companies, and was ranked #297 in 2015.
Although the company has long been publicly owned, James R. Houghton, great-great-grandson of the founder, served as chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007. Over the years Houghton family ownership has declined to about 2%. Wendell P. Weeks has been with the company since 1983 and as of March 2013[update] was chairman, chief executive officer, and president.[19]
Over its 160-year history Corning invented a process for rapid and inexpensive production of light bulbs, including developing the glass for Thomas Edison's light bulb. Corning was the glass supplier for lightbulbs for General Electric after Edison General Electric merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1892.[20] It was an early major manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for television tubes, invented and produced Vycor (high temperature glass with high thermal shock resistance). Corning invented and produced Pyrex, CorningWare Pyroceram glass-ceramic cookware, and Corelle durable glass dinnerware. Corning manufactured the windows for US manned space vehicles, and supplied the glass blank for the primary mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope. Corning won the National Medal of Technology four times for its product and process innovations[21] [22] [23] .[24]
In July 2008 Corning announced the sale of Steuben Glass Works to Steuben Glass LLC, an affiliate of the private equity firm Schottenstein Stores Corporation. Steuben Glass had been unprofitable for more than a decade, losing 30 million dollars over the previous five years.[25]
In February 2011, Corning acquired MobileAccess Networks, an Israeli company that develops Distributed antenna systems, which are often used by universities, stadiums and airports to ensure seamless wireless coverage throughout a facility. MobileAccess Networks became part of Corning’s telecommunications business unit.[26]

The company had a history of science-based innovations following World War II and the strategy by management was research and "disruptive" and "on demand" product innovation.[7]
In 1962 Corning developed Chemcor, a new toughened automobile windshield designed to be thinner and lighter than existing windshields, which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed.[8] This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer, and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a "fusion process" in special furnaces that Corning built in its Blacksburg, Virginia facility.[7][9] Corning developed it as an alternative to laminated windshields with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier.[7] After being installed as side glass in a limited run of 1968 Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts, Chemcor windshields debuted on the 1970 model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation (AMC).[9] As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields, the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products.[7][9] Corning terminated its windshield project in 1971, after it turned out to be one of the company's "biggest and most expensive failures."[9] However, like many Corning innovations, the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business.
In the fall of 1970, the company announced that researchers Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an optical fiber with a low optical attenuation of 17 dB per kilometer by doping silica glass with titanium. [10] A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4 dB/km, using germanium oxide as the core dopant. Such low attenuations made fiber optics practical for telecommunications and networking. Corning became the world's leading manufacturer of optical fiber.
In 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning's Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business.[11]
Company profits soared in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly with several new plants. The company also entered the photonics market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems. Failure to succeed in photonics and the collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, as of 2007[update] the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance.

The turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a screen solution for its upcoming phone model, the iPhone. Eventually, all the major Android vendors also adopted its Gorilla glass screen.[citation needed] In 2011 Corning announced the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of a Gen 10 facility co-located with the Sharp Corporation manufacturing complex in Sakai, Osaka, Japan.[12] The LCD glass substrate is produced without heavy metals. Corning is a leading manufacturer of the glass used in liquid crystal displays[citation needed].
The company continues to produce optical fiber and cable for the communications industry at its Wilmington and Concord plants in North Carolina. It is also a major manufacturer of ceramic emission control devices for catalytic converters in cars and light trucks that use gasoline engines. The company is also investing in the production of ceramic emission control products for diesel engines as a result of tighter emission standards for those engines both in the U.S. and abroad.
In 2007 Corning introduced an optic fiber, ClearCurve, which uses nanostructure technology to facilitate the small radius bending found in FTTX installations.




Corning's Gorilla Glass is used on the Nokia N8's screen


Gorilla Glass, an outgrowth of the 1960s Chemcor project, is a high-strength alkali-aluminosilicate thin sheet glass used as a protective cover glass offering scratch resistance and durability in many handheld devices with touchscreens, went on sale in 2008.[13] According to the book "Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson, Gorilla Glass was used in the first iPhone released in 2007.[14]
On October 25, 2011 Corning unveiled Lotus Glass, an environmentally friendly and high-performance glass developed for OLED and LCD displays.[15][16]
Corning invests about 10% of revenue in research and development, and has allocated US$300 million towards further expansion of its Sullivan Park research facility near headquarters in Corning, New York.[17]
Corning Incorporated also manufactures a high-purity fused silica employed in microlithography systems, a low expansion glass utilized in the construction of reflective mirror blanks, windows for U.S. space shuttles, and Steuben art glass. The number of Corning facilities still employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years, but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or finished glass of many types.
Corning is engaged in research and development on green lasers, mercury abatement, microreactors, photovoltaics, and silicon on glass. Through its Life Sciences division, the company offers products to support life science research, including stem-cell culture products.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Corning employs roughly 34,000 people worldwide and had sales of $10.217 billion in 2014.[1] The company has been listed for many years among Fortune magazine's 500 largest companies, and was ranked #297 in 2015.
Although the company has long been publicly owned, James R. Houghton, great-great-grandson of the founder, served as chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007. Over the years Houghton family ownership has declined to about 2%. Wendell P. Weeks has been with the company since 1983 and as of March 2013[update] was chairman, chief executive officer, and president.[19]
Over its 160-year history Corning invented a process for rapid and inexpensive production of light bulbs, including developing the glass for Thomas Edison's light bulb. Corning was the glass supplier for lightbulbs for General Electric after Edison General Electric merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1892.[20] It was an early major manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for television tubes, invented and produced Vycor (high temperature glass with high thermal shock resistance). Corning invented and produced Pyrex, CorningWare Pyroceram glass-ceramic cookware, and Corelle durable glass dinnerware. Corning manufactured the windows for US manned space vehicles, and supplied the glass blank for the primary mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope. Corning won the National Medal of Technology four times for its product and process innovations[21] [22] [23] .[24]
In July 2008 Corning announced the sale of Steuben Glass Works to Steuben Glass LLC, an affiliate of the private equity firm Schottenstein Stores Corporation. Steuben Glass had been unprofitable for more than a decade, losing 30 million dollars over the previous five years.[25]
In February 2011, Corning acquired MobileAccess Networks, an Israeli company that develops Distributed antenna systems, which are often used by universities, stadiums and airports to ensure seamless wireless coverage throughout a facility. MobileAccess Networks became part of Corning’s telecommunications business unit.[26]

Corning Incorporated is an American manufacturer of glass, ceramics, and related materials, primarily for industrial and scientific applications. The company was known as Corning Glass Works until 1989, when it changed its name to Corning Incorporated.[2] In 1998, Corning divested itself of its consumer lines of CorningWare and Corelle tableware and Pyrex and Visions cookware by selling the Corning Consumer Products division (now known as World Kitchen) to Borden, but still holds an interest of about 8%. As of 2014[update], Corning had five major business sectors: Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences, Optical Communications, and Specialty Materials. Corning is involved in two joint ventures: Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning. Quest Diagnostics and Covance were spun off from Corning in 1996.[3] Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc. since working with Steve Jobs in 2007 to develop the iPhone.[4]

History[edit]




One of the first optic headlamp lenses, the Corning Conaphore. Selective yellow "Noviol" glass version shown.


Corning Glass Works was founded in 1851 by Amory Houghton, in Somerville, Massachusetts, originally as the Bay State Glass Co. It later moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works. The company moved again to its ultimate home and namesake, the city of Corning, New York, in 1868 under leadership of the founder's son, Amory Houghton, Jr.
Over 147 years later, Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning, N.Y. The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in 1908. It continues to expand the nearby research and development facility, as well as operations associated with catalytic converters and diesel engine filter product lines. Corning has a long history of community development and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown.[5]
The California Institute of Technology's 200-inch (5.1 m) telescope mirror at Palomar Observatory was cast by Corning during 1934–1936 out of low expansion borosilicate glass.[6] In 1932, George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project. A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed. Corning's first attempt was a failure, the cast blank having voids. Using lessons learned, Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank. After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, in 1935 the blank was completed. The first blank now resides in Corning's Museum of Glass.
In 1935, Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker Owens-Illinois, which formed the company known today as Owens Corning. Owens Corning was spun off as a separate company in 1938.

Corning Incorporated is an American manufacturer of glass, ceramics, and related materials, primarily for industrial and scientific applications. The company was known as Corning Glass Works until 1989, when it changed its name to Corning Incorporated.[2] In 1998, Corning divested itself of its consumer lines of CorningWare and Corelle tableware and Pyrex and Visions cookware by selling the Corning Consumer Products division (now known as World Kitchen) to Borden, but still holds an interest of about 8%. As of 2014[update], Corning had five major business sectors: Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences, Optical Communications, and Specialty Materials. Corning is involved in two joint ventures: Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning. Quest Diagnostics and Covance were spun off from Corning in 1996.[3] Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc. since working with Steve Jobs in 2007 to develop the iPhone.[4]

History[edit]




One of the first optic headlamp lenses, the Corning Conaphore. Selective yellow "Noviol" glass version shown.


Corning Glass Works was founded in 1851 by Amory Houghton, in Somerville, Massachusetts, originally as the Bay State Glass Co. It later moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works. The company moved again to its ultimate home and namesake, the city of Corning, New York, in 1868 under leadership of the founder's son, Amory Houghton, Jr.
Over 147 years later, Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning, N.Y. The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in 1908. It continues to expand the nearby research and development facility, as well as operations associated with catalytic converters and diesel engine filter product lines. Corning has a long history of community development and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown.[5]
The California Institute of Technology's 200-inch (5.1 m) telescope mirror at Palomar Observatory was cast by Corning during 1934–1936 out of low expansion borosilicate glass.[6] In 1932, George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project. A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed. Corning's first attempt was a failure, the cast blank having voids. Using lessons learned, Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank. After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, in 1935 the blank was completed. The first blank now resides in Corning's Museum of Glass.
In 1935, Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker Owens-Illinois, which formed the company known today as Owens Corning. Owens Corning was spun off as a separate company in 1938.




1917 advertisement for the Corning Conaphore headlamp lens shown above.


The company had a history of science-based innovations following World War II and the strategy by management was research and "disruptive" and "on demand" product innovation.[7]
In 1962 Corning developed Chemcor, a new toughened automobile windshield designed to be thinner and lighter than existing windshields, which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed.[8] This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer, and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a "fusion process" in special furnaces that Corning built in its Blacksburg, Virginia facility.[7][9] Corning developed it as an alternative to laminated windshields with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier.[7] After being installed as side glass in a limited run of 1968 Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts, Chemcor windshields debuted on the 1970 model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation (AMC).[9] As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields, the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products.[7][9] Corning terminated its windshield project in 1971, after it turned out to be one of the company's "biggest and most expensive failures."[9] However, like many Corning innovations, the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business.
In the fall of 1970, the company announced that researchers Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an optical fiber with a low optical attenuation of 17 dB per kilometer by doping silica glass with titanium. [10] A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4 dB/km, using germanium oxide as the core dopant. Such low attenuations made fiber optics practical for telecommunications and networking. Corning became the world's leading manufacturer of optical fiber.
In 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning's Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business.[11]
Company profits soared in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly with several new plants. The company also entered the photonics market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems. Failure to succeed in photonics and the collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, as of 2007[update] the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance.
Current technologies[edit]

The turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a screen solution for its upcoming phone model, the iPhone. Eventually, all the major Android vendors also adopted its Gorilla glass screen.[citation needed] In 2011 Corning announced the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of a Gen 10 facility co-located with the Sharp Corporation manufacturing complex in Sakai, Osaka, Japan.[12] The LCD glass substrate is produced without heavy metals. Corning is a leading manufacturer of the glass used in liquid crystal displays[citation needed].
The company continues to produce optical fiber and cable for the communications industry at its Wilmington and Concord plants in North Carolina. It is also a major manufacturer of ceramic emission control devices for catalytic converters in cars and light trucks that use gasoline engines. The company is also investing in the production of ceramic emission control products for diesel engines as a result of tighter emission standards for those engines both in the U.S. and abroad.
In 2007 Corning introduced an optic fiber, ClearCurve, which uses nanostructure technology to facilitate the small radius bending found in FTTX installations.




Corning's Gorilla Glass is used on the Nokia N8's screen


Gorilla Glass, an outgrowth of the 1960s Chemcor project, is a high-strength alkali-aluminosilicate thin sheet glass used as a protective cover glass offering scratch resistance and durability in many handheld devices with touchscreens, went on sale in 2008.[13] According to the book "Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson, Gorilla Glass was used in the first iPhone released in 2007.[14]
On October 25, 2011 Corning unveiled Lotus Glass, an environmentally friendly and high-performance glass developed for OLED and LCD displays.[15][16]
Corning invests about 10% of revenue in research and development, and has allocated US$300 million towards further expansion of its Sullivan Park research facility near headquarters in Corning, New York.[17]
Corning Incorporated also manufactures a high-purity fused silica employed in microlithography systems, a low expansion glass utilized in the construction of reflective mirror blanks, windows for U.S. space shuttles, and Steuben art glass. The number of Corning facilities still employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years, but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or finished glass of many types.
Corning is engaged in research and development on green lasers, mercury abatement, microreactors, photovoltaics, and silicon on glass. Through its Life Sciences division, the company offers products to support life science research, including stem-cell culture products.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Corning employs roughly 34,000 people worldwide and had sales of $10.217 billion in 2014.[1] The company has been listed for many years among Fortune magazine's 500 largest companies, and was ranked #297 in 2015.
Although the company has long been publicly owned, James R. Houghton, great-great-grandson of the founder, served as chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007. Over the years Houghton family ownership has declined to about 2%. Wendell P. Weeks has been with the company since 1983 and as of March 2013[update] was chairman, chief executive officer, and president.[19]
Over its 160-year history Corning invented a process for rapid and inexpensive production of light bulbs, including developing the glass for Thomas Edison's light bulb. Corning was the glass supplier for lightbulbs for General Electric after Edison General Electric merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1892.[20] It was an early major manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for television tubes, invented and produced Vycor (high temperature glass with high thermal shock resistance). Corning invented and produced Pyrex, CorningWare Pyroceram glass-ceramic cookware, and Corelle durable glass dinnerware. Corning manufactured the windows for US manned space vehicles, and supplied the glass blank for the primary mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope. Corning won the National Medal of Technology four times for its product and process innovations[21] [22] [23] .[24]
In July 2008 Corning announced the sale of Steuben Glass Works to Steuben Glass LLC, an affiliate of the private equity firm Schottenstein Stores Corporation. Steuben Glass had been unprofitable for more than a decade, losing 30 million dollars over the previous five years.[25]
In February 2011, Corning acquired MobileAccess Networks, an Israeli company that develops Distributed antenna systems, which are often used by universities, stadiums and airports to ensure seamless wireless coverage throughout a facility. MobileAccess Networks became part of Corning’s telecommunications business unit.[26]

Corning Incorporated is an American manufacturer of glass, ceramics, and related materials, primarily for industrial and scientific applications. The company was known as Corning Glass Works until 1989, when it changed its name to Corning Incorporated.[2] In 1998, Corning divested itself of its consumer lines of CorningWare and Corelle tableware and Pyrex and Visions cookware by selling the Corning Consumer Products division (now known as World Kitchen) to Borden, but still holds an interest of about 8%. As of 2014[update], Corning had five major business sectors: Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences, Optical Communications, and Specialty Materials. Corning is involved in two joint ventures: Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning. Quest Diagnostics and Covance were spun off from Corning in 1996.[3] Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc. since working with Steve Jobs in 2007 to develop the iPhone.[4]

History[edit]




One of the first optic headlamp lenses, the Corning Conaphore. Selective yellow "Noviol" glass version shown.


Corning Glass Works was founded in 1851 by Amory Houghton, in Somerville, Massachusetts, originally as the Bay State Glass Co. It later moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works. The company moved again to its ultimate home and namesake, the city of Corning, New York, in 1868 under leadership of the founder's son, Amory Houghton, Jr.
Over 147 years later, Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning, N.Y. The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in 1908. It continues to expand the nearby research and development facility, as well as operations associated with catalytic converters and diesel engine filter product lines. Corning has a long history of community development and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown.[5]
The California Institute of Technology's 200-inch (5.1 m) telescope mirror at Palomar Observatory was cast by Corning during 1934–1936 out of low expansion borosilicate glass.[6] In 1932, George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project. A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed. Corning's first attempt was a failure, the cast blank having voids. Using lessons learned, Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank. After a year of cooling, during which it was almost lost to a flood, in 1935 the blank was completed. The first blank now resides in Corning's Museum of Glass.
In 1935, Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker Owens-Illinois, which formed the company known today as Owens Corning. Owens Corning was spun off as a separate company in 1938.




1917 advertisement for the Corning Conaphore headlamp lens shown above.


The company had a history of science-based innovations following World War II and the strategy by management was research and "disruptive" and "on demand" product innovation.[7]
In 1962 Corning developed Chemcor, a new toughened automobile windshield designed to be thinner and lighter than existing windshields, which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed.[8] This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer, and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a "fusion process" in special furnaces that Corning built in its Blacksburg, Virginia facility.[7][9] Corning developed it as an alternative to laminated windshields with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier.[7] After being installed as side glass in a limited run of 1968 Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts, Chemcor windshields debuted on the 1970 model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation (AMC).[9] As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields, the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products.[7][9] Corning terminated its windshield project in 1971, after it turned out to be one of the company's "biggest and most expensive failures."[9] However, like many Corning innovations, the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business.
In the fall of 1970, the company announced that researchers Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an optical fiber with a low optical attenuation of 17 dB per kilometer by doping silica glass with titanium. [10] A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4 dB/km, using germanium oxide as the core dopant. Such low attenuations made fiber optics practical for telecommunications and networking. Corning became the world's leading manufacturer of optical fiber.
In 1977, considerable attention was given to Corning's Z Glass project. Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes. Due to a number of factors, the exact nature of which are subject to dispute, this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity. The following year the project made a partial recovery. This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business.[11]
Company profits soared in the late 1990s during the dot-com boom, and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly with several new plants. The company also entered the photonics market, investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber-optic systems. Failure to succeed in photonics and the collapse in 2000 of the dot-com market had a major impact on the company, and Corning stock plummeted to $1 per share. However, as of 2007[update] the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance.
Current technologies[edit]

The turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a screen solution for its upcoming phone model, the iPhone. Eventually, all the major Android vendors also adopted its Gorilla glass screen.[citation needed] In 2011 Corning announced the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of a Gen 10 facility co-located with the Sharp Corporation manufacturing complex in Sakai, Osaka, Japan.[12] The LCD glass substrate is produced without heavy metals. Corning is a leading manufacturer of the glass used in liquid crystal displays[citation needed].
The company continues to produce optical fiber and cable for the communications industry at its Wilmington and Concord plants in North Carolina. It is also a major manufacturer of ceramic emission control devices for catalytic converters in cars and light trucks that use gasoline engines. The company is also investing in the production of ceramic emission control products for diesel engines as a result of tighter emission standards for those engines both in the U.S. and abroad.
In 2007 Corning introduced an optic fiber, ClearCurve, which uses nanostructure technology to facilitate the small radius bending found in FTTX installations.




Corning's Gorilla Glass is used on the Nokia N8's screen


Gorilla Glass, an outgrowth of the 1960s Chemcor project, is a high-strength alkali-aluminosilicate thin sheet glass used as a protective cover glass offering scratch resistance and durability in many handheld devices with touchscreens, went on sale in 2008.[13] According to the book "Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson, Gorilla Glass was used in the first iPhone released in 2007.[14]
On October 25, 2011 Corning unveiled Lotus Glass, an environmentally friendly and high-performance glass developed for OLED and LCD displays.[15][16]
Corning invests about 10% of revenue in research and development, and has allocated US$300 million towards further expansion of its Sullivan Park research facility near headquarters in Corning, New York.[17]
Corning Incorporated also manufactures a high-purity fused silica employed in microlithography systems, a low expansion glass utilized in the construction of reflective mirror blanks, windows for U.S. space shuttles, and Steuben art glass. The number of Corning facilities still employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years, but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or finished glass of many types.
Corning is engaged in research and development on green lasers, mercury abatement, microreactors, photovoltaics, and silicon on glass. Through its Life Sciences division, the company offers products to support life science research, including stem-cell culture products.[18]
Other activities[edit]
Corning employs roughly 34,000 people worldwide and had sales of $10.217 billion in 2014.[1] The company has been listed for many years among Fortune magazine's 500 largest companies, and was ranked #297 in 2015.
Although the company has long been publicly owned, James R. Houghton, great-great-grandson of the founder, served as chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007. Over the years Houghton family ownership has declined to about 2%. Wendell P. Weeks has been with the company since 1983 and as of March 2013[update] was chairman, chief executive officer, and president.[19]
Over its 160-year history Corning invented a process for rapid and inexpensive production of light bulbs, including developing the glass for Thomas Edison's light bulb. Corning was the glass supplier for lightbulbs for General Electric after Edison General Electric merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company in 1892.[20] It was an early major manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for television tubes, invented and produced Vycor (high temperature glass with high thermal shock resistance). Corning invented and produced Pyrex, CorningWare Pyroceram glass-ceramic cookware, and Corelle durable glass dinnerware. Corning manufactured the windows for US manned space vehicles, and supplied the glass blank for the primary mirror in the Hubble Space Telescope. Corning won the National Medal of Technology four times for its product and process innovations[21] [22] [23] .[24]
In July 2008 Corning announced the sale of Steuben Glass Works to Steuben Glass LLC, an affiliate of the private equity firm Schottenstein Stores Corporation. Steuben Glass had been unprofitable for more than a decade, losing 30 million dollars over the previous five years.[25]
In February 2011, Corning acquired MobileAccess Networks, an Israeli company that develops Distributed antenna systems, which are often used by universities, stadiums and airports to ensure seamless wireless coverage throughout a facility. MobileAccess Networks became part of Corning’s telecommunications business unit.[26]

Chairman and CEO, Corning Incorporated
As CEO of Corning Incorporated, Wendell Weeks manages to celebrate the company’s 163-year history while keeping razor-sharp focus on the future. Although the products have changed over the years—from the glass bulbs for Thomas Edison’s electric light to the cover glass in Apple’s iPhones—Weeks sees a steady pattern of innovation paired with an old-fashioned commitment to values.
It was these values that first appealed to Weeks when he arrived at Corning as a Price Waterhouse consultant after graduating from Lehigh University. “I was impressed with the people and what the company stood for,” he recalls. The feeling was mutual: Corning asked him to join its corporate control group. Two years later, on the eve of his departure to attend HBS, Weeks was called into the office of CEO Jamie Houghton (MBA 1962). As Weeks tells it, Houghton, whose storied family had run the company since 1851, asked him to return to Corning after HBS. “I shook his hand and said yes. And here I am, 28 years later.” That simple moment launched Weeks’s career, and it also had a deep impact on Corning’s future as a successful innovator in materials science.
The first in his family to go to college, Weeks thrived at HBS. The case method—“pretend doing,” as he calls it—gave him a way to test out leadership skills without consequences. “HBS taught me the most important skill: to learn,” he says. Also at Soldiers Field, he managed to sit next to Kim Frock (MBA 1987) on his first day. The pair, who found they had much in common, will soon celebrate their 25th anniversary.
Upon returning to Corning, Weeks held a series of positions that helped him understand the complexities of the company—from shift supervisor in a manufacturing plant, to new product development, to business development. Weeks, a quick study, has 26 patents pending despite a lack of formal science training. A good salesman who understands business, he distills complicated ideas down to their essence, and, as one colleague put it, possesses “a forward-looking vision.”
Named a vice president in 1996, Weeks ran the company’s optical communications division and invested heavily in the technology, riding the tech boom and providing the fiber cables that brought the Internet into millions of homes in the 1990s. Like so many companies, Corning was caught by surprise when the telecommunications bubble burst. Its stock tumbled, from more than $100 to about a dollar per share. “That was the darkest time in Corning’s history,” says Weeks.
Jamie Houghton once again called Weeks into his office, and the younger man braced himself to be demoted by his mentor. But Houghton, like Weeks, believes in learning from failure. “His basic theory was, ‘if you broke it, you fix it,’” says Weeks, who was able to do exactly that, bringing Corning back from the brink of failure through a painful restructuring and commitment to both innovation and the diversification of its product lines. “We make products that change the world,” he says, noting Corning’s development of LCD glass; tools to facilitate drug discovery; clean-air technologies; and Corning Gorilla Glass, the scratch-resistant, lightweight cover glass that is now used in nearly 3 billion devices around the world.
An imposing figure at 6 feet 5 inches, with a confident gait and a winning record, Wendell Weeks is surprisingly open about his own self-doubt. “In any given day, there are moments when I am a good leader and there are moments when I am not,” he admits. Having devoted his entire career to Corning—both the company and the small town where it sits on the Chemung River—Weeks’s success is hard to miss, whether measured in employee satisfaction, innovation, shareholder return, or the many local causes he supports. What matters most to him is people. “As individuals, we have very little meaning,” he observes. “We find our meaning through how we serve others and our relationships.”

Chairman and CEO, Corning Incorporated
As CEO of Corning Incorporated, Wendell Weeks manages to celebrate the company’s 163-year history while keeping razor-sharp focus on the future. Although the products have changed over the years—from the glass bulbs for Thomas Edison’s electric light to the cover glass in Apple’s iPhones—Weeks sees a steady pattern of innovation paired with an old-fashioned commitment to values.
It was these values that first appealed to Weeks when he arrived at Corning as a Price Waterhouse consultant after graduating from Lehigh University. “I was impressed with the people and what the company stood for,” he recalls. The feeling was mutual: Corning asked him to join its corporate control group. Two years later, on the eve of his departure to attend HBS, Weeks was called into the office of CEO Jamie Houghton (MBA 1962). As Weeks tells it, Houghton, whose storied family had run the company since 1851, asked him to return to Corning after HBS. “I shook his hand and said yes. And here I am, 28 years later.” That simple moment launched Weeks’s career, and it also had a deep impact on Corning’s future as a successful innovator in materials science.
The first in his family to go to college, Weeks thrived at HBS. The case method—“pretend doing,” as he calls it—gave him a way to test out leadership skills without consequences. “HBS taught me the most important skill: to learn,” he says. Also at Soldiers Field, he managed to sit next to Kim Frock (MBA 1987) on his first day. The pair, who found they had much in common, will soon celebrate their 25th anniversary.
Upon returning to Corning, Weeks held a series of positions that helped him understand the complexities of the company—from shift supervisor in a manufacturing plant, to new product development, to business development. Weeks, a quick study, has 26 patents pending despite a lack of formal science training. A good salesman who understands business, he distills complicated ideas down to their essence, and, as one colleague put it, possesses “a forward-looking vision.”
Named a vice president in 1996, Weeks ran the company’s optical communications division and invested heavily in the technology, riding the tech boom and providing the fiber cables that brought the Internet into millions of homes in the 1990s. Like so many companies, Corning was caught by surprise when the telecommunications bubble burst. Its stock tumbled, from more than $100 to about a dollar per share. “That was the darkest time in Corning’s history,” says Weeks.

Wendell P. Weeks















Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Wendell P. Weeks is chairman and chief executive officer of Corning Incorporated. He was named chief executive officer in April 2005 and chairman of the board in April 2007. He has been a member of the company’s board of directors since December 2000.
Weeks began his career with Corning in 1983 in the corporate control group. In his 30 years with the company, he has held a variety of financial, business development, commercial, and general management roles, including strategic positions in the company’s television and specialty glass businesses.
In 1993, Weeks was named general manager of external development in Corning’s telecommunications business. He was named vice president and general manager of the company’s optical fiber business in 1996. In early 2001, Weeks was named president of Corning’s optical communications businesses, where he led through both dynamic market growth and the subsequent challenges of market declines.
Weeks became Corning’s president and chief operating officer in April 2002.  In this role, he helped lead the company’s restructuring and return to profitability following the telecom industry crash. Weeks was the chief architect of Corning’s Corporate Strategy Framework, which provides a foundation for mitigating the company’s inherent volatility and managing through good times and bad. 
As CEO, he has focused on creating new growth opportunities and building a bigger, more balanced company.
Weeks is a graduate of Lehigh University and earned a Master of Business Administration from Harvard University as a Baker Scholar. He serves on the board of directors at Merck & Co.

Hot Product Has Corning Thriving and Wary

CORNING, N.Y. - Last December, James R. Houghton, then Corning's chief executive, and Wendell P. Weeks, his heir apparent, dropped by the local chapter of the American Flint Glass Workers Union for some informal Christmas cheer.Stephen A. Mandell Sr., president of the chapter, recalls making an offhand remark about quality problems at one of Corning's Steuben glass plants."Within 15 minutes, Wendell was on the phone with the plant manager, asking what could be done to solve the problem," Mr. Mandell said. "Not a lot of C.E.O.'s would make that call themselves."That kind of hands-on chief may be exactly what Corning needs. The company is doing quite well -- but then, it was doing well in 2001, too, when its reliance on fiber optics almost made it a casualty of the telecommunications implosion.

This time, it is glass for flat-panel televisions and computers that could dominate the company. So, perhaps the hardest job facing Mr. Weeks, 46, who officially took over in April, is to figure out how to eke every profitable cent from that booming market without hitching Corning's future to it.

"The top lesson I've learned," Mr. Weeks said in an interview, "is never let this company be about one product."Among battle-scarred Corning employees, that caution gets a rousing amen. Many of them question the leadership skills of Mr. Weeks, his patience, even his grasp of strategy. But few, if any, doubt his ability to grasp details, pitch in and prevent another product disaster from almost scuttling Corning.After all, this is a 154-year-old company whose whole raison d'être has been turning a low-tech substance -- sand -- into cutting-edge glass. It was a front-runner on the light bulb, cathode-ray tubes for color televisions, ovenproof cookware, catalytic converters, optical fibers and, now, electronic glass."Most high-tech companies are looking to continually refresh existing products," said Steven B. Fox, an analyst at Merrill Lynch who has a buy recommendation on Corning's stock. "Corning is always looking for whole new applications for their materials."This time, Mr. Weeks is hedging Corning's bets. He will continue to put 10 percent of sales into research, and, sure, flat-panel glass will get the biggest piece of that. But he is also putting money into various glasses for use in the medical and pharmaceutical fields. And he is investing heavily in the pollution control devices for diesel cars and trucks that Corning expects will be huge sellers when diesel pollution laws start taking effect in 2007."We are giving flat-panel glass less than they are asking for, and we are giving diesel more than they are asking for," Mr. Weeks said.Corning is even poised to revitalize fiber optics, as companies like Verizon proceed with "fiber to the premises" projects that bring fiber optic lines to homes and businesses. Although Corning's optical fiber plant in Concord, N.C., remains shut, the company continues to maintain it.

"Wendell understands it would not be a good idea to change this technological culture, but he's learned from the rocky times," said Jaye E. Morency, a managing director at Babson Capital Management, which took a "small position" in Corning shares in January.It was no abstract lesson. Mr. Weeks was heading optical communications, the catch-all unit for Corning's telecommunications products, when everything came undone. It was on his watch that Corning's telecommunications revenue went from $5 billion in 2000 to $1.6 billion in 2002; sales in its once-promising photonics business, which made devices that blast signals down fiber optic pipelines, went from $1 billion to $60 million.Corning's debt ballooned as its profits dried up. Shareholders fled, sending the company's stock, which had peaked at $113 in September 2000, to a little more than $1 in the fall of 2002."People were clamoring for Wendell to be canned," Mr. Houghton recalled. Instead, in 2002, when Mr. Houghton gave in to the board's pleas that he come out of retirement to save the company, he immediately elevated Mr. Weeks to chief operating officer. Why? "I have yet to find someone who really saw the telecom implosion coming," he said.Actually, Mr. Weeks had more than that in his corner. Mr. Houghton, 69, the scion of Corning's founding family, has been mentor to Mr. Weeks since the younger man joined Corning 22 years ago. Mr. Houghton, a Harvard Business School graduate himself, encouraged Mr. Weeks to get a business degree from Harvard -- and got Corning to pay for it, "so that Wendell would feel obligated to us and not tempted to leave," Mr. Houghton said.

Mr. Houghton conceded that he wished Mr. Weeks had international experience and a more polished leadership style. But most important, he said, Mr. Weeks "has the right values to run this company."Maybe so. But when Corning almost hit bottom, it was Mr. Houghton, not Mr. Weeks, who played savior. "When Jaime came back," said James P. Clappin, general manager for display technologies, "it was like a dad saying to his child, 'O.K., your life's been rough, I'm here to help."'When Mr. Houghton came back in 2002, he found a company that had polarized into arrogant haves and sullen have-nots. For many years, the telecommunications executives -- Mr. Weeks among them -- had received the bulk of research dollars and of accolades; people running Corning's catalytic converter, medical glass and other lines had to make do with financial and emotional leftovers. "This had become a dysfunctional company," Mr. Houghton said.Mr. Houghton did not shy away from painful cuts. He mothballed plants, sold businesses and pared Corning's work force to 20,000 employees from 44,000. But, through it all, Mr. Houghton -- wearing his trademark suspenders and using the cane that is an unfortunate legacy of a near-fatal car crash in 1993 -- was omnipresent, stopping to chat with factory workers, dropping in on community meetings, urging people to seek solutions instead of scapegoats.

He hired an industrial psychologist to teach Corning's senior managers to again be team players. He instituted formal management development and global diversity programs. And he reinvigorated the company's total quality management program -- "it was dead as a doornail," Mr. Houghton groused -- and other manufacturing discipline programs.Corning is vibrantly alive now. It just booked its 10th consecutive quarterly sales increase, with revenue hitting $1.14 billion in the second quarter, 17 percent higher than the $971 million in the second quarter of 2004. It earned $165 million, or 11 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $108 million, or 7 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.Its debt, which exceeded $5 billion in 2002, will be below $2 billion by the end of the year, and it expects to have $2.1 billion in cash then. In April, Corning's bonds were restored to investment grade. And shareholders are slowly coming back. [Corning shares closed at $20.16 Monday.]"As other technology companies were gazing at their navels, Corning was redressing its balance sheet sins," said James N. Kelleher, a senior analyst at Argus Research who has a buy recommendation on Corning shares.It is addressing its strategic sins, too. It is closely monitoring sales of televisions and computers to make sure that their makers are not wearing the same rose-tinted lenses that the telecommunications companies once wore. And if customers want it to add new glass-making capacity, it insists that they prepay for much of the product those plants produce."We're pretty sure our customers are overestimating demand for flat-panel TV's, so let their shareholders bear the risk," Mr. Weeks said, noting that Corning has received $1 billion in deposits from five customers.Wall Street does have some concerns, of course. Corning issued lots of stock to pay off its debt, and now has about 1.5 billion shares outstanding, up from 930 million shares in 2001. James B. Flaws, Corning's chief financial officer, says the company will not buy back stock anytime soon, and some analysts are disappointed."I'd like to see them reduce the share count by a meaningful amount," Mr. Fox of Merrill Lynch said.At Corning's headquarters, where glass sculptures abound on every floor, employees have other concerns -- to wit, can their new leader ever fill Jaime Houghton's shoes?

"Jamie is brilliant at elevating himself to important stuff and delegating," Mr. Flaws said. "Wendell still wants to traipse through detail and process."Examples are easy to find. Mr. Clappin recalled a recent visit to some customers in Taiwan with Mr. Weeks. "For four hours on the plane, we talked about every aspect of one customer's financing," Mr. Clappin recalled. "Wendell understands strategy, but his first love will always be operations."Mr. Weeks, a tall man with an infectious smile, is working hard to win over skeptics. Mr. Mandell, the union leader, notes that Mr. Weeks often drops in at a local bar and drinks Genesee beer with the off-duty workers. Mr. Weeks and his wife, Kim Frock, provided much of the start-up financing for a private middle school in Corning; their daughter just graduated from the school, their son is starting. And Mr. Weeks is becoming a more frequent speaker at Rotary Club and other community meetings.Mr. Houghton, who has agreed to stay on as chairman, swears he will never pick up active management reins again. "Why not? The word is 'divorce,"' he said, adding that he promised his wife they would travel more. Mr. Weeks's wife, too, is ready for a bit more calm at home. "Wendell was stressed when the company was doing badly," she said. "And now, the stress is somehow, 'keeping up the success."' Continue reading the main story
