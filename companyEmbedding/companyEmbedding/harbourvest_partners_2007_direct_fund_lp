            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Global investment firm HarbourVest has raised $1 billion in the final close of its oversubscribed 2013 Direct fund. The target was $750 million. According to the firm, the pool has more than 30 LPs, which include corporate pensions, public pensions and international foundations. It has already invested in ten buyout and growth equity transactions in the U.S., Australia and Latin America.
PRESS RELEASE
14 April 2014 – HarbourVest Partners, LLC (“HarbourVest” or the “Firm”), a leading private markets specialist, announced the final close of HarbourVest Partners 2013 Direct Fund L.P. (“2013 Direct”), a global direct co-investment fund, at $1.0 billion. The fund closed above its $750 million target and was oversubscribed.
HarbourVest’s prior co-investment fund, 2007 Direct, a $734 million fund, is fully invested with accelerating distributions. The 2007 Direct portfolio includes buyout and growth equity investments across the U.S., Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. Similar to the 2007 Direct Fund, which invested more than 64% in companies with enterprise values below $1.5 billion, the 2013 Direct Fund intends to have a majority of its portfolio focused on small and mid-market companies.
The 2013 Direct Fund makes global direct co-investments in buyout, recapitalization, growth financing, and special situation transactions. More than 30 investors are participating in the fund including a broad array of institutions such as corporate pensions, public pensions, endowments, Taft Hartley plans, and foundations from around the globe.
“Over the past three decades, HarbourVest’s team has invested over $4 billion in 270 companies,” said Rob Wadsworth, Managing Director at HarbourVest. “A critical component of our success is our direct investment pipeline made up of qualified, actionable opportunities that are often pre-screened by general partners prior to HarbourVest’s review. Our direct co-investment team of more than 20 investment professionals is flexible in providing capital solutions to general partners and selective in identifying high value opportunities for our investors.”
With more than 30 years of experience investing in private markets, the HarbourVest team leverages its own deep network of relationships to originate and evaluate co-investment opportunities. HarbourVest’s longstanding partnerships with proven managers can generate strong deal flow, a large and diversified set of investment opportunities, and the opportunity to add value on a proprietary basis.
Through April 2014, the 2013 Direct Fund has already closed ten buyout and growth equity deals in the U.S., Australia, and Latin America, representing 25% of the fund. In January 2014, HarbourVest announced a significant liquidity event within the portfolio. Online and mobile banking solution provider Digital Insight was acquired by consumer transaction technology provider NCR (NYSE: NCR) for approximately $1.65 billion. 2013 Direct and other HarbourVest-managed funds invested in the company in August 2013 in partnership with funds managed by Thoma Bravo. The investment generated proceeds of approximately twice its cost basis within six months of the initial investment, allowing the fund to make an early distribution to Partners.
