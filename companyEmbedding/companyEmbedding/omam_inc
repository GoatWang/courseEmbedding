(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to "OMAM" refer to OM Asset Management plc and for all periods after our reorganization (as described in this report, which we refer to as the Reorganization), references to the "Company" refer to OMAM, and references to "we," "our" and "us" refer to OMAM and its consolidated subsidiaries and equity accounted Affiliates, excluding discontinued operations, after giving effect to the Reorganization. For all periods prior to the Reorganization, references to the "Company" refer to Old Mutual (US) Holdings Inc., or OMUSH, a Delaware corporation and indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of OMAM, and references to "we," "our" and "us" refer to OMUSH and its predecessors and their respective consolidated subsidiaries and equity accounted Affiliates, excluding discontinued operations. Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to "Affiliates" or an "Affiliate" refer to the asset management firms in which we have an ownership interest. References in this prospectus to our "Parent" refer to Old Mutual plc. None of the information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitutes either an offer or a solicitation to buy or sell any of our Affiliates' products or services, nor is any such information a recommendation for any of our Affiliates' products or services.  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See "-Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this Item 2 for more information. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below.  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results.  Our MD&A is presented in six sections:  * Overview provides a brief description of our Affiliates and our Reorganization, a summary of The Economics of Our Business and an explanation of How We Measure Performance using a non-GAAP measure which we refer to as economic net income or ENI. This section also provides a Summary Results of Operations and information regarding our Assets Under Management by Affiliate and asset class.  * U.S. GAAP Results of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 includes an explanation of changes in our U.S. GAAP revenue, expense, and other items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013.  * Non-GAAP Supplemental Performance Measure includes an explanation of the key differences between U.S. GAAP net income and ENI, the key measure management uses to evaluate our performance. This section also provides a reconciliation between U.S. GAAP net income and ENI for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013.  * Non-GAAP ENI Results of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 includes an explanation of changes in our ENI revenue, ENI expense, and ENI other items over the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013.  * Liquidity and Debt discusses Adjusted EBITDA and Long-Term Debt. The discussion of Adjusted EBITDA includes an explanation of how we calculate Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to both economic net income and cash flows from continuing operations excluding consolidated Funds.  * Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates provides a discussion of the key accounting policies used in the preparation of our U.S. GAAP financial statements.  Overview  We are a diversified, multi-boutique asset management firm headquartered in London, UK. We operate our business through seven affiliate firms to whom we refer in this quarterly report as our Affiliates. Through our Affiliates, we offer a diverse range of actively-managed investment strategies and products to institutional investors around the globe. While our Affiliates maintain autonomy in the investment process and the day-to-day management of their businesses, our strategy is to work with them to accelerate the growth and profitability of their firms.  Under U.S. GAAP, our Affiliates may be consolidated into our operations or may be accounted for as equity investments. We may also be required to consolidate certain of our Affiliates' sponsored investment entities or "Funds," due to the nature of our decision-making rights, our economic interests in these Funds or the rights of third-party clients in those Funds.  Table of Contents  Our Affiliates and their principal strategies include:  * Acadian Asset Management LLC ("Acadian")-a leading quantitatively-oriented manager of active global and international equity, fixed income and alternative strategies.  * Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss, LLC ("Barrow Hanley")-a widely recognized value-oriented investment manager of U.S., international and global equities, fixed income and a range of balanced investment management strategies.  * Campbell Global, LLC ("Campbell Global")-a leading sustainable timber and natural resource investment manager that seeks to deliver superior investment performance by focusing on unique acquisition opportunities, client objectives and disciplined management.  * Copper Rock Capital Partners LLC ("Copper Rock")-a specialized growth equity investment manager of small-cap international, global and emerging markets equity strategies.  * Heitman LLC ("Heitman")*-a leading real estate investment manager of high-quality global strategies focused on private real estate equity, public real estate securities and real estate debt.  * Investment Counselors of Maryland, LLC ("ICM")*-a value-driven domestic equity manager with product offerings across the entire capitalization range and a primary focus on small-cap companies.  * Thompson, Siegel & Walmsley LLC ("TS&W")-a value-oriented investment manager focused on small- and mid-cap U.S. equity, international equity and fixed income strategies.  Reorganization  At September 30, 2014, our US holding company, OMUSH, was a subsidiary of OM Group (UK) Limited, or OMGUK, which was and is in turn wholly owned by our Parent. The board of directors of our Parent completed our initial public offering of the Company's business, or the Offering, on October 15, 2014. Upon the completion of the Offering on October 15, 2014, we became an indirect, majority owned subsidiary of our Parent.  We and our Parent determined that certain transactions, or the Reorganization, should be undertaken in preparation for the Offering. Specifically, the pre-Offering restructuring steps described below were completed by us and our Parent prior to October 1, 2014:  1. OMGUK incorporated OMAM in the United Kingdom as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of OMGUK.  2. OMAM incorporated OMAM US, Inc. in the State of Delaware ("U.S. Sub") as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of OMAM.  3. US Sub incorporated OMAM UK Limited in the United Kingdom ("U.K. Sub") as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S. Sub.  4. Our existing intercompany debt, which was owed by OMUSH to OMGUK, was refinanced with new intercompany debt.  5. OMGUK contributed its shares in OMUSH and the new intercompany debt to OMAM in return for an issuance of shares by OMAM resulting in the elimination of existing intercompany debt of $1,003.5 million and the redemption of a $32.2 million intercompany receivable via a capital distribution back to OMGUK, for a net reduction of existing intercompany debt of $971.3 million.  6. The OMUSH shares were transferred to U.K. Sub via a series of share exchanges, and the new intercompany debt was contributed among OMAM, U.S. Sub and U.K. Sub.  7. OMAM underwent a reduction of share capital to maximize distributable reserves, re-registered in the United Kingdom as a public limited company, amended its articles of association to reflect the same and organized its share capital for purposes of the Offering.  8. OMAM declared a $175.0 million pre-Offering dividend to OMGUK. OMAM also issued a non-interest bearing promissory note to OMGUK in the principal amount of $37.0 million which will be paid as funds become available from Affiliate distributions, subject to the maintenance of a minimum level of cash holdings.  9. OMAM entered into arrangements with OMGUK for the payment of future realizable benefits (estimated to total $289.8 million at September 30, 2014) associated with certain deferred tax assets existing as of the date of the Offering, as well as co-investments (with a carrying value of $39.9 million and a fair value of $48.5 million) made by the Company in real-estate and timber strategies of its Affiliates. In accordance with the deferred tax asset arrangement, in December 2014, OMAM will begin to make quarterly payments to OMGUK. In the fourth quarter of 2014, OMAM will adjust the balance of the liability to reflect the impact of the 2013 income tax return and will also reduce the liability as of the Offering date to reflect a revised estimate of the future realizable benefits as of the Offering date. The liability will again be adjusted in the fourth quarter of 2015 to reflect the impact of the 2014 income tax return through the date of the Offering.  Table of Contents  Between October 1, 2014 and October 15, 2014 we completed the following restructuring steps  i. payment of the $175.0 million pre-Offering dividend to OMGUK, funded by a new third party credit facility entered into at the closing of the Offering; and  ii. the purchase of additional ownership of an Affiliate for $60.0 million in cash, resulting in a reduction of liabilities for the same amount.  Additionally, we have recast the components of Parent equity (deficit) to reflect the issuance of 120,000,000 ordinary shares, nominal value $0.001.  The Economics of Our Business  Our profitability is affected by a variety of factors including the level and composition of our average assets under management, or AUM, fee rates charged on AUM and our expense structure. Our Affiliates earn management fees based on assets under management. Approximately 75% of our management fees are calculated based on average AUM (calculated on either a daily or monthly basis) with the remainder of our management fees calculated based on period end AUM or other measuring methods. Changes in the levels of our assets under management are driven by our investment performance and net client cash flows. Our Affiliates may also earn performance fees when certain accounts add value in relation to relevant benchmarks or exceed required returns.  Our largest expense item is compensation and benefits paid to our and our Affiliates' employees, which consists of both fixed and variable components. Fixed compensation and benefits represents base salaries and wages, payroll taxes and the costs of our employee benefit programs. Variable compensation, calculated as described below, may be awarded in cash, equity or profit interests.  The arrangements in place with our Affiliates result in the sharing of economics between OMAM and each Affiliate's key management personnel using a profit-sharing model, except for ICM, which uses a revenue share model as a result of a legacy economic arrangement that has not been restructured. Profit sharing affects two elements within our earnings: (i) the calculation of variable compensation and (ii) the level of each Affiliate's equity or profit interests distribution to its employees. Variable compensation is the portion of earnings that is contractually allocated to Affiliate employees as a bonus pool, typically representing a fixed percentage of earnings before variable compensation, which is measured as revenues less fixed compensation and benefits and other operating and administrative expenses. Profits after variable compensation are shared between us and Affiliate key employee equity holders according to our respective equity or profit interests ownership. The sharing of profits in this manner ensures that the economic interests of Affiliate key employees and those of OMAM are aligned, both in terms of generating strong annual earnings as well as investing those earnings back into the business in order to generate growth over the long term. We view profit sharing as an attractive operating model, as it allows us to share in the benefits of operating leverage as the business grows, and ensures all equity and profit interests holders are incented to achieve that growth.  Equity or profit interests owned by Affiliate key employees are either awarded as part of their variable compensation arrangements, or alternatively, may have originally resulted from OMAM acquiring less than 100% of the Affiliate. Over time, Affiliate key employee-owned equity or profit interests are recycled from one generation of employee-owners to the next either by the next generation purchasing equity or profit interests directly from retiring principals, or by Affiliate key employees forgoing cash bonuses in exchange for the equivalent value in Affiliate equity or profit interests.  How We Measure Performance  In measuring and monitoring the key components of our earnings, our management uses a non-GAAP financial measure, economic net income, or ENI, to evaluate the financial performance of, and to make operational decisions for, our business. We also use ENI to make resource allocation decisions, determine appropriate levels of investment or dividend payout, manage balance sheet leverage, determine Affiliate variable compensation and equity distributions, and incentivize management. It is an important measure in evaluating our financial performance because we believe it most accurately represents our operating performance and cash generation capability.  ENI differs from net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a result of both the reclassification of certain income statement items and the exclusion of certain non-cash or non-recurring income statement items. In particular, ENI excludes the results of discontinued operations which are no longer part of our business, and that portion of consolidated Funds which are not attributable to our shareholders. ENI is also adjusted to reflect the effect of restructuring and reorganization activity undertaken in connection with the Offering.  ENI revenue is primarily comprised of the fee revenues paid to us by our clients for our advisory services and earnings from our equity-accounted Affiliates. Revenue included within ENI differs from U.S. GAAP revenue in that it excludes amounts from consolidated Funds which are not attributable to our shareholders, and includes our share of earnings from equity-accounted Affiliates.  Table of Contents  ENI expenses are calculated to reflect all usual expenses from ongoing continuing operations attributable to our shareholders. Expenses included within ENI differ from U.S. GAAP expenses in that they exclude amounts from consolidated Funds not attributable to our shareholders, revaluations of Affiliate key employee owned equity and profit interests, amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles and certain other non-cash expenses.  "Non-controlling interests" is a concept under U.S. GAAP that identifies net components of revenues and expenses that are not attributable to our shareholders. For example, the portion of the net income (loss) of our consolidated Funds that is attributable to the outside investors or clients of the consolidated Funds is included in "Non-controlling interests" in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Conversely, "Controlling interests" is the portion of revenue or expense that is attributable to our shareholders.
