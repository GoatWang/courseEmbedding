Products Overview
There are significant differences between products available in the natural products industry and those available from mass-market retailers such as drugstores, warehouse clubs, and supermarkets. Our products emphasize all natural ingredients and we strive to use organic and non-GMO ingredients wherever possible. Most of our brands are available only through health food stores, who are as dedicated as we are to quality, education, and service.
All of Nutraceutical’s products are made from ingredients of the highest quality. We employ quality control standards in all areas of product development – from ensuring identification and authenticity by laboratory analysis to screening for microbes, herbicides, and pesticides to heavy metal testing. We reject herbs and ingredients we suspect or discover are irradiated. Only after our laboratory analysis program confirms that the herbs meet our strict standards do we give the product our approval.

  Product FormulationHome / Products / Product Formulation 
Quality Without Exception
At Nutraceutical, quality is measured by customer satisfaction and confidence in products that have been thoroughly screened and tested to meet label claims. To achieve this goal, the Nutraceutical team monitors and controls every step of production—from sourcing the best raw materials to testing the finished product for dissolution and stability.
Our engineers and scientists are constantly assessing and improving our protocols to produce quality goods.


Manufacturing Process
We have some of the strongest manufacturing capabilities in the industry. Our manufacturing process generally consists of the following:

Sourcing ingredients for products
Quarantining and warehousing raw ingredients
Measuring ingredients for inclusion in products
Blending, grinding and granulating (chilsonating) the ingredients into a mixture with a homogeneous consistency
Encapsulating, tableting, pouring, pouching, bagging, or boxing the blended mixture into the appropriate dosage form using either automatic or semiautomatic equipment

The next step (bottling and packaging) involves placing the product in packaging with appropriate tamper-evident features and sending the packaged product to a distribution point for delivery to retailers.
We place a special emphasis on quality control—including raw material verification, homogeneity testing, weight deviation measurements, and package quality sampling.
In fiscal 2013, we manufactured approximately 75 percent of our branded products (based on net sales). By manufacturing the majority of our own products, we believe we maintain better control over product quality and availability while also reducing production costs.
Our dietary supplement manufacturing is performed primarily in our facilities located in the greater Ogden, Utah area. We also have a cosmetic manufacturing operation in Phoenix, Arizona, a liquid manufacturing facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma and a personal care manufacturing operation in Bowling Green, Florida. We also have a working relationship with numerous outside manufacturers (including certain softgel manufacturers and packagers) and we use these outside sources for such specialty items.
Quality Control
Our quality control program’s goal is to ensure the superior quality of Nutraceutical’s products and that they are manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”). As part of our commitment to quality and safety, we use a variety of analytical testing methods to detect and/or quantify a variety of chemical compounds, heavy metals and microbials. Our processing methods are monitored closely to ensure that only quality ingredients are used and to ensure product purity. Periodically, we retain the services of outside GMP audit and/or consulting firms to assist in our efforts to comply with current GMPs.

Park City, UT — Nutraceutical International Corporation has entered into an agreement under which an affiliate of HGGC, LLC, a middle-market private equity firm, will acquire the company in a transaction valued at about $446 million that includes debt to be refinanced. Under the terms of the agreement, Nutraceutical stockholders will receive $41.80 in cash from each outstanding share of the company’s common stock they own, representing a 49% premium of the Nutraceutical’s closing stock price on May 19, 2017 and a 15.6% premium of its all time high closing price.
“We expect that the combination of HGGC’s strategic insights and the deep industry experience and knowledge of our management team will help us continue to build and grow,” said Bill Gay, chairman and CEO of Nutraceutical in a press release. “We remain committed to our employees and their families, to our customers, to our world-wide consumers and to the natural products industry.”
The agreement was unanimously approved by the company’s board of directors, and was the recommendation of a special committee of independent directors, who also negotiated the terms of the agreement with assistance from financial and legal advisors. There will now be a 60 day “go-shop” period during which Nutraceutical can actively solicit, evaluate and potentially enter into negotiations with parties who offer alternative proposals.
“Nutraceutical is a great example of a successful roll-up strategy carried out with consistency and dedication over the last 25 years,” said Les Brown, managing director and CEO of HGGC in a press release. “We have long admired their disciplined market approach, which has allowed the Company to consistently generate strong financial returns and positive cash flow.”
The transaction which is subject to customary closing conditions is expected to close the second half of 2017.

Nutraceutical

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





Chia is grown commercially for its seeds rich in α-linolenic acid.


A Nutraceutical is a pharmaceutical-grade and standardized nutrient.[1] In the US, "nutraceuticals" do not exist as a regulatory category; they are regulated as dietary supplements and food additives by the FDA under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.[2]

Regulation[edit]
Nutraceuticals are treated differently in different jurisdictions.
Canada[edit]
Under Canadian law, a nutraceutical can either be marketed as a food or as a drug; the terms "nutraceutical" and "functional food" have no legal distinction,[3] referring to "a product isolated or purified from foods that is generally sold in medicinal forms not usually associated with food [and] is demonstrated to have a physiological benefit or provide protection against chronic disease."
United States[edit]
The term "nutraceutical" is not defined by US law.[4] Depending on its ingredients and the claims with which it is marketed, a product is regulated as a drug, dietary supplement, food ingredient, or food.[5][6]
International sources[edit]
In the global market, there are significant product quality issues.[7] Nutraceuticals from the international market may claim to use organic or exotic ingredients, yet the lack of regulation may compromise the safety and effectiveness of products. Companies looking to create a wide profit margin may create unregulated products overseas with low-quality or ineffective ingredients.
Market[edit]
A market research report produced in 2012 projected that the worldwide nutraceuticals market would reach US$250 billion by 2018,[8] defining that market as "Dietary Supplements (Vitamins, Minerals, Herbals, Non-Herbals, & Others), and Functional Foods & Beverages"[9]
Classification of nutraceuticals[edit]
Nutraceuticals are products derived from food sources that are purported to provide extra health benefits, in addition to the basic nutritional value found in foods. Depending on the jurisdiction, products may claim to prevent chronic diseases, improve health, delay the aging process, increase life expectancy, or support the structure or function of the body.[10]
Dietary supplements[edit]




Dietary supplements, such as the vitamin B supplement shown above, are typically sold in pill form.


A dietary supplement is a product that contains nutrients derived from food products that are concentrated in liquid or capsule form. In the US, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 defined the term: “A dietary supplement is a product taken by mouth that contains a "dietary ingredient" intended to supplement the diet. The "dietary ingredients" in these products may include: vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and substances such as enzymes, organ tissues, glandulars, and metabolites. Dietary supplements can also be extracts or concentrates, and may be found in many forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, liquids, or powders.”[11]
Dietary supplements do not have to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before marketing, but companies must register their manufacturing facilities with the FDA. With a few well-defined exceptions, dietary supplements may only be marketed to support the structure or function of the body, and may not claim to treat a disease or condition, and must include a label that says: “These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.”
Functional foods[edit]
Functional foods are fortified or enriched during processing and then marketed as providing some benefit to consumers. Sometimes, additional complementary nutrients are added, such as vitamin D to milk.
Health Canada defines functional foods as “ordinary food that has components or ingredients added to give it a specific medical or physiological benefit, other than a purely nutritional effect.”[12] In Japan, all functional foods must meet three established requirements: foods should be (1) present in their naturally occurring form, rather than a capsule, tablet, or powder; (2) consumed in the diet as often as daily; and (3) should regulate a biological process in hopes of preventing or controlling disease.[13]
History[edit]




Considered a father of Western medicine, Hippocrates advocated the healing effects of food.


The word is a portmanteau of the words "nutrition" and "pharmaceutical", was coined in 1989 by Stephen L. DeFelice, founder and chairman of the Foundation of Innovation Medicine.[14] Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, and Sumerians are just a few civilizations that have used food as medicine.[15] “Let food be thy medicine.” is a common misquotation [16] attributed to Hippocrates, who is considered by some to be the father of Western medicine.
The modern nutraceutical market began to develop in Japan during the 1980s. In contrast to the natural herbs and spices used as folk medicine for centuries throughout Asia, the nutraceutical industry has grown alongside the expansion and exploration of modern technology.[17]

Chia is grown commercially for its seeds rich in α-linolenic acid.


A Nutraceutical is a pharmaceutical-grade and standardized nutrient.[1] In the US, "nutraceuticals" do not exist as a regulatory category; they are regulated as dietary supplements and food additives by the FDA under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.[2]

Regulation[edit]
Nutraceuticals are treated differently in different jurisdictions.
Canada[edit]
Under Canadian law, a nutraceutical can either be marketed as a food or as a drug; the terms "nutraceutical" and "functional food" have no legal distinction,[3] referring to "a product isolated or purified from foods that is generally sold in medicinal forms not usually associated with food [and] is demonstrated to have a physiological benefit or provide protection against chronic disease."
United States[edit]
The term "nutraceutical" is not defined by US law.[4] Depending on its ingredients and the claims with which it is marketed, a product is regulated as a drug, dietary supplement, food ingredient, or food.[5][6]
International sources[edit]
In the global market, there are significant product quality issues.[7] Nutraceuticals from the international market may claim to use organic or exotic ingredients, yet the lack of regulation may compromise the safety and effectiveness of products. Companies looking to create a wide profit margin may create unregulated products overseas with low-quality or ineffective ingredients.
Market[edit]
A market research report produced in 2012 projected that the worldwide nutraceuticals market would reach US$250 billion by 2018,[8] defining that market as "Dietary Supplements (Vitamins, Minerals, Herbals, Non-Herbals, & Others), and Functional Foods & Beverages"[9]
Classification of nutraceuticals[edit]
Nutraceuticals are products derived from food sources that are purported to provide extra health benefits, in addition to the basic nutritional value found in foods. Depending on the jurisdiction, products may claim to prevent chronic diseases, improve health, delay the aging process, increase life expectancy, or support the structure or function of the body.[10]
Dietary supplements[edit]




Dietary supplements, such as the vitamin B supplement shown above, are typically sold in pill form.


A dietary supplement is a product that contains nutrients derived from food products that are concentrated in liquid or capsule form. In the US, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 defined the term: “A dietary supplement is a product taken by mouth that contains a "dietary ingredient" intended to supplement the diet. The "dietary ingredients" in these products may include: vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and substances such as enzymes, organ tissues, glandulars, and metabolites. Dietary supplements can also be extracts or concentrates, and may be found in many forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, liquids, or powders.”[11]
Dietary supplements do not have to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before marketing, but companies must register their manufacturing facilities with the FDA. With a few well-defined exceptions, dietary supplements may only be marketed to support the structure or function of the body, and may not claim to treat a disease or condition, and must include a label that says: “These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.”
Functional foods[edit]
Functional foods are fortified or enriched during processing and then marketed as providing some benefit to consumers. Sometimes, additional complementary nutrients are added, such as vitamin D to milk.
Health Canada defines functional foods as “ordinary food that has components or ingredients added to give it a specific medical or physiological benefit, other than a purely nutritional effect.”[12] In Japan, all functional foods must meet three established requirements: foods should be (1) present in their naturally occurring form, rather than a capsule, tablet, or powder; (2) consumed in the diet as often as daily; and (3) should regulate a biological process in hopes of preventing or controlling disease.[13]
History[edit]




Considered a father of Western medicine, Hippocrates advocated the healing effects of food.


The word is a portmanteau of the words "nutrition" and "pharmaceutical", was coined in 1989 by Stephen L. DeFelice, founder and chairman of the Foundation of Innovation Medicine.[14] Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, and Sumerians are just a few civilizations that have used food as medicine.[15] “Let food be thy medicine.” is a common misquotation [16] attributed to Hippocrates, who is considered by some to be the father of Western medicine.
The modern nutraceutical market began to develop in Japan during the 1980s. In contrast to the natural herbs and spices used as folk medicine for centuries throughout Asia, the nutraceutical industry has grown alongside the expansion and exploration of modern technology.[17]

Nutraceutical's stock soars 47% premarket after buyout bid by HGGC
Nutraceutical's stock soars 47% premarket after buyout bid by HGGC

May. 22, 2017 at 7:54 a.m. ET
by Tomi Kilgore









Nutraceutical to be bought for 49% premium, in a deal valued at $446 million
Nutraceutical International Corp.  agreed Monday to be acquired by private equity firm HGGC LLC in a deal valued at $446 million, including debt. Under terms of the deal, Nutraceutical shareholders will get $41.80 in cash for each Nutraceutical share they own, representing a 49% premium to Friday's closing price of $28.00, and 16% above the Jan. 17, 2017 record close of $36.15. The bid would give the maker and seller of branded nutritional supplements a market value of $386.7 million. Nutraceutical said it expects the deal to close in the second half of the year, but will undertake a 60-day "go shop" period to field potential other bids. "We are pleased to announce this transaction, which delivers significant value to our stockholders, many of whom have been with us since our initial IPO in 1998," said Nutraceutical Chief Executive Bill Gay. The stock is currently halted for news, and is set to resume trade at 7:30 a.m. ET. It has tumbled 20% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.4%.

Nutraceutical's stock soars 47% premarket after buyout bid by HGGC
Nutraceutical's stock soars 47% premarket after buyout bid by HGGC

May. 22, 2017 at 7:54 a.m. ET
by Tomi Kilgore









Nutraceutical to be bought for 49% premium, in a deal valued at $446 million
Nutraceutical International Corp.  agreed Monday to be acquired by private equity firm HGGC LLC in a deal valued at $446 million, including debt. Under terms of the deal, Nutraceutical shareholders will get $41.80 in cash for each Nutraceutical share they own, representing a 49% premium to Friday's closing price of $28.00, and 16% above the Jan. 17, 2017 record close of $36.15. The bid would give the maker and seller of branded nutritional supplements a market value of $386.7 million. Nutraceutical said it expects the deal to close in the second half of the year, but will undertake a 60-day "go shop" period to field potential other bids. "We are pleased to announce this transaction, which delivers significant value to our stockholders, many of whom have been with us since our initial IPO in 1998," said Nutraceutical Chief Executive Bill Gay. The stock is currently halted for news, and is set to resume trade at 7:30 a.m. ET. It has tumbled 20% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.4%.

9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements














9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of  Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements
I'm sure you've heard of vitamins, herbs, and other nutritional products that flunked lab tests. Here at Advanced Bionutritionals, we strive to make sure that does not happen.
In fact, our manufacturing process assures purity, potency and quality 9 different ways:

"You Get An A+"
"Thank you. I did receive the credit back on my credit card. You often promote your "money back guarantee" with your literature. Well, you certainly deliver on your promise!!!.
I judge a company on Quality, Price and Service (you pass on all three) but the ultimate test comes when you have a "problem". Your company scored an "A+"!!!!!! You have earned my business forever. Thank you for your outstanding service and problem resolution!"
Patrick M., Colorado



We use suppliers and growers that we've known for years. 


We use ingredients that are shown to be effective in scientific studies.


We use no artificial colors, artificial binders, artificial fillers, or artificial preservatives, and non-GMO sources whenever available. 


Every supplier is qualified by testing multiple lots of material. The material is assayed for purity and screened for pathogens like mold, yeast, staph, and salmonella.


The batches of our ingredients are tested using FTIR spectrometers and compared to a purity index.


Our products are manufactured in a facility that is GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certified.


Batches of our product undergo rigorous disintegration tests in conformance with USP guidelines to ensure proper breakdown in the stomach and absorption in the intestines.


Our manufacturing process has multiple checks in place, and our batches are signed off by a quality control officer to ensure accuracy, purity, and potency.


Our bottles are safety sealed for lasting freshness and potency. And each bottle is marked with a manufactured date and/or an expiration date.





For you, that means the best quality possible. In fact, we promise it. If you are ever dissatisfied with one of our products for any reason whatsoever, simply return the unused portion within 90 days of purchase. We will refund every penny you paid, including shipping and handling. You only pay return shipping.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        National Pen Company has received 3.75 out of 5 stars based on 27 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Nutraceutical - Wikipedia






















 






Nutraceutical

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





Chia is grown commercially for its seeds rich in α-linolenic acid.


A Nutraceutical is a pharmaceutical-grade and standardized nutrient.[1] In the US, "nutraceuticals" do not exist as a regulatory category; they are regulated as dietary supplements and food additives by the FDA under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.[2]

Regulation[edit]
Nutraceuticals are treated differently in different jurisdictions.
Canada[edit]
Under Canadian law, a nutraceutical can either be marketed as a food or as a drug; the terms "nutraceutical" and "functional food" have no legal distinction,[3] referring to "a product isolated or purified from foods that is generally sold in medicinal forms not usually associated with food [and] is demonstrated to have a physiological benefit or provide protection against chronic disease."
United States[edit]
The term "nutraceutical" is not defined by US law.[4] Depending on its ingredients and the claims with which it is marketed, a product is regulated as a drug, dietary supplement, food ingredient, or food.[5][6]
International sources[edit]
In the global market, there are significant product quality issues.[7] Nutraceuticals from the international market may claim to use organic or exotic ingredients, yet the lack of regulation may compromise the safety and effectiveness of products. Companies looking to create a wide profit margin may create unregulated products overseas with low-quality or ineffective ingredients.
Market[edit]
A market research report produced in 2012 projected that the worldwide nutraceuticals market would reach US$250 billion by 2018,[8] defining that market as "Dietary Supplements (Vitamins, Minerals, Herbals, Non-Herbals, & Others), and Functional Foods & Beverages"[9]
Classification of nutraceuticals[edit]
Nutraceuticals are products derived from food sources that are purported to provide extra health benefits, in addition to the basic nutritional value found in foods. Depending on the jurisdiction, products may claim to prevent chronic diseases, improve health, delay the aging process, increase life expectancy, or support the structure or function of the body.[10]
Dietary supplements[edit]




Dietary supplements, such as the vitamin B supplement shown above, are typically sold in pill form.


A dietary supplement is a product that contains nutrients derived from food products that are concentrated in liquid or capsule form. In the US, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 defined the term: “A dietary supplement is a product taken by mouth that contains a "dietary ingredient" intended to supplement the diet. The "dietary ingredients" in these products may include: vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and substances such as enzymes, organ tissues, glandulars, and metabolites. Dietary supplements can also be extracts or concentrates, and may be found in many forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, liquids, or powders.”[11]
Dietary supplements do not have to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before marketing, but companies must register their manufacturing facilities with the FDA. With a few well-defined exceptions, dietary supplements may only be marketed to support the structure or function of the body, and may not claim to treat a disease or condition, and must include a label that says: “These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.”
Functional foods[edit]
Functional foods are fortified or enriched during processing and then marketed as providing some benefit to consumers. Sometimes, additional complementary nutrients are added, such as vitamin D to milk.
Health Canada defines functional foods as “ordinary food that has components or ingredients added to give it a specific medical or physiological benefit, other than a purely nutritional effect.”[12] In Japan, all functional foods must meet three established requirements: foods should be (1) present in their naturally occurring form, rather than a capsule, tablet, or powder; (2) consumed in the diet as often as daily; and (3) should regulate a biological process in hopes of preventing or controlling disease.[13]
History[edit]




Considered a father of Western medicine, Hippocrates advocated the healing effects of food.


The word is a portmanteau of the words "nutrition" and "pharmaceutical", was coined in 1989 by Stephen L. DeFelice, founder and chairman of the Foundation of Innovation Medicine.[14] Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, and Sumerians are just a few civilizations that have used food as medicine.[15] “Let food be thy medicine.” is a common misquotation [16] attributed to Hippocrates, who is considered by some to be the father of Western medicine.
The modern nutraceutical market began to develop in Japan during the 1980s. In contrast to the natural herbs and spices used as folk medicine for centuries throughout Asia, the nutraceutical industry has grown alongside the expansion and exploration of modern technology.[17]

Nutraceutical

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Chia is grown commercially for its seeds rich in α-linolenic acid.


A Nutraceutical is a pharmaceutical-grade and standardized nutrient.[1] In the US, "nutraceuticals" do not exist as a regulatory category; they are regulated as dietary supplements and food additives by the FDA under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.[2]

Regulation[edit]
Nutraceuticals are treated differently in different jurisdictions.
Canada[edit]
Under Canadian law, a nutraceutical can either be marketed as a food or as a drug; the terms "nutraceutical" and "functional food" have no legal distinction,[3] referring to "a product isolated or purified from foods that is generally sold in medicinal forms not usually associated with food [and] is demonstrated to have a physiological benefit or provide protection against chronic disease."
United States[edit]
The term "nutraceutical" is not defined by US law.[4] Depending on its ingredients and the claims with which it is marketed, a product is regulated as a drug, dietary supplement, food ingredient, or food.[5][6]
International sources[edit]
In the global market, there are significant product quality issues.[7] Nutraceuticals from the international market may claim to use organic or exotic ingredients, yet the lack of regulation may compromise the safety and effectiveness of products. Companies looking to create a wide profit margin may create unregulated products overseas with low-quality or ineffective ingredients.
Market[edit]
A market research report produced in 2012 projected that the worldwide nutraceuticals market would reach US$250 billion by 2018,[8] defining that market as "Dietary Supplements (Vitamins, Minerals, Herbals, Non-Herbals, & Others), and Functional Foods & Beverages"[9]
Classification of nutraceuticals[edit]
Nutraceuticals are products derived from food sources that are purported to provide extra health benefits, in addition to the basic nutritional value found in foods. Depending on the jurisdiction, products may claim to prevent chronic diseases, improve health, delay the aging process, increase life expectancy, or support the structure or function of the body.[10]
Dietary supplements[edit]




Dietary supplements, such as the vitamin B supplement shown above, are typically sold in pill form.


A dietary supplement is a product that contains nutrients derived from food products that are concentrated in liquid or capsule form. In the US, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 defined the term: “A dietary supplement is a product taken by mouth that contains a "dietary ingredient" intended to supplement the diet. The "dietary ingredients" in these products may include: vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and substances such as enzymes, organ tissues, glandulars, and metabolites. Dietary supplements can also be extracts or concentrates, and may be found in many forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, liquids, or powders.”[11]
Dietary supplements do not have to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before marketing, but companies must register their manufacturing facilities with the FDA. With a few well-defined exceptions, dietary supplements may only be marketed to support the structure or function of the body, and may not claim to treat a disease or condition, and must include a label that says: “These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.”
Functional foods[edit]
Functional foods are fortified or enriched during processing and then marketed as providing some benefit to consumers. Sometimes, additional complementary nutrients are added, such as vitamin D to milk.
Health Canada defines functional foods as “ordinary food that has components or ingredients added to give it a specific medical or physiological benefit, other than a purely nutritional effect.”[12] In Japan, all functional foods must meet three established requirements: foods should be (1) present in their naturally occurring form, rather than a capsule, tablet, or powder; (2) consumed in the diet as often as daily; and (3) should regulate a biological process in hopes of preventing or controlling disease.[13]
History[edit]




Considered a father of Western medicine, Hippocrates advocated the healing effects of food.


The word is a portmanteau of the words "nutrition" and "pharmaceutical", was coined in 1989 by Stephen L. DeFelice, founder and chairman of the Foundation of Innovation Medicine.[14] Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, and Sumerians are just a few civilizations that have used food as medicine.[15] “Let food be thy medicine.” is a common misquotation [16] attributed to Hippocrates, who is considered by some to be the father of Western medicine.
The modern nutraceutical market began to develop in Japan during the 1980s. In contrast to the natural herbs and spices used as folk medicine for centuries throughout Asia, the nutraceutical industry has grown alongside the expansion and exploration of modern technology.[17]
