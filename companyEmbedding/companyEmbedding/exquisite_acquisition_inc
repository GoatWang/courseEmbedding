Baumco Products Proudly Announces Its Acquisition of the Exclusive Rights to the Exquisite, Hand Sculpted Jewelry Work of Michael De Medina
 Northridge, CA,  January 09, 2009 --(PR.com)-- Baumco Products has been in business since 1976 and has been the creator of many sports and Advertising Specialty products.As an admirer of the sculptors work he is thrilled to have acquired the rights to the line of jewelry. These products were created in the year 2000 but were never offered for sale.Baumco Products is the proud owner of the 5 CD set, La Vida de JesuCristo a dramatization which is also available in English as The Life of Jesus Christ. Mr. Bauman has been the owner of the dramatization of La Vida de JesuCristo for many years. It was recorded almost fifty years ago and has had great acceptance from theologians of many faiths.Mr. Bauman's limited knowledge of Spanish was helped along in the design of the packaging for La Vida de JesuCristo by a Catholic Priest. He is hopeful that a portion of the profits from all of his endeavors can go to worthy charities especially those related to Children's illnesses.He says that brave little kids gave him the courage in his fight with lung, colon, bladder and prostate cancer over approximately twelve years. At age eighty one and a Veteran of Word War II and Korea he believes he has been blessed and hopes he still has time to help others.For information:Contact: Russell Bauman/818-366-0128###
