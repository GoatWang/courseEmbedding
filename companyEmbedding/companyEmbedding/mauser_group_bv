Mauser Files for IPO

By Chris Lange August 10, 2015 2:14 pm EDT




Print




Email









Tweet











 



Mauser Group B.V. filed an F-1 form with the Securities and Exchange Commission for its initial public offering. There were no pricing terms given in the filing but the offering is valued up to $100 million. The company has not yet made plans on what index it plans to list on or what symbol to file under.
The underwriters for the offering are Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Baird, Deustche Bank, Citi and Jefferies. 


This Netherlands-based company is a leading global supplier of rigid packaging products and services for industrial use. Mauser believes that we holds the number 1 or number 2 market position globally in all of the categories of products and services it offers. The company serves an addressable market of roughly €7 billion within the €15 billion global rigid industrial packaging industry. The industry is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 4.0% from 2014 through 2020.
The product and service offerings includes plastic, metal and fiber drums, intermediate bulk containers, or IBCs, and the collection, reconditioning and resale of used IBCs and plastic drums.
The company serves over 7,000 customers, including large blue chip companies such as Archer Daniels Midland, BASF, Bayer, Brenntag, Cargill, Chevron, Dow Chemical, Dow Corning, Evonik, Ecolab, ExxonMobil, Huntsman, Lubrizol, Momentive, Monsanto, Recofarma, Shell and Univar. What’s interesting is that Mauser has a low customer concentration with no single customer representing more than 6% of its revenue for the year ended December 2014 and the top 20 customers accounting for only 36% of revenue for 2014.
Currently, the company operates 98 manufacturing facilities in 76 strategic locations across 18 countries. Many of its facilities are close to the factories of major clients, enabling fast and cost-effective customer service.
Mauser described its finances as:
Our pro forma revenue, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma consolidated result for the year ended December 31, 2014, were €1,243.7 million (representing an increase of 8.5% from the year ended December 31, 2013), €162.1 million (representing an increase of 13.8% from the year ended December 31, 2013) and €(34.4) million, respectively.
The company intends to use the proceeds to pay down its indebtedness as well as for general corporate purposes.

Mauser Gears Up For IPO

Mauser Group B.V. filed an amended Form F-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding its initial public offering (IPO). There were no terms given in the filing. The company intends to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MSR.
The underwriters for the offering are Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Baird, Deustche Bank, Citi and Jefferies. 


This Netherlands-based company is a leading global supplier of rigid packaging products and services for industrial use. Mauser believes that it holds the number 1 or number 2 market position globally in all of the categories of products and services it offers. The company serves an addressable market of roughly €7 billion within the €15 billion global rigid industrial packaging industry. The industry is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 4.0% from 2014 through 2020.
The product and service offerings includes plastic, metal and fiber drums, intermediate bulk containers, or IBCs, and the collection, reconditioning and resale of used IBCs and plastic drums.
The company serves over 7,000 customers, including large blue chip companies such as Archer Daniels Midland, BASF, Bayer, Brenntag, Cargill, Chevron, Dow Chemical, Dow Corning, Evonik, Ecolab, ExxonMobil, Huntsman, Lubrizol, Momentive, Monsanto, Recofarma, Shell and Univar. What’s interesting is that Mauser has a low customer concentration with no single customer representing more than 6% of its revenue for the year ended December 2014 and the top 20 customers accounting for only 36% of revenue for 2014.
Currently, the company operates 98 manufacturing facilities in 76 strategic locations across 18 countries. Many of its facilities are close to the factories of major clients, enabling fast and cost-effective customer service.
Mauser described its finances as:
Our pro forma revenue, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma consolidated result for the year ended December 31, 2014, were €1,243.7 million (representing an increase of 8.5% from the year ended December 31, 2013), €162.1 million (representing an increase of 13.8% from the year ended December 31, 2013) and €(34.4) million, respectively.
The company intends to use the proceeds to pay down its indebtedness as well as for general corporate purposes.
