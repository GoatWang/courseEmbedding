Pricing and performance





Unit values apply only to the specific annuity product listed, and should not be used by investors who hold an interest in Putnam Variable Trust funds through a different annuity or other variable product.
Money market funds are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other governmental agency. Although these funds seek to maintain a constant share price of $1.00, it is possible to lose money by investing in these funds.
For Putnam VT Growth and Income Fund, VT Growth Opportunities Fund, VT New Opportunities Fund and VT Voyager Fund, recent performance benefited from receipt of an Enron Class Action Settlement pertaining to investments made prior to 2002.
Data is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. More recent returns may be less or more than those shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and you may have a gain or a loss when you sell your units.
Returns shown for the subaccounts for periods before their inception are derived from the historical performance of the underlying fund, adjusted to reflect the mortality, expense risk, and surrender charges applicable to this product and do not factor in the annual $30 contract maintenance fee. Additional riders and options for insurance-related charges will increase expenses and lower returns. Please see the prospectus for details. For a portion of the period, subaccounts may have limited expenses, without which returns would have been lower.
Variable annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Putnam Hartford products are flexible-premium variable annuities issued by Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company, Simsbury, CT.

Please check for availability in your specific state.
These policies have limitations and are sold by prospectus only. The prospectus contains details on the variable annuity, the subaccounts, contract features, fees, expenses, and other pertinent information.
For a prospectus containing this and other information for any variable annuity or variable life product that invests in Putnam Variable Trust funds, contact your financial advisor or the applicable insurance firm for a contract prospectus and prospectus for the underlying funds. You may call Hartford at 1-800-521-0538 or Allstate at 1-800-390-1277. Read the prospectuses carefully before investing.

Putnam to Launch Absolute Return Fund for Use in Variable AnnuitiesHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0Putnam to Launch Absolute Return Fund for Use in Variable AnnuitiesMarketwireFebruary 22, 2011ReblogShareTweetShareBOSTON, MA--(Marketwire - 02/22/11) - Putnam Investments today announced that it plans to launch a version of its Absolute Return 500 Fund for use by insurance companies in variable annuities and other variable insurance products that they offer customers.The Putnam Variable Trust (VT) Absolute Return 500 Fund, which will be available for sale only to insurers and other firms issuing variable insurance products, is designed to seek a positive return that exceeds the rate of inflation, as reflected by Treasury bills, by 5% over a reasonable period of time (generally at least three-years or more) regardless of market conditions. The subaccount's strategies are also generally intended to produce lower volatility than historically associated with traditional asset classes that have earned similar level of return.The new variable trust offering will join the Putnam 529 for America and Putnam RetirementReady (lifecycle) funds as investment vehicles that make Putnam absolute return strategies available to advisors and their clients."The Putnam VT Absolute Return 500 Fund meets a growing demand by insurers for a variable insurance counterpart to our retail Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund that they could incorporate into their annuity and life insurance platforms," said Putnam's President and Chief Executive Officer Robert L. Reynolds. "This subaccount aims for targeted return with managed volatility that insurers can use in assembling portfolios to help meet their variable products' investment, risk and volatility objectives."This new application is fresh evidence of the great potential that absolute return strategies have to meet a wide variety of investment goals," Reynolds explained.The trustees of the Putnam Funds have approved the proposed subaccount, and Putnam has filed the subaccount with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Subject to the required review the Putnam VT Absolute Return 500 Fund will be launched in spring 2011.The Putnam VT Absolute Return 500 Fund will be managed by the same team of portfolio managers and in the same manner as the retail Absolute Return 500 Fund, led by Jeffrey L. Knight, Head of Global Asset Allocation. It will be a diversified fund with the objective of seeking a positive total return that exceeds the rate of inflation by 500 basis points over a reasonable period of time (generally at least three-years or more) regardless of market conditions.In order to achieve its goals, the Putnam VT Absolute Return 500 Fund will combine two independent investment strategies: A beta strategy that seeks to balance risk and provide positive total return through a comprehensively diversified, multi-asset class market portfolio with broad exposure to investment markets; and an alpha strategy with a variety of active trading tactics that employ security selection, tactical asset allocation, , currency transactions and options transactions."Absolute return strategies, in general, can help address a variety of retirement-related investment concerns, including market volatility, the need for more dependable streams of income, the potential for inflation and longevity risk," said Reynolds.
