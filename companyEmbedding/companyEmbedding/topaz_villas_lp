 Classic Beauty. Modern Living.
Topaz Villas condominiums are designed to deliver luxury living that shines. Every home combines idyllic elegance with contemporary features. 
Significant Features Include:

Spacious single level homes
 Tranquil location, convenient to Museum District, Downtown, Medical Center, Montrose
Extraordinary Views
Class “A” concrete non-combustible structure
Two (2) elevators
Quality finishes 


The inspirationJust as Michelangelo, Raphael and da Vinci started with a vision, so did we. Their art was a result of their need for creative expression and the inspiration of many years of life experiences. Topaz Villas is the result of a similar creative passion and of more than 50 years of condominium development experience. Topaz Villas, LP, is led by Ron Lozoff who pioneered building and developing condominiums in Atlanta, GA, more than 30 years ago. Starting with Evian Condominiums on Peachtree Street, he built communities designed to last. With its concrete structure, timeless design and only three homes per floor, Evian was innovative and unique when built in 1985, and is still known as Atlanta’s finest mid-rise condominium development in Buckhead. River Oaks Condominiums, built 30 years ago in Atlanta’s inner-loop, is considered by many to be the best townhome community ever built. Those and many other newly constructed and uniquely designed condominiums, as well as more than 2,150 Houston and Dallas townhomes and condominiums sold during the last 12 years, inspired the development of Topaz Villas. This Italian Renaissance-style condominium community is a “Class A” concrete sculpture with built-in security, only three spacious well-designed homes per floor, large outdoor terraces, high-end finishes and is, like fine art, designed to stand the test of time. Art is the result of creative expression. The final design, construction and expert finish of these condominiums are the result of our passion to create timeless, inspirational sculpture. That’s why we consider Topaz Villas a work of art.
