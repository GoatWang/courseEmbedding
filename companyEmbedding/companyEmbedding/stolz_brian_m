Brian M. Stoltz is currently a professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology.[1] The primary focus of his research is chemical synthesis with an emphasis on the development of new strategies for the preparation of complex molecules possessing unique structural, biological, and physical properties. His research involves the total synthesis of natural products such as dragmacidin F[2] and (–)-cyanthiwigin F,[3] and development of synthetic reactions to access quaternary stereocenters.[4] Specifically, he has focused on the allylic alkylation of enolates, developing an enantioselective variant in 2004.[5]
Several former members of the Stoltz laboratory have gone on to start research groups of their own, such as Richmond Sarpong (UC-Berkeley), Uttam Tambar (UT-Southwestern Medical Center), Neil Garg (UCLA), Jeremy May (University of Houston), Eric Ferreira (University of Georgia), Hosea Nelson (UCLA) and Wen-Bo 'Boger' Liu (Wuhan Univ.).

Brian M. Stoltz is currently a professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology.[1] The primary focus of his research is chemical synthesis with an emphasis on the development of new strategies for the preparation of complex molecules possessing unique structural, biological, and physical properties. His research involves the total synthesis of natural products such as dragmacidin F[2] and (–)-cyanthiwigin F,[3] and development of synthetic reactions to access quaternary stereocenters.[4] Specifically, he has focused on the allylic alkylation of enolates, developing an enantioselective variant in 2004.[5]
Several former members of the Stoltz laboratory have gone on to start research groups of their own, such as Richmond Sarpong (UC-Berkeley), Uttam Tambar (UT-Southwestern Medical Center), Neil Garg (UCLA), Jeremy May (University of Houston), Eric Ferreira (University of Georgia), Hosea Nelson (UCLA) and Wen-Bo 'Boger' Liu (Wuhan Univ.).

The Stoltz Group
























































Increasingly, modern organic synthesis is driven by the pursuit of function, as evidenced in two of its central research endeavors, total synthesis and methods discovery and development. In complex natural product synthesis, the ideal target is not only architecturally fascinating, but also exhibits potentially useful medicinal properties toward which an efficient synthesis could provide useful quantities for further biological studies. Similarly, in reaction discovery and development, the new method ideally facilitates the efficient synthesis of motifs prevalent in medicinal or functional compounds and materials.  Our research group seeks to address difficult but rewarding fundamental problems in both synthesis and technology development, such as the synthesis of quaternary stereocenters and selective C-H functionalization. Ultimately, we hope our endeavors will further the ideals of modern organic chemistry: advancing the field from a basic science perspective while also lending to numerous applications in biomedicine and materials science.
