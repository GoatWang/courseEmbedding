SummaryTARO is a dominant generic drug manufacturer with a strong balance sheet.Trades at significant discount to peers despite much higher margins.Catalysts include new drug approvals and $150 billion of drug patents expiring by 2020.Target Price and Rationale Taro Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TARO) is a recommended buy with a price target of $175. The Company markets over 200 generic pharmaceutical products in over 25 countries and is largely known for its dominating influence in the generic dermatology segment. Over the last three years, Taro has experienced an ample growth in terms of sales that increased around 42% and significant margins expansion. Taro has concentrated its efforts on reducing costs, eliminating debt, increasing profitability and efficiency, and in committing more capital to research and development. Taro currently has zero debt but a substantial net cash position of around $1.1 billion. Cost of sales accounts for less than 18% of revenues, while SG&A expense accounts for less than 10% of revenues. Decreasing COGS, zero debt, and low SG&A expenses significantly reduced the cost structure of Taro enabling the company to sell its products at a discount compared to competitors. Taro's commitment to delivering new quality products through R&D investments is one of its central priorities; in fact, the company increased its number of products in pre-registration from 27 in 2014 to 36 currently. Taro's gross margin is 82.15%, while its net profit margin is 56.90%. Free cash flow per share is around $9, and operating margin is around 64%. By running a fairly conservative DCF valuation, it can be evinced that Taro's current intrinsic value is around $175/share. Additionally, there are several catalysts likely to happen that will further improve Taro's position in the market. Relevant Comps Taro's most direct competitors are: Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA), Akorn (NASDAQ:AKRX), Merck (NYSE:MRK), and Sandoz (Novartis's (NYSE:NVS) generic subsidiary). All of the aforementioned companies have a substantially higher cost structure, more debt, and lower margins compared to Taro. However, they are all trading at higher multiples.
 Taro's P/E is 10. Its EV/EBIT is 6.8, compared to the peers' mean of 36.3. This indicates that the company is being valued relatively cheaply for each $ of EBIT. EBIT/EV is 14.7%, compared to peers' mean of 2.75%. Catalyst The main catalysts likely to happen with regard to Taro's operations are: Taro's has committed an increasing amount of capital on developing new medicines and accelerated its ANDA (Abbreviated New Drug Application) filings. Currently, 36 of Taro's ANDAs are being reviewed by the FDA, one of which was tentatively approved. Taro recently filed 10 ANDAs with the FDA, of which four were first to file. Moreover, there are multiple products for which either developmental or internal regulatory work is in process. In August 2013, NovaBiotics entered into an exclusive global licensing agreement with Taro for the clinical development, manufacturing, and marketing worldwide of Novexatin, a product aimed at the treatment of fungal infections of the toenail (Onychomycosis). Based on recent studies, Novexatin will deliver high cure rates and rapid cosmetic benefits with only 28 days of treatment against 330 days for the existing topical treatments. My view is that the market is not correctly discounting the possibility that Novexatin will successfully launch in 2018-2019. In fact, from Taro's latest 20-F report, it can be evinced that the company has recently "received patents and obtained an exclusive license in the United States and other countries for a variety of products, processes, and methods of treatment, including a novel anti-fungal compound for onychomycosis". That statement (which was not reported on the 2014 and 2015 20-F files) gives a major hint about the several steps forward that have been done regarding Novexatin. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $1-1.5 billion once Novexatin is launched as the market for such infection is relatively large and given the efficiency of the treatment. Around $150 billion worth of drug patents will expire by 2020, which will allow generic drug producers to introduce new and cheaper products in the market.
 Investment summary and recommendation: Taro Pharmaceutical is a recommended buy with a price target of $175. Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Taro, the company) is a science-based pharmaceutical company. The Company markets over 200 pharmaceutical products in over 25 countries and is largely known for its dominating influence in the generic dermatology segment. Over the past three years, Taro has experienced stable growth along with operating and financial improvements. Metrics such as sales, net income, free cash flow, profit margins all improved, while debt was reduced to zero. Additionally, the company has a meaningful net cash position of $1.1 billion. Albeit the betterment of its operations, the market is pricing Taro at low valuations. Company description: Taro Pharmaceutical Industries is a multinational, science-based pharmaceutical company established in Israel in 1950. Taro is a leader in both the marketing and production of generic drugs and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) and sells its products in over 25 countries. The Company operates principally through three entities: Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Taro Israel), and two of its subsidiaries, Taro Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Taro Canada) and Taro U.S.A. Sun Pharmaceutical (OTCPK:SMPQY) currently controls 79.3% of the voting power in Taro. Generic pharmaceuticals are the chemical and therapeutic equivalents of brand-name drugs and are typically marketed after the patents for brand name drugs have expired. Generic pharmaceutical products must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceutical products although they are generally sold at prices that are substantially lower than those of their branded counterparts. Taro's generics (including semi-solids formulations, such as creams, ointments, and other dosage forms such as liquids, capsules and tablets) are the bedrock of its business and consist of more than 200 stock-keeping units, the majority of which are developed along with Taro's own API division. The therapeutic categories that Taro's generic drugs cover are Dermatology (66% of sales), Neuropsychiatric (20% of sales), Cardiovascular (8% of sales), Anti-inflammatory (3% of sales), and others (3% sales).
 Taro manufactures API internally in its manufacturing facilities in Israel and Canada. This allows the company to control the quality of its products and to adopt an efficient and flexible approach to control supply. The vertical integrated production process of both generics and API enables the company to have a substantial cost advantage compared to peers. Operating features: Over the last three years, Taro has experienced an ample growth in terms of sales that increased around 42% and significant margins expansion. The company has concentrated its efforts on reducing costs, eliminating debt, increasing profitability and efficiency, and in committing more capital to research and development. Taro's increase in profitability was mainly driven by the introduction of new and high quality drugs in the market and by adjusting the prices of its products due to limited market availability of the respective drugs. These "pricing adjustments existed given these products were, and continue to be, of high quality and cost effective to patients compared to alternative treatment options available in the market". Taro's revenue in the United States accounted for 91% of total consolidated net sales. Taro's market presence is balanced. Its customer pool is diversified among drug wholesalers, store chains, mass merchandisers, food and retail chains, medical care providers, and generic drug distributors. Research and development expenses are allocated 65% to generic pharmaceuticals, 25% to proprietary pharmaceuticals and delivery systems, and 10% to organic and steroid chemistry. Over the last two years, R&D expenses grew 28%. Taro increased its number of products in pre-registration (products that have passed the Phase 3 clinical trials and are awaiting regulatory approval before being launched for sale) from 27 in 2014 to 36 currently. Cost of sales accounts for less than 18% of revenues, while SG&A expense accounts for less than 10% of revenues. Moreover, the company has lower labor force expenses and higher revenues per employee than most competitors.
 Decreasing COGS, zero debt, and low SG&A expenses significantly reduced the cost structure of Taro, enabling the company to sell its products at a discount compared to competitors, increasing the company's market share and, consequentially, its free cash flow and cash position. Cash flow from operations for the nine months ended December 31st, 2016, increased 34% compared to the same period last year. I expect free cash flow to be around $400 million for the fiscal year that ended on the 31st March 2017, increasing at an average annual growth rate of 15% over the last four years. Taro's gross margin, net margin, and return on net capital are as follows: 

 Taro's ROE is 27%, and by analyzing it under a DuPont profile, it can be seen that it is driven by a large net profit margin and asset turnover rather than leverage, which is essentially not existent. Competitors not only have a substantially lower ROE but such value is principally driven by leverage rather than profitability and efficiency. Market features: In recent years, the market for generic pharmaceuticals has grown and is expected to keep expanding at a CAGR of 10.5% by 2020. The growth has been fueled mainly by the following factors:  The constant increase in brand drug prices is pushing demand for generics; Efforts by governments, employers, third-party payers and consumers to control healthcare costs; Increased acceptance of generic products by physicians, pharmacists, and consumers; The increasing number of pharmaceutical products whose patents have expired and are therefore subject to competition from, and substitution by, generic equivalents. Moreover, around $150 billion worth of drug patents will expire by 2020, which will allow generic drug producers to introduce new and cheaper products in the market. 
 Additionally, Taro is mainly focused on the market for generic drugs aimed at treating dermatological diseases such as eczema and psoriasis (of which around 13% of the US population is affected). Such market is a niche-high barrier to entry market. This allows Taro to sustain its extremely high margins by exploiting its predominant position as a leader provider of such generic medicines. A niche market will not persuade other large competitors that will have to commit extra capital in order to develop new drugs and that will be unable to sell at Taro's low prices because of their higher cost structure and operating leverage. Management Operatus: Taro's management has been able to execute a strategy focused on delivering high quality products. Taro's commitment to delivering quality products through R&D investments is one of its central priorities, and management has stated that building a strong and superior quality pipeline will continue to be its focus. In 2016, Taro received the supply chain excellence award from Cardinal Health, and the RBC 2016 Manufacturers award. Additionally, compensation expenses are relatively lower than the company's peers. Taro's Board of Directors has recently announced that it approved a new $250 million share repurchase program, following the successful completion of the previous $250 million share repurchase program completed in August 2016. Taro's management currently intends to retain the majority of its earnings to finance the development of its business. In fact, the company has recently expanded the production capacity of its Israeli and Canadian operations to meet anticipated greater demand for Taro's products in future years. In May 2016, Taro's management announced that it will now make Keveyis, the first medicine approved by the FDA for the treatment of primary hyperkalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis and related variants, available to distributors at no cost for the treatment of primary periodic paralysis, in order to make the drug less expensive to clients.
 Management has a tendency to operate conservatively. For example, from Taro's latest 20-F report, it can be evinced that the company does not ship products that have 12 months or less to expiration in order to reduce its exposure to any risk associated to a temporarily slowing demand for its medicines. Such peculiarity was not found on Taro's most direct competitors' financial reports. Competition: Taro's most direct competitors are: Teva Pharmaceutical, Akorn, Merck, Perrigo (NASDAQ:PRGO) (2016 10-K form not yet provided), and Sandoz (Novartis's generic subsidiary). All of the aforementioned companies have a substantially higher cost structure, more debt and lower margins compared to Taro. However, they are all trading at higher multiples. 

 Valuation: Taro is an efficient performing business that is, however, barely covered by Wall Street analysts and thinly traded. Free cash flow per share is around $9, a value that is 2 to 8 times higher than closest competitors. Moreover, EV/EBIT is 6.8 compared to the peers' mean of 36.3. This indicates that the company is being valued relatively cheaply for each $ of EBIT. EBIT/EV is 14.7%, compared to peers' mean of 2.75%. By running a fairly conservative DCF valuation, it can be evinced that Taro's current intrinsic value is around $175/share. 

 Investment thesis: Taro has recently experienced an increase in pricing pressure. The market is expecting a decrease in sales and the challenging pricing environment for Taro to continue for the foreseeable future, hence its low valuation of 10 P/E. However, my view on the company's future is different. My investment thesis core tenants are as follows:
 Taro has committed an increasing amount of capital on developing new medicines and accelerated its ANDA (Abbreviated New Drug Application) filings. Currently, 36 of Taro's ANDAs are being reviewed by the FDA, one of which was tentatively approved. Taro recently filed 10 ANDAs with the FDA, of which four were first to file. To the extent that Taro is the first to market the generic version of a significant product, and particularly if the company obtains the 180-day period of market exclusivity for the U.S. market provided under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, sales and profitability can experience a sharp increase. Moreover, there are multiple products for which either developmental or internal regulatory work is in process. In August 2013, NovaBiotics entered into an exclusive global licensing agreement with Taro for the clinical development, manufacturing, and marketing worldwide of Novexatin, a product aimed at the treatment of fungal infections of the toenail (Onychomycosis). Novexatin will be the first fungal nail infection therapy to address both the underlying cause of the condition and the cosmetic issues associated with the infection. Based on recent studies, Novexatin will deliver high cure rates and rapid cosmetic benefits with only 28 days of treatment against 330 days for the existing topical treatments. My view is that the market is not correctly discounting the possibility that Novexatin will successfully launch in 2018-2019. In fact, from Taro's latest 20-F report, it can be evinced that the company has recently "received patents and obtained an exclusive license in the United States and other countries for a variety of products, processes, and methods of treatment, including a novel anti-fungal compound for onychomycosis". That statement (which was not reported on the 2014 and 2015 20-F files) gives a major hint about the several steps forward that have been done regarding Novexatin. The market for such infection is about $6 billion a year, affecting 12% of the global population. Capturing around 25% of such market will lead to an increase in revenue of about $1-1.5 billion per year. Such scenario is relatively conservative considering the quickness and effectiveness of the treatment.
  Taro's competitive advantage lies in its proven compliance in manufacturing very high quality products. Taro has an ability to sell at lower prices than competitors given its cost structure. In addition to the pharmaceutical patents that have expired, there is a significant amount of patents related to dermatology that will expire in the following years, allowing Taro to capture additional market share. Taro has been able to sustain higher margins than almost the entirety of its competitors for an extended period of time. This means that the company is able to keep a competitive advantage in different market conditions. Near-term pricing pressure is being offset by increasing volume and by the launch of new products. Significant return on assets of 25% suggests that its operating results are sustainable. Taro currently has zero debt but a substantial net cash position of around $1.1 billion. Taro's internal vertical integration process gives it a meaningful competitive advantage.

Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Taro Pharmaceuticals Fourth Quarter 2016 - 17 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder for the duration of this conference call, all participants lines will be in a listen-only mode and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions at the end of todayâs presentation [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. William Coote. Mr. Coote, please go ahead.
William Coote
Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to our year-end 2016 - 17 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Mr. Dilip Shanghvi, Chairman of Taroâs Board of Directors; Mr. Abhay Gandhi, Interim CEO; and Mr. Mariano Balaguer, Taroâs CFO.
We hope you received a copy of the earnings press release, which can be found on our website at taro.com. We anticipate that many of you may have questions concerning not only this quarterâs and year-to-date financial performance, but also our markets, operations, strategies and other matters. While weâll try to respond to most of your queries, weâll not be able to share product specific and commercially sensitive information, including pipeline details. We ask that you limit yourself to one question, and if you have more please rejoin the queue. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and a replay will be made available on our website for the next 24 days. A call transcript will also be placed and remain on our website.
Before I proceed, I must remind you that todayâs discussion may include certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurances that its expectations will be attained and should be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that our business faces, as detailed from time to time in the Companyâs SEC reporting.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Dilip Shanghvi.
Dilip Shanghvi
Thank you, Bill. Welcome all of you and thank you for joining us today for Taroâs earnings call after the announcement of the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 16 -17 financial results. As we have stated for quite some time, we were cautious about the long-term sustainability of some of the product prices that we were experiencing in the U.S. We continued to see a difficult generic pricing environment particularly in the U.S. given by more intense competition among manufacturers, new entrants to the market, buying consortium pressures and higher ANDA approval rate from the FDA.
This product specific pricing pressure is expected to continue in future as well. Despite these challenges, Taro continues to invest in R&D to develop a differentiated product pipeline, which will help us in getting new business in future. Taro continues to be a preferred supplier with high standards of customer service. It also enjoys healthy market share for many of the products in the U.S. Approximately 72% of Taroâs product lines rank number one and number two within the product segment itself. I believe that Taro will maintain its leadership position delivering high quality products and creating long-term shareholder value.

I will now hand over the call to Abhay.
Abhay Gandhi
Thank you, Mr. Shanghvi. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today. Q4 has been a difficult quarter for Taro. As indicated in the past, we have faced pricing pressure in some of our products which has impacted the performance. While we are faced with a challenging market environment, we did a number of significant accomplishments during the year. Our facilities are fully compliant with regulatory agencies.
During the year, we had two successful FDA inspections Health Canada and a health inspection, which have gone very well, 10 key customer orders that were all successful. Our New Jersey the distribution facility was VWAG certified. We continue to focus on R&D. We had the leading number of generic topical FDA approvals in 2016 among our competitors. Our customer service is our spending with 97% service levels.
Taro received the supply chain excellence award from Cardinal Health, and the RBC 2016 Manufacturer of the Year award. We repurchased a total of 2.3 million shares during the year, returning significant value to shareholders with a large portion of our current authorization remaining. Finally, we are encouraged by the 3% volume increase in the quarter, our third consecutive quarter of increase as compared to the prior year quarters and by the overall 2% volume increase this year.
With cash of approximately $1.4 billion, we will continue to evaluate business development opportunities with appropriate targets. However, we will remain disciplined in our approach for deploying this cash, ensuring that our financial and operational targets are met.
In summary, I believe we are well positioned in our target markets. Our strategy is solid with the leadership position in many of our key molecules, the continuing focus on R&D investment, a healthy pipeline, effective new product launches, a strong balance sheet, and excellent manufacturing and customer service capabilities.
I will now handover the call to Mariano.
Mariano Balaguer
Thank you, Abhay. Hello, everyone and welcome. Let me discuss some of the key financial highlights. The comparisons that I will discuss are with comparable prior year periods. First, the Q4 highlights followed by the full year comparison. Q4 net sales were at $196 million, a decrease of $69 million, or 26%, the result of continue increased competition and challenging pricing environment. Overall volumes increased 3% driven principally by the U.S. generic business.
Gross profit of $144 million decreased $80 million and as a percentage of net sales, was 73% compared to 85%. R&D expenses of $20 million remained in line with the comparable quarter. Selling, marketing, general and administrative expenses of $22 million decreases slightly, as we continue to actively manage and remained disciplined with our spending and seek efficiencies wherever is possible.
Operating income of $102 million decreased $80 million and as a percentage of net sales was 52% as compared to 69% in the prior year quarter. As the result of the above, Q4 EBITDA decreased 43% to $106 million. EBITDA margins were 54% compared to 70% for Q4 last year.
Foreign Exchange expense decreased $42 million to $6 million, principally the result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus Canadian dollar at a lower rate than prior period and increased U.S. dollar cash and intercompany balances. The FX is mainly balance sheet driven by U.S. dollar denominated bank accounts and intercompany accounts receivable balances on our Canadian subsidiary books.
Tax expense decreased $6 million to $17 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 17.3% compared to 16.6%. Net income attributable to Taro was $83 million as compared to a $115 million as the decrease in operating income was offset by the decrease in FX expenses and tax expenses and slightly increased in interest income. Resulting in diluted earnings per share of $2.05 compared to $2.68 for the same period last year.

Let me now briefly discuss the full year performance and comparison to last year. Net sales of 879 million decreased 71 million or 8% while overall volumes increased 2% on this trend of our generic basis. Cost of goods increased 38 million, the result of high volume and product mix. Gross profit of 671 million decreased 108 million as a percentage of net sales was 76% compared to 82% while the margin obviously they are still very strong and amounted best in the industry.
R&D expenses of 71 million decrease slightly. SG&A expenses decreased 7 million to 86 million principally as a result of a reduced Keveyis spend as well as remain disciplined with our overall expenses. Operating income of 515 million decreased a 100 million or 16% versus last year. EBITDA of 530 million with a decreasing margin from 66% to 60% again is helping margin to highlight.
FX income increased 13 million to 20 million principally driven by the strengthening of U.S. dollar versus Canadian dollar at a slightly lower rate as compared to the prior year. FX again is mainly balance sheet driven. Other gain of 11 million increased 9 million primarily driven by the sale of Keveyis in the fiscal third quarter of fiscal 2017. Tax expenses increased 8 million, principally the result of certain tax benefit in the prior year, not realized in the current year resulting in an effective tax rate increase to 18.5% from 15%.
Net income attributable to Taro was 456 million compared to 541 million and 85 million decrease, as the decrease in operating income was partially offset by the increase of FX and the interest income, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $11.05 million compared to $12.62.
Our cash flow and balance sheet remain extremely strong. Cash provided by operation for the year ended March 31, 2017 of 438 million as compared to 395 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. Cash including short-term bank deposit and marketable securities of 1.4 billion increased a 158 million from March 2016 despite of a 295 million impact on the Company share repurchase in fiscal 2017.
Recently, we entered in two agreements, one of them on April 25 of 2017, we entered into a development and commercialization license agreement with Crescita Therapeutics under which Crescita has granted Taro an exclusive license to the right to serve and distribute Pliaglis in the U.S. for a second-generation enhanced version with patent pending, while these are relatively small transactions that demonstrate our willingness to pursue opportunities which might farther with our portfolio.
We return value to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. In August, we successfully complete our 250 million share repurchase program, repurchasing 1.8 million shares in open market transactions of which 1.7 million were purchased subsequent to April 1, 2016. During the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 208,000 shares at an average price of $103.99 in total during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 the Company repurchased 2.3 million shares at an average price of a $130.87. We still have unutilized buyback authorization of 196 million.
I will now turn the floor back to Abhay Gandhi
Abhay Gandhi
Thanks, Mariano. Before we open the floor to your questions, I want to briefly address the DoJ investigation. While we have nothing new to report on this, we take this matter very seriously and we continue to work with our counsel to cooperate DoJ. We also remain committed to strong corporate governance and fostering a compliance culture at Taro.
Finally, I would like to thank the entire Taro team and all of our employees for their continuing outstanding efforts throughout the year during these very challenging times. Iâm confident that Taro is well positioned for the future and that we will continue to meet these challenges to move the Company forward.

With this, I would like to open the floor up for your questions. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] The first question from the line is Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is now open.
Gregg Gilbert
Yes, thank you. Good day. I was hoping you could speak to your expectations for revenues and margins for the coming year and if you canât be specific, could you at least talk qualitatively or directionally around the challenges youâre facing now and whether you expect them to sort of abate and stabilize in the next year or so? Thanks a lot.
Abhay Gandhi
Thanks, Gregg, for your question. I think directionally I think the challenges that we have seen in the last quarter were continued in the new financial year going ahead also. I think what we talked about in the readout and what we all know in the consolidation of the buyer groups, which has now down to three buyers with [indiscernible] also joining the WBAD group, and then the higher number of approval that we are seeing from the FDA, I think the pressure on the business is going to continue. And I think the challenge for us is to find ways and means to hold onto the business that we have and keep increasing the volumes and market share in products where we can get a sensible kind of price.
Gregg Gilbert
Letâs hope that the pressure from the consolidation of the buyers will sort of anniversary in 2018 versus â17 and result in pricing going down next year versus this year?
Abhay Gandhi
Difficult to estimate, we cannot predict how it will pan out, but logically when you have a consolidation of buying in the hands of just three conglomerates, which will account for 90% of the total market. Your guess is as good as mine.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Prakash Agarwal from Axis Capital. Your line is now open.
Prakash Agarwal
Just trying to understand with the approval that has come during the last quarter and approval that weâre expecting given the 30 plus NDAs that we have, so how good is this to offset the increasing pricing pressure because we saw the increased pressure in Q4, and if we analyze in fiscal â18, that could be further markdowns. So, Iâm just trying to understand, how confident in terms of number of products or qualitatively any key approvals that we are looking at which could help arrest this fall? Thank you.
Abhay Gandhi
The new product that we will get during the year will be available of course through the course of the year at different periods of time, but as the pricing pressure that we see will be for the duration of the year, so not really sure whether the products that will come in and can entirely mitigate the pricing pressure that we are talking about on the size and the scale of the business that we are seeing.
Our objective of course will be to launch a new product and keep up with the track record that Taro has that we wish to be either number one or number two with each of the product launches. That will be our task going ahead and itâs a track record that we have worked hard to maintain going ahead.
Operator
Thank you and our next question comes from Ram Selvaraju from Rodman & Renshaw. Sir, your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, there, this is Mitchell on for Ram. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you outline the development timeline for Shigamab? And do you have the total breakdown of 2016 sales by Pliaglis?
Abhay Gandhi
I couldnât get the second part of your question, so Iâll answer the first part and then maybe you could repeat the second part for my benefit. So, the first product I think we should we able to file during the current financial year, thatâs our expectation. And what other question on Crescita you said?
Unidentified Analyst

Do you have the breakdown of sales for 2016 generated by Pliaglis?
Abhay Gandhi
I mean we have clearly, but not something that I can share on this call.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Anubhav Aggarwal from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Anubhav Aggarwal
Yes, so one question. With the new environment of more competition, can you give some color of how Taroâs R&D program will change from now in the sense that do you want to spend more on R&D from now or less in terms selection of products, some colors will be useful on the R&D program in the new context?
Abhay Gandhi
I think in the readout and release also we have said that investment in R&D will continue. It is not something that we look on a quarter-on-quarter basis. So, I think on a long-term perspective I think we have good R&D team in place. We are excited about the projects that we are working on and the investment in R&D will continue. And directionally I donât want to take a standard increase or remain same, but its depends on the projects and the product that we have in the pipeline and how much each one of them will require to be invested, but itâs a continuous investment for the future that we will continue to do.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] SBI Capital. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst
Just a couple of few things. One, would there be any impact of new shelf stock adjustment for prior quarter deliveries that came into the fourth quarter? And second, with the new pricing pressure and competitive pressure that youâre seeing in your core area of dermatology, would your R&D programs taking new direction in terms of other therapeutic areas or other product lines et cetera?
Abhay Gandhi
Iâll answer the second part of your question and itâs a continuation on the earlier question, which was asked of me. I think and we will continue to invest on R&D. Most of our R&D is derm focus, but we also have some products which are not exactly in dermatology, which is especially being developed for the generic part of the business. So, no, there is no sudden change in our R&D strategy. Thatâs the question youâre trying to ask. For the first part, I think Mariano would you like to answer.
Mariano Balaguer
It was difficult to understand you. Do you mind please to repeat your question?
Abhay Gandhi
The first part of your question. Sorry, could you please repeat your first part of your question?
Dilip Shanghvi
Okay. We will take it later. Can we go to the next question please?
Operator
Our next participant called by the name of Neha Manpuria from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Neha Manpuria
Thank you for taking my question. Sir, given we have about $1.4 billion of cash in our books. We have done some smaller deals, but how are we looking at inorganic growth opportunities particularly given the generic dermatology and business is becoming more tough with the competition?
Abhay Gandhi
So, I donât know that I heard you correctly, I heard organic opportunities.
Neha Manpuria
Inorganic, sorry.
Abhay Gandhi
Inorganic opportunities.
Neha Manpuria
Inorganic.
Abhay Gandhi
Yes, Yes. Thank you. Clearly, Neha, I mean we continue to look for opportunities with the same kind of discipline that we have always talked about. If we can find a product or a business which we think and grow in our hands and we can make is successful, and at the right kind of financial metrics and payback that we all just talk about, I think we definitely keep looking out for that.
Neha Manpuria
So your preference would be for a more product like approach rather than business because those are the kind of deals that you seem to be doing on more on the specialty side would that be fair to say?
Abhay Gandhi
No, we have no such preference. I mean weâll keep looking for opportunities and whatever helps us to grow. We will be open, so no preference really.

Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Nimish Mehta from Research Delta Advisors. Your line is now open.
Nimish Mehta
Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify I heard and wanted to make sure, you said that the price erosion was more pronounced in few products at this quarter, is that right? And second, also wanted to know was the price erosion in general more aggravated or it was more aggravated for derma as a segment than the other segments of generic industry? Thank you.
Abhay Gandhi
I think the price erosion does not differentiate between therapies, so itâs equally bad and I think all therapies that we are looking at. As far as Taro is concerned, we are more worried about what happens in the derm space. And naturally in a particular product where you have two or three or four approvals coming in in a particular quarter, that those are the kinds of products where the price erosion is far more than the others. So, the buyer consolidation being like a constant, the other factor which then impacts you is the number of approvals that come in the quarter for a given product.
Nimish Mehta
So, it was more because of I mean this quarter was more impacted because of few products?
Abhay Gandhi
Last two quarters the rate of approvals have gone up much higher than what we normally used to see. So, what we saw in the Q3, the impact of that would be really felt in Q4 because for the products to then become available, get some share from customer, so you see a little bit of a lag. So as far as approvals are concerned, we saw in the peak in Q3 slightly less in Q4, but overall for the last six months far higher than what we would normally see.
Nimish Mehta
So, it was across the Board, right? It was not concentrated in few products, is what I am trying to understand?
Abhay Gandhi
No, I donât know what you mean by across the Board. I mean, I cannot guarantee then each and every molecule that we are marketing there were large number of competitors which came in. For example, 16 new approvals came in Q3 and approximately 12 new approvals came in Q4. Those are the numbers I can give you, but whether it is for each and every molecule that we are marketing thatâs not really true.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James. Sir, your line is now open.
Elliot Wilbur
Good morning. With respect to price erosion, could you quantify that number for the fourth quarter, I mean understand obviously reported sales growth and you gave volumes, but just trying to tease out the differential between price impact on the portfolio and then what the contribution may have been from new products. And I guess if it's possible to discern the difference between the negative impact of new competitive of new competitive launches against your existing portfolio versus the impact of the consolidation of the buyers group, maybe not a specific quantitative measure. But if you could talk about qualitatively which of those you think have the greater impact over the last couple of quarters? Thank you.
Abhay Gandhi
I actually donât know any methodology by which I can differentiate the pricing pressure, how much of that is because of buyer consolidation and how much of that is because of new approvers. So, overall if you want to see what kind of an impact we have, then you should directly look at what is the volume increase we have see in the business and overall decline in the revenues. That will give you a fair indicator of by how much the prices have come down because overall we have run a tight shift. So, on expenses we havenât really increased. R&D, we continue to invest. So, the difference is essentially because price erosion.
Mariano Balaguer
[indiscernible] mix as well 
Elliot Wilbur

Okay, but no, no significant positive benefit from new products than year-over-year?
Abhay Gandhi
Iâm sorry can you repeat that please?
Elliot Wilbur
So there wasn't really a significant positive impact from new launches year-over-year in terms of the reported revenue number?
Abhay Gandhi
We did around one significant product during the year, but just remember on the scale that we are talking about, one new product in the very first year doesnât really help us to move the needle.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Girish Bakhru from HSBC. Your line is now open.
Girish Bakhru
Hi, just again on the approval side. Abhay, any I mean concern on some delayed approvals on certain products given that we have seen some of the markets have gone generic with Taro not getting approval in those products despite all facilities being clear?
Abhay Gandhi
Actually, no Girish. If I see our own R&D productivity, I think during the course of the year, we have been the number one company in terms of the number of approvals that we have received. So, I think overall, I think we are happy with the R&D productivity, the quality of our filing. And therefore, I think the approvals that we get from the FDA. I think the task for all of us is to being able to do that sustainably year-on-year.
Girish Bakhru
Actually related question on that is in the pipeline of 35 ANDAs. I mean how do you basically judge, then going forward is these pipeline of products are more technical even though they maybe derm products or they something of the sort where you would see the number of approvals on one day would not be more than one or two. Is there a possible color that you can give on that?
Abhay Gandhi
No, I mean we have our best guess but thatâs about it. We would not know for a given molecule how many would have filed and we can only guess.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Sameer Baisiwala from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Sameer Baisiwala
Hi, thank you so much. Just a quick one, if I look at your financials were in last six quarters, they have been coming off say on the top line and on the operating profit line, but last quarter was quite peculiar, like early it was some gradual 10 million, 5 million sort of time down, but last quarter it came down 20 million plus on top line and also on operating profit. So, the question here is, was anything one-off in the quarter? And second are should we start working from this new base of roughly 200 million on top line and 100 million dollar on the operating profit for the current business assuming no new approvals?
Abhay Gandhi
Sameer, there is no one-off. So, this is a market reality and the challenge which all of us in the space are going to face. And we do our best to try and mitigate these circumstances, so there is no one-off.
Sameer Baisiwala
Okay. And just a related question, I can send competitive intensity, but just on the buyer consolidation and the three consortiums which are there. Is it something to say that you know this is at some point I am behind us or is this a recurring theme that every year there is shop up on your door and then give you a $50 million tap, what is the right way to think about this pressure?
Abhay Gandhi
I donât know. Iâm trying to understand your question little more clearly. I know it used to be five, then four, then three, now whether that three will become a two I could not know. You and I should pray together on this one.
Sameer Baisiwala
No, Abhay. What I mean to say is, assuming it remains three, is it something to say that they work towards a certain goal and the method in terms of their cost savings or is this a recurring theme with just three around that they will come and ask for their pound of flesh every year, hope for a foreseeable future. So it's a recurring pressure.

Abhay Gandhi
It will be Sameer a recurring pressure, I think rather than look at it as how do they want to run the business or we want to run the business, I think the logic is simple. If you have your sales spread across just three buyers and even if you loss one for a particular product then the loss is very significant for any company. So you would try and do your best to protect your existing business and that is where I think any trade-off between keeping a share of the market or losing a little bit of value on price. So itâs more to do with handling of the large buyer groups as an organization in a competitive environment. So itâs not that they come with the prefix step, every year you have to give me this kind of a reduction. Its more to do with what kind of trade-offs happen in the process of trying to keep your shade.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Kartik Mehta
Yes, hi, I just trying to understand this, so Abhay is it fair to assume that 3% volume, which we deal now, it's more out of an option which we have to I mean just to ensure that we also participate to maintain and increase our market share in an event where three overall buyers are consolidating. I'm just trying to understand here that from where did the volume gain happened in this quarter? Thank you.
Abhay Gandhi
I think irrespective of the buyer consolidation or otherwise, I think any good business would like to focus on volume gain as a strategy so that you have more people using your product. You have more customers who are using your products and buying your products. So I think itâs a strategic objective of any organization to try and increase volumes wherever they can. I am not saying every time the Company would be successful but clearly if you ask me that would be an objective, right.
Kartik Mehta
Yes, because we have seen in Q3, this is driven by 1% now, 3% and previously the commentary and the results have been either the volumes have seen very marginal increase or they have decreased. So, I'm just understanding, is this a new way in which Taro is approaching existing competition [indiscernible]?
Abhay Gandhi
Itâs not a new way. Itâs not a new way. What Iâm trying to say is that itâs been always an objective maybe we are seeing the result of it.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Rahul Deshmukh from Private Investor. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hello, hi. This is Rahul Deshmukh, again thank you for taking my call. My question for is more some of ownership structure, and this is to do with the Sun Taro relationship. Right now, I believe that Sun owns about 81% of voting rights of Taro. So my question is, how does Taro management look at this ownership and what are their thoughts. Once Sun reaches 90% of the ownership, Sun has the right to own Taro completely. So how is does Taro management looking at this?
Abhay Gandhi
The Taro is an independent company and all decisions that we take are with the best interest of the Taro as a company and our employees work for the business. So that has been our overarching principle of operations anyway. So, I donât think there is any kind of pressure or directive from the Sun ownership to try and influence the way Taro functions. So, thatâs very clear and I donât think there's any ambiguity on it.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Appreciate your response.
Abhay Gandhi
I think we differentiate ownership from management of the Company and I think we manage the business and Taro in the best interest of the Company.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Appreciate that. And my second question was regarding the Phase II product that the clinical trials were completed about 16 months ago on Novexatin for the onychomycosis treatment of the fungal toe infection. And we haven't seen any update whatsoever from Taro and yet and we are monitoring the clinical trial sides and stuff, but we don't see anything. All we know is the trials are completed, the Phase IIb and no updates have been provided by Taro as yet, and it's a big market opportunity.

Abhay Gandhi
Rahul, I can give you brief right now. So when you see that the study we did, the singles are positive but we are going to do a larger scale of Phase 2b study. And that study is completed only then we can say that any degree of confidence of the products will meet the expected efficacy and safety parameter. The initial results of course are encouraging and we hope for the best. The previous examples practically like Phase IIa, so it helped to design certain parameters in Phase IIb, which is the current one. And right now, we are in the middle of -- sorry, you wanted to ask the question when I am answering.
Unidentified Analyst
No sorry, sorry. Go ahead, please.
Abhay Gandhi
Okay. So, we are in the middle of recruitment of the patients and due to the FDA requirement and the clinical nature of onychomycosis, we do not think study will end before the 2017 calendar year.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Chirag Dagli from HDFC Mutual Fund. Your line is now open.
Chirag Dagli
Yes, thank you for the opportunity. So, there is volume growth of 2% for the full fiscal. Is this from new product launches or is this existing product that you're gaining some share?
Abhay Gandhi
Mix of both actually.
Chirag Dagli
Okay. Meaningfully tilted towards I mean I know the number is too small, but this one product that you launched, has that materially contributed to this volume growth or is it that the existing basis?
Abhay Gandhi
Logically as I said one product will not on total volumes mean an increase of 2% thatâs why I said itâs a mix of both.
Chirag Dagli
Okay, fair point. And sir what would be your tax rate guidance?
Abhay Gandhi
No, we donât give any tax rate guidance?
Chirag Dagli
But this I mean is there some, is there an element of you know unsustainable tax benefit in this?
Mariano Balaguer
I think when you see our announcement in the press release you can see 2016 were some one-off benefit there. We do not provide any tax item but we also believe our sustainability of our current situation.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Sameer Baisiwala from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Sameer Baisiwala
Yes, thanks for the follow-on. Quick question Abhay, is there any thoughts on geographic diversification taking your high class for a portfolio outside of United States and what youâre doing in Canada and Israel?
Abhay Gandhi
Constantly evaluating in a couple of products we are filing in the EU during the course of this year.
Sameer Baisiwala
Okay. But looks like a little incremental, I mean is there a plan to take whatever 50, 100 products to Latin America, Europe or any other geography?
Abhay Gandhi
From what I see right now, it will not be a big bank.
Sameer Baisiwala
Okay. And second question very quickly on that list, looks like the patent is going to expire in 2019. I think it was approved in 2006, if Iâm not wrong. So, the key attraction is the newer version of the product. I mean is that the key motivation behind this deal?
Abhay Gandhi
I think itâs a good product and it fits into our basket and also allows us to get into a little bit of a specialty space and thatâs what the major attraction is. Often, I donât recall which year the patent expires, you may be right its 2019, but I think itâs a product where we donât expect at least at this point in time too much of competition. So, we feel we can do well, fits into our portfolio and gives us the specialty look.
Sameer Baisiwala
Okay, so and youâre referring to the end market product?
Abhay Gandhi
Yes.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Rahul Deshmukh, Private Investor. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. Again, much appreciated. So my second question was regarding this $1.4 billion of cash that Taro is sitting and obviously over the years, you have been very frugal and prudent with your investment approach focusing more on R&D. My question though is now, looking at the U.S. market, yes, definitely the pharma market was highly inflated at some point, but right now with big the companies, pretty much generic big companies and big trouble it must have become very lucrative. So my question for you is, at this point what is your thought process in defining what does it mean that whatever acquisitions you may explore are lucrative because you have been saying that many times that we are monitoring and stuff, but what time that monitoring becomes action?

Abhay Gandhi
I really couldnât understand your question, Rahul.
Unidentified Analyst
Sorry my question was you have $1.4 billion in cash and now a lot of assets out there in the pharma sector have become lucrative from an acquisition perspective just because of the fact that their prices have dropped dramatically. So when now are you going..
Abhay Gandhi
As I said, Rahul, we donât look at what is an asset cost today and is it lucrative in as you say,but it also has to fit into what we are good at doing. Is there a way for us to grow that business? Is that a way to make it profitable, if it is not? So, all those things come into consideration. We would not just go and buy something just because it is available at cheap or at the right kind of valuation. It also has to do with how does it add value to Taro.
Unidentified Analyst
So, then maybe what I can ask you is what kind of areas would add value to current Taro business line? What was therapeutic area?
Abhay Gandhi
I think on the other cause itself this question has been answered, we really arenât a global company. So, the business that we are looking at has to be U.S. focus. It can be in term, it can be in areas which are specialty. And, yes, these are the two basic criteria that we will look at or it has product portfolio which has to be complementary to what we have and we think we can do good with that.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Ram Selvaraju from Rodman & Renshaw. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, there itâs Mitchell on again. I was just wondering, if you guys are open the business development opportunities and the orphan disease and medical esthetics domains, if you guys are actively looking or plan to look?
Abhay Gandhi
Open to both those options, if there is something happy to look at.
Operator
And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That was our last question. I will now hand the floor back to Mr. Coote for closing remarks.
William Coote
Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining us today and taking the time to be on our earnings call. We look forward to speaking to you again after our -- the release of our second quarter earnings. And this concludes our conference. Again, thank you and have a good day.

Fluorouracil (Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.): FDA Package Insert

Fluorouracil: Package Insert and Label InformationBy Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. | Last revised: 18 August 2010
FLUOROURACIL- fluorouracil creamTaro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. FOR TOPICAL USE ONLYNOT FOR OPHTHALMIC, ORAL, OR INTRAVAGINAL USE.
DESCRIPTIONFluorouracil Topical Cream is a topical preparation containing the fluorinated pyrimidine 5-fluorouracil, an antineoplastic antimetabolite.
Fluorouracil Topical Cream contains 5% w/w of Fluorouracil USP in a cream base consisting of methylparaben, polysorbate 60, propylene glycol, propylparaben, purified water, stearyl alcohol and white petrolatum.
Chemically, fluorouracil is 5-fluoro-2,4(1H ,3H)-pyrimidinedione. It is a white to practically white, crystalline powder which is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol. One gram of fluorouracil is soluble in 100 mL of propylene glycol. The molecular weight of 5-fluorouracil is 130.08 and the structural formula is:
Chemical Structure
    
      CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY



There is evidence that the metabolism of fluorouracil in the anabolic pathway blocks the methylation reaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid. In this manner fluorouracil interferes with the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and to a lesser extent inhibits the formation of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Since DNA and RNA are essential for cell division and growth, the effect of fluorouracil may be to create a thymine deficiency which provokes unbalanced growth and death of the cell. The effects of DNA and RNA deprivation are most marked on those cells which grow more rapidly and take up fluorouracil at a more rapid rate. The catabolic metabolism of fluorouracil results in degradation products (eg, CO2 , urea, Î±-fluoro-Î²-alanine) which are inactive.
Systemic absorption studies of topically applied fluorouracil have been performed on patients with actinic keratoses using tracer amounts of 14 C-labeled fluorouracil added to a 5% preparation. All patients had been receiving nonlabeled fluorouracil until the peak of the inflammatory reaction occurred (2 to 3 weeks), ensuring that the time of maximum absorption was used for measurement. One gram of labeled preparation was applied to the entire face and neck and left in place for 12 hours. Urine samples were collected. At the end of 3 days, the total recovery ranged between 0.48% and 0.94% with an average of 0.76%, indicating that approximately 5.98% of the topical dose was absorbed systemically. If applied twice daily, this would indicate systemic absorption of topical fluorouracil to be in the range of 5 to 6 mg per daily dose of 100 mg. In an additional study, negligible amounts of labeled material were found in plasma, urine and expired CO2 after 3 days of treatment with topically applied 14 C-labeled fluorouracil.
Fluorouracil Indications and UsageFluorouracil is recommended for the topical treatment of multiple actinic or solar keratoses. In the 5% strength it is also useful in the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinomas when conventional methods are impractical, such as with multiple lesions or difficult treatment sites. Safety and efficacy in other indications have not been established.
The diagnosis should be established prior to treatment, since this method has not been proven effective in other types of basal cell carcinomas. With isolated, easily accessible basal cell carcinomas, surgery is preferred since success with such lesions is almost 100%. The success rate with Fluorouracil Cream and Solution is approximately 93%, based on 113 lesions in 54 patients. Twenty-five lesions treated with the solution produced 1 failure and 88 lesions treated with the cream produced 7 failures.
CONTRAINDICATIONSFluorouracil may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with either the topical or the parenteral forms of fluorouracil. One birth defect (cleft lip and palate) has been reported in the newborn of a patient using Fluorouracil as recommended. One birth defect (ventricular septal defect) and cases of miscarriage have been reported when Fluorouracil was applied to mucous membrane areas. Multiple birth defects have been reported in a fetus of a patient treated with intravenous fluorouracil.
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Fluorouracil. Fluorouracil administered parenterally has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats, and hamsters when given at doses equivalent to the usual human intravenous dose; however, the amount of fluorouracil absorbed systemically after topical administration to actinic keratoses is minimal (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Fluorouracil exhibited maximum teratogenicity when given to mice as single intraperitoneal injections of 10 to 40 mg/kg on Day 10 or 12 of gestation. Similarly, intraperitoneal doses of 12 to 37 mg/kg given to rats between Days 9 and 12 of gestation and intramuscular doses of 3 to 9 mg/kg given to hamsters between Days 8 and 11 of gestation were teratogenic and/or embryotoxic (ie, resulted in increased resorptions or embryolethality). In monkeys, divided doses of 40 mg/kg given between Days 20 and 24 of gestation were not teratogenic. Doses higher than 40 mg/kg resulted in abortion.
Fluorouracil should not be used in patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme deficiency. A large percentage of fluorouracil is catabolized by the DPD enzyme. DPD enzyme deficiency can result in shunting of fluorouracil to the anabolic pathway, leading to cytotoxic activity and potential toxicities.
 Fluorouracil is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant during therapy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while using this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. 
 Fluorouracil is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its components. 
WARNINGS Application to mucous membranes should be avoided due to the possibility of local inflammation and ulceration. Additionally, cases of miscarriage and a birth defect (ventricular septal defect) have been reported when Fluorouracil was applied to mucous membrane areas during pregnancy. 
Occlusion of the skin with resultant hydration has been shown to increase percutaneous penetration of several topical preparations. If any occlusive dressing is used in treatment of basal cell carcinoma, there may be an increase in the severity of inflammatory reactions in the adjacent normal skin. A porous gauze dressing may be applied for cosmetic reasons without increase in reaction.
Exposure to ultraviolet rays should be minimized during and immediately following treatment with Fluorouracil because the intensity of the reaction may be increased.
Patients should discontinue therapy with Fluorouracil if symptoms of DPD enzyme deficiency develop (see CONTRAINDICATIONS section).
Rarely, life-threatening toxicities such as stomatitis, diarrhea, neutropenia, and neurotoxicity have been reported with intravenous administration of fluorouracil in patients with DPD enzyme deficiency. One case of life- threatening systemic toxicity has been reported with the topical use of Fluorouracil in a patient with DPD enzyme deficiency. Symptoms included severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and chills. Physical examination revealed stomatitis, erythematous skin rash, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, inflammation of the esophagus, stomach, and small bowel. Although this case was observed with 5% fluorouracil cream, it is unknown whether patients with profound DPD enzyme deficiency would develop systemic toxicity with lower concentrations of topically applied fluorouracil.
PRECAUTIONS General There is a possibility of increased absorption through ulcerated or inflamed skin.
Information for Patients Patients should be forewarned that the reaction in the treated areas may be unsightly during therapy and, usually, for several weeks following cessation of therapy. Patients should be instructed to avoid exposure to ultraviolet rays during and immediately following treatment with Fluorouracil because the intensity of the reaction may be increased. If Fluorouracil is applied with the fingers, the hands should be washed immediately afterward. Fluorouracil should not be applied on the eyelids or directly into the eyes, nose or mouth because irritation may occur.
Laboratory Tests Solar keratoses which do not respond should be biopsied to confirm the diagnosis. Follow-up biopsies should be performed as indicated in the management of superficial basal cell carcinoma.
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Adequate long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted with fluorouracil. Studies with the active ingredient of Fluorouracil, 5-fluorouracil, have shown positive effects in in vitro tests for mutagenicity and on impairment of fertility.
5-Fluorouracil was positive in three in vitro cell neoplastic transformation assays. In the C3H/10T1/2 clone 8 mouse embryo cell system, the resulting morphologically transformed cells formed tumors when inoculated into immunosuppressed syngeneic mice.
While no evidence for mutagenic activity was observed in the Ames test (3 studies), fluorouracil has been shown to be mutagenic in the survival count rec-assay with Bacillus subtilis and in the Drosophila wing-hair spot test. Fluorouracil produced petite mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and was positive in the micronucleus test (bone marrow cells of male mice).
Fluorouracil was clastogenic in vitro (ie, chromatid gaps, breaks and exchanges) in Chinese hamster fibroblasts at concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 Âµg/mL and has been shown to increase sister chromatid exchange in vitro in human lymphocytes. In addition, 5-fluorouracil has been reported to produce an increase in numerical and structural chromosome aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes of patients treated with this product.
Doses of 125 to 250 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally, have been shown to induce chromosomal aberrations and changes in chromosome organization of spermatogonia in rats. Spermatogonial differentiation was also inhibited by fluorouracil, resulting in transient infertility. However, in studies with a strain of mouse which is sensitive to the induction of sperm head abnormalities after exposure to a range of chemical mutagens and carcinogens, fluorouracil was inactive at oral doses of 5 to 80 mg/kg/day. In female rats, fluorouracil administered intraperitoneally at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg during the preovulatory phase of oogenesis significantly reduced the incidence of fertile matings, delayed the development of preimplantation and postimplantation embryos, increased the incidence of preimplantation lethality and induced chromosomal anomalies in these embryos. Single dose intravenous and intraperitoneal injections of 5-fluorouracil have been reported to kill differentiated spermatogonia and spermatocytes (at 500 mg/kg) and to produce abnormalities in spermatids (at 50 mg/kg) in mice.
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category X See CONTRAINDICATIONS section.
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because there is some systemic absorption of fluorouracil after topical administration (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY), because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue use of the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.
Adverse Reactions to FluorouracilThe most frequent adverse reactions to Fluorouracil occur locally and are often related to an extension of the pharmacological activity of the drug. These include burning, crusting, allergic contact dermatitis, erosions, erythema, hyperpigmentation, irritation, pain, photosensitivity, pruritus, scarring, rash, soreness and ulceration. Ulcerations, other local reactions, cases of miscarriage and a birth defect (ventricular septal defect) have been reported when Fluorouracil was applied to mucous membrane areas. Leukocytosis is the most frequent hematological side effect.
Although a causal relationship is remote, other adverse reactions which have been reported infrequently are:
Central Nervous System: Emotional upset, insomnia, irritability.
Gastrointestinal: Medicinal taste, stomatitis.
Hematological: Eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, toxic granulation.
Integumentary: Alopecia, blistering, bullous pemphigoid, discomfort, ichthyosis, scaling, suppuration, swelling, telangiectasia, tenderness, urticaria, skin rash.
Special Senses: Conjunctival reaction, corneal reaction, lacrimation, nasal irritation.
Miscellaneous: Herpes simplex.
OVERDOSAGEThere have been no reports of overdosage with Fluorouracil.
The oral LD50 for the 5% topical cream was 234 mg/kg in rats and 39 mg/kg in dogs. These doses represented 11.7 and 1.95 mg/kg of fluorouracil, respectively. Studies with a 5% topical solution yielded an oral LD50 of 214 mg/kg in rats and 28.5 mg/kg in dogs, corresponding to 10.7 and 1.43 mg/kg of fluorouracil, respectively. The topical application of the 5% cream to rats yielded an LD50 of greater than 500 mg/kg.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATIONWhen Fluorouracil is applied to a lesion, a response occurs with the following sequence: erythema, usually followed by vesiculation, desquamation, erosion and reepithelialization.
Fluorouracil should be applied preferably with a nonmetal applicator or suitable glove. If Fluorouracil is applied with the fingers, the hands should be washed immediately afterward.
Actinic or Solar Keratosis Apply cream twice daily in an amount sufficient to cover the lesions. Medication should be continued until the inflammatory response reaches the erosion stage, at which time use of the drug should be terminated. The usual duration of therapy is from 2 to 4 weeks. Complete healing of the lesions may not be evident for 1 to 2 months following cessation of Fluorouracil therapy.
Superficial Basal Cell Carcinomas Only the 5% strength is recommended. Apply cream twice daily in an amount sufficient to cover the lesions. Treatment should be continued for at least 3 to 6 weeks.

Operations[edit]
The company's operations are managed in three sub-companies, including Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Taro Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Taro U.S.A. The latter two are its subsidiaries.[4]
History[edit]
Taro (the name of the company was derived from the Hebrew words for "pharmaceutical industry") was founded in 1950 by a team of pharmacists and physicians in Haifa, Israel. In 1952 it acquired by United States based investors and began production and marketing Rokal and Rokacet pain relievers.[5]
In 1957, Taro acquired licenses to produce third-party products for the Israeli market and launched production of its first three licensed products, Coumadin, also known under its generic name, Warfarin, Percodan and Percocet.[5]
In 1960, Taro begins production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).[5]
Taro had an initial public offering in 1961, listing its stock on the over-the-counter market in the United States. At the beginning of the 1980s Taro became interested in moving into the North American market, following the impending opening of the U.S. generics market through the Hatch-Waxman Act, that was passed in 1984 and provided a framework for the production and marketing of off-patent drugs in the United States. In preparation for this opening, Taro shifted its listing to the NASDAQ stock index in 1982.[5]
In 1984, Taro acquired Canada-based K-Line Pharmaceuticals. K-Line specialized in generic topical medications for dermatological applications. This niche market then became Taro's primary focus in the North American market.
Acquisition by Sun Pharmaceuticals[edit]
In 2009, the company sued India's Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. For failing to disclose that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had effectively closed down Sun's US subsidiary, in their legal battle over Taro's unilateral cancellation of the takeover contract by Sun.
In 2013, they mutually agreed to terminate their merger agreement.[6]
FDA warnings[edit]
In February 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a warning letter to Taro Pharmaceuticals pointing out some issues relating to the company's manufacturing facility in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. The manufacture of non-sterile cream an ointment finished products was inspected to be adulterated and did not conform good manufacturing practices.[7]
In February 2011, Taro Pharmaceuticals resolved the warning letters after a re-inspection from FDA which showed an acceptable regulatory status.[8]

Operations[edit]
The company's operations are managed in three sub-companies, including Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Taro Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Taro U.S.A. The latter two are its subsidiaries.[4]
History[edit]
Taro (the name of the company was derived from the Hebrew words for "pharmaceutical industry") was founded in 1950 by a team of pharmacists and physicians in Haifa, Israel. In 1952 it acquired by United States based investors and began production and marketing Rokal and Rokacet pain relievers.[5]
In 1957, Taro acquired licenses to produce third-party products for the Israeli market and launched production of its first three licensed products, Coumadin, also known under its generic name, Warfarin, Percodan and Percocet.[5]
In 1960, Taro begins production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).[5]
Taro had an initial public offering in 1961, listing its stock on the over-the-counter market in the United States. At the beginning of the 1980s Taro became interested in moving into the North American market, following the impending opening of the U.S. generics market through the Hatch-Waxman Act, that was passed in 1984 and provided a framework for the production and marketing of off-patent drugs in the United States. In preparation for this opening, Taro shifted its listing to the NASDAQ stock index in 1982.[5]
In 1984, Taro acquired Canada-based K-Line Pharmaceuticals. K-Line specialized in generic topical medications for dermatological applications. This niche market then became Taro's primary focus in the North American market.
Acquisition by Sun Pharmaceuticals[edit]
In 2009, the company sued India's Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. For failing to disclose that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had effectively closed down Sun's US subsidiary, in their legal battle over Taro's unilateral cancellation of the takeover contract by Sun.
In 2013, they mutually agreed to terminate their merger agreement.[6]
FDA warnings[edit]
In February 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a warning letter to Taro Pharmaceuticals pointing out some issues relating to the company's manufacturing facility in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. The manufacture of non-sterile cream an ointment finished products was inspected to be adulterated and did not conform good manufacturing practices.[7]
In February 2011, Taro Pharmaceuticals resolved the warning letters after a re-inspection from FDA which showed an acceptable regulatory status.[8]
