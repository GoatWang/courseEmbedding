		The Brazilian native made a name for herself heading up Procter and Gamble's feminine care division, including the Always and Tampax brands. Introduced edgy campaigns to de-euphemize menstrual products; Web site BeingGirl.com won a Gold Lion at Cannes in 2004. One of P&G's few leaders from outside the fold; she began her career at competitors SC Johnson and Johnson & Johnson. Healey rose to group president of feminine and health care in 2007 in a company-wide shakeup to streamline P&G's global operations. Since then, her group's stock has climbed 17.5%. —Amina Khan

          Marketing veteran to support marketing intelligence leader during next phase of growth

SAN MATEO, Calif., March 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Beckon, the leader in marketing intelligence software, today announced the appointment of former Procter & Gamble Co. (P&G) Group President Melanie Healey to its board of directors. Ms. Healey, who also sits on the board of directors at Target, Verizon and Urban Sitter, brings more than 25 years of marketing and business leadership experience at P&G, the largest advertiser in the world, to Beckon's board as she helps guide the company through its next phase of growth. 








"As a lifelong marketer, I spent the bulk of my career investing large and complex marketing budgets, and it was exceedingly frustrating not to have integrated visibility and real-time, actionable insight into marketing performance," said Ms. Healey. "There were plenty of data warehouse projects and business intelligence tools available, but they never gave me the performance insight and agility I needed to optimize my marketing effectiveness and efficiency. Beckon is the only solution taking a marketing-specific perspective, and as soon as we were introduced, I was incredibly impressed with the leadership and the product and knew I wanted to get involved."
"Melanie is a visionary leader and it's an honor to welcome her to our board," said Beckon CEO Jennifer Zeszut. "Yes, she's a world-renowned marketer, having led and grown some of the most iconic brands on the planet. But she's a business leader first and foremost. Like Beckon, she sees smart marketing as the growth engine for a business. In increasingly competitive and noisy markets, using data to do more with less—and at scale—is more than a 'nice to have,' it's a strategic competitive advantage. Melanie gets that better than anyone." 
An experienced executive officer, Ms. Healey has focused her career on leading multinationals (P&G, S.C. Johnson & Son and Johnson & Johnson) in Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and the US. During her 25-year tenure at P&G, she most recently served as Group President, North America, where she ran P&G's overall operations in the company's largest market. Prior to that she was Group President for one of their largest sectors (health care, feminine care and adult care).  Before P&G, Ms. Healey held positions at S.C. Johnson & Son and Johnson & Johnson for seven years. She was named one of Fortune magazine's 50 Most Powerful Women in Business for eight consecutive years, and was also included in Forbes' 100 Most Powerful Women and Advertising Age's Most Influential Women in Advertising lists. 
To join the conversation, follow Beckon on Twitter at @BeckonInc or visit the Beckon blog.

Local knowledge: Process expertise: Responsiveness: Negotiation skills:  As a first-time homeowner, I was mostly clueless and dependent upon others' knowledge in the home buying process. Emotionally I was also anxious. I knew that anyone who took me on as a client would have to be very patient and knowledgeable. The process, to me, was really not that different from  picking a husband. I really wanted to find something that I liked and just “me.” As nearly a year went by, I went through three different real-estate agents who were all recommended by friends/colleagues, but there were issues after issues. I was becoming really discouraged. It all changed when I met Melanie. She said to me, “This will be an entirely different experience for you” about which I was obviously skeptical at first. Over the next few months, I was shown places that met my needs more than all the previous ones I had been shown by three other agents who also had claimed they knew the areas well. How come I had never seen these places until I met Melanie? I was mostly impressed by Melanie’s professionalism and responsiveness. Melanie is well spoken and well mannered. She comes across as a real professional woman. I was not impressed when the previous agents showed up in sneakers, without being prepared, taking calls and talking on the phone for a long time in the middle of showing me properties, without handshakes in the first meeting, looking tired and so on. I remembered saying to Melanie, “Can just about anyone become an agent?” Melanie is very personable. She is always smiling and is always helpful. Most importantly, she is consistently responsive. Even in the event of her absence, she would find a way to help me or send someone else capable to help. Patience is a virtue. Melanie was always patient throughout the course of time, when I had so many questions and needs for beginner’s education on home buying. She did it with a smile and a friendship! She continued to reach out after I settled into my new place she had helped me find! I know how lucky I was to have her as a big part of my first home buying experience. She definitely has a wealth of knowledge about the area and understands her clients’ needs. I will continue to work with her in the future and refer her to anyone who is looking for a home!More Less         Highly likely to recommend     01/04/2017 -  Jared Neely    Written about  Melanie Healey   on 01/04/2017 Bought a Single Family home in 2016 for approximately $500K in Westport, CT.   Local knowledge: Process expertise: Responsiveness: Negotiation skills:  The overall buying experience with Melanie was phenomenal and her effort and responsiveness was more than I could have asked for.  Melanie's market insight arms the buyer with the important information needed for making a significant investment in real estate; her recommendations for enhancing and  adding value to the property provide further support for the investment; finally, Melanie's local connections with everyone from efficient lenders to tradespeople assist the buyer with closing and executing on those value-creation projects.  Melanie has the personality to build immediate rapport with clients and the work ethic and expertise to deliver a favorable result.  I would trust Melanie in both the buying and selling process and know she has my interests top of mind.More Less         Highly likely to recommend     01/04/2017 -  rmercede    Written about  Melanie Healey   on 01/04/2017 Sold a Condo home in 2016 for approximately $475K in Springdale, Stamford, CT.   Local knowledge: Process expertise: Responsiveness: Negotiation skills:  Melanie was very supportive and knowledgeable in helping me sell my condo. She knew the local market, was extremely responsive and I always felt that she was always looking out for my needs. I would highly recommend her.        Highly likely to recommend     11/15/2014 -  sylviasteinback    Written about  Melanie Healey   on 11/15/2014 Bought a Single Family home in 2012 for approximately $775K in North Stamford, Stamford, CT.   Local knowledge: Process expertise: Responsiveness: Negotiation skills:  Melanie represented us in a lease, corporate housing, and a home purchase.  All were very smooth transactions because of her responsiveness, organizational skills and knowledge of the area and process. We moved here from California and Europe,  where the systems are extremely different than CT.  We  even closed escrow on a jumbo FHA in21 calendar days, which Iincluded the Christmas and MLK holidays.More Less         Highly likely to recommend     08/04/2014 -  perlman becca    Written about  Melanie Healey   on 08/04/2014 Sold a Condo home in 2014 in Glenbrook, Stamford, CT.   Local knowledge: Process expertise: Responsiveness: Negotiation skills:  Melanie was wonderful to work with and I highly recommend her.  She was knowledgeable about our neighborhood, home staging, and negotiating.  She was extremely responsive and always made us feel like a priority, even though we were only selling a condo.  After we negotiated our contract, she  managed all of the required repairs, often taking care of them for us while we were at work.  She was reassuring and encouraging throughout a stressful process and I'm so glad we chose her to list our condo.  I highly recommend Melanie and her team at New Bridge Properties.More Less       1 2 Next  Service AreasCos Cob, Greenwich, CTDarien, CTFairfield county, CTGreenwich, CTNorwalk, CTOld Greenwich, Greenwich, CTStamford, CT Print page  Contact  This Team Contact team Submitting contact...Professional Information08/28/2009Melanie HealeyRealtorNewbridge PropertiesAddress:Newbridge Properties225 Bedford St.Stamford, CT  06901Phone:(203) 437-4119Websites:Website, Screen name:Melanie HealeyMember since:08/28/2009Licenses:0795240 (Real Estate Sales)

P&G's Mel Healey on why not having it all is liberating | Fortune.comMPWSearchSearchTelecommunicationsSprint Seeks Merger with Charter Communications: ReportFoxconnEnvironmental Regulations Would Be Waived For Planned Foxconn PlantCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDGovernmentHours After North Korea Missile Launch, Trump Reassigns Homeland Security ChiefMelanie Healey Proctor & GambleCareersP&G’s Mel Healey on why not having it all is liberatingJennifer ReingoldOct 30, 2014On October 22, Melanie Healey, Procter & Gamble's (pg) group president for North America and No. 18 on Fortune's 2014 ranking of the Most Powerful Women in Business, announced her retirement from the company, effective next June. The news, which came as part of an overall restructuring announcement by CEO A.G. Lafley, surprised many, who thought that Healey had a good shot at succeeding Lafley one day.But the company is undergoing dramatic change, and Healey, who has struggled to get the once-dynamic North America region back on track, has decided to do something different (retirement, at P&G, is allowed after 25 years at the company, which Healey has completed. But she's only 53, so don't expect to see her in a rocking chair anytime soon).In an email exchange with Fortune, the Brazilian executive mused on what that might be. "I firmly believe that happiness and success is not just about reaching a dream destination, but more importantly, it's about enjoying the journey," she says. "The past 25 years at P&G have been an amazing journey. Now, it's time for something different."She says she's considering everything from writing a book to working in a startup, but notes that it is impossible to figure out what's next when you're in such an intense job. "There is virtually no time to step back, reflect and consider what else you could choose to do."I asked Healey to offer some advice for professional women based on her long career. She directed me to a speech she gave to her alma mater, the University of Richmond, in late October, entitled "Choose to Live a Life that Matters." There were two aspects that seemed particularly relevant.First was the notion that authentic leadership comes from within. "Looking at yourself in the mirror and knowing you are accountable first and foremost to yourself is a choice," she said. "And when you get really clear about who you are, this understanding will make you a more authentic leader." For women in particular, who often feel pressured to act like leaders they see around them rather than finding their own path, this is very good advice. And as someone who has watched Healey in action for years, I can vouch for her own authenticity.The second bit of advice surprised me. "The choice not to have it all, far from being defeatist, is extremely liberating," she said. "Slugging through a decade of work but losing touch with your family and friends or with your community creates its own sense of failure," she wrote.This from a woman with a $32 billion P&L, who spends months a year on the road and yet has managed to maintain a longterm marriage and raise two kids (both currently in college)?But when I thought about it for a while, I realized that what she was saying was profound enough to turn the whole "Lean In" debate on its head. You can have all of what YOU want, she is saying. You just can't have everything that anyone wants—or you can try, but you won't be happy.Here's hoping Healey's next chapter gives her what she wants (but not all).“From the MPW Co-chairs” is a series where the editors who oversee the Fortune Most Powerful Women brand share their insights about women leaders.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.
