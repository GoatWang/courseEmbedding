ETFs Could Save Virtus Investment Partners - Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRTS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»ETFs Could Save Virtus Investment PartnersJan.19.16 | About: Virtus Investment (VRTS) FX Metrix, LLC Newsletter provider, research analyst, ETF investing, currenciesFX Metrix, LLCSummaryAUM for VRTS has been declining for quarters.Along with Institutional Accounts, the ETFs division was the only other VRTS division with net AUM inflows. Mutual funds etc. all posted declines in AUM.Given recent trajectory of the ETF industry and VRTS' steady pipeline of ETF launches, VRTS could be a turnaround story.Background Established asset manager as well as up-and-comer in the ETF world, Virtus Investment Partners (NASDAQ: VRTS) is in our spotlight. 

 VRTS is a small cap. investment management company, with a market cap. of approximately $790 million and an overall AUM of just under $50 billion. AUM for VRTS has been declining for quarters, and share prices have reflected this. However, there may be one silver lining to VRTS: ETFs. As detailed below, VRTS involvement in the ETF landscape could stop the bleeding as far as AUM is concerned. AUM Decline for VRTS   Quarter Ending VRTS AUM (billions)   09/30/2014 $59.6   12/31/2014 $56.7   03/31/2015 $54.8   06/30/2015 $52.4   09/30/2015 $47.9   We would like to note there are only two possible reasons for fluctuations in AUM: inflows/outflows and performance of the assets. As we see above, there are quarter-over-quarter declines in AUM. As for the most recent quarter, VRTS claims that $1.6 billion of the drop in AUM was attributable to net flows, and the other 2.7 billion attributable to performance. Along with Institutional Accounts, the ETFs division was the only other VRTS division with net AUM inflows.  As for VRTS' mutual funds and other offerings, they had net outflows. This is a story that we will start to see more of as asset managers with offerings of yesteryear will go by the wayside unless they can jump on board this train. ETF industry net inflows overall are up year, after year. Not only are ETFs an expanding industry, it is a lucrative one.
 ETF Involvement On January 26, 2015, it was announced that Virtus would acquire a majority stake in ETF Issuer Solutions, along with affiliated companies ETF Distributors, and Etfis Captial. This established Virtus as a player in the ETF issuer market.  ETF Issuer Solutions Inc: "Comprehensive services platform designed specifically to build, operate, and market exchange-traded funds" ETF Distributors LLC: ETF distribution firm and licensed Broker-Dealer Etfis Capital: ETF advisor to 3 funds and registered RIA  ETF Issuer Solutions, and its affiliated companies have helped 7 total ETFs launch so far. It is important to note that despite Etfis Capital being listed as advisor to the funds, the do not fully operate these funds. Rather, they partner with sub-advisors to manage the funds. ETF Distributors LLC is, however, the distributor for the funds. Below is a table of the funds, in chronological order of launch date.   Ticker Launch Date AUM (millions) Asset Class Sub-Advisor Partner Fund Name  Before VRTS Acquisition  InfraCap MLP ETF (NYSEARCA:AMZA) 10/07/14 $14.53 Equities Infrastructure Capital Advisors InfraCap MLP Fund   BioShares Biotechnology Products ETF (NASDAQ:BBP) 12/17/14 $17.33 Equities LifeSci Index Partners BioShares Biotechnology Products Fund   BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials ETF (NASDAQ:BBC) 12/16/14 $16.65 Equities LifeSci Index Partners BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials Fund  After VRTS Acquisition  Tuttle Tactical Management U.S. Core ETF (NASDAQ:TUTT) 02/25/15 $78.32 Multiple Tuttle Tactical Management, The Tuttle Tactical Management U.S. Core Fund   Tuttle Tactical Management Multi-Strategy Income ETF (NASDAQ:TUTI) 06/10/15 $32.48 Multiple Tuttle Tactical Management The Tuttle Tactical Management Multi-Strategy Income Fund   Virtus Newfleet Multi-Sector Unconstrained Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:NFLT) 08/11/15 $168.18 Bonds Newfleet Asset Management Newfleet Multi-Sector Unconstrained Bond Fund   Reaves Utilities ETF (NASDAQ:UTES) 09/23/15 $5.26 Equities Reaves Asset Management Reaves Utility Income Fund   Poor Stock Performance VRTS shares have been getting battered since the stock's all-time high on May 8, 3013 at $239.00. VRTS shares are currently down over 60% compared to previously May '13 highs. 

 VRTS data by YCharts Value Comparison VRTS is trading with a P/E of 17.94, which sparked us to make a brief valuation comparison to an ETF sponsorship titan with nearly identical AUM figures: WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF). One of our favorites, WisdomTree currently trades at a higher P/E of 22.69. The two companies have far different market caps despite nearly identical AUMs.     NASDAQ:VRTS NASDAQ:WETF   Market Capitalization (millions) $830.42 $1,680.00   P/E 17.94 22.69   AUM (billions) $47.90 $47.53   # ETF Offerings 7 92   # Mutual Fund Offerings 60 0   Dividend Yield 1.93% 2.82%   Conclusion Given the trajectory of the ETF industry, and VRTS' history of steady ETF launches, we would expect VRTS to launch many more ETFs in 2016. VRTS' investment in ETF Issuer Solutions might be what it needed to stop the firms AUM hemorrhaging saving this asset manager. Everyone loves a turnaround story, and looking into the future, VRTS could be one. We look forward to keeping track as this all unfolds.

Fidelity takes the top spot, with Interactive Brokers and TD Ameritrade right on its heels

 Biography




 




March 18, 2017


The bull market is on sale for online brokerage customers. In the run-up to our 22nd annual ranking of Barron’s Best Online Brokers, two developments topped all others: The three major indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the Nasdaq Composite—all set record highs, and six brokers slashed commissions and other fees. At the 16 brokers we reviewed this year, the average monthly cost of trading for an occasional investor had fallen 25% since early 2016, to $47.51 from $63.45. That means...

HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:   VRTS), which operates a multi-manager asset management business, today announced an agreement to acquire a majority interest in ETF Issuer Solutions (ETFis), a New York City-based company that operates a platform for listing, operating, and distributing exchange-traded funds. The transaction will provide Virtus with manufacturing capabilities for both active and passive ETFs, adding to its broad product line-up.
ETFis, founded in 2012, recently introduced the industry's first actively managed ETF investing exclusively in master limited partnerships, the InfraCap MLP ETF (NYSE:   AMZA)1. It currently manages two other ETFs and has seven additional ETFs in registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All of the company's ETFs are managed by external subadvisers.
"There is growing interest among financial advisors and investors to use exchange-traded funds in their retail and institutional portfolios because of the tax efficiency and liquidity benefits that ETFs offer," said George R. Aylward, president and chief executive officer of Virtus. "The ETFis business model is similar to the Virtus approach of offering investors access to strategies of boutique managers. This partnership with ETFis will expand our product capabilities and allow us to offer compelling investment strategies in an actively managed ETF format."
ETFis will become a Virtus affiliate and continue to operate as a multi-manager ETF platform, providing investors access to differentiated investment capabilities from select subadvisers. The company is led by its co-founders, Matthew B. Brown, who manages operations and technology capabilities, and William J. Smalley, head of product strategy and management.
"We developed ETF Issuer Solutions to provide a technology-driven, ETF-specific platform that offers significant cost and operational efficiencies. The partnership with Virtus gives us the resources and support to execute on our long-term vision of building a leading multi-manager ETF platform," said Smalley. "We are excited to have the opportunity to combine our offerings with Virtus' extensive distribution capabilities to create a compelling alternative for asset managers that want to make their actively managed strategies available in an exchange-traded fund structure."
The Newfleet Multi-Sector Unconstrained Bond ETF2 will be the first new offering managed by a Virtus affiliate added to the ETFis platform. The fund will leverage the Newfleet Asset Management team's broad experience in multi-sector fixed-income investing in a strategy that will have the flexibility to capitalize on opportunities across all sectors of the bond markets, including evolving, specialized, and out-of-favor sectors, as it seeks to deliver relatively high income and an attractive total return. A registration statement for the fund has been filed with the SEC. 
The transaction is expected to close in March. Terms were not disclosed. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP acted as legal advisor to Virtus. Haynes & Boone LLP acted as legal advisor to ETFis.
About ETF Issuer Solutions Inc.
ETF Issuer Solutions Inc. offers a comprehensive services platform designed specifically to build, operate, and market exchange-traded funds. Its affiliated companies include ETF Distributors LLC (Member: FINRA), a broker-dealer that operationally administers and actively distributes exchange traded funds; and Etfis Capital, an SEC-registered investment advisor that is the adviser to three ETFs: InfraCap MLP ETF (NYSE:   AMZA), subadvised by Infrastructure Capital Advisors, LLC; and BioShares Biotechnology Products Fund (NASDAQ:   BBP) and BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials Fund (NASDAQ:   BBC), both sub-advised by LifeSci Index Partners, LLC. 
About Virtus Investment Partners

Virtus offers access to a variety of investment styles across multiple disciplines to meet a wide array of investor needs, and provides products and services through affiliated managers and select subadvisers, each with a distinct investment style, autonomous investment process and individual brand.

Forward-Looking Information
This press release contains statements that are, or may be considered to be, forward-looking statements. All statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs or expectations, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may be identified by such forward-looking terminology as "expect," "estimate," "plan," "intend," "believe," "anticipate," "may," "will," "should," "could," "continue," "project," or similar statements or variations of such terms. Our forward-looking statements are based on a series of expectations, assumptions and projections about our company, are not guarantees of future results or performance, and involve substantial risks and uncertainty as described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), which are available on our website at www.virtus.com under "Investor Relations." All of our forward-looking statements are as of the date of this release only. The company can give no assurance that such expectations or forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. Actual results may differ materially. You are urged to carefully consider all such factors.
1 Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the Funds carefully before investing. Contact ETF Distributors LLC at 1-888-383-4184 or visit www.infracapmlp.com or www.bioshares.com to obtain a prospectus which contains this and other information about the Funds. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risks; therefore you may lose money by investing in the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be successful in meeting its investment objective. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Narrowly focused investments typically exhibit higher volatility. The Fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio. In managing the Fund's investment portfolio, the sub-adviser will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result. There can be no guarantee that the Fund will meet its investment objectives.
2 A registration statement relating to the Newfleet Unconstrained Multi-Sector Bond ETF has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund may not be sold until the registration statement becomes effective. Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. The prospectus, when available, will contain this information.
The Funds are distributed by ETF Distributors LLC.

Virtus ETF Solutions Launches Actively Managed ETF With Cumberland Advisors
Virtus Cumberland Municipal Bond ETF Launches on NYSE as 'CUMB'




NEW YORK, Jan. 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Virtus ETF Solutions, an affiliate of Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ: VRTS) has partnered with Cumberland Advisors to introduce the Virtus Cumberland Municipal Bond ETF (NYSE Arca: CUMB). 



The Virtus Cumberland Municipal Bond ETF seeks to maximize total return of income and capital appreciation by investing in a basket of municipal bonds. By actively managing the portfolio, Cumberland is able to allocate across local, state and federal bonds, placing an emphasis on quality issues and the ability to favor shorter maturities should interest rates rise.
"We believe the current market offers great value in municipal bonds, particularly in intermediate and longer maturity bonds, especially when compared to traditional valuations versus US Treasuries," said David Kotok, Cumberland Advisors chief investment officer and portfolio manager. "The Virtus Cumberland Municipal Bond ETF will give investors the opportunity to obtain total return and diversification in the municipal bond market while capitalizing on Cumberland's 40 years of experience in bond management."
The strategy emphasizes both shorter-term and longer-term bonds, which helps the fund benefit from the steepness of the municipal yield curve and capitalize from moves in the municipal bond yield curve and municipal "centric" events. 
Kotok leads the management of CUMB along with John Mousseau, CFA, Director of Fixed Income and Portfolio Manager for Cumberland Advisors.
"We are very excited to join Virtus ETF Solutions in launching the Cumberland Municipal Bond ETF and opening the next chapter in our firm's history," Kotok added. "This ETF is a great opportunity for investors to participate in Cumberland's total return municipal bond management style within the affordable structure of an exchange traded fund."
CUMB is Cumberland's first ETF launched in conjunction with Virtus ETF Solutions, a multi-manager ETF sponsor. 
"We're thrilled to add CUMB to our growing ETF family, and we believe municipal bonds is an asset class that is best managed by a blue chip sector specialist like Cumberland Advisors," said William Smalley, executive managing director of Virtus ETF Solutions. "We have taken a thoughtful approach to new product origination and will continue to leverage best-of-breed investment managers as we bolster our suite of alpha-seeking ETF solutions."

About Virtus Investment PartnersVirtus Investment Partners (NASDAQ: VRTS) is a distinctive partnership of boutique investment managers singularly committed to the long-term success of individual and institutional investors. The company provides investment management products and services through its affiliated managers and select subadvisers, each with a distinct investment style, autonomous investment process and individual brand.

Additional information can be found at virtus.com.
The fund is an exchange-traded fund ("ETF"). The "net asset value" (NAV) of the fund is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV of the fund is not necessarily the same as its intraday trading value. Fund investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV because shares of ETFs such as the fund are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Thus, shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
Fund Risks:Credit & Interest: Debt securities are subject to various risks, the most prominent of which are credit and interest rate risk. The issuer of a debt security may fail to make interest and/or principal payments. Values of debt securities may rise or fall in response to changes in interest rates, and this risk may be enhanced with longer-term maturities. Municipal Market: Events negatively impacting a municipal security, or the municipal bond market in general, may cause the fund to decrease in value. State & AMT Tax: A portion of income may be subject to some state and/or local taxes and, for certain investors, a portion may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. Tax Liability: Noncompliant conduct by a municipal bond issuer, or adverse interpretations, could cause interest from a security to become taxable, subjecting shareholders to increased tax liability. Exchange Traded Funds: The value of an ETF may be more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities the ETF is designed to track. The costs of owning the ETF may exceed the cost of investing directly in the underlying securities.
Please consider the fund's objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. Contact Virtus ETF Solutions at 1.888.383.0553 or visit www.cumberetfs.com for a prospectus, which contains this and other information about the Fund.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Cookie name


Purpose





__utma


Keeps track of the number of times a
  visitor has been to a site, when their first visit was, and when their last
  visit occurred. It expires after two years.




__utmb and __utmc


The B and C cookies work together to calculate
  how long a visit takes.

  __utmb takes a timestamp of the exact moment in
  time when a visitor enters a site, while __utmc
  takes a timestamp of the exact moment in time when a visitor leaves a site.

  __utmc has no way of knowing when a user closes their
  browser or leaves a website, so it waits 30 minutes for another pageview to happen, and if it doesn't, it expires.




__utmz


Keeps track of where the visitor came
  from, what search engine was used, what link was clicked on, what keyword was
  used, and where they were in the world when the website was accessed.




s_vi


Keeps track of where the visitor came
  from, what search engine was used, what link was clicked on, what keyword was
  used, and where they were in the world when the website was accessed.

  It expires after six months.




gpv_p3 and s_nr


gpv_p3 takes a timestamp of the exact moment in time when a visitor
  enters a site, while s_nr takes a timestamp of the
  exact moment in time when a visitor leaves a site.




s_sq


Keeps track of where the visitor came from,
  what search engine was used, what link was clicked on, what keyword was used,
  and where they were in the world when the website was accessed. It expires
  after six months.




Visitor_ID


These cookies are used to collect
  information about how visitors use our Website. This information is used to
  compile reports and to help us improve the Website. The cookies collect
  information in an anonymous form, including the number of visitors to the
  site, where visitors have come to the site from and the pages they
  visited. 



 
 
 
 



__ar_v4


 
These category 4 cookies are set by our
  advertising partner Google in order to show you relevant adverts.
These cookies collect information about
  your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your
  interests. They remember the websites you have visited and that information
  is shared with other parties such as advertisers. For example we use 3rd
  party companies such as Google to provide you with more personalised adverts
  when visiting other websites.  These may be set from a few different
  domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com.
