v3[edit]
The v3 brand is used by Vision III Imaging, Inc. to identify its parallax scanning technology.2
The v3 optical and software tools were designed to capture and/or format three-dimensional depth information (parallax) in a manner that exploits certain human visual perceptual mechanisms when viewed on standard unaided displays. The tools exploit certain short-term visual memory and depth-mapping psychophysical processes.3
Intellectual properties[edit]
The company has received a total of 20 issued United States patents with three currently pending, three European Patent Office patents with four pending, two Canadian patents with three pending, one Japanese patent with two pending, and one South Korean patent with one pending.4,5
Technology[edit]
The company’s v3 technology hardware and software product brands include:

v3 AX3 HD Zoom Lens Unit
v3 MOE 35mm Prime Lenses
v3 DPS Parallax Scanner
v3 QS3D Pro Stereoscopic Plug-in Software toolset for Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects
v3 QS3DX GPU accelerated (Cuda and OpenCL) Stereoscopic Plug-in Software tooolset for Premiere Pro CC
v3 Parallax Visualization Plug-in FMV and WAMI toolset for AFRL's Pursuer GUI
v3 Real Shot Digital Advertising
v3 Parallax Scanning Game Code

AX3 – HD lens parallax scanning unit[edit]
The AX3 is designed to be inserted into a standard HD camera lens’ optical path at or near the plane of the iris allowing the capture of parallax views.
AX3 Technical Specifications:

Compatible Lenses

Angenieux 26x7.8 or 19x7.3 ENG Lenses
Fujinon HA22x7.8 or HA18x7.6 HD ENG Lenses


Lens Installation

Requires v3 Ready Adapter installed in place of 2x extender housing


Aperture Size

1 mm to 35.4 mm


Aperture Excursion

3 mm off optical center
6 mm p-p max (@f/16)


Aperture Scan Rate

0–15 Hz


Power

12 volts supplied through controls maintained


Lens Control

Standard lens controls maintained


AX3 Controls

Unit operated via on-board controls
A thumbwheel provides for change of menus and parameter settings
Four programmable buttons are included for operator lens/AX3 function presets
Parallax scan direction control included for stereoscopic applications
Broadcast remote operation via CCU or hand control connected via serial interface.



Moving Optical Element (MOE) lenses 6[edit]
The 35mm MOE Prime lenses are PL-mount compatible lenses that allow cinematographers to capture parallax scanned images on 35mm film or in a digital cinema format (4K).
MOE lens specs:

Aperture Range

Lens speed - T16 with marked thirds and splits


Aperture Excursion

12mm off optical center 24mm p-p Max (@T16)


Aperture Scan Rate

DC - 15.0 Hz Maximum (standard) Allows filming stop motion thru 80 frame/s


Image Format

35mm Full Frame 18.67mm X 24.89mm (0.735" X 0.980")



Digital Parallax Scanner (DPS)[edit]
The Digital Parallax Scanner is the parallax scanning component of the AX3 HD zoom lens unit and the 35 mm MOE prime lenses. It is inserted into a lens’ optical path at the plane or near the plane of the iris allowing the capture of parallax views.
The DPS employs two linear actuators and a central pivoting armature that holds the iris. The two parallel linear actuators have coordinated motion in such a way as to produce both x and y motions of the iris. For illustrative purposes think of the way, a tank moves. If both tank treads move forward/backward the “gun tip” moves forward/backward (both treads moving normally). If one tread moves opposite to the other (turning, both treads moving differentially) the “gun tip” would move left or right. It is this type of differential motion that allows the iris to be positioned in any area of the optical axis in the lens, and do it in the smallest possible space. The linear actuators consist of a moving coil and fixed magnetic yoke assembly, very similar to the typical actuator that controls the read/write heads in a computer hard drive. By incorporating miniature, high-resolution optical encoders, the entire scanner mechanism control system becomes digital.

v3 Technologies








Technical Papers
Critical Alignment
Parallax Scanning
v3D Stereoscopic






Vision III Imaging, Inc., (the "Company") specializes in advanced parallax visualization technologies for military and entertainment imaging markets.  

v3® imaging technologies have been developed for capturing and displaying three-dimensional parallax depth information.  These technologies provide for the creation of v3 imagery that possess an enhanced sense of dimension, sharpness, and with greater texture and realism when presented on a standard unaided display.  


The Company has focused its R&D efforts on an area of human perception that is unique and has been largely overlooked by the general imaging industry.  As a result, the company has been able to develop and patent a series of fundamental proprietary parallax visualization technologies and tools.  When fully deployed the v3 products will provide users with a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace.


Historically, viewing three-dimensional (parallax) visual information has required stereoscopic technology that is not compatible with normal display screens.  This is because stereoscopic systems require left/right visual information to be presented simultaneously (or near instantly) on separate channels to each eye.   Stereoscopic imagery requires that left and right images be formatted for 3D monitors which require special glasses or special screens to view.  


v3 has taken a different approach to three-dimensional imaging by presenting parallax information over time, in a manner that is compatible with standard unaided displays and media.    


Interestingly, the original parallax scanning, which was developed as a method for enhancing the texture and depth of standard two-dimensional imagery, is also applicable to stereoscopic 3D imaging (v3D).  When applied, it has been shown to overcome one or more of the problems associated with traditional stereoscopic imaging methods. v3D provides the ability to capture non-horizontal parallax and other sub-process three-dimensional visual information in a manner that triggers a non-fatiguing perceptional response in the viewer.  It uses stereoscopic parallax scanning to simulate information captured by the eye's natural gaze, saccade, and head motions.  v3D allows the combined stereoscopic display (left and right views) to present a variety of three-dimensional information to the viewer in a manner that will create a unified realistic visual perception.

Pursuer PV Plug-in
Visualizing three-dimensional WAMI and FMV data









Examples

Features











Parallax Visualization (PV) Toolset
The v3 Pursuer PV Plug-in is the first Pursuer Plug-in to allow three-dimensional information to be analyzed using current Electronic Light Table (ELT) workflows. The Plug-in can process existing and future WAMI data, FMV data, and any data that can be viewed using Pursuer. This data can be critically aligned and viewed on any standard unaided display.  Critically aligned alternating data invokes an autostereoscopic  (automatic three-dimensional) response on the part of the viewer using a standard unaided display.







Seamless Integration into Workflows
The Pursuer PV Plug-in can be added into the Pursuer 2.3.X baseline seamlessly and quickly, being implemented as a Pursuer module.  After installation, images can be captured directly from the Pursuer interface and opened into the custom separate "v3 Parallax Visualization Window".  This custom window has numerous easy to use controls and options to ensure the parallax information contained within the data is accurately visualized.







Valuable and Now Obvious Information
The Pursuer PV Plug-in makes difficult and obscure image data obvious. Hidden terrain features and/or aerial obstructions like hanging wires and poles are easily spotted in parallax visualized images. PV work products can be generated, annotated and saved as short movies that can be distributed via a network and viewed on any standard display.






If you are interested in a 30 day evaluation license of the Pursuer PV Plug-in, please contact Vision III:

Digital Parallax Scanner (DPS)[edit]
The Digital Parallax Scanner is the parallax scanning component of the AX3 HD zoom lens unit and the 35 mm MOE prime lenses. It is inserted into a lens’ optical path at the plane or near the plane of the iris allowing the capture of parallax views.
The DPS employs two linear actuators and a central pivoting armature that holds the iris. The two parallel linear actuators have coordinated motion in such a way as to produce both x and y motions of the iris. For illustrative purposes think of the way, a tank moves. If both tank treads move forward/backward the “gun tip” moves forward/backward (both treads moving normally). If one tread moves opposite to the other (turning, both treads moving differentially) the “gun tip” would move left or right. It is this type of differential motion that allows the iris to be positioned in any area of the optical axis in the lens, and do it in the smallest possible space. The linear actuators consist of a moving coil and fixed magnetic yoke assembly, very similar to the typical actuator that controls the read/write heads in a computer hard drive. By incorporating miniature, high-resolution optical encoders, the entire scanner mechanism control system becomes digital.
