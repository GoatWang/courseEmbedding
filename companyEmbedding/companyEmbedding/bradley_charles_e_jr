What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Personal data[edit]
Brady was born in Pinehurst, North Carolina, but considered Robbins, North Carolina, to be his hometown.[4] He lived in the San Juan Islands in Washington state. He enjoyed canoeing, kayaking, tennis, biking and amateur radio operating. His father is deceased, his mother resides in Robbins, North Carolina. Brady's death was the result of suicide. At the time his death was announced to the public, many reports stated that he had died after a lengthy illness (severe pain and paralysis from his rheumatoid arthritis),[2][3][5] while other sources speculated that Brady's decision to take his own life might have been brought on by his chronic pain and diminished mobility.[6][7][8] This is also supported by NASA internal emails related to Brady that were later released under the Freedom of Information Act.[9] He is survived by his partner, Susen Oseth, and their son, Charles "Charlie" Brady III.
Education[edit]
Brady graduated from North Moore High School in Robbins, North Carolina in 1969, and went on to study pre-med at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating in 1971. Brady received his medical degree from Duke University in 1975.[1] From Duke, he went on to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville for his internship.[1]
Military career[edit]
In 1978 Brady worked as the team physician in sports medicine for Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. He continued in sports medicine and family practice for the next seven years, working as a team physician at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina.[4] He joined the U.S. Navy in 1986, receiving training as a flight surgeon at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.[4]
In June 1986 he reported to Carrier Air Wing Two on board the aircraft carrier USS Ranger; he was assigned to Attack Squadron 145 (VA-145) and Aviation Electronic Countermeasures Squadron 131 (VAQ-131). Brady was selected for the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels in 1988 and served with them through 1990.[4] He was serving in Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 129 (VAQ-129) when selected for the astronaut program.[1]
NASA career[edit]
Brady was selected by NASA in March 1992, and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He was qualified for selection as a Mission Specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. Technical assignments included: working technical issues for the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch; flight software testing in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); astronaut representative to the Human Research Policy and Procedures Committee; deputy chief for Space Shuttle astronaut training; and chief for Space Station astronaut training in the Mission Operations Division. He flew on STS-78 in 1996 and logged over 405 hours in space.[1]
As an astronaut and amateur radio enthusiast, callsign N4BQW, Brady was one of the pioneers of the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX), and a member of the American Radio Relay League.[3][4]
STS-78[edit]
STS-78 launched on June 20, 1996 and landed 16 days and 21 hours later on July 7, 1996, becoming the longest Space Shuttle mission to date (later that year the STS-80 mission broke that record by nineteen hours). The Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission served as a model for future studies on board the International Space Station.[4] The mission included studies sponsored by ten nations, five space agencies, and the crew included a Frenchman, a Canadian, a Spaniard and an Italian.[1]

Personal data[edit]
Brady was born in Pinehurst, North Carolina, but considered Robbins, North Carolina, to be his hometown.[4] He lived in the San Juan Islands in Washington state. He enjoyed canoeing, kayaking, tennis, biking and amateur radio operating. His father is deceased, his mother resides in Robbins, North Carolina. Brady's death was the result of suicide. At the time his death was announced to the public, many reports stated that he had died after a lengthy illness (severe pain and paralysis from his rheumatoid arthritis),[2][3][5] while other sources speculated that Brady's decision to take his own life might have been brought on by his chronic pain and diminished mobility.[6][7][8] This is also supported by NASA internal emails related to Brady that were later released under the Freedom of Information Act.[9] He is survived by his partner, Susen Oseth, and their son, Charles "Charlie" Brady III.
Education[edit]
Brady graduated from North Moore High School in Robbins, North Carolina in 1969, and went on to study pre-med at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating in 1971. Brady received his medical degree from Duke University in 1975.[1] From Duke, he went on to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville for his internship.[1]
Military career[edit]
In 1978 Brady worked as the team physician in sports medicine for Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. He continued in sports medicine and family practice for the next seven years, working as a team physician at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina.[4] He joined the U.S. Navy in 1986, receiving training as a flight surgeon at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.[4]
In June 1986 he reported to Carrier Air Wing Two on board the aircraft carrier USS Ranger; he was assigned to Attack Squadron 145 (VA-145) and Aviation Electronic Countermeasures Squadron 131 (VAQ-131). Brady was selected for the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels in 1988 and served with them through 1990.[4] He was serving in Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 129 (VAQ-129) when selected for the astronaut program.[1]
NASA career[edit]
Brady was selected by NASA in March 1992, and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He was qualified for selection as a Mission Specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. Technical assignments included: working technical issues for the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch; flight software testing in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); astronaut representative to the Human Research Policy and Procedures Committee; deputy chief for Space Shuttle astronaut training; and chief for Space Station astronaut training in the Mission Operations Division. He flew on STS-78 in 1996 and logged over 405 hours in space.[1]
As an astronaut and amateur radio enthusiast, callsign N4BQW, Brady was one of the pioneers of the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX), and a member of the American Radio Relay League.[3][4]
STS-78[edit]
STS-78 launched on June 20, 1996 and landed 16 days and 21 hours later on July 7, 1996, becoming the longest Space Shuttle mission to date (later that year the STS-80 mission broke that record by nineteen hours). The Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission served as a model for future studies on board the International Space Station.[4] The mission included studies sponsored by ten nations, five space agencies, and the crew included a Frenchman, a Canadian, a Spaniard and an Italian.[1]

Personal data[edit]
Brady was born in Pinehurst, North Carolina, but considered Robbins, North Carolina, to be his hometown.[4] He lived in the San Juan Islands in Washington state. He enjoyed canoeing, kayaking, tennis, biking and amateur radio operating. His father is deceased, his mother resides in Robbins, North Carolina. Brady's death was the result of suicide. At the time his death was announced to the public, many reports stated that he had died after a lengthy illness (severe pain and paralysis from his rheumatoid arthritis),[2][3][5] while other sources speculated that Brady's decision to take his own life might have been brought on by his chronic pain and diminished mobility.[6][7][8] This is also supported by NASA internal emails related to Brady that were later released under the Freedom of Information Act.[9] He is survived by his partner, Susen Oseth, and their son, Charles "Charlie" Brady III.
Education[edit]
Brady graduated from North Moore High School in Robbins, North Carolina in 1969, and went on to study pre-med at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating in 1971. Brady received his medical degree from Duke University in 1975.[1] From Duke, he went on to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville for his internship.[1]
Military career[edit]
In 1978 Brady worked as the team physician in sports medicine for Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. He continued in sports medicine and family practice for the next seven years, working as a team physician at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina.[4] He joined the U.S. Navy in 1986, receiving training as a flight surgeon at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.[4]
In June 1986 he reported to Carrier Air Wing Two on board the aircraft carrier USS Ranger; he was assigned to Attack Squadron 145 (VA-145) and Aviation Electronic Countermeasures Squadron 131 (VAQ-131). Brady was selected for the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels in 1988 and served with them through 1990.[4] He was serving in Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 129 (VAQ-129) when selected for the astronaut program.[1]
NASA career[edit]
Brady was selected by NASA in March 1992, and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He was qualified for selection as a Mission Specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. Technical assignments included: working technical issues for the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch; flight software testing in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); astronaut representative to the Human Research Policy and Procedures Committee; deputy chief for Space Shuttle astronaut training; and chief for Space Station astronaut training in the Mission Operations Division. He flew on STS-78 in 1996 and logged over 405 hours in space.[1]
As an astronaut and amateur radio enthusiast, callsign N4BQW, Brady was one of the pioneers of the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX), and a member of the American Radio Relay League.[3][4]
STS-78[edit]
STS-78 launched on June 20, 1996 and landed 16 days and 21 hours later on July 7, 1996, becoming the longest Space Shuttle mission to date (later that year the STS-80 mission broke that record by nineteen hours). The Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission served as a model for future studies on board the International Space Station.[4] The mission included studies sponsored by ten nations, five space agencies, and the crew included a Frenchman, a Canadian, a Spaniard and an Italian.[1]

Morgan Stanley to Pay $23 Million in Bond Case - latimes

Advertisement


YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home→Collections→SettlementsMorgan Stanley to Pay $23 Million in Bond CaseCourts: Settlement is called a major victory for accident victims whose trust funds had allegedly been looted and depleted.June 29, 2001|MYRON LEVIN | TIMES STAFF WRITER


Investment giant Morgan Stanley & Co. will pay $23 million to settle claims that it contributed to the looting of trust funds that provided living expenses for more than 200 victims of auto wrecks, industrial accidents and botched medical procedures, according to documents filed Thursday in a Los Angeles class-action case.The settlement was hailed as a major victory by plaintiffs' attorneys, who said it assures a flow of income to their clients while the case against other blue-chip defendants continues.Separately, the company that triggered the disaster by losing a fortune in bonds filed a petition for bankruptcy reorganization this week in Bridgeport, Conn. The bankruptcy case will halt legal proceedings against the company, Stanwich Financial Services Corp. of Stamford, Conn., while it attempts to marshal its assets. But litigation will go forward against a string of powerhouse firms accused of contributing to the loss of the bonds, including Bear, Stearns & Co., Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank and Bankers Trust Co. of New York.The case stems from the sudden cessation last fall of income payments to the victims, who for years have relied on settlement checks to pay medical and living expenses. The default led to the discovery that a Stanwich affiliate had frittered away the bonds, using them as collateral for loans from Morgan, which later sold them for nonpayment.Morgan did not admit liability, and company officials declined comment on the settlement.The agreement brings recent recoveries in the case to $42.5 million--enough to give plaintiffs all payments due them until May 2003.The Morgan settlement is the third and largest of the recoveries. In April, Merrill Lynch & Co. agreed in a settlement to meet all scheduled payments due this year--an amount originally estimated at $16.9 million but now calculated at $15.5 million. In May, Bankers Trust agreed to advance an additional $4 million, although Bankers remains a defendant.The Morgan and Merrill settlements need court approval, and hearings before Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter D. Lichtman are scheduled for July.Plaintiffs' lawyer Roman M. Silberfeld said the infusion of $23 million takes the financial pressure off victims, who he said might otherwise have been forced through desperation to settle on the cheap.The case involves trust funds created to pay more than $100 million to people who had resolved serious accident claims through structured settlements. The settlements were arranged in the 1980s mostly by a Merrill Lynch affiliate and a second firm Merrill acquired. They involved buying U.S. Treasury bonds and using the interest to make monthly, quarterly or twice-yearly payments over periods of 20 to 30 years. Until the default last November, no one missed a payment.But unknown to the plaintiffs, control of the business had passed from Merrill to a Rhode Island businessman and socialite named Jonathan H. Pardee. Operating as Settlement Services Treasury Assignments Inc., Pardee appointed a new trustee, Bankers Trust, to hold the bonds and disburse checks. And Pardee allegedly induced Bankers to accept a permissive trust agreement that allowed Settlement Services to put the bonds in play.According to court papers, Pardee entered into repurchase agreements with Morgan Stanley, essentially a borrowing arrangement in which he used the Treasury bonds as collateral for a multimillion-dollar line of credit. With marketing help from Bear Stearns, Pardee later sold Settlement Services to Stanwich and its principals, Connecticut businessman Charles E. Bradley Sr. and his son, Charles E. Bradley Jr. of Orange County.The Bradleys continued the practice of using the bonds to get investment cash from Morgan. According to the lawsuit, the Bradleys used $16 million of the loan proceeds to pay Pardee for Settlement Services. They allegedly lent at least $46 million more to other Bradley-controlled companies that were in weak financial condition.In March 1998, Morgan sold the bonds, paying itself back from the proceeds and giving the balance to Stanwich. Because people had continued to receive their income checks throughout the period, until the default last November, they were none the wiser.Pardee and the Bradleys, accused by the plaintiffs of fraud and other wrongs, have denied wrongdoing. Defense lawyer Steve Hogan said the Bradleys believed it was perfectly legal to borrow against the bonds, which was why they bought Settlement Services in the first place.Hogan said Stanwich filed for Chapter 11 protection to gain time to liquidate loans and other investments. The hope is "to maximize the recovery on its assets so that it [Stanwich] can pay these people as much money as possible, and hopefully pay them in full."
