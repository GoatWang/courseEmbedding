SAINT PAUL, Minn., March 5, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Angeion Corporation (NASDAQ:   ANGN) today announced that Wendy D. Lynch, Ph.D., has been appointed to the Company's Board of Directors, effective March 1, 2012.

"Dr. Lynch brings unique healthcare industry knowledge and experience to the Angeion Board of Directors. Her expertise across a broad spectrum of the healthcare industry, in organizational productivity, motivation, management and leadership, will be of significant strategic value to our Board.  We look forward to her insight and guidance in the direction and governance of the organization," said Mark Sheffert, Chairman of the Angeion Board of Directors.
From 2006 through 2010, Dr. Lynch also served as executive director of an education and research foundation called the Health as Human Capital Foundation, a nonprofit, non-partisan think tank providing independent information for policy makers.

The addition of Dr. Lynch to the board brings to seven the number of members comprising the board, five of whom are independent directors under Nasdaq Rules.

Forward Looking Statements
Press releases and other statements by Angeion may contain forward-looking statements about Angeion's future financial results and business prospects that by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties.  You can identify these statements by the use of words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "will," "target," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance or business plans or prospects.  Our actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including: (1) national and worldwide economic and capital market conditions; (2) continuing cost-containment efforts in our hospital, clinic, and office markets; (3) remaining as a qualified provider for large group purchasing organizations, thereby ensuring continued access to our market and efficiently increasing our sales potential to expanded numbers of companies using these buying groups; (4) any changes in the patterns of medical reimbursement that may result from national healthcare reform; (5) our ability to successfully operate our business, including successfully converting our increasing research and development expenditures into new and improved cardiorespiratory diagnostic products and services and selling these products and services under the MedGraphics and New Leaf brand names into existing and new markets; (6) our ability to complete our software development initiatives and migrate our MedGraphics and New Leaf platforms to a next generation technology; (7) our ability to maintain our cost structure at a level that is appropriate to our near to mid-term revenue expectations and that will enable us to increase revenues and profitability as opportunities develop; (8) our ability to achieve constant margins for our products and consistent and predictable operating expenses in light of variable revenues from our clinical research customers; (9) our ability to expand our international revenue through our distribution partners and our Milan, Italy representative branch office; (10) our ability to successfully defend ourselves from product liability claims related to our cardiorespiratory diagnostic products and claims associated with our prior cardiac stimulation products; (11) our ability to defend our existing intellectual property and obtain protection for intellectual property we develop in the future; (12) our ability to develop and maintain an effective system of internal controls and procedures and disclosure controls and procedures; (13) our dependence on third-party vendors; and (14) the ability of new members of our senior management to make a successful transition into their new roles and for all members of senior management to ultimately develop and implement a strategic plan.  These and other risk factors that are described from time to time in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission reports, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2011.

Research Interests
Behavioral Pharmacology, Sex Differences, Animal Models of Addiction
Research Description
My laboratory uses behavioral, pharmacological, and molecular techniques to delineate the neurobiological basis of addiction.  We are particularly interested in determining the biological basis of sex differences in vulnerability to addiction.  Our work has shown that females are more vulnerable than males to the reinforcing effects of drugs during the different phases of the addiction process including acquisition, maintenance, escalation, and relapse.  We are examining a number of biological factors that may underlie these sex differences including hormones, age, dopaminergic signaling, as well as interactions between these factors.  Another area of interest is on pharmacotherapies for treating addiction.  The use of animal models is critical to determining the process by which potential medications for treating drug addiction exert their behavioral-pharmacological effects.  Such information will help guide the development and use of medications for drug addiction treatment in humans.  Ultimately, animal models of addiction will be very useful for understanding the neurobiological basis of addiction, determining potential treatments, and identifying individuals at risk for drug addiction.
