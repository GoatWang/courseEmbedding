The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

1926 - THE BEGINNING


At age 28, Max Stern was ambitious but nearly penniless. His native Germany was suffering from the effects of hyper-inflation, unemployment and civil unrest in part caused by the collapse of Germany after World War I. By contrast, America presented an island of stability, freedom and economic opportunity. Max looked toward the promise that was America and decided to emigrate and pursue the American dream.At about the same time, a childhood friend of Max, a local canary dealer who had previously borrowed a modest sum from him, told Max that he could only pay back the loan with 5,000 singing canaries. Max accepted the canaries and decided to sell them in New York City where he was told he could get the best price.Max negotiated free passage for himself to New York on the Hamburg American Steamship Line in return for paying the freight charges on the canaries and spent his time below deck during the voyage caring for the birds. He arrived in America not knowing a single soul or word of English. A great salesman, he immediately sold the canaries to the John Wanamaker Department Store's Pet Department at Astor Place in Manhattan, which had the city's largest pet shop. Seeing the opportunity, he immediately decided to establish a new business of importing canaries making his place of business nearby at 36 Cooper Square. We proudly still own that building.

×










1932 - GROWTH IN THE PET INDUSTRY


Max returned to his native Germany again and again each time bringing back more singing canaries. Soon he was selling them to a growing customer base across the country including R.H. Macy, Sears Roebuck, F.W. Woolworth, W. T. Grant, S.S. Kresge and other large chain retailers.By 1934, Max was the largest livestock importer in America and started manufacturing packaged bird foods at 36 Cooper Square selling them under the Hartz Mountain brand to the same customers who bought canaries from him, and the line of Hartz Mountain pet products was born!

×










1959 - THE SECOND GENERATION


By now, Hartz Mountain had become America's best known bird food company. Max welcomed his 21-year-old son Leonard into the business who immediately took over day-to-day operations as Max's health had started to fail. Leonard appreciated the success of the bird food line, but he also knew that Americans needed food and supplies for their other pets, so he rapidly expanded the Hartz product line, offering supplies for dogs, cats, fish and other household pets. This expansion had far more growth potential than bird products and sales boomed accordingly. Hartz then pioneered a revolutionary type of pet supply distribution using specialized display racks installed in the pet food section of supermarkets, which revolutionized the American pet industry.Hartz products were heavily advertised first on radio and then television creating the most powerful brand in the pet industry. “Perk up your parakeet with Hartz Mountain Parakeet Seed'" read one ad. During this time, Hartz developed numerous unique and creative products like Hartz Yummies, Dog Pretzels, Canary Kits and even Parakeet Training Records.During the 1960s, Hartz flea collars became America's best-selling flea control product. Over the years, Hartz developed a wide range of other flea and tick prevention products and numerous healthcare aids for dogs and cats including shampoos, vitamins, grooming aids, etc.

×










1966 - WE ENTER THE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS


Continuing to seek out new opportunities to invest Hartz's increasing cash flow, Leonard Stern looked beyond the company's successful pet care business into real estate development. A unique opportunity presented itself; the construction of 700,000 square feet of speculative industrial distribution facilities in Bayonne, NJ, and Hartz Mountain Industries, our real estate division, was born and Hartz became a business with two very fast growing divisions.

×










1969 - RAPID EXPANSION IN THE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS


​Leonard Stern with his newly formed real estate division continued to dramatically grow the overall business with the acquisition of two large tracts of barren marshes totaling over 1,250 acres in the New Jersey Meadowlands / Secaucus, an area only six miles from downtown Manhattan. This land, once best known for its adjacency to former pig farms, would soon become the core of Hartz's real estate portfolio. By this time, Hartz had created its own in-house capacity to design, construct and then manage the growing real estate portfolio.This initial tract of land in Secaucus, now known as Harmon Cove is among the premier distribution locations in the country, sitting just outside New York City. With its dual proximity to both Manhattan and the Port of New York/New Jersey, it offers a strategic location that is unmatched. Harmon Cove is also the site where outlet shopping began in the Northeast and continues as a popular consumer outlet destination to this day.Harmon Cove's neighboring Harmon Meadow development in Secaucus is a thriving mixed-use project. It would become one of the premier office locations in New Jersey. The nearby Secaucus Junction Train Station connects employees and visitors to the entire New York Metro Region and beyond. Hartz' Real Estate portfolio grows to more than 1,000 commercial tenants.

×










1980s - REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT & DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES AT A RAPID PACE


Hartz's real estate business expanded dramatically during the 1980s, with the purchase and development of large tracts of land in Weehawken and Ridgefield Park, N.J. The company then acquired additional land and buildings in Jersey City, Newark and Manhattan, all in prime locations. By the end of the eighties, the Hartz name was as synonymous with real estate as it was with pet care and Hartz' real estate portfolio had grown to more than 35,000,000 square feet.

×










1980 - THE HOME CARPET CLEANING BUSINESS


With the acquisition of the Carpet Magic Company, Hartz Mountain entered the home carpet cleaning business. Carpet Magic provided carpet cleaning rental machines in supermarkets. Hartz designed and fabricated the machines in our own factories, then installed them in stores and serviced them. Hartz grew the business to more than 20,000 rental centers in the nation's leading supermarket chains.On the international front, Hartz was growing as well. Canadian operations were strong with headquarters in St. Thomas, Ontario and regional branches in Toronto, Montreal and Calgary. Hartz's International footprint now included offices in Japan, Taiwan and Korea that served as purchasing support for Hartz's worldwide operations.In the United Kingdom, Hartz acquired S.M. Cork, that nation's leading service merchandiser. S.M. Cork distributed a wide range of “non-food'" items to supermarkets and convenience stores with weekly store door delivery service. Products ranged from Hartz pet care to baby products, hair care, cosmetics and stationery lines.

×










1985 - DIVERSIFICATION INTO PUBLISHING


Moving into alternative weekly newspaper publishing, Leonard diversified the company once again. He launched Stern Publishing, and soon had local weekly newspapers across the country including; The Village Voice, The LA Weekly, Seattle Weekly, Orange County Weekly, Long Island Voice, and several more with a total weekly circulation exceeding 900,000 and 1,000 employees.Hartz then created the Harmon Publishing Company, which soon published 180 free local residential real estate photo advertising magazines, reaching well over two million prospective homebuyers every two weeks. The magazines are distributed free through supermarkets, banks, hotels, restaurants and corporate relocation offices.

×










1990 - THE THIRD GENERATION


With a focus on family, it was only natural for Leonard to welcome sons Emanuel and Edward Stern into the business. Representing the third generation of future leadership, they began to work their way up the corporate ladder, with Emanuel starting in the real estate division and Edward in the pet care businesses.

×










1994 - FURTHER PET PRODUCT EXPANSION


To further expand its pet product offerings, Hartz acquired Wardley Products, America's largest manufacturer of aquatic fish foods and remedies. With a range of more than 200 formulations addressing the special needs of the serious aquatic hobbyist, Wardley's line of outdoor pond products were Hartz' first foray into this growing market. Hartz then continued its expansion with its acquisitions of the Pet Products Rawhide Company of Brazil and the L&M Pet Company, manufacturers of small animal foods.

×










1995 - EXPANDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT


Since the first days of the company, Hartz has maintained a continuing commitment to product innovation. In 1995, we expanded our R&D capacity by building a state-of-the-art laboratory and research facility in Bloomfield, NJ adjacent to our major manufacturing complex, then adding a Life Science Center at our live tropical fish distribution facility in Tampa, Florida.

×










1996 - HARTZ ENTERS THE HOSPITALITY BUSINESS


Hartz diversified its business once again by developing a hospitality division, building the SoHo Grand Hotel and a few years later the Tribeca Grand Hotel, now known as The Roxy Hotel, in lower Manhattan. Other hotels in New Jersey were also built and the Hartz hotel portfolio would grow to include eleven hospitality properties.Steeped in luxury, the SoHo Grand was SoHo's first hotel in over 100 years. With its 367 rooms and acclaimed design, the hotel offers luxury accommodations in a vibrant quarter of New York. The Tribeca Grand, now known as The Roxy Hotel, marked the first opening of a luxury hotel in Tribeca, the area known as the “Triangle Below Canal'" bordered by Canal Street, Broadway and the Hudson River, and became another instant success.

×










1997 - THE NEXT GENERATION OFFICIALLY TAKES ITS PLACE


It was time for the next generation to officially take their places in the overall management of our business. Emanuel was named President of the real estate division and Edward was named President of the pet company. Both joined their father Leonard in forming a troika to oversee the day-to-day management of the entire company.

×










2000 - REFOCUSING THE COMPANY FOR THE FUTURE


By now, the success of Hartz pet care products and publishing business attracted the attention of numerous potential purchasers and we received numerous offers to sell these businesses. It was a difficult decision, but the Stern family decided to sell both businesses so Edward could concentrate on managing the company's new fast-growing financial operations under the banner of Hartz Capital, Inc.

×










2007 - HARTZ ENTERS THE SOLAR ENERGY BUSINESS


Hartz Mountain goes green. Under the leadership of Emanuel Stern, Hartz launched a companywide sustainability initiative in 2007. The program resulted in a complete overhaul of the specifications used in all of the company's construction and renovation projects. Another marquis component of the initiative is the use of renewable energy. In 2009 alone, Hartz invested millions of dollars to install solar arrays on its industrial buildings and retail centers in the Meadowlands. As a result, Hartz has become one of the largest owners of solar arrays in NJ with installations on numerous buildings it owns as well as a large free standing facility in Hamilton, New Jersey. As a result of its efforts, Hartz was awarded NJBIA's Environmental Quality Award. Also in 2009, NJBIZ recognized President and Chief Operating Officer Emanuel Stern as the “Green Executive of the Year.'" The environmental focus continues today.

×










2010 - HARTZ CREATES MULTIFAMILY RENTAL BUSINESS


Hartz entered the multifamily residential rental business with the purchase of more than 1,875 rental apartment units in the New York/New Jersey area as the first step toward an aggressive plan to add a substantial residential component to its portfolio. Hartz also initiated plans to build over 2,000 residential rental units on land it already owned in several N.J. townships. Within a short amount of time, Hartz will have 5,000 upscale luxury rental units in its portfolio, with exciting plans to continue to grow this asset class for many years.

×










2010 - HARTZ ENERGY HOLDINGS IS ESTABLISHED


Under the direction of Edward Stern, Hartz Capital establishes a new subsidiary, Hartz Energy Holdings, to enter the oil and gas business. In 2005, Hartz began by investing alongside experienced drillers for the knowledge and contacts as much as for the economic opportunities.In the following years, Hartz participated in drilling more than 150 new oil and gas wells in Texas, Louisiana, North Dakota and Kentucky. Hartz also acquired non-operated working interests and royalty interests in thousands of other domestic oil and gas wells, and invested substantial amounts of capital into public and private midstream energy investments.By 2007, Hartz began to focus its efforts on the development of oil and gas production closer to home in Pennsylvania and New York, acquiring leasehold interests in areas that were highly prospective for the development of shale gas production.In 2010, Hartz entered into active drilling arrangements to develop the leasehold acreage it had assembled. These direct drilling rights represent an inventory of more than one thousand new oil and gas well locations that Hartz hopes to develop over the coming years in an environmentally responsible manner.As the Company executes on this drilling backlog and evaluates a steady stream of new opportunities, we believe we are well on the way toward achieving Leonard's long-time goal of building a meaningful oil and gas operating business.

2011 - TRIBUTE TO MAX STERN'S IMMIGRANT VALUES


On October 12, 2011, as a further tribute to Max Stern's American dream, the Stern family unveiled an actual replica cast from the original plaster sculpture of the Statue of Liberty at their 667 Madison building in Manhattan. Standing nine feet tall, the exact scale model was cast using bronze from the same foundry. Lady Liberty symbolizes the promise of America realized by Max Stern, and the success he was able to achieve in his adopted country. As Max frequently said, "Only in America." 

×










2014 - SWIFT EXPANSION OF RESIDENTIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PORTFOLIOS


In February of 2014, Hartz opened Estuary in Weehawken, NJ, it's most 
spectacular ground-up multifamily residential project to date. Estuary consists 
of 582 luxury apartments and is a complimentary component to the 60-acre Lincoln 
Harbor mixed-use waterfront development.      Hartz began developing 
its residential portfolio in 2010 and plans to add an additional 1,400 units in 
various municipalities in Northern, NJ, including Jersey City, Weehawken and 
Secaucus. Its other high-rise residential properties include One Superior Place 
in Chicago, The Whitley in Austin, TX, and The Alto in Seattle. This activity brings the company's residential holdings to 
nearly 2,800 units.       In the Summer of 2014, Hartz purchased a 
35-building industrial portfolio in North Atlanta, GA, as well as buildings in 
Hanover, MD and Kings Mountain, NC, just outside Charlotte. While Hartz had 
previously purchased warehouses in Baltimore, MD these transactions were its 
largest industrial purchases outside the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area 
and brought its Southeastern industrial holdings close to 7 million square feet.

Leonard Stern Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The Hartz Group, Inc.


Hartz Mountain was founded in 1926 by my late father Max Stern when he imported his first shipment of singing canaries from his native Germany to America. From these humble beginnings, we have evolved into a truly diversified large privately owned family business. Over the years we have continued to evolve into our current model of a diversified single operating company engaged in five lines of business that include commercial real estate, multifamily rental real estate, hospitality, oil, gas and finance. In many ways different but yet in all important strategic ways highly interrelated. With our growing and changing real estate portfolio, the company has substantially upgraded its real estate holdings which now stands at more than 38 million square feet and includes office, warehouse, numerous data centers, hotels, retail, freestanding parking garages, several thousand multifamily residential rental units and unique types of properties such as a convention center, a Medieval Times dinner and tournament facility along with undeveloped land in the Northern, New Jersey area.  Since 2006 through today, we have added 9.6 million square feet of industrial space to our current portfolio largely in Maryland, North Carolina and Atlanta.  All together we own more than 250 buildings. Looking ahead and assuring the continuation of Hartz as a private company into the next generation and beyond, I have named my son Edward, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Hartz Group and my designated successor. Our real estate operations will continue to be managed by our President Gus Milano, and Tony Fant will continue to serve as President of our GrandLife Hotels unit. Eddie, currently serving as President of Hartz Capital, is an experienced businessman and has worked at the Hartz Group for 25 years. He began his career in our previously owned publishing business after which he transferred to the Hartz Pet Supply Company, holding various positions there that culminated in his appointment as President. Eddie executed the company's successful reorganization and sale in year 2000. Following the sale of the pet supply business, Eddie founded Hartz Capital which has invested opportunistically across a wide variety of securities and asset classes for 16 years. Eddie's leadership skills, judgement, and intellect makes him the ideal family member to lead our various enterprises; real estate, hotels, financial, natural resources, renewable energy, and opportunistic investments. I will continue to discharge my current duties as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer till the day comes that I can no longer do so. And when the day finally comes, Eddie will be right there at my side ready in every way to become Hartz' next CEO.As my late father often said "Only in America!"Leonard SternChairman & CEO​

1932 - GROWTH IN THE PET INDUSTRY






Hartz Bird Food Products - 1955F.W. Woolworth was our largest customer by 1940Max returned to his native Germany again and again each time bringing back more singing canaries. Soon he was selling them to a growing customer base across the country including R.H. Macy, Sears Roebuck, F.W. Woolworth, W. T. Grant, S.S. Kresge and other large chain retailers. By 1934, Max was the largest livestock importer in America and started manufacturing packaged bird foods at 36 Cooper Square selling them under the Hartz Mountain brand to the same customers who bought canaries from him, and the line of Hartz Mountain pet products was born! 
 




1959 - THE SECOND GENERATION




 By now, Hartz Mountain had become America's best known bird food company. Max welcomed his 21-year-old son Leonard into the business who immediately took over day-to-day operations as Max's health had started to fail. Leonard appreciated the success of the bird food line, but he also knew that Americans needed food and supplies for their other pets, so he rapidly expanded the Hartz product line, offering supplies for dogs, cats, fish and other household pets. This expansion had far more growth potential than bird products and sales boomed accordingly. Hartz then pioneered a revolutionary type of pet supply distribution using specialized display racks installed in the pet food section of supermarkets, which revolutionized the American pet industry. Hartz products were heavily advertised first on radio and then television creating the most powerful brand in the pet industry. “Perk up your parakeet with Hartz Mountain Parakeet Seed'" read one ad. During this time, Hartz developed numerous unique and creative products like Hartz Yummies, Dog Pretzels, Canary Kits and even Parakeet Training Records. During the 1960s, Hartz flea collars became America's best-selling flea control product. Over the years, Hartz developed a wide range of other flea and tick prevention products and numerous healthcare aids for dogs and cats including shampoos, vitamins, grooming aids, etc.

1966 - WE ENTER THE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS






                    Continuing to seek out new opportunities to invest Hartz's increasing cash flow,
                    Leonard Stern looked beyond the company's successful pet care business into real
                    estate development. A unique opportunity presented itself; the construction of 700,000
                    square feet of speculative industrial distribution facilities in Bayonne, NJ, and
                    Hartz Mountain Industries, our real estate division, was born and Hartz became a
                    business with two very fast growing divisions.

1969 - RAPID EXPANSION IN THE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS




 Leonard Stern with his newly formed real estate division continued to dramatically grow the overall business with the acquisition of two large tracts of barren marshes totaling over 1,250 acres in the New Jersey Meadowlands / Secaucus, an area only six miles from downtown Manhattan. This land, once best known for its adjacency to former pig farms, would soon become the core of Hartz's real estate portfolio. By this time, Hartz had created its own in-house capacity to design, construct and then manage the growing real estate portfolio. This initial tract of land in Secaucus, now known as Harmon Cove is among the premier distribution locations in the country, sitting just outside New York City. With its dual proximity to both Manhattan and the Port of New York/New Jersey, it offers a strategic location that is unmatched. Harmon Cove is also the site where outlet shopping began in the Northeast and continues as a popular consumer outlet destination to this day. Harmon Cove's neighboring Harmon Meadow development in Secaucus is a thriving mixed-use project. It would become one of the premier office locations in New Jersey. The nearby Secaucus Junction Train Station connects employees and visitors to the entire New York Metro Region and beyond. Hartz' Real Estate portfolio grows to more than 1,000 commercial tenants.

1980's - REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT & DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES





                    Hartz's real estate business expanded dramatically during the 1980s, with the purchase
                    and development of large tracts of land in Weehawken and Ridgefield Park, N.J. The
                    company then acquired additional land and buildings in Jersey City, Newark and Manhattan,
                    all in prime locations. By the end of the eighties, the Hartz name was as synonymous
                    with real estate as it was with pet care and Hartz' real estate portfolio had grown
                    to more than 35,000,000 square feet.

1980 - THE HOME CARPET CLEANING BUSINESS






                    With the acquisition of the Carpet Magic Company, Hartz Mountain entered the home
                    carpet cleaning business. Carpet Magic provided carpet cleaning rental machines
                    in supermarkets. Hartz designed and fabricated the machines in our own factories,
                    then installed them in stores and serviced them. Hartz grew the business to more
                    than 20,000 rental centers in the nation's leading supermarket chains.
                    On the international front, Hartz was growing as well. Canadian operations were
                    strong with headquarters in St. Thomas, Ontario and regional branches in Toronto,
                    Montreal and Calgary. Hartz's International footprint now included offices in Japan,
                    Taiwan and Korea that served as purchasing support for Hartz's worldwide operations.
                    In the United Kingdom, Hartz acquired S.M. Cork, that nation's leading service merchandiser.
                    S.M. Cork distributed a wide range of “non-food'" items to supermarkets and convenience
                    stores with weekly store door delivery service. Products ranged from Hartz pet care
                    to baby products, hair care, cosmetics and stationery lines.

1985 - DIVERSIFICATION INTO PUBLISHING






                    Moving into alternative weekly newspaper publishing, Leonard diversified the company
                    once again. He launched Stern Publishing, and soon had local weekly newspapers across
                    the country including; The Village Voice, The LA Weekly, Seattle Weekly, Orange
                    County Weekly, Long Island Voice, and several more with a total weekly circulation
                    exceeding 900,000 and 1,000 employees.
                   
                    Hartz then created the Harmon Publishing Company, which soon published 180 free
                    local residential real estate photo advertising magazines, reaching well over two
                    million prospective homebuyers every two weeks. The magazines are distributed free
                    through supermarkets, banks, hotels, restaurants and corporate relocation offices.

1990 - THE THIRD GENERATION






                    With a focus on family, it was only natural for Leonard to welcome sons Emanuel
                    and Edward Stern into the business. Representing the third generation of future
                    leadership, they began to work their way up the corporate ladder, with Emanuel starting
                    in the real estate division and Edward in the pet care businesses.

1994 - FURTHER PET PRODUCT EXPANSION






                    To further expand its pet product offerings, Hartz acquired Wardley Products, America's
                    largest manufacturer of aquatic fish foods and remedies. With a range of more than
                    200 formulations addressing the special needs of the serious aquatic hobbyist, Wardley's
                    line of outdoor pond products were Hartz' first foray into this growing market.
                    Hartz then continued its expansion with its acquisitions of the Pet Products Rawhide
                    Company of Brazil and the L&M Pet Company, manufacturers of small animal foods.

1995 - EXPANDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT






                    Since the first days of the company, Hartz has maintained a continuing commitment
                    to product innovation. In 1995, we expanded our R&D capacity by building a state-of-the-art
                    laboratory and research facility in Bloomfield, NJ adjacent to our major manufacturing
                    complex, then adding a Life Science Center at our live tropical fish distribution
                    facility in Tampa, Florida.

1996 - HARTZ ENTERS THE HOSPITALITY BUSINESS




 Hartz diversified its business once again by developing a hospitality division, building the SoHo Grand Hotel and a few years later the Tribeca Grand Hotel, now known as The Roxy Hotel, in lower Manhattan. Other hotels in New Jersey were also built and the Hartz hotel portfolio would grow to include eleven hospitality properties. Steeped in luxury, the SoHo Grand was SoHo's first hotel in over 100 years. With its 367 rooms and acclaimed design, the hotel offers luxury accommodations in a vibrant quarter of New York. The Tribeca Grand, now known as The Roxy Hotel, marked the first opening of a luxury hotel in Tribeca, the area known as the “Triangle Below Canal'" bordered by Canal Street, Broadway and the Hudson River, and became another instant success.

1997 - THE NEXT GENERATION OFFICIALLY TAKES ITS PLACE




 It was time for the next generation to officially take their places in the overall management of our business. Emanuel was named President of the real estate division and Edward was named President of the pet company. Both joined their father Leonard in forming a troika to oversee the day-to-day management of the entire company.

2000 - REFOCUSING THE COMPANY FOR THE FUTURE






                    By now, the success of Hartz pet care products and publishing business attracted
                    the attention of numerous potential purchasers and we received numerous offers to
                    sell these businesses. It was a difficult decision, but the Stern family decided
                    to sell both businesses so Edward could concentrate on managing the company's new
                    fast-growing financial operations under the banner of Hartz Capital, Inc.

2007 - HARTZ ENTERS THE SOLAR ENERGY BUSINESS




 Hartz Mountain goes green. Under the leadership of Emanuel Stern, Hartz launched a companywide sustainability initiative in 2007. The program resulted in a complete overhaul of the specifications used in all of the company's construction and renovation projects. Another marquis component of the initiative is the use of renewable energy. In 2009 alone, Hartz invested millions of dollars to install solar arrays on its industrial buildings and retail centers in the Meadowlands. As a result, Hartz has become one of the largest owners of solar arrays in NJ with installations on numerous buildings it owns as well as a large free standing facility in Hamilton, New Jersey. As a result of its efforts, Hartz was awarded NJBIA's Environmental Quality Award. Also in 2009, NJBIZ recognized President and Chief Operating Officer Emanuel Stern as the “Green Executive of the Year.'" The environmental focus continues today.

2010 - HARTZ CREATES MULTIFAMILY RENTAL BUSINESS




 Hartz entered the multifamily residential rental business with the purchase of more than 1,875 rental apartment units in the New York/New Jersey area as the first step toward an aggressive plan to add a substantial residential component to its portfolio. Hartz also initiated plans to build over 2,200 residential rental units on land it already owned in several N.J. townships. Within a short amount of time, Hartz will have 5,000 upscale luxury rental units in its portfolio, with exciting plans to continue to grow this asset class for many years.

2010 - HARTZ ENERGY HOLDINGS IS ESTABLISHED





                    Under the direction of Edward Stern, Hartz Capital establishes a new subsidiary,
                    Hartz Energy Holdings, to enter the oil and gas business. In 2005, Hartz began by
                    investing alongside experienced drillers for the knowledge and contacts as much
                    as for the economic opportunities.
                    In the following years, Hartz participated in drilling more than 150 new oil and
                    gas wells in Texas, Louisiana, North Dakota and Kentucky. Hartz also acquired non-operated
                    working interests and royalty interests in thousands of other domestic oil and gas
                    wells, and invested substantial amounts of capital into public and private midstream
                    energy investments.
                    By 2007, Hartz began to focus its efforts on the development of oil and gas production
                    closer to home in Pennsylvania and New York, acquiring leasehold interests in areas
                    that were highly prospective for the development of shale gas production.
                    In 2010, Hartz entered into active drilling arrangements to develop the leasehold
                    acreage it had assembled. These direct drilling rights represent an inventory of
                    more than one thousand new oil and gas well locations that Hartz hopes to develop
                    over the coming years in an environmentally responsible manner.
                    As the Company executes on this drilling backlog and evaluates a steady stream of
                    new opportunities, we believe we are well on the way toward achieving Leonard's
                    long-time goal of building a meaningful oil and gas operating business.
                

Edward Stern, President of Hartz Capital leads our thrust into the oil and gas business in addition to his numerous other responsibilities which include the overall management of the Company shared with his brother and father.

 Hartz Mountain Industries continues its tradition started by founder Max Stern, who was in the words of granddaughter Andrea Stern, “a rugged entrepreneur, a visionary, [and] a philanthropist.'"




2011 - TRIBUTE TO MAX STERN'S IMMIGRANT VALUES




On October 12, 2011, as a further tribute to Max Stern's American dream, the Stern family unveiled an actual replica cast from the original plaster sculpture of the Statue of Liberty at their 667 Madison building in Manhattan. Standing nine feet tall, the exact scale model was cast using bronze from the same foundry. Lady Liberty symbolizes the promise of America realized by Max Stern, and the success he was able to achieve in his adopted country. As Max frequently said, "Only in America." 






2014 - SWIFT EXPANSION OF RESIDENTIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PORTFOLIOS




 In February of 2014, Hartz opened Estuary in Weehawken, NJ, its most spectacular ground-up multifamily residential project to date. Estuary consists of 582 luxury apartments and is a complimentary component to the 60-acre Lincoln Harbor mixed-use waterfront development. 
      
 Hartz began developing its residential portfolio in 2010 and plans to add an additional 2,200 units in various municipalities in Northern, NJ, including Jersey City, Weehawken and Secaucus.  Its other high-rise residential properties include One Superior Place in Chicago, The Whitley in Austin, TX and The Alto in Seattle. This activity brings the company's residential holdings to nearly 2,800 units.

Bottom: Alto, Seattle, WA and One Superior Place, Chicago, IL
 In the Summer of 2014, Hartz purchased a 35-building industrial portfolio in North Atlanta, GA, as well as buildings in Hanover, MD and Kings Mountain, NC, just outside Charlotte. While Hartz had previously purchased warehouses in Baltimore, MD these transactions were its largest industrial purchases outside the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area and brought its Southeastern industrial holdings close to 7 million square feet. 

Hartz purchased 2.5 Million SF of distribution space in North Atlanta in 2014.  As of 2015, Hartz's Southeastern Industrial holdings totals close to 7 million square feet.

In 2014, Hartz partnered with Patriot Renewables LLC to construct the Saddleback Ridge Wind project, a 34 Megawatt, 12-turbine wind project located in Carthage, Maine.  Saddleback Ridge Wind's 12 GE 2.85 MW turbines will generate nearly 105 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity each year -- enough to power approximately 16,500 homes.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
