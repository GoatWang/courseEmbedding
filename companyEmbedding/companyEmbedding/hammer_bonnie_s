    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Early life[edit]
Born to a Jewish family[1][2] in 1950,[3] Hammer was raised in Queens, New York, the youngest of three children. Hammer’s mother was a full-time mom; her dad, a Russian immigrant, started his own pen company. Intending to become a photojournalist, Hammer enrolled at Boston University College of Communication, earning a bachelor's degree in communications in 1971 and later a master's degree in Media Technology from the Boston University School of Education in 1975.
Career[edit]
Hammer began her career in television at WGBH-TV, the public television station in Boston, where she produced This Old House, Infinity Factory and ZOOM for PBS. She later executive-produced Good Day! for Boston's ABC affiliate, WCVB-TV.
Hammer first established herself professionally in New York as an original programming executive at Lifetime Television Network, where she executive produced several award-winning documentaries for the network’s acclaimed Signature Series; she was honored with the Lillian Gish Award, several Cine Golden Eagles[4] and the National Association for Youth's Mentor Award.
In 1989 Hammer joined Universal Television as a programming executive. Here, Hammer partnered with Vince McMahon to transform the WWF franchise into a cultural phenomenon.[citation needed] Hammer also spearheaded the launch of the successful “Sci Fi Prime,” the channel’s first full night of original programming, as well as the “I am Sci-Fi” messaging effort which redefined how viewers related to the channel and its programming.[citation needed]
When Hammer took on the role of Sci-Fi president,[5] she brought to network a mini-series in partnership with Steven Spielberg called, Steven Spielberg Presents: Taken. The project, a twenty-hour miniseries about alien abductions, garnered the best ratings Sci-Fi had seen to date and earned the channel its first major Emmy. During the six years Hammer presided over Sci-Fi, the channel's audience doubled and Sci-Fi ranked in cable's top 10 among adults 25 to 54 and 18 to 49.[6]
In 2004 Universal Television merged with NBC and Hammer became president of USA in addition to Sci-Fi.[5] As she had done at Sci-Fi, Hammer rebranded USA with “Characters Welcome,” – conveying the message that people, and “wacky but memorable characters” were at the heart of the channel’s programming.[7] USA has ranked #1 among cable networks for a record-setting eight years. After her success at Sci-Fi and USA, Hammer was named the most influential woman in cable by CableWorld magazine.[8]
In March 2008, Hammer took leadership at the new studio Universal Cable Productions. At the same time she became head of the digital networks Cloo, Chiller and Universal HD. Adding to the list in 2011, she assumed responsibility for E!, G4 and Wilshire Studios. In July 2012, under the leadership of Hammer, E! unveiled a major brand evolution of the network and relaunch of its market-leading E! Online website, both of which allowed E! to become the global destination for pop culture.[9] In September 2013, she oversaw the launch of Esquire Network, a lifestyle and entertainment network that replaced Style Network (Variety).
Hammer currently serves on the board of the Ad Council,[10] as well as the Celebration of Women’s Achievements in Television and Radio steering committee for the Paley Center for Media.[7] She also serves on the strategic planning committee for Boston University’s College of Communication, and is a mentor for Women in Film & Television.[9]
Her current plans as NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Chairman are to re-evaluate and adapt NBCUniversal channels to become less gender-based as there is a preconceived notion that many of the channels are only for women. Bravo, Hammer says, “is fortysomething, very affluent, female-plus—Franny [Bravo and Oxygen Media president Frances Berwick] hates it when anyone calls it a women’s network. There are lots of guilty-pleasure guys who watch it and a lot of co-viewing as well. E! is smack in the middle. It’s thirtysomething, it’s kind of affluent, but they’re thirtysomethings that are on their way up. There are unmarrieds, marrieds, not-yet-marrieds, employed or employable, a little younger and a little hipper, and that’s their sweet spot.”[11] She also made a controversial decision to have "male" channel, Esquire, take over the Style Network instead of "gamer network", G4, to further the individual style of NBCUniversal's networks and create content that overlaps style content while also reaching male audiences[12]
Social Activism[edit]
While at USA Network, Hammer spearheaded the “Erase the Hate” pro-social campaign, which earned a National Emmy Governor’s Award.[13] She later extended it to create “Characters Unite,” a public service program to combat hate and discrimination and promoting tolerance and acceptance. Under Hammer’s leadership, Characters Unite has grown into an award-winning, multi-platform initiative that includes on-air programming such as documentaries and themed episodes of USA series, public service announcements, digital content through the website and social media outlets, and community outreach and high school education programs, featuring a partnership with storytelling group The Moth.[9]
Hammer also created the “Visions for Tomorrow” campaign, which is an effort to spark America’s leading thinkers, organizations, and policymakers into searching for ways to solve society’s most pressing issues.[7]
Accolades[edit]
Hammer has received several awards for her work in the span of her career. She has consistently been named to The Hollywood Reporter's Power 100, an annual list of the most influential women in Hollywood.[14][15][16] She was given the National Association of Television Programming Executives’ 2007 Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award[17] and inducted into Broadcasting & Cable’s Hall of Fame the same year.[18] Hammer has also received a MUSE award for outstanding vision and achievement from New York Women in Film & Television.[19] She has been repeatedly featured on lists such as the "50 Most Powerful Women" in Fortune,[20][21] "The World’s 100 Most Powerful Women" in Forbes,[22][23] as well as the "Powers that Be" in Vanity Fair.[24] In 2012, Hammers was given the Crystal + Lucy Award for Excellence in Television by Women in Film.[25]
Praise for her social activism includes her 2012 honor by B’nai B’rith for “her commitment to initiatives confronting racism and bigotry’;[26] and she was cited by storytelling organization The Moth for “philanthropic leadership in programs to end prejudice, discrimination and bullying.” Hammer was given the 2010 Vanguard Award for Distinguished Leadership from the National Cable Television Association,[13] and the Anti-Defamation League’s Entertainment Industry Award.[27]
In 2016, Hammer was listed on Vanity Fair's New Establishment List, described as 100 “Silicon Valley hotshots, Hollywood moguls, Wall Street titans, and cultural icons.”[28]
Personal life[edit]
Hammer is an accomplished photographer, and her work has been displayed in galleries and published in Time, the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, the Los Angeles Times, and various Houghton-Mifflin and Little Brown books.[9] She resides in Westport, Connecticut with her husband,[3] Dale Heussner.[2] Her husband has one child from a previous marriage and they have one child together.[2]

Early life[edit]
Born to a Jewish family[1][2] in 1950,[3] Hammer was raised in Queens, New York, the youngest of three children. Hammer’s mother was a full-time mom; her dad, a Russian immigrant, started his own pen company. Intending to become a photojournalist, Hammer enrolled at Boston University College of Communication, earning a bachelor's degree in communications in 1971 and later a master's degree in Media Technology from the Boston University School of Education in 1975.
Career[edit]
Hammer began her career in television at WGBH-TV, the public television station in Boston, where she produced This Old House, Infinity Factory and ZOOM for PBS. She later executive-produced Good Day! for Boston's ABC affiliate, WCVB-TV.
Hammer first established herself professionally in New York as an original programming executive at Lifetime Television Network, where she executive produced several award-winning documentaries for the network’s acclaimed Signature Series; she was honored with the Lillian Gish Award, several Cine Golden Eagles[4] and the National Association for Youth's Mentor Award.
In 1989 Hammer joined Universal Television as a programming executive. Here, Hammer partnered with Vince McMahon to transform the WWF franchise into a cultural phenomenon.[citation needed] Hammer also spearheaded the launch of the successful “Sci Fi Prime,” the channel’s first full night of original programming, as well as the “I am Sci-Fi” messaging effort which redefined how viewers related to the channel and its programming.[citation needed]
When Hammer took on the role of Sci-Fi president,[5] she brought to network a mini-series in partnership with Steven Spielberg called, Steven Spielberg Presents: Taken. The project, a twenty-hour miniseries about alien abductions, garnered the best ratings Sci-Fi had seen to date and earned the channel its first major Emmy. During the six years Hammer presided over Sci-Fi, the channel's audience doubled and Sci-Fi ranked in cable's top 10 among adults 25 to 54 and 18 to 49.[6]
In 2004 Universal Television merged with NBC and Hammer became president of USA in addition to Sci-Fi.[5] As she had done at Sci-Fi, Hammer rebranded USA with “Characters Welcome,” – conveying the message that people, and “wacky but memorable characters” were at the heart of the channel’s programming.[7] USA has ranked #1 among cable networks for a record-setting eight years. After her success at Sci-Fi and USA, Hammer was named the most influential woman in cable by CableWorld magazine.[8]
In March 2008, Hammer took leadership at the new studio Universal Cable Productions. At the same time she became head of the digital networks Cloo, Chiller and Universal HD. Adding to the list in 2011, she assumed responsibility for E!, G4 and Wilshire Studios. In July 2012, under the leadership of Hammer, E! unveiled a major brand evolution of the network and relaunch of its market-leading E! Online website, both of which allowed E! to become the global destination for pop culture.[9] In September 2013, she oversaw the launch of Esquire Network, a lifestyle and entertainment network that replaced Style Network (Variety).
Hammer currently serves on the board of the Ad Council,[10] as well as the Celebration of Women’s Achievements in Television and Radio steering committee for the Paley Center for Media.[7] She also serves on the strategic planning committee for Boston University’s College of Communication, and is a mentor for Women in Film & Television.[9]
Her current plans as NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Chairman are to re-evaluate and adapt NBCUniversal channels to become less gender-based as there is a preconceived notion that many of the channels are only for women. Bravo, Hammer says, “is fortysomething, very affluent, female-plus—Franny [Bravo and Oxygen Media president Frances Berwick] hates it when anyone calls it a women’s network. There are lots of guilty-pleasure guys who watch it and a lot of co-viewing as well. E! is smack in the middle. It’s thirtysomething, it’s kind of affluent, but they’re thirtysomethings that are on their way up. There are unmarrieds, marrieds, not-yet-marrieds, employed or employable, a little younger and a little hipper, and that’s their sweet spot.”[11] She also made a controversial decision to have "male" channel, Esquire, take over the Style Network instead of "gamer network", G4, to further the individual style of NBCUniversal's networks and create content that overlaps style content while also reaching male audiences[12]
Social Activism[edit]
While at USA Network, Hammer spearheaded the “Erase the Hate” pro-social campaign, which earned a National Emmy Governor’s Award.[13] She later extended it to create “Characters Unite,” a public service program to combat hate and discrimination and promoting tolerance and acceptance. Under Hammer’s leadership, Characters Unite has grown into an award-winning, multi-platform initiative that includes on-air programming such as documentaries and themed episodes of USA series, public service announcements, digital content through the website and social media outlets, and community outreach and high school education programs, featuring a partnership with storytelling group The Moth.[9]
Hammer also created the “Visions for Tomorrow” campaign, which is an effort to spark America’s leading thinkers, organizations, and policymakers into searching for ways to solve society’s most pressing issues.[7]
Accolades[edit]
Hammer has received several awards for her work in the span of her career. She has consistently been named to The Hollywood Reporter's Power 100, an annual list of the most influential women in Hollywood.[14][15][16] She was given the National Association of Television Programming Executives’ 2007 Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award[17] and inducted into Broadcasting & Cable’s Hall of Fame the same year.[18] Hammer has also received a MUSE award for outstanding vision and achievement from New York Women in Film & Television.[19] She has been repeatedly featured on lists such as the "50 Most Powerful Women" in Fortune,[20][21] "The World’s 100 Most Powerful Women" in Forbes,[22][23] as well as the "Powers that Be" in Vanity Fair.[24] In 2012, Hammers was given the Crystal + Lucy Award for Excellence in Television by Women in Film.[25]
Praise for her social activism includes her 2012 honor by B’nai B’rith for “her commitment to initiatives confronting racism and bigotry’;[26] and she was cited by storytelling organization The Moth for “philanthropic leadership in programs to end prejudice, discrimination and bullying.” Hammer was given the 2010 Vanguard Award for Distinguished Leadership from the National Cable Television Association,[13] and the Anti-Defamation League’s Entertainment Industry Award.[27]
In 2016, Hammer was listed on Vanity Fair's New Establishment List, described as 100 “Silicon Valley hotshots, Hollywood moguls, Wall Street titans, and cultural icons.”[28]
Personal life[edit]
Hammer is an accomplished photographer, and her work has been displayed in galleries and published in Time, the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, the Los Angeles Times, and various Houghton-Mifflin and Little Brown books.[9] She resides in Westport, Connecticut with her husband,[3] Dale Heussner.[2] Her husband has one child from a previous marriage and they have one child together.[2]

Hammer first established herself professionally in New York as an original programming executive at Lifetime Television Network, where she executive produced several award-winning documentaries for the network’s acclaimed Signature Series; she was honored with the Lillian Gish Award, several Cine Golden Eagles[4] and the National Association for Youth's Mentor Award.
In 1989 Hammer joined Universal Television as a programming executive. Here, Hammer partnered with Vince McMahon to transform the WWF franchise into a cultural phenomenon.[citation needed] Hammer also spearheaded the launch of the successful “Sci Fi Prime,” the channel’s first full night of original programming, as well as the “I am Sci-Fi” messaging effort which redefined how viewers related to the channel and its programming.[citation needed]
When Hammer took on the role of Sci-Fi president,[5] she brought to network a mini-series in partnership with Steven Spielberg called, Steven Spielberg Presents: Taken. The project, a twenty-hour miniseries about alien abductions, garnered the best ratings Sci-Fi had seen to date and earned the channel its first major Emmy. During the six years Hammer presided over Sci-Fi, the channel's audience doubled and Sci-Fi ranked in cable's top 10 among adults 25 to 54 and 18 to 49.[6]
In 2004 Universal Television merged with NBC and Hammer became president of USA in addition to Sci-Fi.[5] As she had done at Sci-Fi, Hammer rebranded USA with “Characters Welcome,” – conveying the message that people, and “wacky but memorable characters” were at the heart of the channel’s programming.[7] USA has ranked #1 among cable networks for a record-setting eight years. After her success at Sci-Fi and USA, Hammer was named the most influential woman in cable by CableWorld magazine.[8]
In March 2008, Hammer took leadership at the new studio Universal Cable Productions. At the same time she became head of the digital networks Cloo, Chiller and Universal HD. Adding to the list in 2011, she assumed responsibility for E!, G4 and Wilshire Studios. In July 2012, under the leadership of Hammer, E! unveiled a major brand evolution of the network and relaunch of its market-leading E! Online website, both of which allowed E! to become the global destination for pop culture.[9] In September 2013, she oversaw the launch of Esquire Network, a lifestyle and entertainment network that replaced Style Network (Variety).
Hammer currently serves on the board of the Ad Council,[10] as well as the Celebration of Women’s Achievements in Television and Radio steering committee for the Paley Center for Media.[7] She also serves on the strategic planning committee for Boston University’s College of Communication, and is a mentor for Women in Film & Television.[9]
Her current plans as NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Chairman are to re-evaluate and adapt NBCUniversal channels to become less gender-based as there is a preconceived notion that many of the channels are only for women. Bravo, Hammer says, “is fortysomething, very affluent, female-plus—Franny [Bravo and Oxygen Media president Frances Berwick] hates it when anyone calls it a women’s network. There are lots of guilty-pleasure guys who watch it and a lot of co-viewing as well. E! is smack in the middle. It’s thirtysomething, it’s kind of affluent, but they’re thirtysomethings that are on their way up. There are unmarrieds, marrieds, not-yet-marrieds, employed or employable, a little younger and a little hipper, and that’s their sweet spot.”[11] She also made a controversial decision to have "male" channel, Esquire, take over the Style Network instead of "gamer network", G4, to further the individual style of NBCUniversal's networks and create content that overlaps style content while also reaching male audiences[12]
Social Activism[edit]
While at USA Network, Hammer spearheaded the “Erase the Hate” pro-social campaign, which earned a National Emmy Governor’s Award.[13] She later extended it to create “Characters Unite,” a public service program to combat hate and discrimination and promoting tolerance and acceptance. Under Hammer’s leadership, Characters Unite has grown into an award-winning, multi-platform initiative that includes on-air programming such as documentaries and themed episodes of USA series, public service announcements, digital content through the website and social media outlets, and community outreach and high school education programs, featuring a partnership with storytelling group The Moth.[9]
Hammer also created the “Visions for Tomorrow” campaign, which is an effort to spark America’s leading thinkers, organizations, and policymakers into searching for ways to solve society’s most pressing issues.[7]
Accolades[edit]
Hammer has received several awards for her work in the span of her career. She has consistently been named to The Hollywood Reporter's Power 100, an annual list of the most influential women in Hollywood.[14][15][16] She was given the National Association of Television Programming Executives’ 2007 Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award[17] and inducted into Broadcasting & Cable’s Hall of Fame the same year.[18] Hammer has also received a MUSE award for outstanding vision and achievement from New York Women in Film & Television.[19] She has been repeatedly featured on lists such as the "50 Most Powerful Women" in Fortune,[20][21] "The World’s 100 Most Powerful Women" in Forbes,[22][23] as well as the "Powers that Be" in Vanity Fair.[24] In 2012, Hammers was given the Crystal + Lucy Award for Excellence in Television by Women in Film.[25]
Praise for her social activism includes her 2012 honor by B’nai B’rith for “her commitment to initiatives confronting racism and bigotry’;[26] and she was cited by storytelling organization The Moth for “philanthropic leadership in programs to end prejudice, discrimination and bullying.” Hammer was given the 2010 Vanguard Award for Distinguished Leadership from the National Cable Television Association,[13] and the Anti-Defamation League’s Entertainment Industry Award.[27]
In 2016, Hammer was listed on Vanity Fair's New Establishment List, described as 100 “Silicon Valley hotshots, Hollywood moguls, Wall Street titans, and cultural icons.”[28]
Personal life[edit]
Hammer is an accomplished photographer, and her work has been displayed in galleries and published in Time, the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, the Los Angeles Times, and various Houghton-Mifflin and Little Brown books.[9] She resides in Westport, Connecticut with her husband,[3] Dale Heussner.[2] Her husband has one child from a previous marriage and they have one child together.[2]

Early life[edit]
Born to a Jewish family[1][2] in 1950,[3] Hammer was raised in Queens, New York, the youngest of three children. Hammer’s mother was a full-time mom; her dad, a Russian immigrant, started his own pen company. Intending to become a photojournalist, Hammer enrolled at Boston University College of Communication, earning a bachelor's degree in communications in 1971 and later a master's degree in Media Technology from the Boston University School of Education in 1975.

Early life[edit]
Born to a Jewish family[1][2] in 1950,[3] Hammer was raised in Queens, New York, the youngest of three children. Hammer’s mother was a full-time mom; her dad, a Russian immigrant, started his own pen company. Intending to become a photojournalist, Hammer enrolled at Boston University College of Communication, earning a bachelor's degree in communications in 1971 and later a master's degree in Media Technology from the Boston University School of Education in 1975.
Career[edit]
Hammer began her career in television at WGBH-TV, the public television station in Boston, where she produced This Old House, Infinity Factory and ZOOM for PBS. She later executive-produced Good Day! for Boston's ABC affiliate, WCVB-TV.
Hammer first established herself professionally in New York as an original programming executive at Lifetime Television Network, where she executive produced several award-winning documentaries for the network’s acclaimed Signature Series; she was honored with the Lillian Gish Award, several Cine Golden Eagles[4] and the National Association for Youth's Mentor Award.
In 1989 Hammer joined Universal Television as a programming executive. Here, Hammer partnered with Vince McMahon to transform the WWF franchise into a cultural phenomenon.[citation needed] Hammer also spearheaded the launch of the successful “Sci Fi Prime,” the channel’s first full night of original programming, as well as the “I am Sci-Fi” messaging effort which redefined how viewers related to the channel and its programming.[citation needed]
When Hammer took on the role of Sci-Fi president,[5] she brought to network a mini-series in partnership with Steven Spielberg called, Steven Spielberg Presents: Taken. The project, a twenty-hour miniseries about alien abductions, garnered the best ratings Sci-Fi had seen to date and earned the channel its first major Emmy. During the six years Hammer presided over Sci-Fi, the channel's audience doubled and Sci-Fi ranked in cable's top 10 among adults 25 to 54 and 18 to 49.[6]
In 2004 Universal Television merged with NBC and Hammer became president of USA in addition to Sci-Fi.[5] As she had done at Sci-Fi, Hammer rebranded USA with “Characters Welcome,” – conveying the message that people, and “wacky but memorable characters” were at the heart of the channel’s programming.[7] USA has ranked #1 among cable networks for a record-setting eight years. After her success at Sci-Fi and USA, Hammer was named the most influential woman in cable by CableWorld magazine.[8]
In March 2008, Hammer took leadership at the new studio Universal Cable Productions. At the same time she became head of the digital networks Cloo, Chiller and Universal HD. Adding to the list in 2011, she assumed responsibility for E!, G4 and Wilshire Studios. In July 2012, under the leadership of Hammer, E! unveiled a major brand evolution of the network and relaunch of its market-leading E! Online website, both of which allowed E! to become the global destination for pop culture.[9] In September 2013, she oversaw the launch of Esquire Network, a lifestyle and entertainment network that replaced Style Network (Variety).
Hammer currently serves on the board of the Ad Council,[10] as well as the Celebration of Women’s Achievements in Television and Radio steering committee for the Paley Center for Media.[7] She also serves on the strategic planning committee for Boston University’s College of Communication, and is a mentor for Women in Film & Television.[9]
Her current plans as NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Chairman are to re-evaluate and adapt NBCUniversal channels to become less gender-based as there is a preconceived notion that many of the channels are only for women. Bravo, Hammer says, “is fortysomething, very affluent, female-plus—Franny [Bravo and Oxygen Media president Frances Berwick] hates it when anyone calls it a women’s network. There are lots of guilty-pleasure guys who watch it and a lot of co-viewing as well. E! is smack in the middle. It’s thirtysomething, it’s kind of affluent, but they’re thirtysomethings that are on their way up. There are unmarrieds, marrieds, not-yet-marrieds, employed or employable, a little younger and a little hipper, and that’s their sweet spot.”[11] She also made a controversial decision to have "male" channel, Esquire, take over the Style Network instead of "gamer network", G4, to further the individual style of NBCUniversal's networks and create content that overlaps style content while also reaching male audiences[12]
Social Activism[edit]
While at USA Network, Hammer spearheaded the “Erase the Hate” pro-social campaign, which earned a National Emmy Governor’s Award.[13] She later extended it to create “Characters Unite,” a public service program to combat hate and discrimination and promoting tolerance and acceptance. Under Hammer’s leadership, Characters Unite has grown into an award-winning, multi-platform initiative that includes on-air programming such as documentaries and themed episodes of USA series, public service announcements, digital content through the website and social media outlets, and community outreach and high school education programs, featuring a partnership with storytelling group The Moth.[9]
Hammer also created the “Visions for Tomorrow” campaign, which is an effort to spark America’s leading thinkers, organizations, and policymakers into searching for ways to solve society’s most pressing issues.[7]
Accolades[edit]
Hammer has received several awards for her work in the span of her career. She has consistently been named to The Hollywood Reporter's Power 100, an annual list of the most influential women in Hollywood.[14][15][16] She was given the National Association of Television Programming Executives’ 2007 Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award[17] and inducted into Broadcasting & Cable’s Hall of Fame the same year.[18] Hammer has also received a MUSE award for outstanding vision and achievement from New York Women in Film & Television.[19] She has been repeatedly featured on lists such as the "50 Most Powerful Women" in Fortune,[20][21] "The World’s 100 Most Powerful Women" in Forbes,[22][23] as well as the "Powers that Be" in Vanity Fair.[24] In 2012, Hammers was given the Crystal + Lucy Award for Excellence in Television by Women in Film.[25]
Praise for her social activism includes her 2012 honor by B’nai B’rith for “her commitment to initiatives confronting racism and bigotry’;[26] and she was cited by storytelling organization The Moth for “philanthropic leadership in programs to end prejudice, discrimination and bullying.” Hammer was given the 2010 Vanguard Award for Distinguished Leadership from the National Cable Television Association,[13] and the Anti-Defamation League’s Entertainment Industry Award.[27]
In 2016, Hammer was listed on Vanity Fair's New Establishment List, described as 100 “Silicon Valley hotshots, Hollywood moguls, Wall Street titans, and cultural icons.”[28]
Personal life[edit]
Hammer is an accomplished photographer, and her work has been displayed in galleries and published in Time, the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, the Los Angeles Times, and various Houghton-Mifflin and Little Brown books.[9] She resides in Westport, Connecticut with her husband,[3] Dale Heussner.[2] Her husband has one child from a previous marriage and they have one child together.[2]

Bonnie Hammer, the new head of seven cable channels at NBC Universal
Photo: Adam Fedderly 


It’s hard enough to persuade one person to fall in love with a product. Now try 3 million, seven nights a week. Such is the power of Bonnie Hammer, newly minted head of seven cable channels at NBC Universal. In 2003 she revived the SyFy channel, luring in viewers with Ron Moore’s revamped Battlestar Galactica. Then Hammer took over as president of the USA Network, where she linked beefy wrestlers (WWE) to quivering neurotics (Monk) under the chirpy rubric “Characters Welcome.” And it worked: USA has been the number one basic cable network for five years, valued at $11.7 billion. The 60-year-old Queens native explains her plans to make other NBC Universal channels grab your eyeballs.
Wired: Lots of entertainment executives claim to make decisions with their gut. You, however, have a checklist—a “brand filter.” 
Bonnie Hammer: For USA, it’s three things: Is there a slightly flawed but likable lead character? Is there a strong drama with a dollop of humor? Is it blue skies? I mean that literally and figuratively. Exterior shots showing blue skies add a levity and brightness to each show. You also have to be able to describe it in a single sentence: Royal Pains—it’s Marcus Welby in the Hamptons.
Wired: So where did “Characters Welcome” fit in? 
Bonnie Hammer: We had to figure out a way to tie together the wrestlers of the WWE with the furry critters of the Westminster Kennel Club and the quirky characters on Monk. Every show has that crucial element, but we tweak each one so it’s distinct. We’ve built a loyal fan base because viewers believe we’ll make them happy.
Wired: What about networks with other vibes? Will you have a checklist for each? 
Bonnie Hammer: Channel brand is so key. I think most broadcasters choose their series, then try to make a mosaic of a schedule. We’re the opposite—we will not choose a show if it doesn’t fit exactly into our jigsaw puzzle.
Wired: You have the game-driven G4 in your stable now. What can you do with that? 
Bonnie Hammer: I’m just trying to get my arms around it. The kids who are gaming aren’t watching television. So you have to figure out what their psychographic is—what they like, what they want. It will be a challenge.
Wired: What was your take on the Saturday Night Live skit about a game show that asks, “What is Burn Notice?” That was one of your big hits at USA, but the joke was that no one had heard of it. 
Bonnie Hammer: The general feel was, we made it. SNL is dissing us! We’re in the mainstream!

Early life[edit]
Born to a Jewish family[1][2] in 1950,[3] Hammer was raised in Queens, New York, the youngest of three children. Hammer’s mother was a full-time mom; her dad, a Russian immigrant, started his own pen company. Intending to become a photojournalist, Hammer enrolled at Boston University College of Communication, earning a bachelor's degree in communications in 1971 and later a master's degree in Media Technology from the Boston University School of Education in 1975.
Career[edit]
Hammer began her career in television at WGBH-TV, the public television station in Boston, where she produced This Old House, Infinity Factory and ZOOM for PBS. She later executive-produced Good Day! for Boston's ABC affiliate, WCVB-TV.
Hammer first established herself professionally in New York as an original programming executive at Lifetime Television Network, where she executive produced several award-winning documentaries for the network’s acclaimed Signature Series; she was honored with the Lillian Gish Award, several Cine Golden Eagles[4] and the National Association for Youth's Mentor Award.
In 1989 Hammer joined Universal Television as a programming executive. Here, Hammer partnered with Vince McMahon to transform the WWF franchise into a cultural phenomenon.[citation needed] Hammer also spearheaded the launch of the successful “Sci Fi Prime,” the channel’s first full night of original programming, as well as the “I am Sci-Fi” messaging effort which redefined how viewers related to the channel and its programming.[citation needed]
When Hammer took on the role of Sci-Fi president,[5] she brought to network a mini-series in partnership with Steven Spielberg called, Steven Spielberg Presents: Taken. The project, a twenty-hour miniseries about alien abductions, garnered the best ratings Sci-Fi had seen to date and earned the channel its first major Emmy. During the six years Hammer presided over Sci-Fi, the channel's audience doubled and Sci-Fi ranked in cable's top 10 among adults 25 to 54 and 18 to 49.[6]
In 2004 Universal Television merged with NBC and Hammer became president of USA in addition to Sci-Fi.[5] As she had done at Sci-Fi, Hammer rebranded USA with “Characters Welcome,” – conveying the message that people, and “wacky but memorable characters” were at the heart of the channel’s programming.[7] USA has ranked #1 among cable networks for a record-setting eight years. After her success at Sci-Fi and USA, Hammer was named the most influential woman in cable by CableWorld magazine.[8]
In March 2008, Hammer took leadership at the new studio Universal Cable Productions. At the same time she became head of the digital networks Cloo, Chiller and Universal HD. Adding to the list in 2011, she assumed responsibility for E!, G4 and Wilshire Studios. In July 2012, under the leadership of Hammer, E! unveiled a major brand evolution of the network and relaunch of its market-leading E! Online website, both of which allowed E! to become the global destination for pop culture.[9] In September 2013, she oversaw the launch of Esquire Network, a lifestyle and entertainment network that replaced Style Network (Variety).
Hammer currently serves on the board of the Ad Council,[10] as well as the Celebration of Women’s Achievements in Television and Radio steering committee for the Paley Center for Media.[7] She also serves on the strategic planning committee for Boston University’s College of Communication, and is a mentor for Women in Film & Television.[9]
Her current plans as NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Chairman are to re-evaluate and adapt NBCUniversal channels to become less gender-based as there is a preconceived notion that many of the channels are only for women. Bravo, Hammer says, “is fortysomething, very affluent, female-plus—Franny [Bravo and Oxygen Media president Frances Berwick] hates it when anyone calls it a women’s network. There are lots of guilty-pleasure guys who watch it and a lot of co-viewing as well. E! is smack in the middle. It’s thirtysomething, it’s kind of affluent, but they’re thirtysomethings that are on their way up. There are unmarrieds, marrieds, not-yet-marrieds, employed or employable, a little younger and a little hipper, and that’s their sweet spot.”[11] She also made a controversial decision to have "male" channel, Esquire, take over the Style Network instead of "gamer network", G4, to further the individual style of NBCUniversal's networks and create content that overlaps style content while also reaching male audiences[12]
Social Activism[edit]
While at USA Network, Hammer spearheaded the “Erase the Hate” pro-social campaign, which earned a National Emmy Governor’s Award.[13] She later extended it to create “Characters Unite,” a public service program to combat hate and discrimination and promoting tolerance and acceptance. Under Hammer’s leadership, Characters Unite has grown into an award-winning, multi-platform initiative that includes on-air programming such as documentaries and themed episodes of USA series, public service announcements, digital content through the website and social media outlets, and community outreach and high school education programs, featuring a partnership with storytelling group The Moth.[9]
Hammer also created the “Visions for Tomorrow” campaign, which is an effort to spark America’s leading thinkers, organizations, and policymakers into searching for ways to solve society’s most pressing issues.[7]
Accolades[edit]
Hammer has received several awards for her work in the span of her career. She has consistently been named to The Hollywood Reporter's Power 100, an annual list of the most influential women in Hollywood.[14][15][16] She was given the National Association of Television Programming Executives’ 2007 Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award[17] and inducted into Broadcasting & Cable’s Hall of Fame the same year.[18] Hammer has also received a MUSE award for outstanding vision and achievement from New York Women in Film & Television.[19] She has been repeatedly featured on lists such as the "50 Most Powerful Women" in Fortune,[20][21] "The World’s 100 Most Powerful Women" in Forbes,[22][23] as well as the "Powers that Be" in Vanity Fair.[24] In 2012, Hammers was given the Crystal + Lucy Award for Excellence in Television by Women in Film.[25]
Praise for her social activism includes her 2012 honor by B’nai B’rith for “her commitment to initiatives confronting racism and bigotry’;[26] and she was cited by storytelling organization The Moth for “philanthropic leadership in programs to end prejudice, discrimination and bullying.” Hammer was given the 2010 Vanguard Award for Distinguished Leadership from the National Cable Television Association,[13] and the Anti-Defamation League’s Entertainment Industry Award.[27]
In 2016, Hammer was listed on Vanity Fair's New Establishment List, described as 100 “Silicon Valley hotshots, Hollywood moguls, Wall Street titans, and cultural icons.”[28]
Personal life[edit]
Hammer is an accomplished photographer, and her work has been displayed in galleries and published in Time, the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, the Los Angeles Times, and various Houghton-Mifflin and Little Brown books.[9] She resides in Westport, Connecticut with her husband,[3] Dale Heussner.[2] Her husband has one child from a previous marriage and they have one child together.[2]

Early life[edit]
Born to a Jewish family[1][2] in 1950,[3] Hammer was raised in Queens, New York, the youngest of three children. Hammer’s mother was a full-time mom; her dad, a Russian immigrant, started his own pen company. Intending to become a photojournalist, Hammer enrolled at Boston University College of Communication, earning a bachelor's degree in communications in 1971 and later a master's degree in Media Technology from the Boston University School of Education in 1975.
Career[edit]
Hammer began her career in television at WGBH-TV, the public television station in Boston, where she produced This Old House, Infinity Factory and ZOOM for PBS. She later executive-produced Good Day! for Boston's ABC affiliate, WCVB-TV.
Hammer first established herself professionally in New York as an original programming executive at Lifetime Television Network, where she executive produced several award-winning documentaries for the network’s acclaimed Signature Series; she was honored with the Lillian Gish Award, several Cine Golden Eagles[4] and the National Association for Youth's Mentor Award.
In 1989 Hammer joined Universal Television as a programming executive. Here, Hammer partnered with Vince McMahon to transform the WWF franchise into a cultural phenomenon.[citation needed] Hammer also spearheaded the launch of the successful “Sci Fi Prime,” the channel’s first full night of original programming, as well as the “I am Sci-Fi” messaging effort which redefined how viewers related to the channel and its programming.[citation needed]
When Hammer took on the role of Sci-Fi president,[5] she brought to network a mini-series in partnership with Steven Spielberg called, Steven Spielberg Presents: Taken. The project, a twenty-hour miniseries about alien abductions, garnered the best ratings Sci-Fi had seen to date and earned the channel its first major Emmy. During the six years Hammer presided over Sci-Fi, the channel's audience doubled and Sci-Fi ranked in cable's top 10 among adults 25 to 54 and 18 to 49.[6]
In 2004 Universal Television merged with NBC and Hammer became president of USA in addition to Sci-Fi.[5] As she had done at Sci-Fi, Hammer rebranded USA with “Characters Welcome,” – conveying the message that people, and “wacky but memorable characters” were at the heart of the channel’s programming.[7] USA has ranked #1 among cable networks for a record-setting eight years. After her success at Sci-Fi and USA, Hammer was named the most influential woman in cable by CableWorld magazine.[8]
In March 2008, Hammer took leadership at the new studio Universal Cable Productions. At the same time she became head of the digital networks Cloo, Chiller and Universal HD. Adding to the list in 2011, she assumed responsibility for E!, G4 and Wilshire Studios. In July 2012, under the leadership of Hammer, E! unveiled a major brand evolution of the network and relaunch of its market-leading E! Online website, both of which allowed E! to become the global destination for pop culture.[9] In September 2013, she oversaw the launch of Esquire Network, a lifestyle and entertainment network that replaced Style Network (Variety).
Hammer currently serves on the board of the Ad Council,[10] as well as the Celebration of Women’s Achievements in Television and Radio steering committee for the Paley Center for Media.[7] She also serves on the strategic planning committee for Boston University’s College of Communication, and is a mentor for Women in Film & Television.[9]
Her current plans as NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Chairman are to re-evaluate and adapt NBCUniversal channels to become less gender-based as there is a preconceived notion that many of the channels are only for women. Bravo, Hammer says, “is fortysomething, very affluent, female-plus—Franny [Bravo and Oxygen Media president Frances Berwick] hates it when anyone calls it a women’s network. There are lots of guilty-pleasure guys who watch it and a lot of co-viewing as well. E! is smack in the middle. It’s thirtysomething, it’s kind of affluent, but they’re thirtysomethings that are on their way up. There are unmarrieds, marrieds, not-yet-marrieds, employed or employable, a little younger and a little hipper, and that’s their sweet spot.”[11] She also made a controversial decision to have "male" channel, Esquire, take over the Style Network instead of "gamer network", G4, to further the individual style of NBCUniversal's networks and create content that overlaps style content while also reaching male audiences[12]
Social Activism[edit]
While at USA Network, Hammer spearheaded the “Erase the Hate” pro-social campaign, which earned a National Emmy Governor’s Award.[13] She later extended it to create “Characters Unite,” a public service program to combat hate and discrimination and promoting tolerance and acceptance. Under Hammer’s leadership, Characters Unite has grown into an award-winning, multi-platform initiative that includes on-air programming such as documentaries and themed episodes of USA series, public service announcements, digital content through the website and social media outlets, and community outreach and high school education programs, featuring a partnership with storytelling group The Moth.[9]
Hammer also created the “Visions for Tomorrow” campaign, which is an effort to spark America’s leading thinkers, organizations, and policymakers into searching for ways to solve society’s most pressing issues.[7]
Accolades[edit]
Hammer has received several awards for her work in the span of her career. She has consistently been named to The Hollywood Reporter's Power 100, an annual list of the most influential women in Hollywood.[14][15][16] She was given the National Association of Television Programming Executives’ 2007 Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award[17] and inducted into Broadcasting & Cable’s Hall of Fame the same year.[18] Hammer has also received a MUSE award for outstanding vision and achievement from New York Women in Film & Television.[19] She has been repeatedly featured on lists such as the "50 Most Powerful Women" in Fortune,[20][21] "The World’s 100 Most Powerful Women" in Forbes,[22][23] as well as the "Powers that Be" in Vanity Fair.[24] In 2012, Hammers was given the Crystal + Lucy Award for Excellence in Television by Women in Film.[25]
Praise for her social activism includes her 2012 honor by B’nai B’rith for “her commitment to initiatives confronting racism and bigotry’;[26] and she was cited by storytelling organization The Moth for “philanthropic leadership in programs to end prejudice, discrimination and bullying.” Hammer was given the 2010 Vanguard Award for Distinguished Leadership from the National Cable Television Association,[13] and the Anti-Defamation League’s Entertainment Industry Award.[27]
In 2016, Hammer was listed on Vanity Fair's New Establishment List, described as 100 “Silicon Valley hotshots, Hollywood moguls, Wall Street titans, and cultural icons.”[28]
Personal life[edit]
Hammer is an accomplished photographer, and her work has been displayed in galleries and published in Time, the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, the Los Angeles Times, and various Houghton-Mifflin and Little Brown books.[9] She resides in Westport, Connecticut with her husband,[3] Dale Heussner.[2] Her husband has one child from a previous marriage and they have one child together.[2]

There are unmarrieds, marrieds, not-yet-marrieds, employed or employable, a little younger and a little hipper, and that’s their sweet spot.”[11] She also made a controversial decision to have "male" channel, Esquire, take over the Style Network instead of "gamer network", G4, to further the individual style of NBCUniversal's networks and create content that overlaps style content while also reaching male audiences[12]
Social Activism[edit]
While at USA Network, Hammer spearheaded the “Erase the Hate” pro-social campaign, which earned a National Emmy Governor’s Award.[13] She later extended it to create “Characters Unite,” a public service program to combat hate and discrimination and promoting tolerance and acceptance. Under Hammer’s leadership, Characters Unite has grown into an award-winning, multi-platform initiative that includes on-air programming such as documentaries and themed episodes of USA series, public service announcements, digital content through the website and social media outlets, and community outreach and high school education programs, featuring a partnership with storytelling group The Moth.[9]
Hammer also created the “Visions for Tomorrow” campaign, which is an effort to spark America’s leading thinkers, organizations, and policymakers into searching for ways to solve society’s most pressing issues.[7]
Accolades[edit]
Hammer has received several awards for her work in the span of her career. She has consistently been named to The Hollywood Reporter's Power 100, an annual list of the most influential women in Hollywood.[14][15][16] She was given the National Association of Television Programming Executives’ 2007 Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award[17] and inducted into Broadcasting & Cable’s Hall of Fame the same year.[18] Hammer has also received a MUSE award for outstanding vision and achievement from New York Women in Film & Television.[19] She has been repeatedly featured on lists such as the "50 Most Powerful Women" in Fortune,[20][21] "The World’s 100 Most Powerful Women" in Forbes,[22][23] as well as the "Powers that Be" in Vanity Fair.[24] In 2012, Hammers was given the Crystal + Lucy Award for Excellence in Television by Women in Film.[25]
Praise for her social activism includes her 2012 honor by B’nai B’rith for “her commitment to initiatives confronting racism and bigotry’;[26] and she was cited by storytelling organization The Moth for “philanthropic leadership in programs to end prejudice, discrimination and bullying.” Hammer was given the 2010 Vanguard Award for Distinguished Leadership from the National Cable Television Association,[13] and the Anti-Defamation League’s Entertainment Industry Award.[27]
In 2016, Hammer was listed on Vanity Fair's New Establishment List, described as 100 “Silicon Valley hotshots, Hollywood moguls, Wall Street titans, and cultural icons.”[28]
Personal life[edit]
Hammer is an accomplished photographer, and her work has been displayed in galleries and published in Time, the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, the Los Angeles Times, and various Houghton-Mifflin and Little Brown books.[9] She resides in Westport, Connecticut with her husband,[3] Dale Heussner.[2] Her husband has one child from a previous marriage and they have one child together.[2]

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
