Cerberus Partners Fund Being Restructured

Cerberus Capital Management, whose daring acquisition of Chrysler proved disastrous, is restructuring one of its investment funds amid a wave of requests from clients who want their money back.But Cerberus, run by Stephen A. Feinberg, is not allowing investors to pull their cash from the fund just yet. Those who have submitted redemption requests can choose to have their assets moved into a special-purpose vehicle that will be liquidated over time as market conditions improve, Mr. Feinberg said in a letter to clients last Friday. Investors in that new vehicle have been told they will not pay management fees.The original fund, Cerberus Partners L.P., is expected to be fully liquidated by 2013 and represents less than 10 percent of the firm’s total assets under management.Investors who want to stick with Cerberus can receive cash as the Cerberus Partners fund is liquidated or have the proceeds moved into a new fund, Cerberus Partners II, with greatly reduced fees. The original fund lost 21 percent of its value last year, and more than half of its investors asked to withdraw.

“We are embarrassed and disappointed by our 2008 performance, and we feel an obligation to you to turn this around,” Mr. Feinberg said in the letter. “But we just don’t know when and how much pain we must take before that happens.”

Since Mr. Feinberg started the firm in 1992, Cerberus has had only one losing quarter. But, 2008 proved a bad year for many hedge funds as credit markets froze and stocks crashed.His comments differ markedly from his confident tone in September, when he told investors, “None of our problem positions are large enough to create a real return problem for the fund.” Continue reading the main story

Those positions included prominent bets on Chrysler, GMAC and the mortgage company Residential Capital. Cerberus invested nearly $3 billion in Chrysler and GMAC and a significant portion has been written down. The publicity surrounding those companies and their federal bailouts has also taken a toll on Cerberus’s reputation.
