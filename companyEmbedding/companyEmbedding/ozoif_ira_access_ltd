Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing. 



1


        Modified gross adjusted income (MAGI) is calculated by subtracting certain expenses and allowable adjustments from gross income. To determine your MAGI, contact your tax advisor. 
      



2


        Future contribution limits may be adjusted for cost-of-living increases. Contributions for the current tax year must be made by April 15 of the following year, unless that date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. In those cases, the due date is delayed until the next business day.

Expand all


  SIMPLE IRA Eligibility  











Eligible employers
Businesses with 100 or fewer employees, including state and local governments and tax-exempt organizations, are eligible for SIMPLE IRAs.
Eligible employees
Any employee who earns $5,000 during any two preceding years and who is expected to earn $5,000 in the current year is eligible; certain employees can be excluded. The employer may also specify less restrictive eligibility requirements on the SIMPLE adoption agreement to expand the group of employees who are eligible.
 










  SIMPLE IRA Flexible Contributions  











Employer contributions














May be changed annually




 






Minimum contribution required for all eligible employees earning at least $5,000 during the year:

Dollar-for-dollar match up to 3% of pay (which may be reduced to as low as 1% for 2 of every 5 years); elective contribution OR
2% of gross pay; non-elective contribution





 


























For 2017, $25,000 is the maximum annual allocation to a participant’s account ($12,500 deferral, plus $12,500 maximum match; $3,000 catch-up contribution and $3,000 matching contribution, if applicable). Limited to 3% of compensation. Please note that compensation of at least $416,667 is required for the $12,500 maximum match.
The compensation on which the employer calculates the 2% of gross pay contribution is limited to $270,000 (for non-elective contributions only), making the maximum non-elective contribution $5,400 (2% of $270,000).
All employer contributions are immediately vested.













Participant deferrals

For 2017, the maximum annual participant deferral is $12,500; the maximum annual participant deferral for those 50 or older is $15,500.
All participant contributions are immediately vested.
The participant controls the distributions.

 










  SIMPLE IRA Low-Cost Pricing  












$10 per participant setup fee
$10 per participant annual maintenance fee
May be paid by employer or deducted from participant accounts
The employer may be eligible for a federal tax credit of up to $500 a year to help cover costs in the first three years.











  SIMPLE IRA Taxes and Testing  












Participant deferrals and earnings grow tax-free until withdrawn at retirement.
Employer contributions are not subject to Social Security/Medicare (FICA) or Federal Unemployment (FUTA).
Deferrals are reported on W-2 forms and subject to FICA, FUTA and Railroad Retirement Tax (RRTA).
No IRS 5500 reporting or testing is required.











  SIMPLE IRA SIMPLE Administration  











Limited fiduciary responsibility

Fiduciaries have limited liability since Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are set up for each eligible employee, and participants control their own investment choices.
American Funds education materials are available to participants on retirement and investment issues.

 








Establishment and funding deadlines











Plan establishment – SIMPLE plans must be established by October 1 of the current calendar year, provided a SIMPLE IRA was not previously maintained (exceptions may apply for new employers). However, there is no specific deadline by which American Funds must receive the SIMPLE Adoption Agreement, application and/or check. The plan can be established as long as the employer signed the adoption agreement on or before October 1 of the applicable year.



 






Funding

Participant deferrals: The employer must deposit the elective deferrals into each participant’s SIMPLE IRA as of the earliest date on which those contributions can reasonably be segregated from the employer’s general assets, but in no case later than the close of the 30-day period following the last day of the month in which the money was withheld. Because SIMPLE plans have fewer than 100 participants, SIMPLE IRA sponsors can take advantage of the 7-day safe harbor rule. This rule allows them to meet plan asset rules if they deposit employee contributions to the plan’s trust account within 7 business days of being withheld from employee paychecks. If employers don’t meet the safe harbor, however, they must comply with the 30-day rule.
Employer contributions: The employer’s tax filing deadline (including extensions).






 






Making investments











Employers are required to submit investments electronically through our Online Group Investments website, which simplifies the contribution process and offers the following benefits:

Electronic, paperless process. Contributions are made with the click of a button from the company bank account. Access transactional history and update participant information anytime.
More timely contributions. A quicker online contribution process makes it easier to comply with retirement plan funding deadlines. No mailing and handling time required.
Security. Keep transactions safe and secure through our website data security rather than risking lost or misdirected mail.
Flexibility. Employers can choose from a variety of payroll roster creation methods to find the one that fits their needs. Online processing allows the employer to work around his or her schedule.






 






Participants can monitor their investments and make exchanges via our 24-hour voice response system or the American Funds website.




 






The participant controls the distributions.




 






Aggregating accounts
Aggregation of participant IRA accounts under a SIMPLE IRA plan depends on the plan agreement selected by the plan sponsor. When a plan sponsor signs an American Funds prototype agreement, all plan contributions are required to come to American Funds. When a sponsor selects another prototype of an IRA Model Agreement, some of the contributions may come to American Funds, but the participants are not required to establish an account with American Funds. As a result, accounts will be aggregated as follows:

Using the American Funds prototype SIMPLE IRA plan agreement will cause the participant account values to be aggregated for reduced sales charges on Class A shares. When the group assets reach a breakpoint, all plan participants benefit from the reduced sales charge. Participants’ accounts will not be linked with personal accounts.
When the plan sponsor does not use an AFD prototype agreement for the plan, the participants’ accounts will be linked to any other personal accounts they may have with American Funds. This plan may be advantageous for participants already invested in American Funds or those who plan to establish personal accounts in the future.

Retirement Planning










Rollovers
Rolling over your retirement plan assets when you leave a job gives your savings the potential for continued growth. Learn about the benefits of rollover IRAs, and about other options for your retirement plan money.
Leaving a job or retiring is a big change in your life. A rollover IRA gives your money the potential to keep growing. Of course, a rollover IRA is not the only option you have. You should carefully compare all your options to make the best choice for your situation.

Roll Your Money to an IRA
Moving your retirement plan assets into a rollover IRA not only helps you keep the same tax benefits, it also offers a number of other advantages.

















Why Choose a Rollover


















You keep the same tax benefits.
A traditional IRA gives your money the potential to keep growing tax-deferred. A Roth IRA — like a Roth account in a 401(k) or 403(b) — can provide tax-free growth potential and tax-free withdrawals.



 






You avoid paying taxes and penalties.
By not cashing out, you won’t have to pay taxes or withdrawal penalties.



 






You take control of your money. 
Rollover IRAs generally aren’t subject to as many rules and restrictions as employer-sponsored retirement plans. You’ll have more access to your money.




 






You have a wider choice of investments.
Instead of being limited to the options in your employer’s plan, rollover IRAs allow you to choose from a huge array of investments.




 






You can consolidate your retirement investments.
Keeping track of accounts from previous employers can be difficult. You can combine them into one account with a rollover IRA.




 






You can continue making contributions to a rollover IRA.
Income limits may apply for Roth IRAs. The maximum amount you can contribute is $5,500 for 2017. If you’re 50 or older, you can contribute up to $6,500 in 2017. Of course, you don’t have to roll over money to open an IRA.




 






You can avoid required minimum distributions (RMDs).
RMDs are not mandatory for Roth IRAs. However, you’re generally required to make annual withdrawals from employer plan accounts and traditional IRAs once you reach age 70½.




 









A Few Things to Keep in Mind 

















You can avoid mandatory income tax withholding with a direct rollover.
Make sure the rollover funds don’t come to you. The money should go directly from your old plan’s trustee to your rollover IRA’s trustee or custodian.




 






If you choose an indirect rollover, income taxes will be withheld.
You can still initiate a rollover if you request a cash distribution. However, 20% of the taxable portion of your distribution is withheld from your distribution for income taxes.
You must then roll over the money into an IRA within 60 days of receiving your distribution if you want to keep the tax benefits.

If you replace the amount withheld, you can roll over your entire account value. (Your withholding amount will be refunded by the IRS when you file your taxes.)





 






Know what is taxable and what is not.
When you make withdrawals from traditional IRAs, the money is taxable. With Roth IRAs, you already paid taxes on money going in, but qualified withdrawals, including earnings, aren’t taxable.

Money in a Roth 401(k) or 403(b) account can be rolled into a Roth IRA. Non-Roth accounts can be rolled into a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Rollovers to Roth IRAs from non-Roth accounts are taxable.




 









 

Move Your Money to Your New Plan
Moving your money from old plan into your new employer’s plan may be an option to consider. Be sure to review new employer’s policy on rollovers from other plans.










Why Roll to Your New Plan
Rolling your money into a new employer’s plan gives your retirement assets the opportunity to continue growing tax-deferred. It’s also convenient to have your assets combined into one account.

Your new plan may provide additional benefits, such as:












Automatic investing. If your new plan allows employee deferrals, you can take advantage of payroll deductions to regularly contribute to your retirement account. You may be able to contribute up to $18,000 for 2017.



 






Extra contributions. If you’re age 50 or older and your plan allows employee deferrals, the plan may also allow you to contribute even more — up to an additional $6,000 for 2017.



 









A Few Things to Keep in Mind












Your new employer may have rollover restrictions. 
Your new plan may not accept rollovers from certain types of plans, or it may not accept Roth or other after-tax money.



 






You can avoid mandatory income tax withholding with a direct rollover.
Make sure the rollover funds don’t come to you. The money should go directly from your old plan’s trustee to your new plan’s trustee.

If you have a Roth account, check with your new employer to see if the plan accepts Roth rollovers. If the plan does not, you can roll this money into a Roth IRA.



 






If you choose an indirect rollover, income taxes will be withheld. 
You can still initiate a rollover if you request a cash distribution. However, 20% of the taxable portion of your distribution is withheld for income taxes.

You must then roll over the money into the new plan within 60 days of receiving your distribution if you want to keep the tax benefits.

If you replace the amount withheld, you can roll over your entire account value. (Your withholding amount will be refunded by the IRS when you file your taxes.) If you don’t replace the amount withheld, it will be considered a distribution subject to taxes and possible penalties.




 






You may not be able to roll your money into your new plan right away. 
Some employers may require a waiting period before you can roll your money into the plan.




 






Your investment choices will be limited.
Your investment choices are limited to what is offered in your new plan.




 






You’ll have to follow the rules of the new plan.
Participating in your new plan means you’re subject to new investment, exchange and withdrawal rules.




 






You can also save outside the plan.
Participating in your employer’s plan isn’t the only way to save and receive tax-deferral benefits. If you want to put away additional money for retirement, an IRA is another great way to save.




 









 

Keep Your Money in Your Old Plan


If you’re undecided about what to do with your retirement plan account when you leave your job, keeping it where it is may be a temporary solution. Check with your employer to review how your plan works.












Why Keep Your Money Where It Is











You will maintain your tax benefits.
As long as you keep your assets in the plan, your account can continue to grow tax-deferred. Roth accounts provide the potential for tax-free distributions.




 






You will avoid taxes and penalties.
By not cashing out, you won’t have to pay taxes or early withdrawal penalties.




 






You keep your money invested.
If you’re satisfied with your plan’s provider, you can keep your assets in the same investments.




 









A Few Things to Keep in Mind












You can’t continue to contribute.
Because you’re no longer an employee, you’re no longer eligible to make contributions to that account.




 






Your investment choices will be limited.
Your investment options are limited to what is offered in the plan.




 






The rules of the plan will still apply.
Keeping your account in the plan means you’re still subject to its rules. Your ability to choose investments, make exchanges between investments, or make withdrawals may be restricted.

Also, you’ll generally have to take required minimum distributions (RMDs) when you retire or reach age 70½, whichever is later.




 






Your balance could be cashed out or rolled into an IRA.
If your account balance is $1,000 or less at any time after you leave your job, your employer may automatically cash you out unless you elect another option within a certain time period.

If your balance is between $1,000 and $5,000, your balance may be rolled into an IRA selected by your employer. Ask your benefits department about your plan’s rules.




 









 

Cash Out Your Savings


Most financial experts advise against cashing out. However, withdrawing your plan balance does give you money to take care of current needs.












A Few Things to Keep in Mind













You may have to pay federal taxes.
Before you receive your payout, your employer must withhold 20% of the taxable portion of your distribution for federal income taxes. Depending on your income tax rate, you may owe even more on the taxable amount.

Qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts, including earnings, are tax-free. Only the earnings portion of nonqualified withdrawals from Roth accounts is taxable.

Withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free if the account was established at least 5 years before, and if you’re at least 59½ years of age or if withdrawals are made because of disability or death. Withdrawals from your non-Roth balance are generally taxable.




 






You could be subject to penalties.
If you’re under age 59½ when you cash out, you may have to pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty on the taxable portion of your distribution. If you’re 55 or older when you leave your job, withdrawals are penalty-free but still taxable. (Other exceptions may also apply.)




 












You may be hit with additional taxes.
You may owe state and local taxes on the taxable portion of your distribution.




 






You can reduce what you owe.
Instead of taking your entire account balance in cash, consider taking a distribution for just what you need. That way, you avoid paying applicable taxes and penalties on the rest of your account.

The remaining amount can keep growing tax-deferred if you leave it in the plan or roll it into an IRA or another plan. Roth accounts can be rolled only into Roth IRAs or into plans that accept Roth rollovers.

Check with your tax advisor or financial professional about the specific rules for lump-sum withdrawals.

SEP IRA










A SEP IRA is an easy, low-cost way for small-business owners to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis with the advantage of American Funds’ quality investment options and exceptional service.

An American Funds SEP plan removes many of the key obstacles that prevent small-business owners from offering a retirement plan:













Low setup and maintenance costs



 






Flexible, discretionary contribution limits









There is no requirement to make ongoing contributions, and a SEP plan can be discontinued at any time.





 






Low administrative burden









Minimal paperwork and tax filing requirements.
Online resources allow for fast, simple and secure transactions, 24 hours a day.





 






Limited fiduciary liability









Accounts are set up by eligible employees, and participants control their own investment choices.




 






One employee is enough








A SEP works even for sole proprietors.




 





Expand all



  SEP IRA Eligibility  











Eligible Employers
Businesses of any size, including sole proprietors, small companies (both for-profit and tax-exempt) and government entities, are eligible for a SEP plan.
Eligible Employees
Any employee who has worked for 3 of the past 5 years, is 21 or older, and received at least $600 in compensation from the employer during the year is eligible. Certain employees can be excluded, such as:

Union members covered by a collective bargaining agreement
Nonresident aliens with no source of U.S. income














  SEP IRA Flexible Contributions  












Contributions from the employer can vary or not be made at all, depending on profitability, cash flow or other factors. No participant contributions are allowed.
Annual allocation to participant’s account is 25% of participant’s compensation, up to a maximum of $54,000 in 20171. For self-employed individuals, contributions are based on self-employment income minus 50% of any self-employment taxes that have been paid. Self-employed individuals will need to further reduce that amount by any deductible plan contributions (effectively reducing the maximum contribution from 25% to 20%, not to exceed the annual contribution limit).
Contributions are immediately vested.












  SEP IRA Low-Cost Pricing  












$10 per participant setup fee
$10 per participant annual maintenance fee
Fees may be paid by the employer or deducted from participant accounts.
The employer may be eligible for a federal tax credit of up to $500 a year to help cover costs in the first 3 years.












  SEP IRA Taxes and Testing  












Employer contributions are deductible from pretax profits.
The maximum annual deduction is 25% of participant’s pay or $54,000 in 20171, whichever is less.
Top-heavy and 415 testing are required. A plan is top heavy if, on the determination date, the total value of the accounts of all key employees is greater than 60% of the total value of the accounts of all employees.
Annual IRS Form 5500 and Department of Labor filings are not required.












  SEP IRA Easy Administration  











Limited Fiduciary Responsibility

Fiduciaries have limited liability since Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are set up for each eligible employee, and participants control their own investment choices.
Ongoing American Funds education materials are available to participants on retirement and investment issues.










Establishment and Funding Deadlines











Plan establishment: The employer’s tax filing deadline (including extensions).



 






Funding

Employer contributions: The employer’s tax filing deadline (including extensions).





 






Making Investments











Employers submit investments electronically through our Online Group Investments website, which simplifies the contribution process and offers the following benefits:

Electronic, paperless process. Contributions are made with the click of a button from the company bank account. Access transactional history and update participant information anytime.
More timely contributions. A quicker online contribution process makes it easier to comply with retirement plan funding deadlines. No mailing and handling time required.
Security. Keep transactions safe and secure through our website data security rather than risking lost or misdirected mail.
Flexibility. Employers can choose from a variety of payroll roster creation methods to find the one that fits their needs. Online processing allows the employer to work around his or her schedule.





 






Participants can monitor their investments and make exchanges via:

24-hour voice response system 
American Funds website 





 






Aggregating Accounts











Aggregation of participant IRA accounts under a SEP plan depends on the plan agreement selected by the plan sponsor. When a plan sponsor signs an American Funds prototype agreement, all plan contributions are required to come to American Funds. When a sponsor selects another prototype of an IRA Model Agreement, some of the contributions may come to American Funds, but the participants are not required to establish an account with American Funds. As a result, accounts will be aggregated as follows:

Using the American Funds prototype SEP plan agreement will cause the participant account values to be aggregated for reduced sales charges on Class A shares. When the group assets reach a breakpoint, all plan participants benefit from the reduced sales charge. Participants’ accounts will not be linked with personal accounts.
When the plan sponsor does not use an AFD prototype agreement for the plan, the participants’ accounts will be linked to any other personal accounts they may have with American Funds. This plan may be advantageous for participants already invested in American Funds or those who plan to establish personal accounts in the future.

          All customer ratings and reviews are provided to Fidelity on a voluntary basis and are screened in accordance with the guidelines set forth in our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use. For additional information on which ratings and reviews may be posted, please refer to our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use. Featured reviews have been selected based on subjective criteria and have been reviewed by Fidelity Investments. The average rating is determined by calculating the mathematical average of all ratings that are approved for posting per the Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use, and does not include any ratings that did not meet the guidelines and were therefore not posted. Ratings and reviews are added continuously to the Web site (after a delay for screening against guidelines), and average ratings are updated dynamically as reviews are added or removed.


The ratings and experiences of customers may not be representative of the experiences of all customers or investors and are not indicative of future success. The accuracy of information included in the customer ratings and reviews cannot be guaranteed by Fidelity Investments. Customers who post ratings may be responsible for disclosing whether they have a financial interest or conflict in submitting a rating or review.
