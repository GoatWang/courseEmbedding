For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

Approximately $881.6 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, June 02, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on eleven classes in 
Morgan Stanley Capital I Trust 2011-C3, Commercial Mortgage 
Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2011-C3 as follows:

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes, A-3, A-4, 
A-J, B, C, D, E, and F, were 
affirmed because the transaction's key metrics, including 
Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed 
debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the transaction's Herfindahl 
Index (Herf), are within acceptable ranges.




The rating on the P&I class, G, was affirmed because the 
ratings are consistent with Moody's expected loss.




The rating on the IO class, X-A, was affirmed based 
on the credit performance (or the weighted average rating factor) of the 
referenced classes.




The rating on the IO class, X-B, is affirmed because 
it is not receiving interest but may receive prepayment premiums.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.1% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.2% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 1.3% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 1.6% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The methodologies used in these ratings were "Approach to Rating US and 
Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014, and "Moody's 
Approach to Rating Large Loan and Single Asset/Single Borrower CMBS" 
published in October 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies 
page on www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies.




Additionally, the methodology used in rating Cl. X-A 
and Cl. X-B was "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured 
Finance Interest-Only Securities" published in October 2015. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Please note that on February 27, 2017, Moody's released a 
"Request for Comment" in which it has requested market feedback on proposed 
changes to its methodology for rating structured finance interest-only 
(IO) securities called "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance 
Interest-Only Securities," dated October 20, 2015. 
If Moody's adopts the new methodology as proposed, the changes could 
affect the ratings of Morgan Stanley Capital I Trust 2011-C3. 
Please see "Moody's Proposes Revised Approach to Rating Structured 
Finance Interest-Only (IO) Securities", which is available 
at www.moodys.com, for more information about the 
implications of the proposed changes to the methodology on Moody's ratings.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 15, 
compared with 17 at Moody's last review.




When the Herf falls below 20, Moody's uses the excel-based 
Large Loan Model and then reconciles and weights the results from the 
conduit and large loan models in formulating a rating recommendation. 
The large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation 
of adjusted loan-level proceeds derived from Moody's loan-level 
LTV ratios. Major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage, 
loan structure, and property type. Moody's also further 
adjusts these aggregated proceeds for any pooling benefits associated 
with loan level diversity and other concentrations and correlations.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the May 17, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 38% to $930.1 
million from $1.49 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 45 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 15% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 69% of the pool. 
Two loans, constituting 16.4% of the pool, have 
investment-grade structured credit assessments. Two loans, 
constituting 0.9% of the pool, have defeased and are 
secured by US government securities.




Eight loans, constituting 11% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool. One loan, constituting 
0.6% of the pool, is currently in special servicing.




Moody's received full year 2016 operating results for 95% of the 
pool, and partial year 2017 operating results for 42% of 
the pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). Moody's 
weighted average conduit LTV is 87%, compared to 82% 
at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit component excludes 
loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and CTL loans, 
and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's net cash 
flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 16% to the most 
recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's value 
reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.3%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.55X and 1.22X, 
respectively, compared to 1.67X and 1.29X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The largest loan with a structured credit assessment is the Park City 
Center Loan ($141.2 million -- 15.2% 
of the pool), which is secured by a 1.2 million square foot 
(SF) super-regional mall located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. 
The property is also encumbered by a $42 million mezzanine loan. 
As of December 2016, inline vacancy was 7.6% and the 
total property vacancy was 2.6%. The largest tenants 
include JC Penney (20% of the net rentable area (NRA); lease 
expiration July 2020), Bon Ton (15% of the NRA; lease 
expiration of February 2028), and Sears (13% of the NRA; 
lease expiration April 2023). The property has an Apple store, 
with the next closest Apple store over 44 miles away. Performance 
dropped slightly in 2016 due to a drop in revenue, while expenses 
remained roughly flat. Excluding Apple, inline sales ending 
2016 for tenants less than 10,000 square feet were $414 per 
square foot (PSF) compared to $417 PSF for 2015. Apple's 
sales increased over 6% from 2015 to 2016. Moody's structured 
credit assessment and stressed DSCR are baa1 (sca.pd) and 1.45X, 
respectively.




The second loan with a structured credit assessment is the 420 East 72nd 
Street Coop Loan ($11.0 million -- 1.2% 
of the pool), which is secured by 20 story co-op building 
located in the Lenox Hill neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. 
Moody's structured credit assessment is aaa (sca.pd).




The top three conduit loans represent 28.3% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the Westfield Belden Village Loan 
($98.8 million -- 10.6% of the pool), 
which is secured by a 419,000 SF within a 818,000 SF regional 
mall located 18 miles south of Akron in Canton, Ohio. The 
non-collateral anchors are Dillard's and Sears. As of December 
2016, inline space was 99% occupied and the total mall was 
99% occupied, compared to 100% and 99% in December 
2015, respectively. Retail competition consists of Chapel 
Hill Mall, located 21 miles north, and The Strip, a 
power center located just north of the subject property. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 87% and 1.16X, respectively, 
compared to 82% and 1.19X at the last review.




The second largest loan is the Oxmoor Center Loan ($86.6 
million -- 9.3% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 941,000 SF super-regional mall in Louisville, 
Kentucky. The center is anchored by Macy's, Sears, 
Von Maur, and Dick's Sporting Goods. As of December 2016, 
inline space was 91% occupied and the total mall was 96% 
occupied. Retail competition includes Mall Saint Matthews, 
which has the same owner as the subject and is located across the street, 
and The Jefferson Mall, which is located approximately 12 miles 
south of the subject. As of March 2016, the total property 
was 98% leased with the in-line space 94% leased, 
the same as at last review. The property has an Apple store, 
with the next closest Apple store over 60 miles away. Excluding 
Apple, inline sales ending 2016 for tenants less than 10,000 
square feet were $462 per square foot (PSF) compared to $460 
PSF for 2015. Apple's sales increased over 7% from 
2015 to 2016. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 80% and 
1.25X, respectively, compared to 84% and 1.15X 
at the last review.




The third largest loan is the One BriarLake Plaza Loan ($78.1 
million -- 8.4% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 502,000 SF Class A office building located in Houston, 
Texas. The property is also encumbered by a $15 million 
mezzanine loan. The property includes a seven story parking garage 
and the building is LEED gold certified and has received an Energy Star 
Award. As of December 2016, the property was 93% occupied, 
compared to 89% in March 2016 and 93% at securitization. 
The property is located in the West Chase submarket of Houston, 
which has a vacancy rate of over 20%. The property has 21% 
of the NRA with leases expiring by the end of 2019, with approximately 
14% in 2017. Performance improved in 2016 mainly due to 
a drop in expenses. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 83% 
and 1.27X, respectively, compared to 68% and 
1.51X at the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.
