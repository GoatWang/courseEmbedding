About Patti Pao - Founder of Restorsea






About Patti
Patti Pao Founder/CEO

Patti boasts an illustrious beauty background, having launched over 400 products for lauded brands such as Avon, Elizabeth Arden, Guerlain and Peter Thomas Roth. She has been at the forefront of revolutionary product developments, having recognized the power of glycolic acid and acquiring the exclusive rights to commercialize it before most beauty insiders discovered its benefits.
A true pioneer in skincare, Patti recognized an unmet consumer need for gentler anti-aging products that deliver real results. She did so in an unlikely manner. Reluctantly participating in a hike through the pure fjords of western Norway, Patti landed herself on a tour of the country's largest salmon hatchery. She became transfixed by the hatchery workers' hands; while their faces betrayed their true ages, their hands looked much younger. Because the workers' hands were consistently submerged in water, Patti knew where to look for their secret.
It was hidden in the water. Restorsea's revolutionary, proprietary Vibransea™ complex is anchored by Aquabeautine XL®, a natural enzyme salmon release into the water at birth enabling them to safely emerge from their eggshells. In skincare, the enzyme's remarkable properties similarly work to selectively exfoliate only dead skin cells, allowing living ones to flourish. It is regular exposure to the enzyme that imbued the workers’ hands with such a youthful appearance.
Patti realized the opportunity to create an anti-aging skincare line better than anything she had created before. Why? By dissolving only dead skin, Aquabeautine XL® provides the same benefits as other leading anti-aging products, without the harsh side effects.
Patti quickly secured the exclusive global rights to use the enzyme in all of Restorsea's products.
Patti received her MBA from the Harvard Business School and her undergraduate degree from UC Berkeley, where she graduated summa cum laude. She currently lives in New York City, where she enjoys a hike-free life and wishes everyone great and glowing skin.
Please email her at pattipao@restorsea.com or call her at 888-785-8878 if you have questions, desire further information or just want to share your experience.

PRO: Clinical Studies






 








Peer-Reviewed Clinical Studies 
 October 2016 Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology
November 2015 Journal of Drugs in Dermatology 

Study Overview: Peer-reviewed and published study showed that applying the PRO Rebalancing Lotion directly on post-procedure skin reduces redness after 8 and 24 hours significantly better compared to no treatment. Source: Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology October 2016 JClin Aesthet Dermatol. 2016; 9(10):55-62  Title: A Split-Face Evaluation to Assess the Efficacy of a Hydrolyzed Roe Cream in Reduction of Erythema Following Chemical Peel Authors: Vic A. Narurkar, MD, Bay Area Laser Institute, San Francisco, CA
Objective: To evaluate the PRO Rebalancing Lotion in the reduction of facial erythema following a chemical peel treatment. Edema was also assessed.


Design: The PRO Rebalancing Lotion was applied to one side of the face of 30 healthy female subjects (average age=54.9 years, range 33-65 years) immediately following 4 to 15 minutes peel treatment. The opposite side remained untreated. Visia-CR digital photographs were taken at baseline and 8 and 24 hours post-facial peel. Objective dermal irritation assessments were done by a blinded investigator, graded on severity of facial erythema and edema on a 5-point scale; 0=none, 1=slight, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe. Subjects completed a perception questionnaire.


Results: Reduction in erythema was greater (P less than or equal to: 0.05) for the treated side of the face compared to the untreated side at both 8 and 24 hours post-peel. Both sides showed reduction in erythema compared to immediate post-peel. No edema was observed. At eight hours, more than 50% of subjects agreed on the five attributes, and at 24 hours, 57% (17/30) of subjects agreed. At eight hours, greater than or equal to 80 percent of subjects strongly agreed or agreed that the treated skin feels hydrated and moisturized immediately after application. At 24 hours, more than 90 percent of subjects strongly agreed or agreed that treated skin feels perfectly hydrated and moisturized. When asked about their overall impression of the product, 60 percent (18 subjects) of subjects responded said, “I love it.” All subjects completed the study. No adverse events were reported.
