Correction AppendedTheodore L. Weise, the president and chief executive of the Federal Express Corporation, will retire in January, the package-delivery company announced yesterday. He will be succeeded by David J. Bronczek, the executive vice president and chief operating officer.The move came as a surprise because Mr. Weise is only 55 and has worked at Fedex, the world's largest air-express delivery company, since its founding nearly 28 years ago. But analysts who follow the company said that his departure would have little effect on Fedex, which has been hurt lately by rising fuel costs and slowing domestic sales growth.The FDX Corporation, parent of Fedex and of several ground-delivery companies, will still be run by its chairman, Frederick W. Smith, a hard-driving, ex-Marine aviator, who pioneered the overnight delivery business in the 1970's and who is also 55. ''This is a very deep management bench,'' said Edward M. Wolfe, an analyst at Bear, Stearns in New York. ''I don't think operationally it should be a setback.''Indeed, Mr. Bronczek, 45, has worked at Fedex for 23 years. He began his career there in 1976 as a courier, and held top jobs in Canada and Europe before returning to headquarters in Memphis early last year to succeed Mr. Weise after he was promoted to succeed Mr. Smith. Mr. Bronczek is currently responsible for the company's global operations, as well as sales, E-commerce and customer service.

After stepping aside on Jan. 31, Mr. Weise will continue to sit on the Fedex board and to act as a consultant to its air operations. He said in an interview yesterday that he had no plans to work outside the company. Continue reading the main story

Several people who spoke with Mr. Weise in recent months said they had received no indication that his retirement was imminent. But Mr. Weise said he and Mr. Smith had been planning to elevate Mr. Bronczek to run Fedex since the umbrella FDX was formed early in 1998, after Fedex bought Caliber System Inc., the owner of several trucking companies.

''It's been exhausting,'' Mr. Weise said of his 28 years at Fedex. ''I'm just, quite frankly, ready to step aside.''Mr. Weise took a lead role in the company's confrontation with its pilots last year. On the brink of a strike, the independent pilots union ultimately backed down after Mr. Smith threatened to dismiss several hundred pilots. Until then, Mr. Weise had issued most of the threats and was widely resented by many pilots.Last month, FDX failed to meet already diminished earnings expectations for the fiscal quarter that ended on Aug. 31. The day the earnings were announced, FDX stock dropped 13 percent, the steepest one-day fall in 12 years. Analysts said that high fuel prices and increased domestic competition had slowed Fedex's growth. FDX stock closed yesterday at $42.75, up 43.75 cents.Jeffrey A. Kauffman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, said he did not believe that the weak results had any connection with Mr. Weise's departure. ''The company's problems are macroeconomic,'' he said, citing a slowdown in manufacturing. ''Every other player in this market has not had the robust volume growth domestically as they had in the last two years.''Correction: October 14, 1999, Thursday  Because of an editing error, a headline in Business Day on Tuesday referred incorrectly to the company whose chief executive will retire in January. As the article reported, Theodore L. Weise, will leave Federal Express, not the FDX Corporation, its parent company. Continue reading the main story
