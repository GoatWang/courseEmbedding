Make sure to ask us about how we can lower your homeowners’ or renters’ insurance premiums!



Bump Key
Although our home security systems and locks are meant to keep intruders out of our homes, determined intruders can often find a way around them. One of the tricks they use is called lock bumping. Lock bumping is a widely known industry problem, and we have enlisted the top home security brands to help prevent lock bumping from occurring.
Lock bumping refers to the act of creating specially cut keys, also known as “bump keys,” to break into a home or business.  Bump keys can defeat tumbler door locks and conventional pin locks as well. Those performing the key bumping will then use the bump key, otherwise known as a “999 key,” with another object to force the lock open.
Kwikset offers the high-security ANSI Grade 1 980 Deadbolt which features SmartKey™ technology and BumpGuard™. The Kwikset SmartKey™ and BumpGuard™ technology give you the ability to re-key your lock in less than 30 seconds while still giving you superior key bumping security. Rather than replacing the entire lock to prevent a break-in, all you need to do is replace the key – saving you time, worry and money.



We Can Help with the Following Security Systems:

Security Cameras
Alarm Systems
Video Verification
Monitoring

Check with local agencies regarding codes for video verification & permits. We can help!

Home security systems
Home security is not a subject to be taken lightly. You put a lot of time and effort into purchasing, building, and decorating a home – now it’s time to protect your investment. With a wide variety of home security systems to choose from, you can get peace of mind knowing your family and valuables are being protected in exactly the way you want. Think you’re ready for a home security system? Complete the form above to get free quotes from local pros.

        Alarm system installation
Home security alarm systems help offer protection against burglary and other unwanted intrusions. With the latest technology, you can even choose between a hardwired or wireless alarm. Alarms usually require a keypad and control panel. They’re available in both hardwired and wireless options.

        Equipment options
With all the brands and tech options on the market, your home security equipment can be as minimal or robust as you’d like. The best way to decide what you need is to talk to home security companies about their package and a la carte offerings. There’s a huge range of equipment choices from installing a camera to having a smart lock on your door to 24-hour monitoring and motion detectors.

        Cameras
Installing a camera is a one of the basic equipment options you’ll encounter, so it’s important to know how extensive or minimal you might want your camera system to be. Looking into some of the most popular brands, figuring out which entry points in your home you may want monitored, and deciding if an indoor or outdoor camera would be better for you are some good first steps into researching your camera needs.

        How to get started
Once you’ve done your online research, we recommend talking to a few security companies to see what they think you need for your home’s size and location. This will also help you nail down how best to work within your budget while getting everything you need for your home security. They can walk you through equipment recommendations (like alarm types and cameras) as well as answer all your questions. If you’re considering purchasing a home security system, complete the above form to review free quotes from local professionals.

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Pennsylvania:













Does Charter Home Security, Llc carry a valid contracting license?



Anyone who owns or operates a home improvement business or who offers, performs, or agrees to perform home improvements in Pennsylvania must register with the Office of Attorney General. New home builders do not have to register and are exempt from the regulation but must meet all applicaple building codes.
Charter Home Security, Llc currently holds license PA111650 (As Part Of A Transaction Between Comcast Corporation And Charter Communications, Inc., Charter Home Security, Llc Will Take Over The Home Security Accounts Of Time Warner Cable, If And When The Merger Between Comcast And Time Warner Is Completed Whi), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Pennsylvania?



Contractors in Pennsylvania do not have to take an exam prior to registering as home improvement contractors. 











Your liability risk when hiring Charter Home Security, Llc



Registered home improvement contractors in Pennsylvania must show proof of general liability insurance with minimum coverage of $50,000, workers' compensation insurance is not required. It is a good idea to only hire contractors with current general liability and workers' compensation policies. Be sure to request copies of insurance certificates for each before any work begins. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Pennsylvania, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Charter: We’ll Continue To Support TWC Home Security Subs
Says it is reducing focus on sales of the smart home product as Charter assesses program
6/16/2016  12:00 PM Eastern
Last updated at 6/16/2016  12:24 PM
 

By: Jeff  Baumgartner Follow @thebauminator  









Charter Communications said it will continue to support  home security and home automaton services for customers who came on board via its merger with Bright House Networks and Time Warner Cable, but noted that it’s reducing its focus on sales of that product as it assesses that line of business. 
 
DSL Reports reported Thursday that an industry source indicated that Charter, which inherited the TWC and BHN smart home offering via the merger, might shut down that service. Charter, however, stressed that existing customers will continue to be supported.
 
“Existing Intelligent Home customers are being fully supported and will continue to be fully supported,” a Charter official said in a statement. “Intelligent Home is a new business for Charter and we are in the process of assessing it. While we assess the program we are reducing the focus on sales.”
 
The TWC and BHN home security and automation offering is powered by Icontrol, a company that works with several other cable operators, including Cox Communications, Comcast and Rogers Communications, and is reportedly in talks to sell its various assets and products  to Comcast and Alarm.com.

The Best Security Suites of 2017
Using your PC for games and social media is fun; keeping it safe isn't. A security suite can be your one-stop solution. We've tested nearly four dozen of them, and these 10 get our highest recommendation.







Get a Security Suite for All-Around Protection
From PC games to project management apps, we use our computers for everything from wasting time to making money. Most of us spend more and more time connected to computers, but all too few of us spare much thought for PC security. And yet, without the protection of a security suite you might find your most important documents imprisoned by encrypting ransomware . A Trojan could force your poor PCs to labor at tasks like attacking websites, or sending spam propaganda. You could find your very identity stolen. If you don't have the protection of a security suite, now's the time to enlist one. We've evaluated almost four dozen, so you can make an informed choice.
The top security vendors offer security suites that integrate a variety of features. Some stick to the basics, while others pile on tons of useful extras. Just read through PCMag's reviews of security suites and select one that has the features you need. I've reviewed almost four dozen security suites and identified a collection of the best ones, of all types from simple entry-level suites to cross-platform multi-device extravaganzas.
This article briefly mentions the many tests we use to evaluate security suites and determine which ones are best. If you want more details on the torture tests we perform on every product we review, please read the full explanation of how we test security software.
Basic and Advanced Security Suites
Most security vendors offer at least three levels of security products, a standalone antivirus utility, an entry-level security suite, and an advanced suite with additional features. Most entry-level suites include antivirus, firewall, antispam, parental control, and some sort of additional privacy protection such as protection against phishing sites, those frauds that try to steal your passwords. The advanced "mega-suite" typically adds a backup component and some form of system tune-up utility, and some also add password managers and other security extras.
When a new product line comes out, I start by reviewing the antivirus. In my review of the entry-level suite, I summarize results from the antivirus review and dig deeper into the suite-specific features. And for a mega-suite review, I focus on the advanced features, referring back to the entry-level suite review for features shared by both. Your choice of a basic or advanced security suite depends entirely on what features matter to you.
Symantec is an exception to this pattern. Previously the company offered various antivirus and suite products for PC, Mac, and Mobile. All the standalone Norton products you may remember were retired a couple years ago, rolled into Symantec Norton Security. However, Symantec recently brought back a standalone antivirus product, Norton AntiVirus Basic.
One more thing: The suites we've rounded up here are aimed at protecting consumers, for the most part. You can definitely use any of them in a small business, but as your company grows you may need to switch to a SaaS endpoint protection system. This type of service lets an administrator monitor and manage security for all your company's computers.
Fighting Malware, Adware, and Spyware
Malware protection is the heart of a security suite; without an antivirus component, there's no suite. Naturally you want a suite whose antivirus is effective. When evaluating an antivirus, I look for high marks from the independent antivirus testing labs. The fact that the labs consider a product important enough to test is a vote of confidence in itself. The very best antivirus products get high ratings from many labs.
I also perform my own hands-on testing. For one test I use a relatively static set of malware samples that's replaced once per year. I note how the antivirus reacts when I try to launch those samples and score it on how well it protects the test system. For another, I try to download very new malicious files from URLs no more than a few days old. Lab test results, my own test results, and other aspects like ease of use go into my antivirus rating.
Firewall Choices
A typical personal firewall offers protection in two main areas. On the one hand, it monitors all network traffic to prevent inappropriate access from outside the network. On the other, it keeps a watchful eye on running applications to make sure they don't misuse your network connection. The built-in Windows Firewall handles monitoring traffic, but doesn't include program control. A few security suites skip the firewall component, figuring that Windows Firewall already does the most essential firewall tasks.
The last thing you want is a firewall that bombards you with incomprehensible queries about online activity. Should OhSnap32.exe be allowed to connect with 111.222.3.4 on port 8080? Allow or Block? Once, or always? Modern firewalls cut down the need for these queries by automatically configuring permissions for known programs. The very best ones also handle unknown programs by monitoring them closely for signs of improper network activity and other suspicious behaviors.
Squelch Some Spam
These days, most of us hardly ever see spam messages in our inboxes because your email provider filters them out. If you don't get this service from your provider, it can be hard to even find your valid mail amid all the offers of male enhancements, Russian brides, and quick-money schemes.
If your provider doesn't squelch spam, it's smart to choose a suite that has spam filtering built in. Look for one that integrates with your email client. Client integration lets it divert spam into its own folder, and sometimes let you train the spam filter by flagging any spam messages that get through or, worse, valid messages that wound up in the spam pile.
Phishing and Privacy Protection
The best antivirus in the world can't help you if a fraudulent website tricks you into giving away your security credentials. Phishing sites masquerade as bank sites, auction sites, even online game sites. When you enter your username and password, though, your account is instantly compromised. Some clever ones will even pass along your credentials to the real site, to avoid raising suspicions.
Steering users away from phishing sites definitely helps protect privacy, but that's not the only way suites can keep your private information out of the wrong hands. Some offer specific protection for user-defined sensitive data, credit cards, bank accounts, that sort of thing. Any attempt to transmit sensitive data from your computer sets of an alarm. Some contract with third-party vendors to offer credit protection. And some supply a hardened browser that lets you do online banking in an environment isolated from other processes.
What About Parental Control?
I don't penalize a suite for omitting parental control. Not everyone has kids, and not every parent feels comfortable about controlling and monitoring their children's computer use. However, if parental control is present, it has to work.
Blocking inappropriate websites and controlling how much time the child spends on the Internet (or on the computer) are the core components of a parental control system. Some suites add advanced features like instant message monitoring, limiting games based on ESRB ratings, and tracking the child's social networking activity. Others can't even manage the basics successfully.
Don't Bog Me Down
One big reason to use a security suite rather than a collection of individual utilities is that the integrated suite can do its tasks using fewer processes and a smaller chunk of your system's resources. Or at least, that's what ought to happen. Few modern suites have an appreciable effect on performance.
For a hands-on measure of just what effect installing a particular suite has, I time three common system actions with and without the suite installed, averaging many runs of each test. One test measures system boot time, another moves and copies a large collection of files between drives, and a third zips and unzips that same file collection repeatedly. Suites with the very lightest touch have almost no effect on the time required.
Backup and Tune-Up Utilities
In a sense, having a backup of all your files is the ultimate security. Even if ransomware destroys your data, you can still restore from backup. Some vendors reserve backup for their mega-suite offering, while others include it in the entry-level suite. Read my reviews carefully, as backup capabilities vary wildly. At the low end, some vendors give you nothing you couldn't get for free from Mozy, IDrive, or another online backup service. At the high end you might get 25GB of online storage hosted by the vendor, along with the ability to make local backups.
Tuning up your system performance has no direct connection with security, unless it serves to counteract the security suite's performance drag. However, tune-up components often include privacy-related features such as clearing traces of browsing history, wiping out temporary files, and deleting lists of recently used documents. For a dedicated system-cleaning app, read our roundup of the Best Tune-Up Utilities.
What's Not Here?
I've evaluated nearly four dozen security suites, including entry-level suites, feature-packed mega-suites, and suites that extend protection across multiple different platforms. The products listed in the chart at the top of this article have all received at least four stars; the blurbs below also include products that earned at least three stars.
In some cases, two products from the same vendor appear in the chart. For example, Bitdefender Internet Security is an Editors' Choice for entry-level suite, and Bitdefender Total Security earned the same honor as a security mega-suite.
There are a couple of four-star suites that just didn't make the cut for the chart, given that there are other, very similar products from the same company already in it. Webroot SecureAnywhere Internet Security Plus is quite good, but it doesn't have all the features of Webroot SecureAnywhere Internet Security Complete. Likewise, Trend Micro Maximum Security beat out the less-feature-rich Trend Micro Internet Security for a spot on the chart. To see those and all the other suites we've reviewed, check out our security suites page, or scroll through the product blurbs at the bottom of this page.
What's the Best Security Suite?
The chart at top details ten security suites that we definitely recommend, including multi-device suites, mega-suites, and entry-level suites. If you're looking for a suite that covers the basics without getting in the way, Bitdefender Internet Security and Kaspersky Internet Security are our Editors' Choice winners. In the mega-suite range, Editors' Choice goes to Bitdefender Total Security and Kaspersky Total Security, with more features than you can imagine. Symantec Norton Security Premium protects up to 10 devices, and McAfee LiveSafe doesn't put any limit on the number of devices—these two are our Editors' Choice products for cross-platform multi-device security suite. With a powerful, integrated suite protecting your devices, you can stay protected without worrying about balancing security against performance.
Of course, the suite you like best may not be one we've identified as Editors' Choice. The three dozen blurbs below include every suite that earned at least three stars in our evaluation.

Wix



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.27.2017



 

at

07.27.2017



 

at

Vizio D65-E0


Editors' Rating: good
07.27.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Vizio D65-E0 is a decent budget-priced 4K TV hindered by a dated connected platform.










Sigma 500mm F4 DG OS HSM Sports



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.27.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Sigma 500mm F4 DG OS HSM Sports is a bright, super telephoto prime lens built for professional photographers, but boy is it heavy.










Apple MacBook Pro 13-Inch (2017)



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.27.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The base model MacBook Pro gets an updated processor and a price drop, making it the best choice for Mac shoppers who want a blend of power and relative affordability.










Huawei MateBook X


Editors' Rating: good
07.27.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Huawei Matebook X is a super-slim laptop with a slick design at a reasonable price, though it lacks the pizazz and features of competing ultraportables.










Tamron 10-24mm F/3.5-4.5 Di II VC HLD


Editors' Rating: good
07.27.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Tamron 10-24mm F/3.5-4.5 Di II VC HLD captures ultra-wide views and boasts a sturdy all-weather design, but doesn't deliver impeccable optics.










Asus ROG Zephyrus (GX501VI)



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.26.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Thanks to Nvidia's Max-Q initiative and a clever design, the Asus ROG Zephyrus is the new benchmark for powerful, thin gaming laptops.










Alcatel Idol 5S


Editors' Rating: good
07.26.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Alcatel Idol 5S offers a nice design and solid performance for an attractive price that's subsidized by Amazon Prime ads, but it falls a bit short of similarly priced alternatives.










Neato Botvac D5 Connected


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.26.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Neato Botvac D5 Connected is an all-around solid robot vacuum with accurate laser navigation and built-in Wi-Fi for app control from your phone.










Logitech Brio



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.26.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: If you need a high-quality webcam, Logitech's Brio has it all, with 4K resolution, stellar sound quality, and support for Windows Hello biometric face login.










Wasp 9907 4K


Editors' Rating: fair
07.26.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Wasp 9907 4K action cam is waterproof without a case, but doesn't offer enough outside of that to justify its high price.










Sony FDR-X3000


Editors' Rating: good
07.25.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Sony FDR-X3000 action cam records optically stabilized 4K footage, but it's not as easy to use or squeeze into small places as a GoPro.










Sjcam SJ7 Star


Editors' Rating: good
07.25.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Sjcam SJ7 Star action cam delivers high-quality 4K capture for an affordable price, but omits digital stabilization at its top resolution.










MGcool Explorer Pro


Editors' Rating: fair
07.25.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Mgcool Explorer Pro action cam entices with a low asking price and promise of 4K video capture, but you can do better without spending more.

Wix

07.27.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Wix is the easiest and fullest-featured website builder around, and you can use it to create your own highly customized site for free. 






Liquid Web Hosting

07.24.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Liquid Web is expensive and lacks shared Web hosting, but it's a flexible, feature-packed online host with outstanding customer service and excellent dedicated and VPS packages. 






GoDaddy Web Hosting
07.24.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: GoDaddy is a feature-packed web hosting service that boasts rock-solid uptime, excellent customer service, and flexible website-building tools. 






Amazon S3
07.24.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Amazon S3 is the industry-standard answer for storing business data, especially for enterprise operations. But because Amazon designed S3 as an IT-oriented "bucket," it doesn't come with a user-friendly storage sync and backup application, instead providing only IT-centric tools and APIs. It's cost-effective, efficient, and secure, but plan to bring your own desktop software. 






InMotion Web Hosting
07.24.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: InMotion is a feature-stacked web hosting service that offers many attractive features, but a few issues keep it from being the top dog. 
















A2 Web Hosting
07.24.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Packed with features, A2 is a web hosting service that's more than worthy of being the foundation for your website. 






SurveyMonkey
07.21.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: SurveyMonkey has a well-deserved reputation as a leader in online survey marketing with an intuitive user interface and advanced features like artificial intelligence. 






Microsoft Azure
07.21.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Organizations standardized on Windows Server are no-brainer candidates for Microsoft Azure once they begin moving infrastructure to the cloud. However, Azure is also friendly to other operating platforms, especially Linux, and has a growing arsenal of ancillary services, too. 






Campaign Monitor
07.21.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Campaign Monitor may lack live support and third-party integrations, but it offers a simple way to connect with your audience through email marketing, including auto-responders and a new suite of analytics. 






Zenefits Z2

07.21.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Zenefits Z2 is best suited for small to midsized businesses (SMBs) in need of solid human resources platform. By delivering the basic framework and regularly adding new integration partners, Zenefits Z2 can provide a fairly long lived solution even for fast-growing companies.

NordVPN

07.21.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: NordVPN is a robust VPN service with an excellent collection of features, all wrapped in a slick Windows client that can easily secure your online activities. It's everything you could want, and an Editors' Choice winner. 






Check Point ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware

07.19.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Check Point ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware is the most effective ransomware-specific security tool we've seen. In testing, it showed complete success against all of our real-world samples. 






Bitdefender Antivirus Plus

07.18.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: The labs give Bitdefender Antivirus Plus top marks, and it aces some of our own hands-on tests. Beyond that, it adds a wealth of security features that almost qualify it as a security suite. It's a winner. 






KeepSolid VPN Unlimited (for iPhone)

07.07.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: With affordable and flexible pricing, an attractive app, solid speed test performance, and advanced features, KeepSolid VPN Unlimited for iPhone has it all. 






KeepSolid VPN Unlimited (for Android)

07.07.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: KeepSolid VPN Unlimited is an affordable Android VPN that secures your traffic and offers additional protection to boot. It offers good speeds and a strong server selection, making it an excellent choice. 
















KeepSolid VPN Unlimited (for Mac)
06.30.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: KeepSolid VPN Unlimited is a solid service with unparalleled flexible pricing, and robust security technology, but its interface feels clunky for a Mac app, and its speed tests results were only fair. 






PureVPN (for Mac)
06.30.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: PureVPN offers robust protection for your web data with an excellent collection of servers and strong privacy protections, but it isn't the fastest Mac VPN we've tested. 






OneLogin
06.30.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: OneLogin sports a nice feature set, including risk-based authentication policies, integration with HR apps, and event monitoring platforms. It's a well-rounded IDM approach where the only real complaint concerns how groups are managed. 






Avast Premier 2017
06.30.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Upgrading from Avast's very good security suite to Avast Premier 2017 gets you a comprehensive secure deletion utility and automation for its software updater component. You'll have to decide if that's worth the significant added cost. 






Avast Internet Security 2017
06.30.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Avast Internet Security 2017 includes an antivirus, a robust firewall, a simple spam filter, and a wealth of bonus features. Depending upon your needs, though, a less expensive Avast product could be more cost effective.

Avast Premier 2017
06.30.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Upgrading from Avast's very good security suite to Avast Premier 2017 gets you a comprehensive secure deletion utility and automation for its software updater component. You'll have to decide if that's worth the significant added cost. 






Avast Internet Security 2017
06.30.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Avast Internet Security 2017 includes an antivirus, a robust firewall, a simple spam filter, and a wealth of bonus features. Depending upon your needs, though, a less expensive Avast product could be more cost effective. 






ThreatTrack Vipre Advanced Security
06.26.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Threat Track's Vipre Advanced Security offers almost all expected suite features at a low price. It won't dethrone our Editors' Choice suites, but it's an improvement over the previous edition. 






Avira Total Security Suite (2017)
04.24.2017


Editors' Rating: fair



 

at 




Bottom Line: Avira Total Security Suite is more a gaggle of products than an integrated suite. This lack of integration and of expected suite features make it a poor security suite choice. 






Avira Free Security Suite (2017)
04.18.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Avira Free Security Suite, introduced this year, packs a goodly collection of features beyond antivirus, but it doesn't come close to the power of a full-scale, paid security suite. 
















BullGuard Premium Protection (2017)
04.10.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: On top of a full roster of security features, BullGuard Premium Protection adds identity protection and Facebook activity tracking. It actually costs less than BullGuard's entry-level suite, but Facebook tracking wasn't working when we tested it. 






BullGuard Internet Security (2017)
04.05.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: BullGuard Internet Security includes all the features you'd expect in a suite, plus a backup system and a comprehensive collection of tune-up utilities. Its many features aren't consistently effective, however. 






Panda Gold Protection (2017)
03.31.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Panda Gold Protection enhances an uneven security suite with a slick backup and sync system, along with VIP support for all your tech woes. But it's seriously pricey. 






Panda Protection Complete
03.17.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: A subscription to Panda Protection Complete lets you install security on all of your Windows and Android devices. It's a good deal, but competing products score better in testing and cover more device types. 






Panda Global Protection (2017)
03.17.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Panda Global Protection boasts the wealth of features you'd expect in a security mega-suite, but it doesn't match quality of the top competitors, and its pricing is confusing.

Make sure to ask us about how we can lower your homeowners’ or renters’ insurance premiums!



Bump Key
Although our home security systems and locks are meant to keep intruders out of our homes, determined intruders can often find a way around them. One of the tricks they use is called lock bumping. Lock bumping is a widely known industry problem, and we have enlisted the top home security brands to help prevent lock bumping from occurring.
Lock bumping refers to the act of creating specially cut keys, also known as “bump keys,” to break into a home or business.  Bump keys can defeat tumbler door locks and conventional pin locks as well. Those performing the key bumping will then use the bump key, otherwise known as a “999 key,” with another object to force the lock open.
Kwikset offers the high-security ANSI Grade 1 980 Deadbolt which features SmartKey™ technology and BumpGuard™. The Kwikset SmartKey™ and BumpGuard™ technology give you the ability to re-key your lock in less than 30 seconds while still giving you superior key bumping security. Rather than replacing the entire lock to prevent a break-in, all you need to do is replace the key – saving you time, worry and money.



We Can Help with the Following Security Systems:

Security Cameras
Alarm Systems
Video Verification
Monitoring

Check with local agencies regarding codes for video verification & permits. We can help!

Home security systems
Home security is not a subject to be taken lightly. You put a lot of time and effort into purchasing, building, and decorating a home – now it’s time to protect your investment. With a wide variety of home security systems to choose from, you can get peace of mind knowing your family and valuables are being protected in exactly the way you want. Think you’re ready for a home security system? Complete the form above to get free quotes from local pros.

        Alarm system installation
Home security alarm systems help offer protection against burglary and other unwanted intrusions. With the latest technology, you can even choose between a hardwired or wireless alarm. Alarms usually require a keypad and control panel. They’re available in both hardwired and wireless options.

        Equipment options
With all the brands and tech options on the market, your home security equipment can be as minimal or robust as you’d like. The best way to decide what you need is to talk to home security companies about their package and a la carte offerings. There’s a huge range of equipment choices from installing a camera to having a smart lock on your door to 24-hour monitoring and motion detectors.

        Cameras
Installing a camera is a one of the basic equipment options you’ll encounter, so it’s important to know how extensive or minimal you might want your camera system to be. Looking into some of the most popular brands, figuring out which entry points in your home you may want monitored, and deciding if an indoor or outdoor camera would be better for you are some good first steps into researching your camera needs.

        How to get started
Once you’ve done your online research, we recommend talking to a few security companies to see what they think you need for your home’s size and location. This will also help you nail down how best to work within your budget while getting everything you need for your home security. They can walk you through equipment recommendations (like alarm types and cameras) as well as answer all your questions. If you’re considering purchasing a home security system, complete the above form to review free quotes from local professionals.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
