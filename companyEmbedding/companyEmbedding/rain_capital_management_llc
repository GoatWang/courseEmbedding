Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

Rain and its representatives are in compliance with the current registration and notice filing requirements imposed upon SEC registered investment advisers by those states in which Rain maintains clients.
Rain may only conduct business in those states in which it is notice filed, or qualifies for an exemption or exclusion from notice filing requirements. Rain's website is limited to the dissemination of general information regarding its investment advisory services to United States residents residing in states where providing such information is not prohibited by applicable law. Accordingly, the publication of Rain's website on the Internet should not be construed by any consumer and/or prospective client as Rain's solicitation to effect, or attempt to effect transactions in securities, or the rendering of personalized investment advice for compensation, over the Internet. Furthermore, information on this Internet site should not be construed, in any manner whatsoever, as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized individual advice from Rain. Any subsequent, direct communication by Rain with a prospective client shall be conducted by a representative that is either registered or qualifies for an exemption or exclusion from registration in the state where the prospective client resides. For information pertaining to the registration status of Rain, please contact the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on their website at www.adviserinfo.sec.gov.
A copy of Rain’s current disclosure brochure discussing Rain’s business operations, services, and fees is available from Rain upon written request. Rain does not make any representations as to the accuracy, timeliness, suitability, completeness, or relevance of any information prepared by any unaffiliated third party, whether linked to Rain’s website or incorporated herein, and takes no responsibility therefore. All such information is provided solely for convenience purposes only and all users thereof should be guided accordingly.
 
 
Privacy Policy
Rain Capital Management is committed to safeguarding the confidential information of its clients.  We do collect nonpublic personal information in order to open and administer client accounts with us and to provide clients with accurate and pertinent advice.  We hold all nonpublic personal information clients provide to us in the strictest confidence. If we were to change our firm policy, we would be prohibited under the law from doing so without advising clients first.
We will get client permission first before we share personal information with most nonaffiliated third parties.  However, this does not apply to sharing information with nonaffiliated third parties in connection with maintaining or servicing a client account, or administering transactions requested or authorized by clients.  Clients may direct us not to make disclosures (other than disclosures required by law) regarding nonpublic personal information to our financial marketing partners.  Clients also have the right to opt out of having their information shared with affiliates of Rain Capital Management LLC.  If a client wishes to opt out of disclosures to third parties please contact us at (503) 822-1700.
Rain Capital Management, LLC collects personal information about clients from the following sources:


Applications or other forms.


Discussions with nonaffiliated third parties.


Information about client transactions with us or others.


Questionnaires.


Tax Returns.


Estate Planning Documents.


Rain Capital Management, LLC uses client personal information in the following manner:


We do not sell client personal information to anyone.


We limit employee and agent access to information only to those who have a business or professional reason for knowing, and only to nonaffiliated parties as permitted by law. (For example, federal regulations permit us to share a limited amount of information about a client with a brokerage firm in order to execute securities transactions on a client's behalf, or so that our firm can discuss a client's financial situation with the client's accountant or lawyer.)


We will provide notice of changes in our information sharing practices.  If, at any time in the future, it is necessary to disclose any of a client's personal information in a way that is inconsistent with this policy, we will give that client advance notice of the proposed change so they will have the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure.


We maintain a secure office and computer environment to ensure that client information is not placed at unreasonable risk.


For nonaffiliated third parties that require access to a client's personal information, including financial service companies, consultants, and auditors, we also require strict confidentiality in our agreements with them and expect them to keep this information private.


Federal and state regulators also may review firm records as permitted under law.


We do not provide clients' personally identifiable information to mailing list vendors or solicitors for any purpose.


Personally identifiable information about clients will be maintained during the time one is a client, and for the required time thereafter that such records are required to be maintained by federal and state securities laws.  After this required period of record retention, all such information will be destroyed.


If you have questions about Rain's privacy policy, please contact David Reichle, CCO at 503-822-1700 or email .

April 28, 2017
Tough Transition

The so-called “Trump Trade” began to lose steam toward the end of Q1 as it became clear that single-party control in Washington wouldn’t necessarily translate into quick results


Events abroad in Afghanistan, Syria and North Korea also took the President’s attention away from his aggressive domestic agenda


The Fed continued to hike rates during the quarter and shifted its tone from one of patience to one that is markedly more aggressive


Comparisons between our current economy and political situation to those of the early 1980s are not supported by the data

 
In Q1, President Trump began an unusually ...


January 20, 2017
Hard Reset
Markets had a hard reset in Q4 with the election of Donald Trump on November 8th.  Initially global equity markets plunged, but within hours began to recover and rallied strongly throughout the quarter, mostly on speculation that the new president would usher in tax cuts, deregulation and a sweeping fiscal spending program.  Coupled with strong economic data and another hike from the Fed in mid-December, bonds were left in the dust during the quarter reminding investors that old rules of diversification are flawed.  To paraphrase one of our managers, “it’s counterintuitive to suggest that, if one aims to ...


October 31, 2016
Policy Uncertainty 

In the wake of “Brexit,” central banks reasserted themselves over markets in a big way in Q3, sending bond yields to historic lows.


The recent wave of populism in the developed world is targeting institutions that have been supportive of capital markets for the better part of 70 years.  To the extent these political movements prevail, they would likely carry negative economic consequences.


Ultra-low interest rates are increasingly being blamed for contributing to the anemic growth and wealth inequality that may be fueling these populist sentiments, further limiting the Fed’s policy options.


Rain portfolios remain positioned at the cautious ...


August 1, 2016
Mixed Messages

Events in Q1 took the Fed off message and “Brexit” further complicated its story


Given the limited set of policy tools, the Fed seems to want to play it safe and is reluctant to raise rates until it has strong evidence of inflationary pressures


The safe road now means more policy uncertainty later


Markets will hinge, in part, on whether the Fed dramatically changes the exit framework it has spelled out so well in recent years

Market Update
Last quarter, we wrote that negative interest rate policy in Japan and Europe signaled a sense of desperation on the part of ...


April 29, 2016
The Limits of Divergence?
 

The smooth December lift-off in rates was derailed in January by a rolling set of concerns that culminated in markets pricing in (at least for now) a more gradual pace of interest rate tightening than previously expected.

 

Negative interest rate policy out of Japan in late January gave markets a taste of just how divergent global monetary policies are today and may have signaled that foreign central banks are approaching the limits of their policy tools.

 

Credit markets were particularly stressed during the quarter, driven largely by the energy sector, and liquidity became scarce in substantial parts of the high ...


February 9, 2016
Mind the potholes

The Central Bank divergence story – the idea that instability in capital markets would be driven by diverging monetary policy among the world’s largest economies - is alive and well but evolving, with more pain in store for interest-rate sensitive investments


Correlations between traditional asset classes increased in 2015, making traditional asset allocation an unreliable way to achieve diversification


Recent volatility may be attributable in part to rebalancing by traditional portfolio managers away from risk assets because of the lack of portfolio safety that bonds demonstrated in 2015


Rain portfolios experienced less volatility than their respective benchmarks due to a tilt ...


April 27, 2015
Getting to your Goal
As of this writing, the S&P 500 has gone 1,302 days without a correction of 10% or greater, the second longest run since World War II.  As far as the untrained eye can see, risk appears to have disappeared from markets.  The performance of the S&P 500 seems to dominate investors’ perception of prevailing risk in the market, despite explosive risk events in certain other asset classes - May and June 2013 saw the worst bond market rout in generations, certain commodity and resource assets lost more than half their value in 2014, and on October 15th ...


March 17, 2015
An Advance in Portfolio Construction 
Larry Cao, of the CFA Institute, writes that risk factor diversification - like that used at Rain Capital - is one of the most important advances in portfolio construction techniques in recent decades and is increasingly used by sophisticated institutional investors.  According to Cao, asset classes are simply too correlated with each other for traditional asset allocation to add much to portfolio diversification anymore. Continue reading to see why he thinks risk factor allocation is the most effective approach to diversification:

Rain Capital Management offers comprehensive wealth management solutions addressing the complexity wealth creates









We Focus
Rain Capital Management is an independent, privately-owned wealth management firm that delivers access to sophisticated portfolio construction and investment advice in a client-focused, boutique setting. We focus exclusively on serving wealthy families, private foundations and nonprofit organizations.




We Serve
Our mission is to have a lasting positive impact on the financial wellbeing of our clients. We can only fulfill that commitment by remaining completely independent of any relationship that conflicts with the fiduciary obligation we have to our clients. We practice openness, transparency, common sense, and accountability.






We Perform
We are dedicated to growing our clients' wealth with less risk. Effective risk control is as important as generating return when trying to deliver outstanding investment performance over time. Our approach is designed to mitigate unwanted risk throughout the investment process to achieve more stable and robust diversification. Our strong relationships ensure unique access for clients in what are often investments with limited capacity.





We Advocate
We understand wealth creates complexity, and complexity requires sound advice and planning. Your goals may be as concrete as transitioning a business or as intangible as pursuing a dream. Our tax-efficient solutions include investment strategy and advice, sophisticated risk management, portfolio construction, investment due diligence, retirement planning, wealth transfer, and philanthropic strategies.
