Who is the man who shot Trooper Casper? What was he doing in Wisconsin?

MILWAUKEE (WITI) -- The Wisconsin Department of Justice says the man who shot and killed Wisconsin Trooper Trevor Casper is a Michigan man named Steven Timothy Snyder. Who is he? What was he doing in Wisconsin?
Steven Timothy Snyder
One relative tells FOX6 News Snyder was a hard worker and a family man with a wife and a teenage son. But Investigator Bryan Polcyn uncovered something about him that his own relatives didn't seem to know.
Snyder was a master cement mason with his own business in suburban Detroit. But in 1996, Snyder was arrested in Fond du Lac after a bloody brawl between a group of "Skinheads" and another group of "Blacks and Hispanics." According to a criminal complaint from the case, the two groups pulled out pipes and baseball bats and started swinging. When officers arrived, they scattered. But the officers caught what documents describe as one of the Skinheads -- then 19-year-old Snyder. He had several white power tattoos and a coat filled with small, printed cards promoting the "National Alliance," a white supremacist group. Another young man from Fond du Lac was later caught and arrested, carrying a card with the words, "FDL Boot Boys" and a Celtic cross.
Snyder was convicted of disorderly conduct and served 50 days in the Fond du Lac County Jail. He does not appear to have any other criminal record since 1996.
A relative FOX6 News spoke to in Michigan says the family has no idea what Snyder was doing in Wisconsin on Tuesday. He said he was "bummed" that Snyder had to take another person's life.
It all began Tuesday around 2:00 p.m. Marinette County Sheriff's officials were notified that a lone male had entered the State Bank of Florence in the Village of Wausaukee. The DOJ says that male was Steven Timothy Snyder.
Snyder displayed a handgun and fired one round before robbing the bank of cash.
He then fled the bank in a stolen bank employee’s vehicle.
Sheriff’s officials responded to the bank, and were then actively involved in looking for Snyder and the stolen vehicle.
Just after 2:30 p.m., another call came in to the Marinette County Sheriff’s Office regarding a male victim found along Jermac Road — just east of Wausaukee near a pickup truck that was still running. That man, now identified as Thomas Christ, was found to be deceased.
Officials searched the area and located the stolen vehicle taken from the bank.
Investigators believe Snyder fled from that scene in another vehicle. The Wisconsin DOJ has confirmed that Christ was shot and killed during an encounter with Snyder near Christ’s property.
Eventually, the suspect and vehicle information was learned and relayed to law enforcement officials. It was soon learned that the suspect and vehicle were spotted in Fond du Lac by a Wisconsin State Patrol trooper. The suspect (Snyder) exchanged gunfire with the trooper — and both were killed.
The shooting happened around 5:30 p.m. in the 100 block of N. Berger Parkway in Fond du Lac.
At just 21 years old, Trevor Casper is the youngest law enforcement officer to be killed in the line of duty.

wow

Friend…no one wants to hear. Yeah I am bummed..when a thug and criminal kills innocent people and a law officer…really no one Cares. May sound harsh..but. it is the truth..Snyder died of his own bad choices…the others had no choice…no sympathy here




							March 26, 2015 at 6:59 am						








 

USA

Put yourself in one of the family’s shoes who lost a loved one….when it happens to a loved one from your family who cares, right?  Wrong you have no respect for innocent lives.  Totally an ignorant comment.  You need a hug.




							March 26, 2015 at 9:52 pm						








 

Jeremy Mosley

I believe the “no sympathy” comment was directed solely at Snyder.




							March 27, 2015 at 6:34 pm						












 

Mr. Bob

Friend, you are a complete idiot for defending and attempting to solicit concern for this two time murdering, two time auto thief, armed robbing scumbag POS.  Previously his family knew nothing of his skinhead activity nor do they claim to know why he came to Wisconsin to rob a bank, murder two innocent people and steal a couple vehicles along the way.  There is no concern for his family here because the people posting here have common sense, know right from wrong and recognize the fact that you are a POS just like your good DEAD buddy….




							March 26, 2015 at 12:14 pm						








 

Sad

Wow Bob….. that is a pretty harsh statement to make when you have no clue about Mr. Snyder’s family. I know his f’amily  and they are very decent people. The article says he has one teenage son. Wrong, he also has 3 more young children. I also pray for the state trooper, his family and the 59 year old man and his family. May God be with then all!




							March 30, 2015 at 1:18 pm						










 

Mr. Bob

Oh yeah friend forgot to tell you how elated I am that your good buddy snyder is DEAD!!!!




							March 26, 2015 at 12:16 pm						








 

mexico joe

Who cares about this thug? Prayers to the state troopers family!! If he was such a hard working family man, why did he killed two people and rob a bank?

D.C.
I don’t see anything here about race.
I did, however notice that your caps lock is stuck also.
I real life do you scream at the top of you lungs every time you have something to say?

Are you really Sam Kinison????
He always yelled at the top of his lungs.
And people would laugh at him when he did.




							March 26, 2015 at 2:18 pm						








 

Mr. Bob

He may have that voice modulation problem similar to what Will Farrell had in the old skits on Saturday Night Live…

Friend,
You’re a Dumb-A$$!




							March 26, 2015 at 2:16 pm						








 

Anthony

If this Snyder guy would have just surrendered they would both be alive………totally stupid what he did and caused his own death!!!How about just committing suicide and leave others alone!!!




							March 26, 2015 at 2:55 pm						








 

Hell in a handbasket

Your comment made my day! That’s hilarious.




							March 26, 2015 at 3:00 pm						








 

IAK

To reckless:  He has a right to be angry.  The killing of someone standing between the scum like Snyder should make everyone angry!  The fact that apparently it does not affect you, puts you in a category with the killer!




							March 27, 2015 at 6:43 am						








 

Richard White

In much of the United States, a law enforcement officer is more likely to be shot or shot at by a White Supremacist or a “Sovereign Citizen” than by a Black or Hispanic gangbanger or a radical Moslem – but we rarely hear about it in the media.  At best, they are portrayed as lone wolf nutcases, where in truth they are more often part of organized anti-government groups. I would not be shocked if, under investigation, it would be found that Synder had spent time out in Colorado “defending” Cliven Bundy from the “evil” Federal Bureau of Land Management officers trying to get him to pay his grazing fees or stalking an abortion clinic or planning to blow up an IRS office.




							March 28, 2015 at 12:50 pm						








 

Pam

This is the 2nd time in the past few years that I know of where a white supremacist has come from outside of Wisconsin and shot our cops.  Officer Murphy was shot at the Sikh temple a few years ago, many times, but he survived somehow, and that was done by some white power group member from North Carolina.  The bank robber who killed Trooper Casper was from Michigan.  Why do they come to Wisconsin, the state that founded the Republican Party?  I just don’t get the connection.  People of this state helped set up the political apparatus to dismantle slavery — the party to do it was founded here and the president who did it came from the neighboring state of Illinois.  There’s little to no support for white supremacists here.  No idea why they’re attracted to Wisconsin, and in both cases they ended up doing something completely wacko and were shot to death by law enforcement.

I feel sorry for Casper’s family. I was reading these articles and it just made me sad to hear a young state trooper was shot and killed- and on his first solo day as a trooper as well. Trevor will be remembered as a hero to anyone, like me. Long live Trevor!! You make Wisconsin proud!! R.I.P. Trevor Casper, a beloved Wisconsin State Trooper 😥
