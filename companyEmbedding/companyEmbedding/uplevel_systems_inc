PORTLAND, Ore., June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Uplevel Systems has added highly innovative Virtual Private Network (VPN) capabilities to its hybrid managed service platform to help providers differentiate and increase profitability. Ideally suited for the networking needs of smaller companies, Uplevel's VPN capabilities revolutionize the managed service provider (MSP) model with unprecedented affordability and ease of use and configuration.

"Users at smaller companies need secure access to office facilities from home, coffee shops, and other public places every bit as much as employees at large companies, if not more," says Don Monteith, Owner of Compudoc Computer Services in Weatherford, Texas. "These businesses need to keep costs low and security high as they allow mobile workers to print to office printers and access files on the company network. The Uplevel solution equips them to do all this and much more in exchange for a low, risk-free monthly subscription."
Uplevel managed Infrastructure-as-a-Service offering equips MSPs with a turnkey platform for scaling their business while bringing better business outcomes to customers. Uplevel delivers the core information technology (IT) elements small businesses need most – wired and Wi-Fi networking, storage and backup, and security—through one powerful, simple device installed at the customer site and managed by providers via the cloud. 
Secure Remote Access Made Easy
The newly available VPN capabilities enable small business employees to work from anywhere, without compromising security or breaking a sweat.  The newly available VPN capabilities enhance resellers' competitive differentiation and profitability by making VPNs:

Easy to use 

No third-party software to install on user devices Works with native VPN drivers on Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS 
Provides secure access to remote desktops, storage, printers, servers, and other onsite IT resources

Easy to sell 

Pure subscription with no upfront purchase, or hidden maintenance or support fees, and no "per user" fees 
Sold on a per-site vs. per-user basis 
No need to pay ISP for static IP addresses – makes service essentially "free" to providers 

Easy to support 

Provision in 1 minute 
Fast and easy user training 
Users automatically maintain same level of security remotely as they do onsite


"Where setting up a customer VPN has traditionally been roughly a ten-step process, Uplevel offers a quick two-step configuration," says Glenn Chagnot, Vice President of Marketing, at Uplevel. "Our unique architecture makes our VPN solution radically simpler than alternatives and allows partners to offer SMBs more for less while expanding their own profitability and value proposition. The new VPN capabilities introduce significant breakthroughs that exponentially improve upon the traditional MSP offering."

Cybersecurity attacks are occurring with increased complexity and frequency and can no longer be addressed effectively with manual processes or traditional workflow automation tools.
          

Uplevelapplies advanced data science to aggregate and contextualize cybersecurity data from internal systems and external sources, extract meaningful insights and provide automation throughout the incident response lifecycle.








Comprehensive Scope


              By centralizing relevant internal and external data and integrating with the existing security infrastructure, Uplevel enables collaborative, efficient response from prioritization through to remediation, and creates an actionable feedback loop as intelligence gleaned throughout the investigation process is pushed back into security controls.
            





Dynamic Intelligence


              Uplevel enables continuous data enrichment from historical incident data and external threat intelligence to provide organizations with the actionable strategic, operational, and tactical intelligence needed to respond to attacks with speed and accuracy and adapt to ever changing cyber attack vectors.
            





Contextualized Analysis


              Relationships between incidents, indicators, threats and targets can be as important as the individual data elements themselves. Uplevelâs Graph Intelligence preserves complete context associated with cyber attacks and applies advanced graph analysis for complete understanding of an organizationâs threat landscape.

TIGARD, Ore., Nov. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Uplevel Systems, a provider of managed information technology (IT) services to small business IT consultants, today announced that the company has raised $1.2M in funding to launch and promote Uplevel's hybrid managed IT services to consultants targeting small businesses across the U.S.


Uplevel's hybrid approach to managed services combines advanced cloud-based management and enterprise-class equipment with delivery through a simple subscription that aligns to small businesses' specific needs and challenges.  This unique combination accommodates the budgets of smaller companies by eliminating up-front equipment expenses and enabling IT to be monitored and managed remotely by trusted IT experts.  The formal launch of services next month will include remote network management, wired and Wi-Fi networking, virtual private networks (VPNs), data backup and storage, firewall, and other enhanced data and network security services.
"With a solid track record of success in building new businesses, the founding team at Uplevel is now bringing disruptive technology to a large and underserved market," says Christopher A. DeMonico, investor and Board member. "The company's go-to-market strategy creates a compelling 'win-win' value proposition both for smaller businesses and the IT consultants who serve them. As Managed Service Providers (MSPs), consultants can grow their businesses faster and become more competitive while streamlining cost."
The Uplevel Systems founding team features proven technology innovators specializing in network management, Wi-Fi, and data security.  The team includes CEO Tom Alexander, former Chief Architect at PMC-Sierra who delivered the first fully integrated 8-port Ethernet switch; Vice President of Marketing Glenn Chagnot, former Director of Product Management and Marketing leader at Ixia and VeriWave, Inc.; and Product Architect Sergey Rathon, a twenty-year industry veteran specializing in delivering a high-quality user experience.
"By making it simple to deliver and support managed IT offerings, the Uplevel service delivery model equips IT consultants to provide more and better services to clients in the 5-25 employee segment, in less time and with less travel to customer sites," says CEO Tom Alexander. "And for the first time, smaller companies can benefit from business-grade technology and the peace of mind that comes with knowing trusted IT professionals are watching over their networks 24/7, without breaking the bank."
