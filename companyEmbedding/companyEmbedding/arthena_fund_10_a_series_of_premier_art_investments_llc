Art Lending

Helps collectors unlock the capital of their collection




Art Lending
Leverage your collection to unlock capital.
Your art collection is a considerable financial asset that can lend flexibility to your overall wealth management strategy. Borrowing against the value of your art collection may help you access liquidity, raise capital, or reallocate and diversify your portfolio. Plus, what you might pay in interest on an art-related loan is generally less than the fees for an unsecured loan.


Key Art Lending Services

Can convert a static asset into one of economic value
Our third party appraisers ensure an objective appraisal
You maintain possession of pledged artwork
Dedicated team of credit specialists focus on art

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Investment Returns, Risks and ComplexitiesCarefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. A prospectus, obtained by calling 800-669-3900 or by clicking on the prospectus link, contains this and other important information about an investment company. Read carefully before investing.*The Premier List represents what Morningstar Investment Management believes to be the “top picks” funds in each category from the universe of no-load funds with minimums less than $10,000 and open to new investors available on TD Ameritrade’s platform.A mutual fund is not FDIC-insured, may lose value, and is not guaranteed by a bank or other financial institution. Performance quoted represents past performance, is no guarantee of future results, and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance of the product over varying market conditions or economic cycles. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.TD Ameritrade receives remuneration from mutual fund companies, including those participating in its no-load, no-transaction-fee program, for recordkeeping, shareholder services, and other administrative and distribution services. The amount of TD Ameritrade's remuneration for these services is based in part on the amount of investments in such funds by TD Ameritrade clients. PLEASE ALSO SEE IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL FUND FEE DISCLOSURE INFORMATIONNo-transaction-fee funds and other funds offered through TD Ameritrade have other fees and expenses that apply to a continued investment in the fund and are described in the prospectus.Mutual funds, closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds are subject to market, exchange rate, political, credit, interest rate, and prepayment risks, which vary depending on the type of fund.  International investments involve special risks, including currency fluctuations and political and economic instability. Asset allocation and diversification do not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses.  Fund purchases may be subject to investment minimums, eligibility and other restrictions, as well as charges and expenses.Although certain money market funds seek to preserve their value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in such a fund.  Certain money market funds may impose liquidity fees and redemption gates in certain circumstances.Some mutual funds sold through TD Ameritrade impose a charge on the purchase of shares, called a “sales load.” An investor may be able to purchase fund shares through TD Ameritrade without paying a front-end sales load, but an investor  may be charged a fee, called a “contingent deferred sales charge,” when the investor sells or redeems shares.  TD Ameritrade may receive part or all of the sales load.Some mutual funds offer reductions in front-end sales loads (“breakpoints”) for purchases over certain amounts or purchases through Letters of Intent or Rights of Accumulation.  Some funds also offer waivers of those loads, often to retirement plans or charities.  Such breakpoints or waivers will be as further described in the prospectus. You, as the investor, should determine and obtain any breakpoints or waivers or provide TD Ameritrade with sufficient information to assist it in obtaining them.Most mutual funds charge 2.00% on the redemption of shares (including by exchange) held for less than a certain number of calendar days.  Performance figures reported do not reflect the deduction of this fee. If reflected, the fee would reduce the performance quoted. Please refer to the fund's prospectus for redemption fee information. TD Ameritrade may also charge its own short-term redemption fee.See the SEC Guide to Mutual Funds for more information.TD AMERITRADE RISKS OF INVESTING IN FUNDS: PLEASE READ IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL MUTUAL FUND, EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND, AND CLOSED-END FUND RISK DISCLOSURESResearch and planning tools are obtained by unaffiliated third-party sources deemed reliable by TD Ameritrade. However, TD Ameritrade does not guarantee their accuracy and completeness and makes no warranties with respect to results to be obtained from their use. The Investment Profile report is for informational purposes only.The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Morningstar Investment Management LLC is a registered investment adviser and subsidiary of Morningstar, Inc.

IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. For performance data including the effects of sales charges, Class A and A2 shares reflect the maximum front-end sales charge of 5.75% for equity funds, 4.25% for most fixed-income funds and 2.5% for the following funds: Western Asset Adjustable Rate Income Fund, Western Asset Intermediate Maturity California Municipals Fund, Western Asset Intermediate Maturity New York Municipals Fund, Western Asset Intermediate-Term Municipals Fund, Western Asset Short Duration High Income Fund, and Western Asset Short-Term Bond Fund. One-year returns for Class C shares reflect a CDSC of 1.0%, except for ClearBridge Value Trust which reflects a CDSC of 0.95%. Due to market volatility, current performance may be higher or lower than performance shown. Class FI, I and IS shares are sold at net asset value with no initial or contingent deferred sales charge, but higher initial minimum investment requirements apply. Effective July 1, 2011, Class B shares are closed to new purchases; however Class B exchange privileges will remain in effect. Royce Funds are sold at net asset value with no initial or contingent deferred sales charge.
Performance for other share classes will vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. All classes of shares are not available through all distribution channels. Total returns assume the reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all Fund expenses. Total return figures are based on the NAV per share applied to shareholder subscriptions and redemptions, which may differ from the NAV per share disclosed in Fund shareholder reports. Performance shown excluding sales charges would have been lower, if the applicable sales charge been reflected. Had fees not been waived in various periods performance would have been lower. All classes of shares may not be available to all investors or through all distribution channels.
A Fund's 30-day SEC Yield is based on yield to maturity of a Fund's investments over a 30-day period and not on the dividends paid by the Fund, which may differ; and is subject to change.
Different minimums may apply to clients of certain service agents. See the Fund's prospectus for additional information.
For further information on Fund expenses, see the individual Fund page or the Fund's prospectus. Please go to the end of this page for additional performance related information regarding Legg Mason BW Alternative Credit Fund Class IS, Legg Mason BW Dynamic Large Cap Value Fund Class IS, and certain Royce funds.  
An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
Daily Change($) indicates change in the net asset value from the previous business day.
Effective June 1, 2017, the following Funds changed their security pricing methodology to now use the mean value of the bid and ask prices (of underlying fund holdings) to calculate the NAV: Western Asset Core Bond Fund, Western Asset Core Plus Bond Fund, Western Asset High Yield Fund, Western Asset Inflation Indexed Plus Bond Fund, Western Asset Intermediate Bond Fund, Western Asset Macro Opportunities Fund and Western Asset Total Return Unconstrained Fund.  Funds may show a one-time increase of the NAV, which is due to this change in pricing methodology.































IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
Carefully consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. Please view the prospectus or summary prospectus for this and other information. Read it carefully.
FINANCIAL ADVISORS: Please note that not all share classes may be available for sale at your firm. Please call the Legg Mason Sales Desk 1-800-822-5544 or your Legg Mason Sales contact for more information.





IMPORTANT PREDECESSOR PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Each share class is invested in the same portfolio of securities, therefore annual total returns for newer share classes would differ from those returns for older share classes only to the extent of fees and charges associated with that share class. For an indication of a Fund's fees and charges, see the Fund's expense ratio and maximum sales charge disclosures or the fee table provided in a Fund's prospectus. 
ClearBridge Real Estate Opportunities Fund Class O: This fund is the successor to a closed-end fund (the "Predecessor"). The performance shown prior to the fund’s inception is that of the Predecessor and has not been adjusted for the Class O fund expenses. On June 10, 2016, the Predecessor transferred its assets to the fund in exchange for the fund's Class O shares. The Predecessor and the fund have similar investment policies and strategies. In addition, the Predecessor's portfolio managers are the current portfolio managers of the fund.  For information regarding the differences between the Predecessor and the fund, see the fund's prospectus. A redemption fee of 1.00% applies only to shareholders who received their Class O shares in connection with LMP Real Estate Income Fund Inc.’s (“RIT”) merger with and into the fund (the “Merger”) and redeem such shares within 12 months following the closing date of the Merger.
Legg Mason BW Alternative Credit Fund Class IS: This fund is the successor to an institutional account (the "Predecessor"). The performance in the accompanying chart and table is that of the Predecessor. On December 2, 2013, the Predecessor transferred its assets to the fund in exchange for the fund's Class IS shares. The investment policies, portfolio managers objectives, guidelines and restrictions of the fund are in all material respects equivalent to those of the Predecessor. As a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is subject to certain restrictions to which the Predecessor was not subject. Had the Predecessor been registered under the 1940 Act, its investment performance may have been adversely affected. The performance information reflects the gross expenses of the Predecessor adjusted to reflect the higher fees and expenses of Class IS of the fund. The performance is shown net of annual management fees and other expenses which reflects the application of the Class IS expense limitation agreement. If the expense limitation agreement were not applicable, expenses would be higher and performance lower.
Legg Mason BW Dynamic Large Cap Value Fund Class IS: This fund is the successor to a private fund (the "Predecessor"). The performance in the accompanying bar chart and table is that of the Predecessor. On October 31, 2014, the Predecessor transferred its assets to the fund in exchange for the fund's Class IS shares. The investment policies, objectives, guidelines and restrictions of the fund are in all material respects equivalent to those of the Predecessor. In addition, the Predecessor's portfolio managers are the current portfolio managers of the fund. As a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is subject to certain restrictions under the 1940 Act and the Internal Revenue Code to which the Predecessor was not subject. Had the Predecessor been registered under the 1940 Act and been subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act and the Code, its investment performance could have been adversely affected, but these restrictions are not expected to have a material effect on the fund's investment program. The performance information reflects the gross expenses of the Predecessor adjusted to reflect the higher fees and expenses of Class IS of the fund. The performance is shown net of an annual management fee of 0.55% and other expenses of 0.10% which reflects the application of the Class IS expense limitation agreement. If the expense limitation agreement were not applicable, expenses would be higher and performance lower.
Royce Funds: Performance prior to the commencement date of certain Funds’ Investment Class shares (Royce Dividend Value Fund - 9/14/07, Royce International Premier Fund – 1/22/14, Royce Low-Priced Stock Fund - 3/15/07, Royce Small-Cap Leaders Fund - 3/15/07, Royce Small-Cap Value Fund - 3/15/07, Royce Small/Mid-Cap Premier Fund - 3/15/07, and Royce Smaller-Companies Growth Fund - 3/15/07) reflects Service Class results; certain Funds’ Service Class shares (Royce Opportunity Fund - 5/22/00, Royce Total Return Fund - 1/3/02, Royce Micro-Cap Fund - 8/30/02, Royce Premier Fund - 9/3/02, Royce Special Equity Fund – 10/2/03, Royce Pennsylvania Mutual Fund - 11/08/05, and Royce Micro-Cap Opportunity Fund - 3/20/14) reflect Investment Class results; Consultant Class shares (Royce Pennsylvania Mutual Fund - 6/17/97, Royce Micro-Cap Fund - 5/1/98, Royce Total Return Fund - 10/16/01, Royce Heritage Fund - 12/7/01, Royce Premier Fund - 6/2/03, Royce Special Equity Fund - 6/2/03, Royce Small-Cap Value - 3/30/06, Royce Opportunity Fund - 3/30/06, Royce Smaller-Companies Growth Fund - 3/30/06, Royce Special Equity Multi-Cap Fund - 1/24/14, Royce Dividend Value Fund - 3/20/14, and Royce International Premier Fund – 2/29/16) reflects Investment/Service Class results; Institutional Class shares (Royce Opportunity Fund - 12/12/01, Royce Premier Fund - 9/17/02, Royce Total Return Fund - 3/4/03, Royce Special Equity Fund - 7/25/03, Royce Low-Priced Stock Fund - 1/3/06, Royce Smaller-Companies Growth Fund - 5/10/06, Royce Small-Cap Value Fund - 6/1/06, Royce Pennsylvania Mutual Fund - 6/3/11, Royce Dividend Value Fund - 8/31/12, Royce Special Equity Multi-Cap Fund - 4/17/12, Royce International Small-Cap Fund - 1/27/14, and Royce Global Financial Services Fund - 1/4/16) reflects Investment/Service Class results; K Class shares (Royce Opportunity Fund - 5/15/08, Royce Pennsylvania Mutual Fund - 5/15/08, Royce Small-Cap Value Fund - 5/15/08, and Royce Total Return Fund - 5/1/08) reflects Investment/Service Class results; (Royce International Premier Fund – 2/29/16, Royce Low-Priced Stock Fund - 5/21/07, Royce Opportunity Fund - 5/21/07, Royce Pennsylvania Mutual Fund - 5/21/07, Royce Premier Fund - 5/21/07, Royce Small-Cap Leaders Fund -5/15/08, Royce Small-Cap Value Fund - 9/14/07, Royce Small/Mid-Cap Premier Fund - 5/15/08, Royce Smaller-Companies Growth Fund - 9/14/07, and Royce Total Return Fund - 5/21/07) W Class shares (Royce Premier Fund - 5/19/05 and Royce Total Return Fund - 5/19/05) reflects Investment Class results.  Service Class and K Class shares bear an annual distribution expense that is not borne by Investment Class shares. If the annual distribution expense of Service Class or K Class had been reflected, total returns prior to that Class's inception would have been lower. Consultant Class and R Class shares have higher expenses than Investment/Service Class shares.  If the higher expenses of Consultant Class or R Class shares had been reflected, total returns prior to that Class's inception would have been lower.

                7 Popular Software Programs for Portfolio Managers            


    By Dan Moskowitz | September 18, 2015 — 10:49 AM EDT

Are your investments spread out in lots of places? Are your 401(k) plans, trading accounts, and savings accounts located at different institutions? If that’s the case, then you likely receive separate updates for each on the status of the accounts, which can get confusing. It can also be difficult to know exactly where you stand in regards to net worth. 
Some investors swear by portfolio management software to help solve this problem. In some cases, like for retail investors, dealing with this type of software is a simple process. Below we provide synopses of portfolio management software programs for retail investors as well as much more advanced portfolio management software programs for money managers.

Before you invest
All investments are subject to market risk and will fluctuate in value. 
A portion of a municipal fund’s income may be subject to state and local taxes or the Alternative Minimum Tax. Funds that invest in bonds are subject to interest-rate risk and can lose principal value when interest rates rise. Bonds are also subject to credit risk, in which the bond issuer may fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner. High-yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are generally considered speculative because they present a greater risk of loss than higher-quality debt securities and may be subject to greater price volatility. High-yield municipal bonds may be subject to increased liquidity risk as compared to other high-yield debt securities.
Municipal securities risks include the ability of the issuer to repay the obligation, the relative lack of information about certain issuers, and the possibility of future tax and legislative changes which could affect the market for and value of municipal securities. Such uncertainties could cause increased volatility in the municipal securities market and could negatively impact the Fund's net asset value and/or the distributions paid by the Fund. Securities purchased by the Fund that are liquid at the time of purchase may subsequently become illiquid due to events relating to the issuer of the securities, market events, economic conditions, or investor perceptions.
Active management is the use of a human element, such as a single manager, co-managers or a team of managers, to actively manage a fund’s portfolio. Active management strategies typically have higher fees then passive management.
P3s are Public-Private Partnerships, which are a popular infrastructure financing structure outside of the U.S. Pari passu: At the same rate or on equal footing.

Art Lending

Helps collectors unlock the capital of their collection




Art Lending
Leverage your collection to unlock capital.
Your art collection is a considerable financial asset that can lend flexibility to your overall wealth management strategy. Borrowing against the value of your art collection may help you access liquidity, raise capital, or reallocate and diversify your portfolio. Plus, what you might pay in interest on an art-related loan is generally less than the fees for an unsecured loan.


Key Art Lending Services

Can convert a static asset into one of economic value
Our third party appraisers ensure an objective appraisal
You maintain possession of pledged artwork
Dedicated team of credit specialists focus on art

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.
