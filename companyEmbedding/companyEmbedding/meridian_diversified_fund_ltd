We are living longer

Thanks to advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles, people who are 65 today have a very good chance of reaching ages 80 or 90. A 65-year-old couple might be surprised to learn that at least one of them has a 48% probability of living another 25 years and needing investments to last until age 90.

	 

Many of us have not saved enough

Studies reveal that individuals do not feel adequately prepared for retirement. Investors should start early by saving more, investing with discipline and having a plan for their future.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.

TARGET DATE FUNDS. Target date funds are funds with the target date being the approximate date when investors plan to start withdrawing their money. Generally, the asset allocation of each fund will change on an annual basis with the asset allocation becoming more conservative as the fund nears the target retirement date. The principal value of the fund(s) is not guaranteed at any time, including at the target date.

	*TDFs may suffer investment losses, including near and following retirement. There is no guarantee that a TDF will provide adequate retirement income.

Principal Investment Strategies
The Fund seeks long-term growth of capital by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of publicly traded common stocks of U.S. companies. Under normal circumstances, the Fund emphasizes stocks which the Investment Adviser believes are undervalued in relation to an issuer’s long-term earnings power or asset value, or the stock market in general. Securities in which the Fund invests may be undervalued because of many factors, including market decline, poor economic conditions, tax-loss selling or actual or anticipated unfavorable developments affecting the issuer of the security. The Fund may invest in securities of companies with any capitalization across a broad range of industries. The Fund intends to invest at least 65% of its total assets in common stocks and equity-related securities (such as convertible debt securities and warrants). The Fund may invest up to 35% of its total assets in debt or fixed income securities, including higher yield, higher risk, lower rated or unrated corporate bonds commonly referred to as “junk bonds.” These are bonds that are rated Ba or below by Moody’s or BB or below by S&P. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets in securities rated Ca or below by Moody’s or C or below by S&P, or unrated but considered by the Investment Adviser to be of comparable quality. The Fund may also invest up to 25% of its total assets, calculated at the time of purchase, in securities of foreign companies, including emerging market companies. If, in the Invest- ment Adviser’s opinion, a stock has reached a fully valued position, it generally will be, but need not be, sold and replaced by securities which are deemed to be undervalued in the marketplace. The Fund generally sells investments when (i) the Investment Adviser concludes that the company’s fundamentals are not meeting expectations; (ii) better investment opportunities exist; and/or (iii) the company’s business has improved and this, in the Investment Adviser’s opinion, is reflected in the share price.Principal Investment Risks
There are risks involved with any investment. The principal risks associated with an investment in this Fund are set forth below. Please see the section “Further Information About Principal Risks” in this Prospectus for a detailed discussion of these risks and other factors you should carefully consider before deciding to invest in the Fund.
General Risk — You could lose money on your investment in the Fund or the Fund could underperform other investments.
Investment Style Risk — Although the Fund makes every effort to achieve its investment objective of long-term growth of capital, it cannot guarantee that the Investment Adviser’s investment strategies or securities selection method will achieve that objective.
Equity Securities Risk — Equity securities holders are entitled to the income and increase in the value of the assets and business of an issuer after debt obligations and obligations to debt securities holders are satisfied. Equity securities fluctuate in price in response to many factors including historical and prospective earnings of the issuer, the value of its assets, general economic conditions, interest rates, investors perceptions and market liquidity.
Market Risk — The value of the Fund’s investments will fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and general stock market and economic conditions and the value of your investment in the Fund may be more or less than your purchase price.
Value Investing Risk — There is a risk that the Fund’s emphasis on investing in value-oriented companies may underperform during times when value investing is out of favor.
Small Company Risk — Generally, the smaller the capitalization of a company, the greater the risk associated with an investment in the company. The stock prices of smaller and newer companies tend to fluctuate more than those of larger, more established companies and have smaller market for their shares than do large capitalization companies.
Foreign Company Risk— Investments in foreign securities may be subject to more risks than those associated with U.S. investments, including currency fluctuations, political and economic instability and differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards. Emerging market securities involve greater risk and more volatility than those of companies in more developed markets. Significant levels of foreign taxes are also a risk related to foreign investments.
High Yield Bond Risk — Debt securities that are rated below investment grade (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) involve a greater risk of default or price declines than investment grade securities. The market for high-yield, lower rated securities may be thinner and less active, causing market price volatility and limited liquidity in the secondary market. This may limit the ability of a Fund to sell these securities at their fair market values either to meet redemption requests, or in response to changes in the economy or the financial markets.
Debt Securities Risk — Debt securities are subject to credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Credit risk is the risk that the entity that issued a debt security may become unable to make payments of principal and interest when due and includes the risk of default. Interest rate risk is the risk of losses due to changes in interest rates. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Fund may not be able to sell portfolio securities, including medium- and lower-grade securities, because there are too few buyers for them.

Case Summary


Case Status:   
 SETTLED 
                        
            
			On or around 09/07/2016 (Date of order of final judgment)
            
Filing Date: April 20, 2009


           			According to a press release dated April 20, 2009, the complaint charges Meridian, Meridian Diversified and their officers and/or partners with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Securities Act of 1933 and ERISA. Meridian is an alternative investment adviser offering funds of hedge funds to institutional and high net worth investors and acts as the managing member of Meridian Diversified.The complaint alleges that Meridian Diversified placed significant amounts of investor money into funds managed by Madoff and his firm. Madoff has now been charged with running what may be the largest Ponzi scheme ever.  Unbeknownst to investors in its Funds, Meridian Diversified had invested 6% to 8% of its clients’ funds in Madoff-managed investments. This was contrary to the duties Meridian Diversified had to its investors of good faith and fair dealing and contrary to the representations Meridian Diversified had made regarding its processes for selecting fund managers.  As a result of defendants’ breaches of fiduciary duty and false statements, investors made additional investments in the Funds and/or held shares they would have redeemed.On August 11, 2009, the case was transferred to the Southern District of New York under Multi-District Litigation in In Re: Meridian Funds Group Securities & Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Litigation, case number 1:09-md-02082-TPG.On October 22, 2009, by Judge Thomas P. Griesa consolidated several actions for pretrial proceedings under the MDL case number, 09md2082.  Pension Trust for Operating Engineers is appointed Lead Plaintiff, and the law firm of Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP is appointed Lead Counsel for plaintiffs.  On December 10, 2010, the lead plaintiff filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint.  On February 8, 2011, a Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal was filed, voluntarily dismissing defendant Meridian Diversified Fund, Ltd., from the action.  On February 15 and October 25, 2011, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Consolidated Class Action Complaint.  On March 29, 2012, the Court issued an order granting the defendants' motions to dismiss, with leave to amend.  On January 7, 2013, the Court issued an Opinion granting in part and denying in part Defendant's motion to dismiss.  On January 22, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Reconsideration of this Opinion.  On April 16, the Court issued an Opinion denying Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration of the January 17, 2013 Opinion.On March 13, 2015, the Court issued an Order granting defendants' motion to dismiss.On April 11, 2016, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement.  The Court preliminarily approved the Settlement the next day.  On September 7, the Court entered a Final Judgment approving the Settlement and dismissed this case with prejudice.

About the Company & Securities Data
"Company" information provides the industry and sector classification and headquarters state for the primary company-defendant in the litigation.

In a small subset of cases, however, the primary company-defendant is not the issuer (for example, cases against third party brokers/dealers), and the securities information and company information do not relate to the same entity.

MFS Launches MFS Meridian Funds – Diversified Income Fund | Business Wire


























































MFS Launches MFS Meridian Funds – Diversified Income Fund




Disciplined Approach, Asset Allocation and Security Selection Drive 
      Strategy for Income and Growth






November 11, 2014 04:05 AM Eastern Standard Time



LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MFS Investment Management announced the launch of MFS Meridian® Funds – 
      Diversified Income Fund, a fund which seeks current income and capital 
      appreciation. Led by James Swanson, MFS' chief investment strategist, 
      the strategy takes a disciplined investment approach that combines broad 
      diversification, active asset allocation and bottom-up, fundamental 
      security selection. In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the 
      fund focuses on five income-oriented asset classes: US government 
      securities, high-yield corporate bonds, emerging market debt, 
      dividend-paying equities and real estate related investments.
    


      “Similar to a strategy available in the US, this fund may be appropriate 
      for investors who seek both income and growth potential through a 
      diverse mix of income-producing securities”, said Lina Medeiros, 
      president of MFS International Ltd. “The fund follows a disciplined and 
      flexible approach and is managed by a team of highly-skilled portfolio 
      managers who have managed money over long periods of time through varied 
      market conditions”.
    

      Lead portfolio manager James Swanson manages the asset allocation among 
      the various types of securities in the portfolio. He works closely with 
      co-managers and MFS’ Quantitative Solutions group and draws on insights 
      from his 30-year career to determine the fund’s asset allocation. 
      Working with Swanson is William Adams, co-head of Fixed Income for MFS® 
      and portfolio managers Ward Brown, David Cole, Richard Gable, Matthew 
      Ryan, Jonathan Sage and Geoffrey Schechter. The management team has an 
      average of more than 23 years of industry experience.
    

      “We think the fund’s disciplined and flexible approach to broad 
      diversification, active asset allocation and fundamental security 
      selection may help position the fund for favourable risk-adjusted 
      returns”, added Medeiros.
    

      Issued by MFS Investment Management Company (Lux) S.àr.l. MFS Meridian 
      Funds are a Luxembourg registered SICAV with US$27.0 billion in assets 
      as of 30 September 2014. The MFS Meridian Funds are comprised of 31 
      equity, fixed income and mixed asset class funds. The MFS Meridian Funds 
      are managed by MFS Investment Management, a global asset manager with 
      US$424.8 billion in assets under management as of 30 September 2014.

Important Risk Considerations


      The fund may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose money on 
      your investment in the fund.
    

      Stock markets and investments in individual stocks are volatile and can 
      decline significantly in response to issuer, market, economic, industry, 
      political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions.
    

      Investments in debt instruments may decline in value as the result of 
      declines in the credit quality of the issuer, borrower, counterparty, or 
      other entity responsible for payment, underlying collateral, or changes 
      in economic, political, issuer-specific, or other conditions. Certain 
      types of debt instruments can be more sensitive to these factors and 
      therefore more volatile. In addition, debt instruments entail interest 
      rate risk (as interest rates rise, prices usually fall); therefore, the 
      fund's share price may decline during rising rate environments as the 
      underlying debt instruments in the portfolio adjust to the rise in 
      rates. Funds that consist of debt instruments with longer durations are 
      generally more sensitive to a rise in interest rates than those with 
      shorter durations. At times, and particularly during periods of market 
      turmoil, all or a large portion of segments of the market may not have 
      an active trading market. As a result, it may be difficult to value 
      these investments and it may not be possible to sell a particular 
      investment or type of investment at any particular time or at an 
      acceptable price.
    

      Emerging markets can have less market structure, depth, and regulatory, 
      custodial or operational oversight and greater political, social, and 
      economic instability than developed markets.
    

      Investments in derivatives can be used to take both long and short 
      positions, be highly volatile, involve leverage (which can magnify 
      losses), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying 
      indicator(s) on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty and 
      liquidity risk.
    

      Investments in small-cap companies can be more volatile than investments 
      in larger companies.
    

      Investments in lower-quality debt instruments can be more volatile and 
      have greater risk of default, or already be in default, than 
      higher-quality debt instruments.
    

      Real estate-related investments can be volatile because of general, 
      regional, and local economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates 
      and property tax rates; shifts in zoning laws, environmental regulation 
      and other governmental actions; increased operation expenses; lack of 
      availability of mortgage funds; losses due to natural disasters; changes 
      in property values and rental rates; overbuilding; losses due to 
      casualty or condemnation, cash flows; and other factors.
    

      Please see the prospectus for further information on these and other 
      risk considerations.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 1.14% for A Shares, 1.65% for C Shares, 0.89% for I Shares and 0.65% for L Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 10/31/2017 for A Shares, 10/31/2017 for C Shares, 10/31/2017 for I Shares and 10/31/2017 for L Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. MSCI World Index (net of foreign withholding taxes) is a broad measure of the performance of developed countries' equity markets. The Diversified Composite Benchmark is a composite benchmark of unmanaged indexes that correspond to the Fund's model allocation, consisting of MSCI World Index (net of foreign withholding taxes) (60%) and Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index (40%). The performance of the Lipper Mixed-Asset Target Allocation Growth Funds Index includes the deduction of expenses associated with mutual funds, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. An individual cannot invest directly in an index. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops. The Fund's investment in equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. When the value of a fund's securities goes down, an investment in a fund decreases in value. The Fund invests in foreign securities, which are subject to special currency, political and economic risks. The Fund may also invest in futures contracts and other derivatives. This may make the Fund more volatile. Securities rated below investment grade are considered "high-yield," "non-investment grade," "below investment-grade," or "junk bonds." They generally are rated in the fifth or lower rating categories of Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. Although they can provide higher yields than higher rated securities, they can carry greater risk. The Fund may invest up to 15% in high yield securities. The fund may invest 25%-50% in U.S. and foreign fixed income securities.  The fund may invest 30%-75% in U.S. small-, medium-and large-cap equity securities. It may invest 0%-30% in foreign equity securities.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. Sharpe ratio measures the fund's excess return compared to a risk-free investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the returns relative to the risk taken. Tracking Error: The active risk of the portfolio, which determines the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns between the portfolio and the benchmark. Alpha: The relationship between the performance of the Fund and its beta over a three-year period of time. Standard deviation/Volatility: A statistical measure of the degree to which the Fund's returns have varied from its historical average. The higher the standard deviation, the wider the range of returns from its average and the greater the historical volatility. The standard deviation is calculated over a 36-month period based on Fund's monthly returns. The standard deviation shown is based on the Fund's Class A Shares or the oldest share class, where Class A Shares are not available. R2: The percentage of a Fund's movements that result from movements in the index ranging from 0 to 100. A Fund with an R2 of 100 means that 100 percent of the Fund's movement can completely be explained by movements in the Fund's external index benchmark. Risk measures are calculated based upon the Funds' broad-based index as stated in the prospectus.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.
