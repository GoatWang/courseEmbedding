Description
Full of the rich, distinctive details that make traditional pieces so valuable, the Howard Miller Cynthia Mantel Clock is sure to stand out in your home. Decorative leaf molding brings character to this stylish timepiece, enhanced by an Americana Cherry finish and elaborately curved front legs. Floral and vine overlays provide further visual interest, while the aged dial under convex glass lends an antiqued appeal, providing an apt background for black Roman numerals and stylish hands. With a precise interior mechanism crafted of quartz, this elegant piece plays either Westminster or Ave Maria chimes, and features both a volume control option and automatic nighttime chime shut-off. (Batteries not included)The Howard Miller StoryIncomparable workmanship, unsurpassed quality, and a quest for perfection - these were the cornerstones of the company Howard C. Miller founded in 1926, at the age of 21. Even then, Howard Miller understood the need to create products that would be steeped in quality and value.Howard Miller was schooled in the fine art of clockmaking by his father, Herman, in the Black Forest region of Germany. Howard developed into a visionary whose keen sense of innovation spawned a tradition of excellence that has been uncompromised through three generations.A highly respected brand, Howard Miller maintains its popularity because of the company's commitment to quality. Every product manufactured at the company's sprawling facility in Zeeland, Michigan, undergoes stringent tests and exceeds industry standards to ensure a lifetime of enjoyment.

The clock is nice but I could not use the instructions to set the chime to turn off at night. It just flat did not show the same adjusting screws as came on the clock. We finally did by manually just turning the hands. No instructions are better than the wrong instructions. Other than that it's a great clock.Primary use:PersonalBottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friendWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this reviewFeb162007 5.0I would buy this product again for sure By Boggy Dfrom Meadow Vista, CAProsAttractive DesignClear DisplayKeeps Good TimeReliableConsBest UsesDecorationComments about Howard Miller Cynthia Mantel Clock - 635124:I just love the Clock!!!!The design is beautiful.
