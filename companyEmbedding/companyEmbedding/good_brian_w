The day after Chalky receives his calling-up papers for National Service, another set drops through Billy’s letterbox and the two eighteen-year olds begin real-life experiences – courtesy of the army.

Thrust into the arena of barrack-room bullying, they endure abject misery, exhaustion and confusion, to emerge a little wiser.

It’s the early 1950s. Communist forces are ravaging whole swathes of Malaya. Their boyhood memories soon fade.

Pleasures are non-existent as Billy and his men learn to cope with the steaming jungle, searching for an elusive, secretive and utterly brutal enemy.

They meet people of many races, some friendly and hospitable, others hostile and murderous. Such a mix proves to be far more than a mere spice to be added to a soldier’s daily diet.

Heng, the leader of the notorious 9 Platoon, leaves a chilling prophecy hanging from a tree – one that Billy cannot ignore.

The battle of wills and skills weaves in many directions – but... More > who will be victorious?< Less

                    By Julie Elizabeth Powell
                

                                        Oct 15, 2009
                


                                "good stuff" Another great read following the adventures of Billy Clark - this time as a soldier in the jungles of Malaya during the early- to mid- 1950s. We see Billy's journey from boy to man as he fulfils his National Service to do battle against the hateful Corporal Wyatt, though it is not until he reaches the sweltering heat of the jungle that his real battle begins.  His promotion to sergeant is justly earned after surviving an ambush and he has to kill for the first time. Yet it is his fight against the egoistical and murderous Heng, the communist Chinese leader of South Johore, that has the most impact. Befriending locals, not least a village chief, helps him in a do or die situation, again emphasising his childhood memories of floppy necks.  A brilliant story giving the reader another snapshot into a time in history that should never be forgotten.  Well done...looking forward to the last in the trilogy.   Julie Elizabeth Powell, author of Gone.

The Taliban maintain that it operates  'In the name of Allah'
This hard-hitting novel pulls no punches as it challenges that stance. 
Sergeant Jack Kirkham  is the central character and pits his will against that brutal and morally corrupt enemy.
The reader must decide who has 'right' on his side.

                                Wow - an incredible insight into the ways of modern warfare. Jack Kirkham takes the reader into the fight to vanquish, it could be argued, the unseen enemy, though leaving no doubt he is doing the 'right' thing. Yes, there are violent scenes from which many would turn their eyes, however, like today's news, we must face its reality. A fantastic, if disturbing story, which, I believe, everyone should read so that, together, we may work towards a safer world. Highly recommended. Julie Elizabeth Powell, author of Gone, Slings & Arrows, Knowing Jack, The Star Realm and Invasion

Now, video inspections run a small, high-resolution camera through the sewer or drain lines to pinpoint where and what the problem is, how deep it is and what’s involved in correcting the problem before it escalates. As a follow-up, we provide homeowners with a DVD of the camera inspection.Water Heater Repair/ReplacementHomeowners will be charged $65.00 for our plumber to come out and provide a written estimate. Examples: Water heater replacement, converting to a tankless water heater, or main water line replacements.

It has zero impact on day-to-day operations.What do you dislike?So far, there has been no downside to our use of CrashPlan. This may be a matter of scale, but so far, so good.Recommendations to others considering the productI can tell you our interactions to date with Code42 have been smooth and simple, and the products have met our needs.  But as with any major purchase, perform your due diligence, ascertain the pros and cons, and analyze what will work best for you. What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Our biggest benefit thus far has been cutting down on the time and resources involved in restoring users' m,machines when crashes have occurred.
