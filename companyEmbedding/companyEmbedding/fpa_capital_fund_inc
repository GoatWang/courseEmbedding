FPA Capital Buys 2 Beaten Down Stocks, Energy in Fourth Quarter

FPA Capital released its first portfolio update of 2017, disclosing purchase of two new positions and a raft of oil and gas stocks as it adhered to its guideline of selling equities that approach intrinsic value and buying those with a margin of safety and price discount to intrinsic value.The first quarter's activity brought the $858 million fund's stock positions to 23 in all, cushioned by a 37.2% cash position at year-end. FPA Capital Fund ( Trades , Portfolio ) centers on small and mid-sized companies vetted through bottom-up research and returned 22.86% last year, beating the 17.59% return in the Russell 2500 benchmark.The fund's largest buy in the quarter, Vista Outdoor Inc. ( VSTO ), has plunged 60.4% over the past year. FPA Capital purchased 489,820 shares that were priced at $25 on quarterly average, giving the stock a 2.02% position in the portfolio.Vista Outdoor is a Utah-based maker of outdoorsy products - including firearms - and owner of about 50 brands including CamelBak. The company's share price decline began with a 17% drop on Aug. 11 to the lowest in more than a year, coinciding with its report that sales had increased overall due to additions from acquisitions and shooting sports gains, but organic sales in its outdoor products segment had weakened in its fiscal first quarter 2017.Vista Outdoors tumbled another 21.7% on Jan. 11 when the company announced it would incur an impairment charge on its hunting and shooting accessories segment in its third fiscal quarter. Vista linked the $400 to $450 million charge to "challenging market conditions" that required it to discount products. The company's share price fell again when it restated its fiscal 2017 guidance.FPA Capital's other new buy bears the same image of a company hit by negative circumstances."In closing, we remain confident about our strategy's future," managers wrote in the fourth quarter. "Our pipeline of potential investments remains robust, as evidenced by the new healthcare stock that went into the portfolio during the fourth quarter. This is an example of a domestic company's stock being depressed partly because of concerns that the expected Clinton administration would have been tough on the overall healthcare industry."Shares of pharmaceutical company Akorn Inc. ( AKRX ) plunged to their lowest in two years the week before the presidential election and slumped further in the first quarter. FPA Capital purchased 380,120 shares of Akorn at their depressed price, which averaged $22 in the quarter, making it 1.83% of the portfolio.A rebound in April vaulted the stock to near a 52-week high reached in August, already giving FPA a gain of about 51%.In oil, FPA changed from selling energy stocks as the price rose in the fourth quarter and added to some positions as the price hovered above $50 for most of the quarter. But the overall presence of the sector in the portfolio slid to 22.5% from 23.4% the previous quarter.Exploration and production company SM Energy Co. ( SM ) was the most increased, with the number of shares owned jumping 55% to 2.23% of the portfolio. FPA also added to drilling company Rowan Companies PLC ( RDC ) and exploration and production company Cimarex Energy Co. ( XEC ).See FPA Capital Fund (Trades, Portfolio)'s portfolio here.Premium MembersThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .

Fund Information




Investment Officers: Arik A. Ahitov
Dennis M. Bryan, CFA  Founded: 1968; under FPA management since July 1984 


Fund Data as of 7/27/2017Net Asset Value: $34.72Ticker: FPPTXCUSIP: 302539101




 FPA Capital Fund, Inc.  Objective: FPA Capital Fund, Inc. (FPPTX) seeks long-term growth through investing primarily in carefully selected common stocks and select fixed 	income securities.      Fundamental bottom-up, deep value stock picking with economic and industry point of view  Capitalize on best ideas with concentrated portfolios  Focus on long term, turnover averaging less than 20% over 20 years   Philosophy: The Fund's managers believe that the best way to produce substantial returns is to purchase securities on the basis of fundamental value, rather than short-term stock market expectations, and hold them until the full investment potential is achieved.  This deep value price-driven equity style attempts to exploit market inefficiencies among stocks of small to mid-capitalization companies.  Intense research is required to build the high level of knowledge and confidence necessary to realistically evaluate unpopular situations.  Great attention is paid to the minimization of potential risk.  The disciplined selection process is designed to minimize business and valuation risk by selecting companies with:    market leadership and long-term histories of profitability;  financially strong balance sheets;  first-rate management teams that have an understandable and successful business strategy;  a deep value price based on normal free cash flows, earnings and balance sheet values.   To purchase superior or potentially superior companies at low valuations requires either that the company or industry is out of favor or the value has not been recognized.  Because our holdings generally originate from areas that are out of favor, our holding period of five years approximate the time it takes for them to realize their full earning and valuation potential.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

1 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 1 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 356 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund's expenses are rated as Low because they are below the 20th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long-term growth of capital; current income is a secondary consideration.




Strategy



The fund's Adviser favors investments in common stocks that are undervalued based on valuation criteria. It may invest in all market capitalizations; however the fund's investment approach has resulted in an emphasis on medium and smaller-sized companies. Much of its exposure to international business activity is expected to come from purchases of U.S.-domiciled companies with strong worldwide franchises, and from similarly strong companies whose principal offices are located in the U.S. but are domiciled outside the U.S.


Risk



Value stocks can perform differently than other types of stocks and can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time. The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
