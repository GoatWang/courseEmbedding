Posted on July 9, 2014July 9, 2014pastel trend products for the home 


 


the pastel trend from spring 2014 runway has made its way into our home stores with an explosion of color!


in an earlier post this year i wrote about a pastel trend straight from the runway https://intentionaldesigns.com/?p=2573 
Pastel Interiors. 2014 Trends from theinbetweengirls.com

and how we will begin seeing that trend offered in home products. 
Ikea lack table

i was at ikea in my local area yesterday sourcing for a client, i had not been there since i think january of this year, anyway the one thing that was so different was an explosion of color options offered … 
the option of white or black/brown has been happily expanded to add a range of colors.
Ikea pink girls room
i loved all the color, it’s so uplifting especially for a big store like Ikea … imagine how it would look in your home.  

but secretly with all this color i was hoping to find something in a beautiful navy blue … and there it was ~ a storage piece in a beautiful navy blue.
hemnes shelving unit for ikea
http://www.ikea.com/us/en/search/?query=HEMNES&category=products&color=blue
Ikea storage

after seeing the piece above it reminded me of my blog about the 2014 hgtv smart home that had used deep rich navy cabinetry in the kitchen.  https://intentionaldesigns.com/?p=5481
for a small space or a rental a few of these storage pieces may just be the ticket to adding a deep rich navy to your home + vertical storage!
my tip ~
grab inspiration from rooms you love then incorporate that element into your home!

Posted on July 7, 2014creating a feature wall with stikwood 


 


happy monday everyone!
hope you all had a great holiday weekend!! ~ nancy
ever think of creating a feature wall? there are so many options to choose from; there are endless molding designs and paint techniques or you can create a feature wall with artwork or beautiful window treatments and now there is a simple way to create feature wall from a light weight easy to install wood product.
i was at dwell on design a few weeks ago in los angeles.  dwell on design is a trade show featuring innovative products and designs.  i was inspired by the offering of fresh new product ideas + some favorites from last year that i was able to revisit. 
stikwood was new to me this year but not new on the market.  “Stikwood is a peel and stick real wood decor. It is extremely easy to use and will transform a room in minutes.” – Stikwood.com
the photo below is of the stikwood booth at dwell on design, i enjoyed speaking with justin one of the owners about the product.
http://www.stikwood.com
dwell on design,  justin from stikwood
below is a youtube video from stikwood and west elm showing how to install the product.  

the idea of an easy to install wood wall … love that.
i have not used stikwood but it is lightweight and seems really easy to install. i’m thinking that there are other diy applications for stikwood like an ikea hack coffee table or dresser … hummmmm or a mirror frame maybe a headboard … 
have a great week! ~ nancy

This center island was a stainless steel pharmacist’s cabinet before it was topped with honed blue limestone and put to use in this charcoal-colored kitchen.
Traditional Home Charcoal Kitchen
These charcoal cabinets have a more traditional feel because of the panel door detailing.  The island features “furniture-style details” so inviting!

“We’re seeing a lot more gray cabinets, and people are mixing gray with brown surfaces,” Teicheira commented  “the secret to pulling off a gray kitchen is having  plenty of natural light.”

I love all the well designed details in this kitchen from the touch of bling in the crystal chandelier to the amazing tile design chevron-patterned mosaic of marble and mirrored tiles to the use of white as an accent to the wood flooring ~ I’m ready for a glass of wine!
Thanks for stopping in! ~ Nancy

Posted on February 12, 2014March 5, 2014Sarah Richardson for Kravet Collections 


 


In October 2013 Kravet announced a new fabric collection launch ~
Sarah Richardson for Kravet Collections.  
I am a big fan of Sarah Richardson and her “signature element” of layering fabrics; mixing prints, solids & textures; blend together with finishes, furnishings & accessories ~
the result …  a fresh modern well loved space. 
“My goal is to bring luxury and beauty, authenticity and creativity to everything I do. I have designed this collection to empower people to create a home they love”
“The layering of prints is a signature element of my work and I designed all of the fabrics in my collection with Kravet to work with one another. It’s so exciting to have my vision become accessible to customers across the country,”  –Sarah Richardson from Kravet.com.
Visit www.kravet.com to view Sarah Richardson’s collection.
For Kravet Fabrics: Sarah Richardson for Kravet Fabric Collections
I always enjoy catching Sarah Richardson’s shows on HGTV; Room Service, Design Inc. Sarah’s Cottage, Sarah’s House or Sarah 101. 
Along with co-host Tommy Smythe Designer & TV Personality the shows are informative and true to their design aesthetic. 
“I do not consider a room complete until it has the right balance of vintage and modern elements. Trends and whimsy are not a focus for me. I strive to create a feeling of timeless elegance and gracious living in soulful environments. Rooms should feel as though the furniture and art within them were collected over time and curated with a sense of personal history.” – Thomas Smythe from The Door Store blog thedoorstore.ca/Thomas-smythe.
I love how the shows take you through their process (albeit made for TV, but we get the idea) of carefully selecting each well thought out detail & how they do change their minds on the spot (again made for TV) based on a fabric that inspires their creative process or purely by trying to stay within budget. 
So the best to you all in your new venture, I’m already a big fan and love the collection!

Posted on November 11, 2013March 9, 2014New paint line Devine color 


 


While I was at Dwell on Design this past June in Los Angeles, I met with a new paint line Devine Color.
Their fresh approach to color it is truly inspiring, the images that relate to the color combinations are a great way to visualize the color while allowing your senses to explore if it’s right for your space. 
Pebbles & Creams
Devine Color: Pebbles-&-Creams
The two color discovery cards pictured are a sampling of their offerings.  The color discovery cards are a new and innovative way to view color samples. The middle section where the image is, is actually a cut out so that you can lay the discovery card on a fabric or hold it back to view a room through it. As you view your fabric or space through the opening an interesting thing happens, one of the color choices surrounding what you are viewing just seems to pop out at you. The images you see below on the discovery card are inspirations for Devine Color’s paint palette, it is really a beautiful way to think of color.  
For more information, visit Devine Color at

Posted on September 13, 2013March 10, 2014pastel paint colors 


 


Pastel paint colors from Sherwin-Williams.
With pastel colors on the runway, we are sure to see them in our homes as well.  Sherwin-Williams has introduced their 2014 Color Forecast – Diaphanous – Spiritual Balance Simplicity.  
Pastel paint colors or neutral barely there colors can be a beautiful backdrop for furnishings and accessories, remember paint is one layer of your space continue the layering process with more scrumptious natural elements and fabrics.
Sherwin-Williams Diaphanous is one of four in the collection, these pastels are simple and rich yet full of depth. I love this video from Sherwin-Williams, it brings to life these soft yet quietly powerful pastels.

2014 Color Forecast – Diaphanous – Spiritual Balance Simplicity – Sherwin-Williams.
Sherwin-Williams 2014 Color Forecast, Diaphanous
I have been seeing a lot of painted furniture in the retail market recently, such as the bed below from Crate and Barrel, add a pop of color in the bed and bedding  then continue the layering process with a textured fabrics an area rug and balance with sleek accessories and a mix natural elements.

Layering your room is easier than you think ~ think of paint as a layer just like your little black dress, then accessorize to dress it up or down.

Posted on August 2, 2013March 13, 2014back to school bedding sales 


 


bedding ~ back to school bedding sales & specials galore!!
Bedding from Pottery Barn Kids called pbk Dorm provides so many options, just take a look on line or in store (check availability), they also have a fun interactive design tool online called “create your bedding bundle”, love that!
http://www.pbteen.com/products/chevron-duvet-cover-sham-pink-magenta/?pkey=cgirls-duvet-cases&
Pottery Barn Kids pbk Dorm, Chevron Duvet Cover + Sham, Pink Magenta
With back to school shopping ads flooding the airways this is an opportune time to cash in on bedding sales.  Back to school bedding is not what it use to be, it’s upscale and perfectly suitable for the bedrooms in your home just calling out to for an update.  Or if you have a second home, back to school bedding sales can be the perfect thing for your guest rooms … and if you have a rental property this is a great time to stock up.    
My tip ~  to save you money and time …
if you are thinking of back to school bedding for your rental property purchase two sets; one set on the bed and one in storage.  This way you have the second set in storage clean and ready to be used at a moments notice.

Happy Shopping Saturday and enjoy the weekend! ~ nancy

Posted on July 26, 2013March 13, 2014Temporary Wallpaper 


 


Temporary wallpaper … really??  yes!!! 
While I was at a design show I stumbled upon the Swag Paper Wallcovering booth. I was so taken by this product, the ease of installation and the lack of commitment for me was the hook especially after many a day spent taking down wallcovering, the idea that it would just peel off intrigued me.
Temporary Removable Wallpaper from Swag Paper | Swag Paper Premium Quality Wallcoverings
I know the title says temporary and it is “Simply peel and stick panels side-by-side. No glue, no mess, no hassle” ~ from Swag Paper.
ok they had me at no mess … but the variety of patterns is amazing.  I’m an easy target for a ikat print especially a blue and white color combination like the one below.  Ikak prints are very on trend right now but they are actually “one of the oldest forms of textile decoration” according to Wikipedia.
http://swagpaper.com/collections/swag-paper-wallcoverings/products/ikat
Temporary Wall Coverings from Swag Paper. Pictured ikat_halenay_grande
Temporary removable wall coverings is the greatest idea to come along for me in a long while.  I have had my go around with paste and water adhesive wall coverings and quite honestly I am a little battle scarred after removing strip after strip.  
I just love the patterns from Swag Paper, the ease of installation and removal make it a perfect choice for any space.  Another plus for Swag Paper is that you can order samples!
Visit swagpaper.com for their full line of wall coverings and information.
Happy Shopping Saturday and enjoy your weekend! ~ nancy

Posted on July 12, 2013March 16, 2014Carpet tiles 


 


FLOR modular carpet tile is such a versatile product.  With the amount of patterns and colors FLOR has available it’s a smart choice for any room of your house.  Plus the ease of installation and the ability to control the size make carpet tiles a product worth looking into.
http://www.flor.com/positive-slant-titanium.html
Flor Carpet Tiles.  Pattern:  Positive Slant.  color: Titanium.
The applications for FLOR carpet tiles are endless ~ some of my favorites are in smaller bedrooms where an 8×10 is too big and a 5×8 is too small, with FLOR I can determine just the right size, a home office space where the room may be divided in half, in a hallway or mud room FLOR fits perfectly. 
Check out this YouTube video on installing FLOR Carpet tiles ~

The other thing about carpet tiles that is so smart is that if one of the tiles gets damaged somehow, you can order another tile and replace it.  Or, if a tile gets soiled and you need to clean it ~ take it up ~ clean it up & replace it.
FLOR uses recycled materials in every product and when you’re finished with the product send it back to the company (they pick up the shipping) and FLOR will recycle the product … pretty awesome.
Happy Shopping Saturday and have a wonderful weekend ~ nancy

Posted on June 28, 2013March 17, 2014JC Penney home collections 


 


Happy Shopping Saturday … New JC Penney home collections from Jonathan Adler, Conran, Michael Graves.
J.C. Penney has amped up and reinvigorated their Home Furnishing Department with Happy Chic by Jonathan Adler, Design by Conran & Michael Graves Collection for JC Penney.  I think this quote from Michael Graves says it all  “Design is for everybody its not an elite affair”  Michael Graves Design Collection for JCP. 
The addition of Jonathan Adler, Michael Graves and Design by Conran to JCP Home Collections which include Martha Stewart, Dyson and many other brands make it a worthwhile trip to stock up or find that unique piece for your space.
I grew up with J.C. Penney’s, my Dad loved their men’s dress shirts and would call it J.C. Penior.  So, ok, I guess I have a soft spot for JCP.  They’ve been on a rough road lately and I hope the new Home Furnishing Department brings sales soaring their way.
Have a great weekend and happy shopping Saturday ~ nancy

Fabric Applique designs by Mary McDonald for Schumacher ~
I just LOVE the fabric applique designs from the Mary McDonald Collection for Schumacher.  Seriously these pillows stop me in my tracks each time I’m at the Marketplace in Philadelphia and pass by the Schumacher Showroom window display ~ nancy

Appliqués from the Mary McDonald Collection | Schumacher | Whats New.
“The bold geometric applique is inspired by Mary McDonald’s love of decorative dressmaker details, which she often incorporates into her designs for interiors”. ~ from Schumacher
Through high school and college I worked in a bridal salon the women who detailed and altered wedding gowns were so talented and gifted. When I read about Mary McDonald’s inspiration of “dressmaker details” is makes sense, to have that level of craftsmanship and detail available for interiors. 
Fabric Applique Design. McDonald Collection for Schumacher.
“The bold geometric” applique … I also like bold geometric patterns and this to me is classic from the “Greek Key style motif” with a modern fresh twist.  Adding a modern applique such as these fabric applique designs by Mary McDondald are actually very versatile, they can be used in a space where there is not much pattern or where there is a lot of pattern.

Posted on May 17, 2013March 22, 2014New Home Furnishings 


 


A new home furnishings line from Target …
Target has introduced “a new line for house and home” called Threshold. 
Target.com/Threshold LR
I’m a big fan of Target.  We used to live in Minnesota and Target was simply a staple ~ that Saturday errand to pick up whatever you needed.  The quality, pricing and style continue to be affordable and on trend.  With their new line, Threshold; Target has integrated “global inspiration, superior fabrics and tempting textiles”.

http://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=threshold%20furniture&category=9976167|All|matchallpartial+rel+ALL|all+categories&kwr=y#?lnk=snav_rd_threshold furniture&orginalSearchTerm=threshold+furniture
Threshold for Target spans from furnishings for the bedroom, family/living rooms + accent pieces. They have some really affordable fun pieces; such as end tables and cocktail tables in bright fun colors and upholstery pieces such as poufs, ottomans + side chairs in fresh modern fabrics.  
Target.com/Threshold
There are a few things I really like about the site; as pictured above the fully designed rooms have an option to “shop this look” or “shop all Threshold Home Decor”.  Once you click through each item for sale is pictured with its price and availability; either in store or online.  They have also posted customer reviews and additional categories to further your search.

Home accessories … Shopping Saturday: Urban Outfitters – Apartments – Their First Home Lookbook
Looking for something unique to perk up your space?  Check out Urban Outfitters their home accessories offerings span from upholstery + furniture pieces to  bedding + window treatments to wall art + rugs. 
Urban Outfitters Home Lookbook 2013
Home Lookbook – Urban Outfitters
http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/category.jsp?id=A_FESTIVAL
URBAN just came out with their First Home Lookbook, it’s full of inspiration and with the weather we have all been enduring ~ these rooms just make you feel good. 
I live in a Philly suburb, and in Philly I root for the home team, and in this case it’s URBAN Outfitters and Anthropologie.  URBAN and Anthropologie created a lifestyle brand that not only are Philadelphians obsessed with, but with the amount of stores they have, I would say the most people are obsessed with.  URBAN and Anthropologie Home Divisions developed a niche market with a boho chic vibe that is so on trend, actually ahead of trend.  Because their pieces create a statement all on their own, you can go full steam ahead 100% with their products or pick and choose to add to what you already have totally changing the look and feel of your space.   
Happy Shopping Saturday ~ nancy
