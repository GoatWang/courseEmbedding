Landers, Frary & Clark

AMERICANS KEPT HOUSE WITH LANDERS, FRARY AND CLARK.
Before his company was incorporated as Landers, Frary & Clark in 1862, George M. Landers had been doing business in New Britain for over 20 years. In 1842 Dewey and Landers was established to manufacture metal products such as furniture casters, coat and hat hooks and other items out of brass; in 1852 with a change of partnership the business was organized in 1853 as a stock company known as Landers and Smith Manufacturing. In 1862, with the purchase of the Meriden business of Frary & Carey, James D. Frary joined the firm and the company was incorporated at Landers, Frary & Clark. 1866 saw the addition of cutlery manufacturing when LF&C instituted the Aetna Works. From the beginning Landers, Frary & Clark manufactured products to  make life easier for the American Housewife. Food scales, coffee grinders, cake mixers, bread makers, coffee pots and percolators along with tableware of every description were all in production before the 19th century turned to the 20th. With the advent of electricity in the first quarter of the 20th century Charles Smith, president of Landers at the time, realized the potential and put into production an electric percolator, iron, toaster and coffee urn. The success of these items led to an entire line of electric products including vacuum cleaners, electric ranges, washing machines, blenders, electric mixers and electric blankets (to name a few) which, along with the non-electric items, were sold all over the world. Speaking at a meeting of the Newcomen Society in 1955, LF&C President Richard White stated that it was the development of the Universal Bread maker (a gold metal winner at the 1904 World’s fair), the Universal Food Chopper and the Coffee Percolator that helped establish Landers, Frary & Clark as a leader in the American housewares industry. In the 1960’s the cutlery division was closed and the small electrics sold to General Electric.

Richard Spencer Frary, Sr., 89, passed away Friday, December 27, 2013 at his home in Holladay, UT, surrounded by devoted family members.
Dick was born on January 29, 1924 in Greybull, WY to the late Frederick Frary and Margaret Lee Ellen Chalfant. Dick married Eros Hunsaker Frary in July of 1946 in Billings, MT. They were later sealed in the Logan LDS Temple. They first met at Utah State where Eros was a co-ed and Dick was a handsome, young Marine in uniform taking some special training classes.  It was love at first sight.  They celebrated their 67th wedding anniversary this year.
Dick graduated from the University of Colorado with a degree in Electronic Engineering.  He received further education at the University of Pennsylvania, Southern Methodist University and New Mexico State University.
Dick proudly served in the Marine Corps in WWII and was called back during the Korean War. The discipline and patriotism he learned in the Marines never left him, as friends and family will attest.  There were only three members left in his Marine Squadron “Night-Fighters-533” and he continued to attend the annual reunions until his health no longer allowed him to do so.
Dick served as President of the Sons of the Utah Pioneers and he was an avid member of the IEEE. His education and training led to a diversified career. Dick’s career took him to  Redondo Beach and Novato, CA; Dallas and El Paso TX; Melbourne, FL; Cherry Hill, NJ; Burnsville, MN; Holladay, UT; Devon, PA; Chicago, IL; Falls Church,VA and back to his favorite place-Holladay, UT.
Dick held many positions as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, including Bishop in Audubon, NJ and Stake Counselor in PA and MN.  He willingly served wherever he was called.
Dick loved his family, friends, country and the Lord.  His spiritual strength was a great example to his family and all who knew him.  Dick had many hobbies including woodworking, hunting, reading and especially golfing with his buddies.
Dick is survived by his beloved wife Eros and his four children: Richard (Irene) Spencer Frary Jr., Lorraine (Joe, deceased) Lee Ellen Lundskog, John (Cherie) Kevin Frary, and James (Linda) Carter Frary. Dick is a proud grandfather of 18 and a great-grandfather of 8. Dick is preceded in death by his siblings: Vern McDowell, Don McDowell, Margaret McDowell, and Robert Frary.
The family expresses thanks to Erick Utley and Jeff Anderson of Sunrise Home Health and Hospice and to Earl Middlemiss, his home teacher.
Funeral services will be held at 11:00 am on Tuesday, December 31, 2013 at the Holladay 8th Ward, 5450 South Holladay Blvd, Salt Lake City, UT.  A visitation will be held from 9:30-10:30 am prior to the services.  Online condolences welcomed at www.larkincares.com.
In lieu of flowers, please make donations to the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation by going to http://www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org/donate

Dick Fraty was a great man.  A man of integrity!
This marks the end of an era and  last of the greatest generation for the McDowell-Frary families.
					                        	— Chuck (Charles) McDowell						                	



It is with great regret that we learn of the passing of another U. S. Marine.  Richard S. Frary served his country with honor in two wars, World War II and the Korean War.   We of the Marine Corps League wish to express our love and appreciation for a fellow Marine, his family, and especially his wife.  We of the Marine Corps League will miss the companionship of a Life Member.  We believe as stated in the Marine Corps Hymn: ” If the Army and the Navy ever look on Heaven’s scenes; they will find the streets are guarded by United States Marines.”   Richard has gone to assume his post on Heavens streets.  As requested by the Family, Headquarters Detachment 1215 is making a donation to the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation.
