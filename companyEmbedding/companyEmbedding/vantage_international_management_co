Vantage
                  International is a premier leadership and business 
                  coaching firm, dedicated to serving business professionals, 
                  teams and organizations using a dynamic, results-oriented 
                  coaching approach. We challenge our clients to view 
                  themselves as powerful forces in their own lives and the lives of their organizations.
                  To acknowledge, at a cellular level, that it is all about, and only
                  about, the choices that  they make...never about the other person,
                  the circumstance or anything external.  Intentionality, inspired action
                  and sustainability are our lynchpins.
The AdVantage Coaching System is all about change, creating movement, momentum
and  more of what the client wants. We know the mind expanding power of coaching.
We've  experienced it firsthand through our own personal and professional mastery.
We have  also coached thousands of professionals, teams, groups, committees and
business  audiences across the world and witnessed its value second-hand. Together
with our clients, we co-create a success partnership that allows them to harness
the power to create new careers, increase profits, attract new business, punch
up sales, set new priorities, and improve organizational well-being. Together we discover new ways of interacting with people to recreate a culture,
replace silos with cross functional teaming, get the right people on the bus
and in the right
seat, engineer turnarounds and breakthroughs...even when positive change hasn't
been sustained in the past; even with "old dogs"; even in the "bad" times and
even in "troubled" industries.




The Take The Lead Experience:
                    Check out a clip of Leta's energetic engagement at the NEW New England Chapter's 2014 spring event
