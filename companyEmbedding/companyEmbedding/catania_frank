									History								



1900




															Our company’s roots date back to 1900 in the small village of San Pier Niceto, Sicily. Giuseppe Basile’s dream was to take his olive oil business from Sicily and establish it in the land of opportunity, America. Giuseppe set out to fulfill his dream at the turn of the 20th century moving to the United States with several barrels of olive oil and the hope of building a family business that would last for generations to come.																											







														Giuseppe lost his entire inventory during a storm as the ship he was on tossed and turned during the voyage to America. Giuseppe arrived at Ellis Island New York with no money and couldn’t speak any English. He eventually managed to move to Lynn, Massachusetts where he replaced his inventory and began packing oil as Basile Packing in a rented store. From the beginning, Giuseppe worked extremely hard filling dozens of cans of olive oil, and blended vegetable oil and olive oil. He would place them in a sack, throw it over his shoulder, and sell them door-to-door throughout his Italian neighborhood in Lynn. His reputation over the years for quality and customer service grew, and by the early 1930s, Giuseppe’s customer base had expanded outward into Boston’s North End and beyond.													




1933



														In 1933, when he was 15 years old, Giuseppe’s son Joseph and his brothers (Carmen and Frank) joined the business. Joseph would carry his inventory to school and would sell his oils house-to-house every afternoon. He worked diligently establishing his customer base and reputation in all areas in the Boston market. As the Basiles’ reputation for quality spread, the family began selling to Italian specialty stores as well as to Italian households, eventually earning enough money to buy not only a packing machine, but also a panel truck that permitted them to expand their route beyond the Boston area. While the Basiles had primarily sold their products to Italian patrons in the beginning, they began selling to a wide range of ethnic customers.													




1941



														When Giuseppe unexpectedly passed away in 1941, his son Joseph, who at the time was 24 years old, was tasked with the responsibility of leading the family business. Determined to fulfill his father’s legacy and dream, each day Joseph and his brothers would pack the oil, load up the truck and head out. With hard work and determination they eventually increased their customer base until their routes took them throughout the New England area as well as into New York State.													




1942



														In 1942, Joseph and Frank were drafted into the Army to join the war effort. Although he wrote home often and gave his mother and brother instructions to continue with the business, it was overwhelming and without his personal touch, the business deteriorated. As a result, his customers began to look elsewhere to buy their olive oils.													




1945



														On his return from the war, Joseph was resolved to continue his father’s dream. He began working together with his immediate family as well as with extended family members. They formed a partnership that would be known as Catania-Spagna. The company gradually re-established its reputation for quality and service. It grew with several new additional customers in the foodservice retail and industrial sectors. In 1945, the business operated from a packaging plant on Creighton Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts then eventually moved to a larger facility in 1948 to Fulton Street in Boston’s historic North End.													




1957



														By 1957, two of the three original partners decided to move on to different industries, and sold their shares of the business to Joseph. The business continued to expand to the point where Catania had outgrown its Boston location; at which point, Joseph made the decision to relocate to a larger facility in Somerville, Massachusetts. The 1960s brought a growing customer base that expanded to include many restaurants. These accounts began to request other grocery items such as canned tomatoes, pasta and peppers. Meeting these requests, Catania’s inventory expanded by offering additional foodservice distributor items.													




mid-1960s



														By the mid-1960s, Joseph’s children were all working for the company. The third generation of Basiles was following the footsteps of their father and grandfather. The third generation established themselves in production, blending oils, on the loading docks, and eventually working in sales. In the early 1970s the third generation took over the day-to-day operations of the business.													




1979



														In 1979, the decision was made to move away from all of the grocery items and to concentrate on the roots of the company, oils. As the grocery items were phased out, the family concentrated on procuring product from all over the world, and on packing olive and vegetable oils exclusively.													




early 1990s



														From the 1970s until the late 1980s, the Somerville plant underwent numerous expansions. However, it became clear in the early 1990s that Catania had outgrown its space. So, the search began for a larger facility that would support growth over the next several decades. Finding the right building and location proved to be challenging. So much as that it was determined that the best option would be to build a facility on a site that had access to rail lines and enough land for future expansion. After a lengthy search, in 1993, construction began on our current state-of-the-art facility in Ayer, Massachusetts. Since relocating the business to Ayer in 1993, Catania has doubled its manufacturing facility, acquired a 100,000 sq. ft. distribution center across the street, doubled the size of its QA lab and recently doubled the railroad and bulk processing capacity to over 20 million lbs. These expansions very likely will carry Catania over the next several decades. In addition, the new facility boasts 10 fully automatic production lines packaging oils from small bottles to tank wagons. Adding to its growing capabilities, Catania operates a fleet of tank and box trucks, allowing it to service customers throughout the United States.													




Today



																													From a young Italian immigrant selling olive oil door-to-door to a multi-million dollar global business, Catania Oils is still run by the direct descendants of Giuseppe Basile. His great-grandchildren are now hard at work, keeping the business growing and prospering in order to continue his dream and build on his legacy for many generations to come.

Catania Medallic Specialty, Inc.


Vince and Trisha Frank utilize an Epilog Laser for medal engraving.

Catania Medallic Specialty, Inc. started business in the basement of Ray and Faye Catania's house in Cleveland , OH , in 1971. The company started out manufacturing cast medals, medallions and coins. The company still manufactures the same products, and has also expanded into specialty items such as lapel pins, belt buckles and laserable labels that can be attached to other metals or used as a key chain. When Ray and Faye Catania retired in 2003, Vince and Trish Frank took over the successful business; however, the Catania's continue to serve as valuable consultants to the business.
The Challenge:
When Vince Frank found the opportunity to run Catania Medallic, he was looking to become part of a company that he could help grow. The Franks promised Catania 's customers the same high quality products they had come to expect, as well as some exciting new product lines.
Vince and Trisha Frank face the challenges of building Catania Medallic head on. One of the most beneficial ways of growing the business has been to add new products for their customers. "I have always been very good at brainstorming and thinking of ways to do new things, so this has come naturally for me to think of new products to benefit our industry," states Vince.
The Solution:
One of the most exciting new products that they have been able to add to Catania 's current offerings is a line of laser engraveable medals. "We had acted on the suggestion of several of our customers that a laser engraveable medal would be very beneficial to the Awards and Engraving industry, as well as a huge hit with their end customer,” said Vince. “A good example of the use of a laser engraveable medal would be if we made 100 custom medals for a track meet with custom text and graphics cast into the medals on the front. With these medals, the Awards shop would laser engrave the back to read ‘First Place Boy's 100 Meter Dash', ‘Second Place Boy's 100 Meter Dash,' or ‘Third Place Boy's 100 Meter Dash'. The same can be laser engraved for specific events in gymnastics, swimming, wrestling, cross country, or any event that has places and divisions. In fact, along with our Photo Image medals, our greatest success and best selling products are the custom, single-faced, cast medals that are laser-engraveable."
The Epilog Laser has been the biggest participating factor in Catania 's success in offering this exciting new product line. As Vince explained, “We purchased the Legend 24 - 75 watt because of the positive feedback that we received from several individuals we spoke with. We were also impressed with our sales representative and their ability to answer all of the questions we had. We are very satisfied with our Epilog and very happy with the help from the service team both at the corporate level and the local level.”
