His finalist year: 1976

His finalist project: Studying how organisms can regenerate parts of themselves

What led to the project: As a little kid, George Yancopoulos was fascinated by such questions as how lizards can regrow their tails and how the body works. A New York City native whose parents had immigrated from Greece, "the whole reason I went to the Bronx High School of Science is that it had 'science' in the name," he says. He wanted to become a scientist.

He got a good start on that endeavor with his Westinghouse project, which occupied much of his high school career. He studied a single-celled organism called Blepharisma, which generally eats bacteria from decomposing vegetation. Parts of this organism function as a rudimentary digestive system; for instance, little external hairlike structures called cilia sweep bacteria into a cavity which functions as a mouth. Blepharisma can regenerate its digestive parts if they're destroyed, and Yancopoulos would tinker with the organism to study exactly how it was managing to accomplish this.

The project fascinated him—which was a good thing, given his schedule. Because he lived in a different borough, Queens, a two-hour commute from the Bronx, he had to leave his house at 4 A.M. in order to start experiments around 6:30. The experiments would run while he was in class, and he'd check them after school before heading home. It made for some long days, but the lack of sleep paid off: He entered his project in the 1976 Westinghouse Science Talent Search, and was named a finalist.

The effect on his career: Yancopoulos's experience cemented his desire to become a scientist, but his father—who had immigrated to the U.S. where he worked as a furrier, a life insurance salesman and finally a financial planner to support his family—said he hadn't sacrificed just for George to become an underpaid academic researcher. He thought he should become a practicing doctor. There was, however, one scientist he told George that it would be all right to emulate: P. Roy Vagelos, who was at the time a rising star at the pharmaceutical giant Merck and later became its CEO. Vagelos just happened to be a doctor, and he just happened to be Greek.

Yancopoulos earned an MD and PhD at Columbia University in biochemistry and molecular biophysics, finishing in 1987. He then accepted a junior faculty position, studying the immune system. Shortly thereafter, he won an eight-year grant worth well over $1 million in today's money from the Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust, a foundation that specialized in promoting young biomedical researchers. It was a great start for an academic career. He marched back to his father, triumphantly. His father pointed out that although he might have lots of money for lab equipment, his own salary was still about $35,000. Surely, if his work was important to people, he could earn more than that?

Right around this time, Yancopoulos got a phone call from Leonard Schleifer, who was recruiting talent for a new biotechnology company. This start-up would try to figure out ways to regrow nerve cells to potentially treat nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases. Yancopoulos was intrigued. With his father's voice ringing in his ears and, aware of the financial rewards that getting in on the ground floor of a company could bring, he decided to join the company which became known as Regeneron.

What he's doing now: Two decades later, Yancopoulos is now the chief scientific officer at Regeneron, headquartered in Westchester County, N.Y. Over the years, he’s helped direct the company’s research into a variety of areas beyond the original nervous system scope, from eye diseases to cancer. Their first drug, ARCALYST, was approved earlier this year by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of an incredibly rare inflammatory condition—it affects about one in one million—known as the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes. It is also currently being tested as a treatment for gout.

Yancopoulos oversees Regeneron's labs which, in addition to drugs, have developed what he calls "the most valuable mouse ever made." Bred to have immune systems that respond just like a human's would, these little critters can quickly show how the human body will react to different compounds.

One aspect of Yancopoulos's life came full circle when, a few years into Regeneron's existence, the company's small staff of scientists realized that curing diseases might be slightly more difficult than simply regenerating cells. They decided that they needed to hire some veteran pharmaceutical leadership. Top on their list? Vagelos of Merck who, to their great surprise, agreed to take the chairman job. Yancopoulos and Vagelos have now been working together for 13 years.

"George Yancopoulos is one of the most accomplished biomedical scientists I know," Vagelos says. Not only did he lay the groundwork for Regeneron's first commercial product, "he has dedicated his career to improving human health through scientific discovery, and he will surely continue to succeed in this endeavor." He's not the only person who is impressed with Yancopoulos's discoveries—the latter was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2004, one of the top honors a U.S. scientist can earn.

In recent years Yancopoulos has helped build a program at Westchester's Yorktown High School that gives students the opportunity to do the kind of research that he undertook for the Westinghouse competition many years ago. And he's also realized that his father was right: Research can be worth a lot more than $35,000. According to Regeneron's 2007 Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Yancopoulos earned $1.14 million in salary and bonus that year, and held 563,094 Regeneron shares, worth about $12 million.

George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. (born 1959) is an American biomedical scientist who serves as chief scientific officer of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc..[1] His work has included study of how nerves regenerate[2] and how muscles connect to nerves.[3] He also developed "the most valuable mouse ever made," bred to have immune systems that respond just as a human's would, so that it can be used for testing how the human body might react to various pharmaceuticals and other substances.[2]
He was elected to both the National Academy of Sciences[2] and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2004. According to a study by the Institute for Scientific Information, he was the eleventh most highly cited scientist in the world during the 1990s, and the only scientist from the biotechnology industry on the list.[citation needed]
According to Forbes magazine, Yancopoulos' financial stake in Regeneron has made him a billionaire. He is the first research and development chief in the pharmaceutical industry to become a billionaire.[4]
Biography[edit]
He spent his early childhood in Woodside, New York. After graduating as valedictorian of both the Bronx High School of Science and Columbia University, Yancopoulos received his MD and PhD degrees in 1987 from Columbia University’s College of Physicians & Surgeons. Following work in the field of molecular immunology at Columbia University with Dr. Fred Alt, for which he received the Lucille P. Markey Scholar Award,[2] he left academia in 1989 as a founding scientist for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals with Leonard Schleifer. Yancopoulos has been awarded Columbia University's Stevens Triennial Prize for Research and its University Medal of Excellence for Distinguished Achievement. He currently resides in Yorktown Heights[5]

Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of atopic diseases.[1]
This drug was developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.

Statement On A Nonproprietary Name Adopted By The USAN Council – Dupilumab,American Medical Association.

Phase 1b Data Presented at Late Breaking Session of 71st Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology

PARIS and TARRYTOWN, N.Y., March 2, 2013  – Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  today announced that pooled data from two Phase 1b trials with dupilumab (REGN668/SAR231893), an investigational, high-affinity, subcutaneously administered, fully-human antibody targeting the alpha subunit of the interleukin 4 receptor (IL-4R alpha), were presented at the 71st Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) in Miami.
The primary objective of the Phase 1b studies was to assess the safety profile of dupilumab.  Other exploratory endpoints included pharmacokinetic, biomarker, and efficacy parameters.  The efficacy data showed that treatment with four weekly subcutaneous injections of dupilumab at either 150 milligrams (mg) or 300mg per week, significantly improved the signs and symptoms of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) whose disease was not adequately controlled with topical medications.  Specifically, patients treated with dupilumab had significant improvements in body surface area (BSA) score, Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score, and Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) from baseline to week 4 compared to placebo (p<0.05 vs. placebo for all measures and doses).  The significant improvements in BSA, IGA, and EASI scores were maintained at week 8 in the 300mg dose group (p<0.05 vs. placebo).  A responder analysis demonstrated that at week 4, 54.5% of patients treated with the 150mg dose and 71.4% of patients treated with the 300mg dose achieved a reduction in EASI score of 50% or greater compared to 18.8% with placebo (p<0.05).  The most common adverse events (AEs) were nasopharyngitis (19.6% vs 12.5% for placebo) and headache (11.8% vs 6.3% for placebo).
“Despite existing therapies, a significant proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis continue to suffer from inflamed skin and intractable itch, which significantly impacts their quality of life,” said Dr. Eric Simpson, Associate Professor, Director of Clinical Studies, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA, and Principal Investigator of the study.  ”The early phase results with this biologic therapy, which has a novel mechanism of action, are encouraging to those of us who treat these patients and warrant further clinical investigation.”
“Through blockade of IL-4R alpha, dupilumab modulates signaling of both the IL-4 and IL-13 pathway, which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of allergic disease,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron and President of Regeneron Laboratories.  ”We look forward to presenting additional data from a 12-week, Phase 2a trial in atopic dermatitis, as well as starting a larger Phase 2b trial with dupilumab in patients with atopic dermatitis, later this year.”
Presented today in a late-breaking clinical trials session at the AAD meeting, the Phase 1b trials included 67 patients randomized to three different doses of dupilumab (75mg, n=8; 150mg, n=22; 300mg, n=21) and placebo (n=16).  The primary objective of the Phase 1b studies was to assess the safety profile of dupilumab.  Other endpoints included pharmacokinetic, biomarker, and efficacy parameters.  Following the 4-week treatment period, patients in the studies were followed for an additional 4 weeks for a total of 8 weeks.
About IL-4R and the IL-4/IL-13 Pathway
Atopic dermatitis and some types of asthma are characterized by the induction of a specific type of an immune response that is driven by a subset of immune cells called Type 2 helper T cells, or Th2 cells.  IL-4 and IL-13 are key cytokines that are required for the initiation and maintenance of this Th2 immune response.  Both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling occurs through two different IL-4 receptors (Type I and II), which both contain a common IL-4R alpha subunit.
About Dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668)
Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against IL-4R alpha and is administered via subcutaneous injection.  By blocking IL-4R alpha dupilumab modulates signaling of both IL-4 and IL-13, drivers of a Th2 immune response.  Dupilumab was created using Regeneron’s pioneering VelocImmune® technology and is being co-developed with Sanofi.  Dupilumab is currently being studied in both atopic dermatitis and asthma.
About Atopic Dermatitis
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, immune-mediated, inflammation of the skin that is characterized by poorly defined erythema (redness) with edema (swelling), weeping in the acute stage, and skin thickening (lichenification) in the chronic stage.  Chronic and/or relapsing lesions, along with pruritus (itching) and scratching are the hallmarks of the disease.  The prevalence of AD is estimated to be between 1% and 3% of adults.  For many patients, topical therapies are not effective for keeping the disease under control and the only approved systemic therapies to treat AD are prednisone and cyclosporine (in Europe).  Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis can negatively impact patients’ lives and is associated with a high burden to society both in terms of direct costs of medical care and prescription drugs, as well as loss of productivity.
About Sanofi
Sanofi, a global and diversified healthcare leader, discovers, develops and distributes therapeutic solutions focused on patients’ needs. Sanofi has core strengths in the field of healthcare with seven growth platforms: diabetes solutions, human vaccines, innovative drugs, consumer healthcare, emerging markets, animal health and the new Genzyme.  Sanofi is listed in Paris (EURONEXT: SAN) and in New York (NYSE:SNY).

George Yancopoulos - Wikipedia





















 






George Yancopoulos

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. (born 1959) is an American biomedical scientist who serves as chief scientific officer of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc..[1] His work has included study of how nerves regenerate[2] and how muscles connect to nerves.[3] He also developed "the most valuable mouse ever made," bred to have immune systems that respond just as a human's would, so that it can be used for testing how the human body might react to various pharmaceuticals and other substances.[2]
He was elected to both the National Academy of Sciences[2] and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2004. According to a study by the Institute for Scientific Information, he was the eleventh most highly cited scientist in the world during the 1990s, and the only scientist from the biotechnology industry on the list.[citation needed]
According to Forbes magazine, Yancopoulos' financial stake in Regeneron has made him a billionaire. He is the first research and development chief in the pharmaceutical industry to become a billionaire.[4]
Biography[edit]
He spent his early childhood in Woodside, New York. After graduating as valedictorian of both the Bronx High School of Science and Columbia University, Yancopoulos received his MD and PhD degrees in 1987 from Columbia University’s College of Physicians & Surgeons. Following work in the field of molecular immunology at Columbia University with Dr. Fred Alt, for which he received the Lucille P. Markey Scholar Award,[2] he left academia in 1989 as a founding scientist for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals with Leonard Schleifer. Yancopoulos has been awarded Columbia University's Stevens Triennial Prize for Research and its University Medal of Excellence for Distinguished Achievement. He currently resides in Yorktown Heights[5]

George Yancopoulos

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D. (born 1959) is an American biomedical scientist who serves as chief scientific officer of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc..[1] His work has included study of how nerves regenerate[2] and how muscles connect to nerves.[3] He also developed "the most valuable mouse ever made," bred to have immune systems that respond just as a human's would, so that it can be used for testing how the human body might react to various pharmaceuticals and other substances.[2]
He was elected to both the National Academy of Sciences[2] and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2004. According to a study by the Institute for Scientific Information, he was the eleventh most highly cited scientist in the world during the 1990s, and the only scientist from the biotechnology industry on the list.[citation needed]
According to Forbes magazine, Yancopoulos' financial stake in Regeneron has made him a billionaire. He is the first research and development chief in the pharmaceutical industry to become a billionaire.[4]
Biography[edit]
He spent his early childhood in Woodside, New York. After graduating as valedictorian of both the Bronx High School of Science and Columbia University, Yancopoulos received his MD and PhD degrees in 1987 from Columbia University’s College of Physicians & Surgeons. Following work in the field of molecular immunology at Columbia University with Dr. Fred Alt, for which he received the Lucille P. Markey Scholar Award,[2] he left academia in 1989 as a founding scientist for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals with Leonard Schleifer. Yancopoulos has been awarded Columbia University's Stevens Triennial Prize for Research and its University Medal of Excellence for Distinguished Achievement. He currently resides in Yorktown Heights[5]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
