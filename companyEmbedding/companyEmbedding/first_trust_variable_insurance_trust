Variable Annuities

Like most things in life, a comfortable retirement doesn't just happen - it 
				calls for planning and for resources. Proper planning can help you get to your 
				retirement when you want it, as well as how you want it. You've recognized this 
				by researching investment options at this website.
There are several tax-deferred vehicles that may help you reach your retirement 
				goals. You are probably familiar with the two most popular qualified plans: the 
				401(k) plan and the IRA (Individual Retirement Account). You may already be 
				taking advantage of them. Along with Social Security benefits, the returns from 
				your investments in these two plans could go a long way toward meeting your 
				retirement needs. Adding a third tax-deferred investment, like 
				a Variable Annuity, may help you fully meet your retirement goals. 
Learn more about how we've enabled you to take advantage of First Trust's quantitative and disciplined investment approach in Variable Annuities through our partnerships with some 
				well-known insurance companies in the United States.

Performance data quoted represents past results. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative total returns.
The investments for the Series are managed by the same portfolio manager(s) who manage one or more other funds that have similar names, investment objectives and investment styles as the Series. You should be aware that the Series is likely to differ from the other mutual funds in size, cash flow pattern and tax matters. Accordingly, the holdings and performance of the Series can be expected to vary from those of the other mutual funds. Shares of the separate Series of Virtus Variable Insurance Trust are sold only through the currently effective prospectuses and are not available to the general public. Shares of the VIT Series may be purchased only by life insurance companies to be used with their separate accounts which fund variable annuity and variable life insurance policies or qualified retirement plans and are also available as an underlying investment fund for certain qualified retirement plans. The performance information for the Series does not reflect fees and expenses of the insurance companies. If such fees and expenses were deducted, performance would be lower.
Morningstar Disclosures:The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accouts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
