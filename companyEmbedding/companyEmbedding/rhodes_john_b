Chair: John B. Rhodes

On June 21, 2017, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo designated John B. Rhodes as Chair of the Public Service Commission and Chief Executive Officer of the Department of Public Service. His term began on June 21, 2017 and runs through February 1, 2021.

Prior to starting with the Commission, Mr. Rhodes served as President and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). While leading NYSERDA, Mr. Rhodes was instrumental in developing innovative clean energy policies and initiatives to support Governor Andrew M. Cuomo’s nation-leading strategies to combat climate change including the Clean Energy Standard for 50 percent of electricity to come from renewable energy sources by 2030 and Reforming the Energy Vision (REV), the state’s strategy to build a cleaner more resilient and affordable energy system and grow New York's economy. He also oversaw the $5 billion Clean Energy Fund focused on stimulating investment in clean technologies like solar, wind, and energy efficiency as it supports the creation of thousands of jobs in manufacturing, engineering, and other clean tech sectors.

Mr. Rhodes brings more than 30 years of experience in business with a focus on the financial and energy industries having lived and worked internationally, including India, Germany, Brazil, and Argentina. 

Prior to his appointment at NYSERDA, Mr. Rhodes served as the Director for the Center for Market Innovation at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), an international environmental advocacy organization. As a member of the senior management team, he worked to channel private capital towards environmentally beneficial investments, with a focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy, green infrastructure, and sustainable food and agriculture.

Mr. Rhodes was a partner at Booz Allen Hamilton where he provided strategic consulting for clients across technology–intensive industries including energy, aerospace, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. 

Additionally, Mr. Rhodes serves on the boards of the New York Institute for Special Education and the American Federation for Aging Research. 

Mr. Rhodes holds a bachelor’s degree in history from Princeton University and a master’s degree in management from the Yale School of Management.

Mr. Rhodes currently resides in New York City.
