ProBility Media Corp. Further Expands International Educational and Training Product Offerings with Purchase of Cranbury International 







ProBility Media Corp. Further Expands International Educational and Training Product Offerings with Purchase of Cranbury International 





 
 



	Jul 24, 2017 - 07:57 ET
	



				
			   


HOUSTON, TX--(Marketwired - Jul 24, 2017) -  ProBility Media Corp. (OTCQB: PBYA), an EdTech company building the first full-service training and career advancement brand for the skilled trades, today announced that it has signed a binding letter of intent to purchase Cranbury International, an exporter of educational and reference materials, located in Montpelier, Vermont. The acquisition significantly expands ProBility's educational and training product offerings in South and Central America and the Caribbean. The closing is expected within 30 days. 
Cranbury International sells educational materials to governmental institutions and private sector markets in Brazil, Mexico, Columbia, Trinidad, and other international regions. The Company markets and represents approximately 40 major publishers in international markets. 
Evan Levine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ProBility, commented, "The purchase of Cranbury complements ProBility's international strategy of offering educational and training materials dedicated to the skilled trades and further expands our international footprint. In addition to improving ProBility's market presence, Cranbury's deep relationships with trade schools and universities in Latin America opens new opportunities for ProBility to offer its virtual reality and animation products to a broader audience, as will its proprietary database of thousands of content purchase decision makers under development. Cranbury's trailing twelve month revenue of approximately $1.5 million is a meaningful addition to ProBility's revenue base as well and we anticipate synergistic growth in the coming twelve months."
"Cranbury has established a history of excellence in providing customers with high quality services, and will continue to ensure the same standard of excellence in all future operations. This experience, coupled with the latest in industry knowledge, makes Cranbury unbeatable in delivering customer satisfaction and a great addition to ProBility asset portfolio," said Noah Davis, President and Chief Operating Officer of ProBility. 
"Cranbury's solid reputation is a good foundation for continued growth and expansion, further supported by our contractual customer relationships, effective quality control, industry expertise, and technical content competence. We look forward to partnering with ProBility to expand our services to additional markets," stated Ethan Atkin, Chief Executive Officer of Cranbury International. " 
ProBility and Cranbury have executed a Binding Letter of Intent. Upon the closing of the Definitive Agreement, ProBility shall:

Purchase 100% of the common stock of Cranbury.
            
Issue a 6% note to the former owners of Cranbury in the amount of $100,000, payable in twenty-four equal monthly installments.
            
Issue $400,000 in shares of ProBility common stock to the sellers. The price per share shall be based upon the closing price of ProBility's stock on the date of closing. 
            
Issue additional contingent consideration if certain sales targets are met during the 12 months following closing. 

About ProBility Media Corp.
ProBility Media Corp. is an EdTech company building the first full-service training and career advancement brand for the skilled trades. Through its divisions Brown Technical Media Corp., Brown Technical Publications Inc., Brown Book Shop, Inc., National Electrical Wholesale Providers, W Marketing, One Exam Prep, LLC, ProBility Safety Academy, ProBility Immersive Technologies and its partnership with Globalsim Inc., ProBility is executing a disruptive strategy of defragmenting the skilled trades training market place by offering high quality training courses and materials and preparing the workforce for excellence.

CPSC, National Media Corporation Announced Juice Tiger Recall Program

































FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


 




March 26, 1996


 




Release # 96-086





WASHINGTON, D.C. -In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), National Media Corporation, of Philadelphia, Pa., announced an inspection and parts replacement program for 77,000 JUICE TIGER electric juicers. The plastic cover and wire mesh grater/filter basket may crack or shatter if the basket is not placed in the juicer properly, possibly injuring people nearby. CPSC and National Media Corporation are aware of 14 incidents resulting in at least eight lacerations to the hands, face, arms, and chest and one permanent eye injury.The consumer safety program involves JUICE TIGER juicers with model numbers 204-SP and JE-1000 marked on the underside of the base. These juicers were sold directly through television infomercials from November 1991 through October 1993 at prices ranging from $100 to $150. The white plastic juicers are clearly marked with the JUICE TIGER logo, which is prominently displayed on the unit. The consumer safety program does not apply to JUICE TIGER model 160 or those with "Made in France" on the underside of the base or JUICE TIGER juicers sold in retail stores and other nontelevision channels of distribution. National Media sold a total of approximately 600,000 JUICE TIGER juicers between November 1991 and October 1993.Consumers should immediately check their unit for damaged parts. If cracks, scratches, or other signs of wear are present, consumers should stop using the juicer and discard or destroy it. The firm cannot be contacted and no further remedy is available.



The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.

NETBRANDS WOULD LIKE CONSUMERS TO KNOW THE FOLLOWING:



Production time: All production timelines reflect business days. Production time does not include any shipping time; therefore shipping time must also be added to production time in order to get an accurate delivery time frame. You have a choice of turnaround timelines in most cases. Your choice should reflect your "in hands" date, and we will do our utmost to stay within the given time frame. Please note that we are not responsible for late receipt of any order due to any unforeseeable circumstances, for example a lengthier proofing time, an out-of-stock product, printing, weather-related issues or delays on behalf of the shipping company. 

Standard Production time – Our Standard Production time is typically 7 business days. Standard Production time is "estimated" and your order will not be considered late if production has exceeded 7 business days. If for any reason, the order was placed during one of our Chinese Holiday Production breaks, Standard Production can be delayed up to an additional 7 business days. 

Rush Production - Rushing an order's production is the only way we guarantee a production time. If an "in hands" date needs to be met this option should be selected. When you request a digital proof, the production time will only begin upon approval of the sample or proof. Therefore the timeline may be delayed several days past the original estimate.   

RETURN & REFUND POLICY If for some reason you receive merchandise that you believe is defective or the print quality is unacceptable, simply send us a picture of the product. We will have a Claim Representative review the issue and upon verification of the mistake we'll remake the product for you. If you placed a rush order with us and we miss the guaranteed delivery time, simply send the product back to our facilities for a refund. Standard orders have an estimated scheduling period and are not guaranteed to meet deadlines.   

Promotional Free wristbands:   ** 200 Free Wristbands are available with a handling fee applies ($15 for regular half inch wristbands / $20 for one inch wristbands) and will be produced with Standard Production and Regular Shipping only. The Free Wristbands must have identical size and messages (including fonts and artworks) with the original order. Additional colors, options and rush services cost extra. Offer valid while supplies last.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
