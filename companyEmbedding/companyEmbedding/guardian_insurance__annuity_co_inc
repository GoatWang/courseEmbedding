About Guardian 

GUARDIAN’S HISTORY


















Since our founding in 1860 - more than 150 years ago - Guardian has been dedicated to protecting individuals, their families, and businesses.
It all began at Delmonico’s restaurant in New York City, where a group of 21 prominent German-American businessmen, led by civil rights lawyer Hugo Wesendonck, gathered to create the Germania Life Insurance Company of America. Our founders raised $200,000 in equity capital, which was twice the amount required by New York State law, showcasing that from the beginning, we’ve been committed to being financially strong for the long-term benefit of our policyholders.
Renamed “The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America” in 1918, we converted in 1925 from a mixed stock and mutual company into one that is wholly owned by our policyholders. We continued to expand our product portfolio over the years, expanding into the employee benefits market in 1957 and increasing our presence in the individual disability income insurance market with the merger of Berkshire Life Insurance Company of America in 2001.
Today, we are one of the largest mutual insurance companies in the United States with $7.4 billion in capital and $1.5 billion in operating income*. We have approximately 8,800 employees in the United States and a network of more than 2,750 financial representatives in more than 58 agencies nationwide.
Below are some key milestones in Guardian’s history.

About Us









How does a company get to be over 150 years old, while still staying relevant today? The answer lies in maintaining a strong set of values while keeping our clients’ needs primary in everything we do. As a mutual insurance company, we are owned by our policyholders who share in Guardian’s actual financial results through annual dividends*. These payments are determined by the firm’s profits, and Guardian has paid a dividend every year since 1868. We take the very long view, invest soundly, and maintain a strong capital base that enables us to meet our insurance commitments today and far into the future. Our sole responsibility is to our clients and policyholders, and that is reflected in everything we do.

Monthly Report - (includes Standardized and Non-Standardized Data)

 













The Guardian Investor variable annuity contract unit values and investment returns will fluctuate to reflect the investment performance of the investment options, and may be higher or lower than the amount invested through purchase payments. Investment in any of the variable investment options involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. All performance data quoted is historical and the results represent past performance and neither guarantee nor predict future investment results. 
To obtain performance data current to the most recent month (availability within 7 business days of the most recent month end), please call us at 1-800-221-3253. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted here. Return information for each investment option is presented in two ways and the numbers vary. The differences reflect the different charges that are deducted and the dates from which the returns are calculated. 
NOTE: To view performance information for annuities, you will need Acrobat Reader that is available FREE by clicking here. 
Guardian, its subsidiaries, agents or employees do not give tax or legal advice. You should consult your tax or legal advisor regarding your individual situation.







Variable annuities and their underlying variable investment options are sold by prospectus only. Prospectuses contain important information, including fees and expenses. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money. You should consider the investment objectives, risks, fees and charges of the investment company carefully before investing.

Annuities are long-term investment vehicles that involve certain risks, including possible loss of the principal amount invested. The investment return and principal value may fluctuate so that the investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Withdrawals of taxable amounts will be subject to ordinary income tax and possible mandatory federal income tax withholding. If taken prior to age 59½, a 10% IRS penalty may also apply. Withdrawals affect the variable annuity’s death benefit, cash surrender value and any optional benefits and may also be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge.
Insurance products are offered through a licensed/registered bank or broker/dealer, but underwritten by insurance companies. All guarantees mentioned on this site are guarantees of the insurance company and not guarantees of the financial institution.

What's an Annuity?










 
One of the few guarantees in life

Looking forward to a long and happy retirement? Consider an income source with guarantees. What is an annuity? Simply, an annuity is a contract with an insurance company that can ensure you have a guaranteed income. To help you reach a retirement you’ll enjoy, we offer variable annuities, fixed annuities, and income annuities. Watch the videos to learn more.

ANNUITY TYPES WE OFFER












 
Why spend your retirement worrying about income?

A great retirement is knowing you can enjoy the life you imagined. Annuities can create a fixed stream of income, starting in as little as a month. Or, receive guaranteed income in the future. If you choose, this income could last for life. 
Explore Income Annuities 









 
EXHALE – RETIREMENT SHOULD BE RELAXING

Studies show that most people are happier in retirement when they have a level of steady income1. With fixed annuities, you know exactly how much you’ll earn each year. And, when you’re ready, you’ll receive a payout of set amounts, at intervals you choose. You’ve been saving for retirement. Plan on enjoying it.
More about Fixed Annuities 









 
HERE, TIME IS YOUR FRIEND

When you’re retired, life is very much about income. Growth potential over time can be important, although there are always risks. Variable annuities tie in certain tax advantages, retirement income, and the possibility for growth when the market rises.

The information provided herein is not written or intended as tax or legal advice and may not be relied on for purposes of avoiding any federal tax penalties. This information supports the promotion and marketing of this annuity. 
Current tax law is subject to interpretation and legislative change. Tax results and the appropriateness of any product for any specific taxpayer may vary depending on the particular set of facts and circumstances. Entities or persons distributing this information are not authorized to give tax or legal advice. Individuals are encouraged to seek specific advice from their personal tax or legal counsel. 
Insurance products are offered through a licensed/registered bank or broker/dealer (financial institution), but underwritten by insurance companies. All guarantees mentioned on this site are guarantees of the insurance company and not guarantees of the financial institution. 
Annuity guarantees are backed exclusively by the strength and claims-paying ability of The Guardian Insurance & Annuity Company, Inc. (GIAC).
Contract provisions and investment options vary by state.
Annuities are issued by The Guardian Insurance & Annuity Company, Inc. (GIAC), a Delaware corporation. Individual variable annuities are distributed by Park Avenue Securities LLC (PAS). GIAC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America (Guardian). PAS is a wholly owned subsidiary of GIAC. Guardian, GIAC, and PAS are located at 7 Hanover Square, NY, NY 10004. 
There is no additional tax deferral benefit for annuity contracts purchased in an IRA or other tax-qualified plan, since these are already afforded tax-deferred status. Thus, an annuity should only be purchased in an IRA or qualified plan if you value some of the other features of the annuity and are willing to incur any additional costs associated with the annuity to receive such benefits.
Variable annuities are long-term investment vehicles that involve certain risks, including possible loss of the principal amount invested. The investment return and principal value may fluctuate so that the investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Withdrawals of taxable amounts will be subject to ordinary income tax and possible mandatory federal income tax withholding. If taken prior to age 59½, a 10% IRS penalty may also apply. Withdrawals affect the variable annuity’s death benefit, cash surrender value and any living benefit and may also be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
