Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. (TSX-V: WEE) is one of North America's largest providers of secondary oil recovery and environmental technologies. The company was founded in 1997 as PE-TECH by CEO Brett Davidson and University of Alberta professor Tim Spanos.[1] The company was later changed to Wavefront Technologies and Environmental Services and then Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. and is known for its patented technology that sends pulses through the ground to simulate the effects of the aftershock of an earthquake to aid in the recovery of stranded oil.[2] These technologies simulate the beating of a heart - when a heart pumps, it sends pulses through the bodies blood vessels, causing the network of capillaries to expand and contract. When a pulse is applied to the ground, it expands and contracts the porous rock, essentially freeing the trapped oil.[3] This technology is used for fluid flow optimization having applications in both the environmental and energy sectors. In the environmental sector the process is marketed as Primawave, while in the energy sector it is marketed as Powerwave.[1]
Powerwave technology has been put to use in more than 175 well applications throughout North America, including applications in California, Oklahoma and Alberta.[4] Powerwave has already been used in the field by EnCana, Penn West Energy Trust, Pengrowth Energy Trust, BP, Chevron and Apache Corporation, among others.
Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. is headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and has offices in Calgary, Alberta and Cambridge, Ontario. The company also has offices in Houston, and Raleigh, North Carolina.

History[edit]
Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc., was founded in 1997 under the name PE-TECH Inc. (Pulse Enhancement Technology Inc.).[1] PE-TECH, a privately held company holding intellectual property operated three subsidiaries; Prism Production Technologies Inc., Wavefront Environmental Technologies Inc., and E2 Solutions Inc. (US subsidiary standing for "Energy and Environmental").[1] In 2000 the shareholders of the privately held PE-TECH Inc., entered into an agreement with a publicly listed company (or in this case a shell of a company) on the TSX Venture Exchange.
A reverse takeover of that entity transformed PE-TECH Inc., from a privately held company to a publicly traded company under the name Wavefront Energy and Environmental Services Inc. For consistency in name branding Prism Production Technologies was renamed Wavefront Reservoir Technologies Inc., Wavefront Environmental Technologies was rolled into Wavefront Reservoir Technologies Inc. and E2 Solutions Inc. was renamed Wavefront Energy and Environmental Services USA Inc.[1] Effective March 27, 2009 the company’s name was changed to “Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc.”
Rationale[edit]




Diagram of trapped oil in soil and rock


Brett Davidson and University of Alberta professor Tim Spanos teamed up in 1997 to fulfill a need that they believed to exist in the onshore oil drilling industry. While working on oil well stimulation site in Alberta, Canada, Davidson heard from a friend in the industry that there was a need for fast, effective, and inexpensive stimulation treatment for oil wells.[5]
After using the most sophisticated oil recovery techniques, oil companies only retrieve a fraction of the crude oil at their sites. The oil well will become too uneconomical to continue pumping because most of the remaining oil is stuck in the nooks and crannies between the rock and sand.[6]
Even after all work is done, around 60% of oil is left in the ground. With more than 200,000 fields in North America alone, extracting even as little as 10% more oil would translate to billions of more barrels of oil recovered.[3]
Primary Oil Recovery Stage[edit]
During primary recovery, the natural pressure of the reservoir or gravity drive oil into the wellbore, combined with artificial lift techniques (such as pumps) which bring the oil to the surface. But only about 10 percent of a reservoir's original oil in place is typically produced during primary recovery.[6]
But petroleum isn’t the only thing trapped in the earth. Water hides there too. Sooner or later, the reservoir begins producing water, along with oil, and it becomes uneconomical to continue. The oil companies will then re-inject the water back into the reservoir. This stage of production is called secondary recovery.[6]
Secondary Oil Recovery Stage[edit]
Water injection helps maintain downhole pressure so that oil can continue to flow. Water from the injection well is also used to sweep or push the oil towards the producing wells. But rock in the reservoir has varying permeabilities; the more permeable the rock is, the more easily the fluid can flow through.[6]




Water takes the path of least resistance when pumped into the ground


Unfortunately, water flows more readily than oil, and it always takes the path of least resistance. Once water creates a channel through the permeable rock to the producing wellbore, there is little benefit in injecting additional water. It only bypasses the oil instead of sweeping it ahead. The result is poor recovery from the reservoir.[7]
Products and Technologies[edit]
Wavefront Technology Solutions's patented technology was created to combat the “path of least resistance”. In this way, the Powerwave and the Primawave share the same scientific principles. This technology, originally penned as "Power Pulse Technology", uses pulses to improve the liquid flow in the ground for improved oil recovery (IOR) in the energy sector and groundwater remediation in the environmental sector. These identical processes generate a fluid pulse that momentarily expands the pore structure of rock and soil. Liquid is then able to flow freely and more uniformly.[8]
Early iterations of Wavefront Technology Solutions's Power Pulse Technology were penned the “Premier Pulse Tool”. The Premier Pulse Tool, or PPT for short, was a two-meter long steel mandrel with a valve system on top and inverted swab cups on the bottom.[5]




Diagram of how Powerwave and Primawave’s fluid pulses generate a more uniform flow of liquid.


Using a standard well servicing rig, the PPT would be lowered to a location above the well perforations. The tool would then be raised up eight meters and dropped. This was done between 200-550 times over eight to 12 hours.[5]
This workover and field stimulation technique used steady, non-seismic pulse vibrations to knock out perforation blockage and create a tsunami-like wave effect that encouraged flow in the reservoir.[5]
This technology, utilized in both the Powerwave and Primawave, generates a fluid pressure pulse that causes a momentary elastic flexure of the pore structure. This pressure pulse moves fluid in and out of a larger number of pore networks, obtaining a more uniform injection front.[8]
Powerwave[edit]
In the energy sector, Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. has patented the Power Pulse Technology as “Powerwave.” This process has been field-tested and proven to increase the amount of oil recovered from on shore oil wells, including low-producing or even abandoned fields.[9] Powerwave utilizes this technology to improve the flow of water through geological materials, including sedimentary soils and fractured rock. These materials are composed of a solid matrix and pore structure, which contain fluids such as gas and oil.[3]
The Powerwave tool generates a fluid displacement wave in the porous media akin to ripples from a stone thrown in a pond. These ripples generate high liquid accelerations in the pores facing liquids out, or treatment fluids in.[10]
In the ten plus years that the technology behind Powerwave has been developed by Wavefront Technologies and Environmental Services, it has evolved from a product that cost nearly $1 to make and had to be transported using two tractor trailers to one that can be shipped via courier.[3] The Powerwave tool now is only one meter high and eight centimeters in diameter. Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. leases the product to oil companies and charges around $3,000 a month for a minimum 12-month period.[3]
Powerwave’s ability to improve uniformity in oil wells has translated to higher production rates, extending the life of a field, and enhancing its value.[9] In Texas, one recent field trial raised production rates from eight wells by 26%. A similar project in Alberta, Canada initially raised output by 18%.[9]
Primawave[edit]
In the environmental sector, Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. has patented the Power Pulse Technology as “Primawave.” Primawave is used largely in the United States. It is licensed to service providers to use the process in conjunction with established methods to treat and eliminate hazardous chemicals from contaminated groundwater.[11]
NASA once used Primawave to clean up soil that had been contaminated with tetrachloroethylene (dry-cleaning fluid). In the 1960s NASA had used the hazardous chemical to remove the soot generated by rockets from the launch site.[3]
Years after using the chemical, the area was saturated with carcinogens. NASA knew that a mixture including iron fillings would decontaminate the soil. NASA then used the Primawave to get the fillings into the ground.[3]

Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. (TSX-V: WEE) is one of North America's largest providers of secondary oil recovery and environmental technologies. The company was founded in 1997 as PE-TECH by CEO Brett Davidson and University of Alberta professor Tim Spanos.[1] The company was later changed to Wavefront Technologies and Environmental Services and then Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. and is known for its patented technology that sends pulses through the ground to simulate the effects of the aftershock of an earthquake to aid in the recovery of stranded oil.[2] These technologies simulate the beating of a heart - when a heart pumps, it sends pulses through the bodies blood vessels, causing the network of capillaries to expand and contract. When a pulse is applied to the ground, it expands and contracts the porous rock, essentially freeing the trapped oil.[3] This technology is used for fluid flow optimization having applications in both the environmental and energy sectors. In the environmental sector the process is marketed as Primawave, while in the energy sector it is marketed as Powerwave.[1]
Powerwave technology has been put to use in more than 175 well applications throughout North America, including applications in California, Oklahoma and Alberta.[4] Powerwave has already been used in the field by EnCana, Penn West Energy Trust, Pengrowth Energy Trust, BP, Chevron and Apache Corporation, among others.
Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. is headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and has offices in Calgary, Alberta and Cambridge, Ontario. The company also has offices in Houston, and Raleigh, North Carolina.

History[edit]
Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc., was founded in 1997 under the name PE-TECH Inc. (Pulse Enhancement Technology Inc.).[1] PE-TECH, a privately held company holding intellectual property operated three subsidiaries; Prism Production Technologies Inc., Wavefront Environmental Technologies Inc., and E2 Solutions Inc. (US subsidiary standing for "Energy and Environmental").[1] In 2000 the shareholders of the privately held PE-TECH Inc., entered into an agreement with a publicly listed company (or in this case a shell of a company) on the TSX Venture Exchange.
A reverse takeover of that entity transformed PE-TECH Inc., from a privately held company to a publicly traded company under the name Wavefront Energy and Environmental Services Inc. For consistency in name branding Prism Production Technologies was renamed Wavefront Reservoir Technologies Inc., Wavefront Environmental Technologies was rolled into Wavefront Reservoir Technologies Inc. and E2 Solutions Inc. was renamed Wavefront Energy and Environmental Services USA Inc.[1] Effective March 27, 2009 the company’s name was changed to “Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc.”
Rationale[edit]




Diagram of trapped oil in soil and rock


Brett Davidson and University of Alberta professor Tim Spanos teamed up in 1997 to fulfill a need that they believed to exist in the onshore oil drilling industry. While working on oil well stimulation site in Alberta, Canada, Davidson heard from a friend in the industry that there was a need for fast, effective, and inexpensive stimulation treatment for oil wells.[5]
After using the most sophisticated oil recovery techniques, oil companies only retrieve a fraction of the crude oil at their sites. The oil well will become too uneconomical to continue pumping because most of the remaining oil is stuck in the nooks and crannies between the rock and sand.[6]
Even after all work is done, around 60% of oil is left in the ground. With more than 200,000 fields in North America alone, extracting even as little as 10% more oil would translate to billions of more barrels of oil recovered.[3]
Primary Oil Recovery Stage[edit]
During primary recovery, the natural pressure of the reservoir or gravity drive oil into the wellbore, combined with artificial lift techniques (such as pumps) which bring the oil to the surface. But only about 10 percent of a reservoir's original oil in place is typically produced during primary recovery.[6]
But petroleum isn’t the only thing trapped in the earth. Water hides there too. Sooner or later, the reservoir begins producing water, along with oil, and it becomes uneconomical to continue. The oil companies will then re-inject the water back into the reservoir. This stage of production is called secondary recovery.[6]
Secondary Oil Recovery Stage[edit]
Water injection helps maintain downhole pressure so that oil can continue to flow. Water from the injection well is also used to sweep or push the oil towards the producing wells. But rock in the reservoir has varying permeabilities; the more permeable the rock is, the more easily the fluid can flow through.[6]




Water takes the path of least resistance when pumped into the ground


Unfortunately, water flows more readily than oil, and it always takes the path of least resistance. Once water creates a channel through the permeable rock to the producing wellbore, there is little benefit in injecting additional water. It only bypasses the oil instead of sweeping it ahead. The result is poor recovery from the reservoir.[7]
Products and Technologies[edit]
Wavefront Technology Solutions's patented technology was created to combat the “path of least resistance”. In this way, the Powerwave and the Primawave share the same scientific principles. This technology, originally penned as "Power Pulse Technology", uses pulses to improve the liquid flow in the ground for improved oil recovery (IOR) in the energy sector and groundwater remediation in the environmental sector. These identical processes generate a fluid pulse that momentarily expands the pore structure of rock and soil. Liquid is then able to flow freely and more uniformly.[8]
Early iterations of Wavefront Technology Solutions's Power Pulse Technology were penned the “Premier Pulse Tool”. The Premier Pulse Tool, or PPT for short, was a two-meter long steel mandrel with a valve system on top and inverted swab cups on the bottom.[5]




Diagram of how Powerwave and Primawave’s fluid pulses generate a more uniform flow of liquid.


Using a standard well servicing rig, the PPT would be lowered to a location above the well perforations. The tool would then be raised up eight meters and dropped. This was done between 200-550 times over eight to 12 hours.[5]
This workover and field stimulation technique used steady, non-seismic pulse vibrations to knock out perforation blockage and create a tsunami-like wave effect that encouraged flow in the reservoir.[5]
This technology, utilized in both the Powerwave and Primawave, generates a fluid pressure pulse that causes a momentary elastic flexure of the pore structure. This pressure pulse moves fluid in and out of a larger number of pore networks, obtaining a more uniform injection front.[8]
Powerwave[edit]
In the energy sector, Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. has patented the Power Pulse Technology as “Powerwave.” This process has been field-tested and proven to increase the amount of oil recovered from on shore oil wells, including low-producing or even abandoned fields.[9] Powerwave utilizes this technology to improve the flow of water through geological materials, including sedimentary soils and fractured rock. These materials are composed of a solid matrix and pore structure, which contain fluids such as gas and oil.[3]
The Powerwave tool generates a fluid displacement wave in the porous media akin to ripples from a stone thrown in a pond. These ripples generate high liquid accelerations in the pores facing liquids out, or treatment fluids in.[10]
In the ten plus years that the technology behind Powerwave has been developed by Wavefront Technologies and Environmental Services, it has evolved from a product that cost nearly $1 to make and had to be transported using two tractor trailers to one that can be shipped via courier.[3] The Powerwave tool now is only one meter high and eight centimeters in diameter. Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. leases the product to oil companies and charges around $3,000 a month for a minimum 12-month period.[3]
Powerwave’s ability to improve uniformity in oil wells has translated to higher production rates, extending the life of a field, and enhancing its value.[9] In Texas, one recent field trial raised production rates from eight wells by 26%. A similar project in Alberta, Canada initially raised output by 18%.[9]
Primawave[edit]
In the environmental sector, Wavefront Technology Solutions Inc. has patented the Power Pulse Technology as “Primawave.” Primawave is used largely in the United States. It is licensed to service providers to use the process in conjunction with established methods to treat and eliminate hazardous chemicals from contaminated groundwater.[11]
NASA once used Primawave to clean up soil that had been contaminated with tetrachloroethylene (dry-cleaning fluid). In the 1960s NASA had used the hazardous chemical to remove the soot generated by rockets from the launch site.[3]
Years after using the chemical, the area was saturated with carcinogens. NASA knew that a mixture including iron fillings would decontaminate the soil. NASA then used the Primawave to get the fillings into the ground.[3]

Clover











  


 The IOT vendor needed Wavefront to monitor thousands of devices in the field.   






CASE STUDY: CLOVER
Clover builds integrated point-of-sale devices for merchants, from customized hardware to cloud-based software. It has deployed more than 100,000 smart payment terminals, primarily serving small- and medium-sized businesses, and is growing quickly. Since 2013, the firm has been a subsidiary of First Data, the world’s largest credit card processor.





  






The Challenge
With customers literally depending on Clover’s terminals to do business, reliability is key. Three years after launching, the start-up found it increasingly difficult to track the health of its growing fleet of devices. It was relying primarily on customer service reports and analysis of field returns to identify problems. This reactive approach was expensive, slow and imprecise. Most importantly, it diminished merchant satisfaction.







  






Our Solution
Clover co-founder and President of Engineering John Beatty oversaw a roll-out of the Wavefront data analytics platform. Previously, data from sensors on the company’s devices wasn’t being captured, let alone analyzed. Now, with more 100,000 devices in the field collecting data from the OS, application and hardware, engineers had unprecedented visibility. By enabling metrics they cared about, they could easily track everything from temperature fluctuations to software failures, identifying and fixing issues before customers noticed.
For example, engineers quickly noticed that four percent of devices were sluggish for four hours a day. Using the platform, they isolated a faulty software component that was causing light sensors to go haywire in certain lighting conditions. “Before Wavefront, we would’ve had no clue what was going on,” Beatty says. “We were able to fix the software bug and validate that it had exactly the effect we intended.”
Once Clover had insights into performance, it began using Wavefront to inform project management decisions. For instance, the team tracked how often merchants were charging Clover’s mobile devices to help understand optimal battery size, ensuring new devices were as compact and inexpensive as possible. The data has fed into requirements for a product currently in development.
Clover has also used Wavefront to speed up and improve the quality of software releases. Employing phased roll-outs, Clover has used metrics to quickly validate whether new releases cause any problems in updated devices. “It’s an absolutely critical tool for us to release software confidently. If we didn’t have it, we’d be slower and more conservative and make more mistakes in production,” Beatty says.
Wavefront is optimal for Internet of Things companies such as Clover, because “historically devices aren’t terribly well-instrumented, and there’s a lot of guessing,” Beatty says. Devices in the field often operate on low-bandwidth connections, so they don’t pump out massive amounts of logs. In addition, many of the data points companies like his care about — from system load to CPU utilization — are classic metrics. For Clover’s part, “We continue to add metrics anywhere and everywhere,” Beatty says.







  




The Results
Adopting Wavefront has reduced Clover’s support calls, meaning both happier customers and higher profit margins. It has also curtailed outages, and prevented revenue loss. According to Beatty, improved performance correlates directly with how many of Clover’s devices are sold in First Data’s distribution network, which also markets earlier-generation competitors. The visibility Wavefront offers is a critical foundation for the company’s plans to scale up, including future international expansion. And it has allowed Clover to move faster, with better products and speedier software releases. “It’s critical for the pace of innovation,” Beatty says.





  


 “ Before Wavefront, we would have no clue about what was going on. Now we can fix software bugs and validate that the changes had exactly the effects we intended. John BeattyClover cofounder and President of Engineering

Comprehensive API100% of the Wavefront service is available to your developers
      




  





“Wavefront was designed from the ground up with maximizing integration options in mind. All actions that take place in the User Interface can also be performed by API calls. Integrating Wavefront with your environment is easy, thanks to our flexible API. Whether you have custom visualizations, external applications/alerting systems, or are looking for ways to programmatically create charts and dashboards. Wavefront has it covered.”

-Clement Pang, Founder & Engineer





  




EVENTS
Using Wavefront, users can easily overlay system events onto charts. For example, a code deployment event can be overlaid and used to see how the deployment correlates with your underlying system and application. Users can also generate external events alongside various actions with the flexible API, including operational orchestration with tools such as Puppet and Chef. Additionally, we can create events for each change, deployment, or release. The Events API allows you to easily configure any platform to send events directly to Wavefront.





  




TAGGING
When bringing up or taking down hosts in the cloud, ops scripts can call Wavefront’s flexible API to automatically tag hosts or sources in Wavefront. Therefore, this makes it easy to group hosts in Wavefront, in order to set alerts on them or query for them later.





  




NOTIFICATIONS & ALERTS
Most of our customers take the alerts generated from Wavefront, and forward them to e-mails and PagerDuty. This is a standard feature in Wavefront.
Along with this, we also support Webhooks, which can make your alerting options even more powerful. Webhooks in Wavefront allow users to integrate actions with alerts. With Webhooks, Wavefront’s flexible API can invoke arbitrary actions when alerts fire, enabling you to execute auto-remediation scripts, or configure arbitrary actions beyond the out-of-the-box e-mail and PagerDuty integrations. Additionally, apart from the standard notifications in Wavefront, you can configure Webhooks to notify your other systems and pass useful information around an alerting event.
We have customers who have integrated alerts with enterprise messaging systems like Slack and Hipchat.





  




VISUALIZATIONS
Wavefront’s flexible API supports various charts types, such as line chart, point plot, and stacked area charts. Further, these chart types are widely used in most telemetry monitoring use cases. We also continue to add more chart types, and customers can extend their capabilities themselves by extracting Wavefront’s query results and importing them into many other visualization platforms and UIs.
Using the Query API, our customers can use Wavefront as the telemetry platform and query engine and interface it with their existing UI, or any other UI of their choosing.
There are stunning examples where customers have integrated Wavefront with D3 charts, and created calendar heat maps, or bar charts.





  




D3 AND MORE
One of our customers created a dashboard that captured business metrics, which represented features and their respective availabilities. They sourced data originating from various regions (eg: Iowa/Virginia). The information was displayed in month/week/day views. Therefore they were able to create their own calendar based heat-map visualization by using the Wavefront API.










  









They created their own custom visualization, and used it in addition to Wavefront’s own charts. The Wavefront API makes it easy to get data out, so customers can visualize their data in any way they wish.





  




STATISTICAL COMPUTATIONS
Wavefront can deliver real-time, high-frequency data: fast ingestion, real-time querying, speed-of-thought analytics, clear visualizations, and effective alerting. Additionally, the Wavefront query language is capable of performing most of the transformations you’ll need for daily monitoring. However, there are cases when you may want to perform very complex computations that the query language doesn’t currently offer, or leverage a set of libraries you’ve already written in R to do analytics. In these cases, you may want to run R as a separate analytics layer on top of your Wavefront account.










  









With Wavefront R Library, you should be able to do just about any type of analysis or visualization you can imagine. Want to see a histogram of your metric at an arbitrary bin-width? Or a heat map of the correlations between your metrics? Or model your metrics for trends, seasonality, noise, and make a forecast about future behavior? All this can be easily done using the Wavefront R Library.

 Lumetrics Acquires WaveFront Sciences Products 
 Wed, 08/08/2012 - 8:24am 
 Comments 
 by Lumetrics Inc.  

 



Lumetrics Inc. announced today that it is acquiring key assets of the former WaveFront Sciences Company from Abbott.  This business transaction will allow Lumetrics to expand its repertoire of services and grow its business substantially. 
Lumetrics, begun in Rochester in 2003, is known for its OptiGauge system, which is designed to reduce production time and enhance quality for the manufacturers of medical devices, optics, and industrial materials. 
Two of the three new assets will help Lumetrics in one of its main areas of business – that of assisting lens-makers with quality control.  The new assets include the ClearWave and CrystalWave products, critical in the ophthalmics industry for the production of contact lenses and intraocular lenses.  With these acquisitions, Lumetrics will now be able to help contact lens makers and lens-implant makers reach unprecedented levels of precision.  The ultimate goal is to help manufacturers produce consistently clear, comfortable, and reliable contact and IOL lenses. 
With a third product, the CLAS-2D sensor, Lumetrics will have the ability to monitor quality in several new arenas, most notably that of laser light.  The sensor can measure, align, and direct laser light, allowing Lumetrics to work with everything from microscopic optics to satellite communications.
Lumetrics, which started at High Tech Rochester’s (HTR) Lennox Tech Enterprise Center, is expected to grow by 40 percent, with the new acquisitions.  “The WaveFront Sciences products are a perfect fit to our business,” said John Hart, CEO Lumetrics.  “We share the same ophthalmic customer base and this acquisition allows us to merge our technologies to provide a more feature-rich offering to solve customer problems that neither company could do on its own.” 
The new CLAS-2D offering allows Lumetrics to enter a whole new market with existing and new products.   “We are excited about obtaining such an important diagnostic tool,” Hart said.   “This allows us to better serve our customers and we look forward to the significant growth opportunities these products will bring.”
Lumetrics closed on the acquisition in July and is in the process of the knowledge transfer to its Rochester, New York headquarters.  Lumetrics will continue to work with key individuals from WaveFront Sciences, including hardware and software engineers and sales & marketing individuals.  Terms of the acquisition will remain confidential.
“We have finalized orders for new systems, as well as maintenance and service contracts for existing systems,” said Steve Heveron-Smith, Vice President of Business Development.  “Our engineering team, furthermore, is already talking with customers on combined Lumetrics and WaveFront Sciences products.”

Pricing










  




Flexible Usage Based Pricing



  








  Pricing is based on data rate – pay for what you use
 Billed Annually
 Enterprise-class customer support included
 Highly scalable solution with fine-grained granularity
 Standard and custom metrics (no pricing difference)
 Easy and powerful query language for ultimate flexibility
 
Contact us for more pricing info 









  






  









Q: How does the Wavefront pricing model work?
A: We have a simple and flexible pay-as-you-go model. Our usage-based price is based on the rate at which you send metric data to Wavefront during the course of each month. This gives you the flexibility to start with any size application you want and scale up/down as needed.
Q: Do you charge more for customer support?
A: No! Unlike some other monitoring products, enterprise-class support is included in the price. We pride ourselves on making every customer successful, whatever it takes.
Q: Do you charge for storing metrics data?
A: No, you do not pay any storage costs for your data.
Q: What if I have an unexpected peak or burst of data in a month?
A: We understand that you may occasionally have peaks and bursts of data that are not typical –and we do not want to unfairly charge you for those. We measure the rate that is used for pricing as the 95th percentile of the 1 hour averages of data rates for the month. This provides you with a no-cost buffer for occasional peaks and bursts.
Q: How do I budget for how much Wavefront will cost?
A: Talk to us! We have a lot of experience with different customers and applications and can help you estimate your costs. To give you an idea, a typical host configuration that is sending 100 metrics every 10 seconds would cost $15 per host per month.
Q: Does the price vary for different types of metric data?
A: No. Our pricing model is very simple and we do not differentiate on the types of metrics data you send us. Standard metrics and custom metrics are the same price. We have many customers who send us a combination of typical system metrics, application metrics (standard and custom) and even custom business metrics.
Q: Can I manage how many metrics are sent from the agent on a host to Wavefront?
A: Yes, you have complete control over how much data is sent to Wavefront and what that data is.
Q: Do you charge for data collection agents?
A: No. Our pricing model is only based on the metrics data –we don’t care where that data comes from. You can have as many or as few data collection agents as you like.

About the Wavefront Service





  




Wavefront is a cloud-hosted service where you send your time-series (metric) data – from CollectD, StatsD, JMX, Ruby’s logger, AWS, anything.
You can then perform arbitrary mathematical operations on any number of those series, render charts to see anomalies or KPI dashboards, and ultimately create truly intelligent alerts to proactively watch over your entire stack.
It scales seamlessly, it’s reliable, it’s feature complete, and the support is great. It’s everything you always want, but never get.

Why Wavefront






  


  




https://www.wavefront.com/wp-content/themes/salient/css/fonts/svg/basic_elaboration_cloud_search.svg
You want to see right into the heart of your system, at granular detail, however big and complicated that might be.









  




https://www.wavefront.com/wp-content/themes/salient/css/fonts/svg/basic_alarm.svg
You want to create smarter, dynamic alerts off meaningful telemetry gathered from every corner of your estate.









  




https://www.wavefront.com/wp-content/themes/salient/css/fonts/svg/arrows_clockwise_dashed.svg
Your current monitoring approach isn’t scaling, i.e. it’s taking too much time, expertise, and cost to get what you want.

WaveFront Technology Inc. - Light Management Films




















 








 

 






 


















 





LIGHT MANAGEMENT FILMS
 




















 






                  WFT's embossing capabilities are wide reaching. Micro-Structured features are used to control light from simply bending light in one direction to diffuse light in a controlled manner or to create a complicated 3Dimensional image. We can replicate features as small as a few nanometers to over 150 microns in height. We emboss rolls of film product from 6" to 68" wide with thickness of 12.5 microns to 300 microns. WFT's Proprietary Tooling technology allows us to obtain shorter job turnaround with a degree of complexity possessed by few other producers in the world. We are capable of producing replicated structures with nearly vertical walls for application not typically serviced by a roll to roll production process which can deliver large volumes of product at economical prices. Once a structure has been replicated WFT has the capability to finish the product in-house. WFT is a one-stop producer for all your micro-structure replication needs.

      WFT has the capability of originating many forms of microstructures. We have in-house Diamond Turning, Holographic, and some Lithographic origination capabilities and can obtain other origination tooling such as Laser Oblation, Computer Generated Holograms and Dot Matrix holograms.

      WFT has become a fully integrated facility with the ability to originate your Diamond Turned Machined (DTM) structure, produce product of the structure in a R2R process, metallize it if necessary and finish it, completely in-house. WFT's new Diamond Turning Facility is an ultra precision diamond machining lab. The materials that are currently machined are Acrylic, Brass, Copper and Nickel. Many types of Molds can be produced in this lab. These Molds are then turned into embossing tools used on a UV casting machine to replicate the structure onto a film substrate. The types of cuts that can be made for tool/mold fabrication include: Cylindrical Drum tools, Flat faced mold tools and Fly-cut tools for exotic and deep aspect ratio films. The types of Patterns that can be cut include: Grooves (prism and truncated prism structures), Grooves that have a new angle on each cut and also valleys with rounded tip radii up to virtual dead sharp notches. At WFT, molds can be manipulated after cutting. The shape can be changed or textured in a way that diamond turning alone can not achieve
      Wavefront's Holographic capabilities are a result of years working on industrial applications employing Holographic Optical Elements (HOE'S). These were used for applications like linear and rotary encoders, back-plane reflectors for lighting application, telecom elements, etc. Our recording facility has produced the largest diffraction gratings in the world to meet the highest demands of the package industry. This lab is capable of originating Hoe's, Diffraction Gratings, and Holographic Diffusers (TMD®).

        Lithographic images can be originated using high quality mask to generate a 2 dimensional patterns with depths up to several microns.

        Our Proprietary Tooling has been developed over the last 14 years. WFT provides tooling to the holographic embossing industry and is known for rapid turnaround and high quality. This tooling technology allows WFT to combine microstructures (Step and Repeat) starting from as small as ¼" to as large as 48" x 72". With this technology, WFT was able to decrease the turnaround time in the holographic embossing industry from what use to take 3 weeks to as little as 1 day. 

        WFT employs the same technology with DTM structures such as Prisms. Unlike other manufacturers of prismatic films who run directly off of a DTM cylinder, WFT makes master tooling from the DTM cylinder. We then combine the prism structure into panels which size is dependent on the final product. This allows us to build a tooling tree that we rely on to continue a product line for many years. Instead of having to re-cut a cylinder when an image wears out or gets damaged, we only go back 1 generation and make a new "copy" which is used to make the product. This is a cost effective method which allows for a consistent product with a long life. 

        Production Equipment is custom built in-house and some operated in class 10,000 CleanRooms. Since the equipment used to make our products is specialized we had to design it ourselves. WFT has a full machine shop which builds and maintains our equipment. Because it is built here, we have the intimate knowledge that allows us to maintain, repair and improve the equipment. This equipment is proprietary and very specialized and would be difficult for a competitor to duplicate with out the years of experience we already have.

        UV formulations used to make our products are mixed in-house. WFT has a UV polymer lab used for R&D and a production mixing facility. WFT has many standard formulations produced in house by mixing various raw materials together. These formulations are used to produce product on our production equipment. We currently produce many different custom formulations depending on the required micro-structured product. Different structures require different raw materials depending on the specifications of the final product. This in-house ability allows us full control to adjust a formulation during R&D to work for a specific structure to achieve the desired result.

        WFT is a leader in the nanostructure and microstructure industry due to our vast experience with so many different structures. We have over 20 year experience working with microstructures as well as over 12 years producing rolls of product. There are few companies with the experience and ability to originate, tool up, and produce the custom products that WFT is capable of producing.

        WFT Technology, Inc. (WFT) produces a number of custom micro-replicated optical films.
