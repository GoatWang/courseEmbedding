Who we Are - QUATTRO M SECURITIES, Inc.HomeWho we AreContact UsPersonel e-mail listHYBRIDIZATION OF HUMAN AND ELECTRONIC TRADINGEugene ("Gene") L. MauroPresident and CEOGene founded Quattro M Securities, Inc. in 1995 after 30 years of experience in the markets from clerk to specialist. Gene started the company to satisfy a need for personal service he never received from other firms. He was a pioneer in early 2002 when he took the bold initiative of making Quattro (via DirectEX ) a Direct Access Brokerage firm.Today, Quattro M Securities,Inc. is one of the largest independent direct access member broker dealer firms  in operation on the floor of the NYSE, and has actually grown since the introduction of the "Hybrid Market" model at the NYSE.  DirectEX has embraced the use of state of the art technology and performance with personal human interaction to create a true "Hybrid" model. Quattro has a staff of nine floor brokers and complimentary clerical personnel, all experienced and trained to work with the hybrid system in use on the floor of the NYSE.  The firm is capable of executing orders for clients and providing clearing services, if necessary.  With this extensive staff, Quattro can handle orders of any size and with any specific instructions.  From the floor of the NYSE, our brokers have access to over 40 trading platforms, giving them availability to extended liquidity.  Our floor traders use their experience by being proactive to changes in the volatile market place of today.  They identify trends in the market ahead of the computer generated alogorithms that are now solely used by a large number of brokerage firms.  Many of these firms have abandoned human involvement and the floor, in executing orders of listed NYSE listed securities, where greater opportunity to compete exists. Quattro havng a unique position on the trading floor of the NYSE, uses this advantage to offer price improvement over computer generated only programs.  The floor team integrates service with technology. links Privacy Statement 606 statementMEMBER NYSE Euronext, AMEX, ARCA, FINRA & SIPC

He is client focused and has a high degree of integrity.See moreSee lessI consider myself fortunate for having had the opportunity to work with Jimmy Lamb while at Merrill Lynch. To me Jimmy was the most influential broker to my professional development. Like most clerks when I started on the floor I believed there were many more years ahead, however unfortunate this turned out not to be the case. The things that I admired about James as a broker was his common sense, his intelligence, and his uncommon commitment to the clerks that worked for him. Although it is often a cliche, in this case it is not, Jimmy is truly a team player. I have no doubt that he will be an asset to the next organization he joins.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended JamesGroupsAlgorithmic Traders Association: CTA & Quant Funds System Trading | Stocks, Futures, Forex, OptionsFinancial Services Career Center™Financial Advisor and Stock Broker GroupCompliancEXTraderDailyRecruitment for TradersStock Brokers NetworkSee 7 moreHedge Fund Group (HFG) Association: Alternative Investments, CTA Funds, & Fund of FundsTrading & Investing The Financial MarketsBROKERHUNTER.com™ - Financial Services Career and Networking GroupElectronic Trading JobsStockMarketFunding Pro TradersN.Y.S.E Traders employment networkSaint Peter's Preparatory School AlumniSee lessView James’ full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact James directlyView James’ Full ProfileNot the James you’re looking for?
