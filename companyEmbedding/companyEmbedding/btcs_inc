Services[edit]
According to company material, their services and products could possibly include:

A low-cost bitcoin transaction verification (bitcoin mining) services business.[7] In January 2015, BTCS announced finalizing a two-year lease for an 83,000 square foot facility.[8]
An e-commerce marketplace accepting bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, and other cryptocurrencies. In its beta version, the marketplace claimed to offer over 250,000 curated products, featuring a so-called "Intelligent Shopping Engine" to find competitive prices on products from over 250 retailers.[9]
A bitcoin wallet that uses 2-of-3 cryptographic multisignatures to securely store the user's bitcoin keys. The wallet is built on BitVault's Gem’s technology[10] and operates in cooperation with Authy,[11] a provider of two-factor authentication. A beta version was claimed to be available, by invitation only.

Investments[edit]
BTCS claims to have partnered with and invested in several digital currency companies, including GoCoin LLC,[12] Bitvault Inc.[13] and Spondoolies Tech Ltd.[14]

We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed

Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.

this company doesn't offer a competitive product or service, unless you consider their lame bitcoin shop a "service" (in reality it's only a storefront for spending bitcoins, and most items are "out of stock"). civic (cvc - ico coming soon) is doing what btcs *should* be doing. btcs management better get creative and get busy -- fast -- if they don't want to be a footnote.  thankfully, this is only a penny stock.

Company Overview




BTCS secures the blockchain through its rapidly growing transaction verification services business and plans to build a broader ecosystem to capitalize on opportunities in this fast growing industry. The blockchain is a decentralized public ledger and has the ability to fundamentally impact all industries on a global basis that rely on or utilize record keeping and require trust. BTCS continues to evaluate and build additional blockchain technology consumer solutions. BTCS also actively partners and integrates with strategic digital currency and blockchain technology companies who provide products or services that are complementary to its business strategy.




Value Proposition




Given BTCS’s strong long-term potential, transaction verification services revenue, focus on blockchain technology, and universal ecosystem business model, we are valuing BTCS at a target price of $0.62, representing current upside of 343%. Venture capital investments in bitcoin totaled approximately $490 million in 2015, which is greater than the value of early venture capital investment in the Internet ($250 million in 1995). The transaction verification services business has the potential to be very scalable, and we are projecting total revenue of $20.4 million in 2016. Long-term, transaction verification services companies can gain revenue through transaction verification fees from consumer usage. Additionally, transaction verification services help to secure the blockchain. This gives long-term profit potential as applications and transactions take place on the blockchain. Early investments in digital currency companies could lead to significant returns if digital currency adoption and blockchain technology development continues to accelerate.




Investment Highlights





Revenue currently generated through transaction verification services business, or digital currency mining; merging with Spondoolies-Tech ($28M in 2014 rev)

BTCS shareholders will own a 55.4%-54.4% stake in the combined Company
 Declining bitcoin prices and increased cost of transaction verification services driving companies out of the transaction verification business; leads to opportunity for BTCS
 Spondoolies is the premier developer of Bitcoin transaction verification servers; cutting edge technology should maximize the value of BTCS’s transaction verification business



Transaction verification services business is at approximately 1800 TH/s, and is expected to generate over 600 bitcoins in 1Q16
BTCS is attempting to create a universal digital currency platform with one point of access; majority of digital currency competitors focus on one product inside the ecosystem

BTCS has developed a series of strategic partnerships and investments to develop this ecosystem:
Wallet: Syndicate investor in Gem, which is developing a secure, cloud wallet storage technology
ATM: Lead investor in the seed round in Coin Outlet, a digital currency ATM manufacturer
Financial services: Lead investor in the bridge round in Expresscoin, a digital currency exchange with multiple payment options
Payment processor: Lead investor in the Series A financing for GoCoin, a leading international digital currency payment platform
