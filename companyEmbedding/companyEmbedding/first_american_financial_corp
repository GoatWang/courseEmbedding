Orange County Title Company (1889–1960)[edit]
First American traces its roots to 1889, when Orange County, California—a rural, undeveloped area at the time—split off from the county of Los Angeles. Two firms opened to handle title matters in the brand-new county. Five years later, Charles Edward Parker (C.E. Parker), a local businessman, succeeded in merging the two competitors into a single entity—Orange County Title Company. C.E. Parker became the president of Orange County Title, which, starting in 1909, would pay a cash dividend every year for the rest of the century and would become one of the first abstract companies in California to qualify to issue title insurance policies.[3]
Donald Parker Kennedy (D.P. Kennedy), grandson of C.E. Parker, joined Orange County Title in 1948. D.P. Kennedy developed a plan to expand the company beyond Orange County, which was approved by the board of directors in 1957.

Orange County Title Company (1889–1960)[edit]
First American traces its roots to 1889, when Orange County, California—a rural, undeveloped area at the time—split off from the county of Los Angeles. Two firms opened to handle title matters in the brand-new county. Five years later, Charles Edward Parker (C.E. Parker), a local businessman, succeeded in merging the two competitors into a single entity—Orange County Title Company. C.E. Parker became the president of Orange County Title, which, starting in 1909, would pay a cash dividend every year for the rest of the century and would become one of the first abstract companies in California to qualify to issue title insurance policies.[3]
Donald Parker Kennedy (D.P. Kennedy), grandson of C.E. Parker, joined Orange County Title in 1948. D.P. Kennedy developed a plan to expand the company beyond Orange County, which was approved by the board of directors in 1957.

Orange County Title Company (1889–1960)[edit]
First American traces its roots to 1889, when Orange County, California—a rural, undeveloped area at the time—split off from the county of Los Angeles. Two firms opened to handle title matters in the brand-new county. Five years later, Charles Edward Parker (C.E. Parker), a local businessman, succeeded in merging the two competitors into a single entity—Orange County Title Company. C.E. Parker became the president of Orange County Title, which, starting in 1909, would pay a cash dividend every year for the rest of the century and would become one of the first abstract companies in California to qualify to issue title insurance policies.[3]
Donald Parker Kennedy (D.P. Kennedy), grandson of C.E. Parker, joined Orange County Title in 1948. D.P. Kennedy developed a plan to expand the company beyond Orange County, which was approved by the board of directors in 1957.
First American Title Insurance and Trust Company(1960–1968)[edit]




Entrance to First American Corporation headquarters complex in Santa Ana


Orange County Title was renamed First American Title Insurance in 1960 to reflect operations beyond Orange County,
D.P. Kennedy was named president of First American Title in 1963, replacing his uncle, George Parker. First American Title had its initial public offering on the over-the-counter market in 1964 and, four years later, was restructured with the formation of The First American Financial Corporation as a holding company. First American Title became a subsidiary company and a trust business was conducted through First American Trust Company.
The First American Financial Corporation(1968–2000)[edit]
First American expanded its title operations across the nation by opening new offices and acquiring existing title and abstract companies. This growth lead to an expansion of the company's Santa Ana headquarters in 1976. By 1982, First American served all regions of the United States. First American began to operate internationally with the opening of title insurance offices in Canada in 1988. First American continued to develop international operations and was the first title insurance provider in Mexico, Korea and Hong Kong, and had the leading market share in Australia and England.
The First American Corporation (2000–2010)[edit]
The First American Financial Corporation was renamed The First American Corporation in May 2000 to reflect the expansion of services beyond financial services and title insurance. As First American grew to become one of the nation's largest title insurance, specialty insurance and trust services providers, its data storehouse, analytics capabilities and business services capacity grew in tandem. By 2008, First American had grown to become the nation's preeminent real estate information business.[citation needed]
The First American Family of Companies grew to operate within five business segments, including: Title Insurance and Services, Specialty Insurance, Mortgage Information, Property Information, and Risk Mitigation and Business Solutions. First American had approximately 2,100 offices throughout the United States and abroad.
First American Financial Corporation (2010–present)[edit]
In June 2010, The First American Corporation split to create two highly focused companies serving the distinct needs of customers across diverse industries. The title insurance and settlement services of The First American Corporation became First American Financial Corporation while the property information and analytics businesses became CoreLogic Inc.
Today, the company continues to be commonly referred to as First American and serves homebuyers and sellers, real estate professionals, loan originators and servicers, commercial property professionals, homebuilders, and others involved in residential and commercial property transactions with products and services specific to their businesses. Those services include title insurance and closing/settlement services; property data, and title plant records and images; home warranties; property and casualty insurance; and banking, trust, and advisory services.
Products and services[edit]

First American provides title insurance and closing/settlement services; title plant management services; title and other real property records and images; valuation products and services; home warranty products; home insurance; and banking, trust and investment advisory services.
Spin-off[edit]
June 1, 2010 marked the separation of the First American Corporation's financial services operations and its information solutions businesses into two independent public companies.[4] The spin-off was intended to allow First American to focus solely on its core businesses.
As part of a spin-off transaction, First American Financial Corporation common stock was distributed to shareholders of The First American Corporation on June 1, 2010. The shares of both companies traded on a “when-issued” basis from May 24, 2010 through June 1, 2010, and began full-fledged trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 2, 2010; First American Financial Corporation under the ticker symbol FAF.
On June 1, 2010, each shareholder received one share of First American Financial Corporation common stock for every share of The First American Corporation common stock held as of the close of business on the record date of May 26, 2010. Shareholders also received a cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares.
Selected subsidiaries and divisions[edit]

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to:
            
1. Avoid involvement, by the business or its principles, in activities that reflect unfavorably on, or otherwise adversely affect the public image of BBB or its accredited businesses.












BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Finding a Solid Email Backbone in the Cloud
Overview
Real estate services giant First American Corp., founded in 1889, split into two independent companies in May 2010, a move that had been planned for two years. The company’s original title insurance and escrow business was renamed First American Financial Corp., and its Information Solutions Group was spun off and renamed CoreLogic Inc. First American Financial Corp. serves the residential and commercial real estate industries and offers its products and services in more than 60 countries, both directly and through its agents and partners. 
Cisco Advantage
●   Cloud Email Security, which features a multi-layered scanning architecture, delivers the industry’s highest spam catch rate: more than 99 percent.
●   Reputation Filters automatically identify suspicious email senders.
●   Fewer than one in 1 million false-positive rate keeps messages out of quarantine.
●   All-inclusive service, with computing resources, software and support bundled together, provides simplicity.
 

In early 2010, First American Corp. was preparing to split into two separate companies: title and escrow business First American Financial Corp., and financial business data provider, CoreLogic Inc.  As part of this dramatic change process for the 120-year-old company, First American Corp. would lose its existing email backbone that thousands of employees and thousands of its locations relied upon. So, it turned to the cloud to create a strong email backbone for the new First American Financial Corp.
First American Corp.’s engineers evaluated a number of offerings, including cloud-based solutions from MessageLabs and WebSense, before recommending to management that they select Cisco® IronPort Cloud Email Security. The company already had been relying on Cisco IronPort email security appliances for about four years, after switching from email security vendor Tumbleweed (now Axway).
 
Technical Challenges
The goal was to make the transition to the cloud email security with Cisco transparent to users. Cisco had to maintain the same level of spam capture rate, if not better, while also providing advanced routing and policies for both First American and CoreLogic. As the companies went through the process of splitting into two separate organizations, all email bound for CoreLogic would have to be processed by the First American filtering solution. This period of coexistence required that many complex and detailed filtering and routing processes be put in place to maintain similar but separate scanning policies. The new solution would have to leverage Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) routing in order to deliver mail to the correct company once it had been processed in the cloud. The unique capabilites of the Cisco IronPort Hybrid solution offered email scanning in the cloud with advanced Active Directory (AD) integration and routing required with the use of the on-premises devices.  
Once it became an independent company, First American Financial Corp. would continue to have a very complex routing scenario to address. All email traffic intended for the new CoreLogic organization needed to be routed—intact—and the Information Solutions Group’s legacy email hosted and held securely. The IT team at First American Financial Corp. would need an email security solution with flexible routing for under 100,000 objects and content filtering that offered encryption. In addition, the solution needed to be integrated with First American’s existing MS exchange email servers.
The main problem for the coexistence phase was handling mail that was destined for two separate companies but addressed using a single email domain of @firstam.com. First American users would have their spam quarantined in the cloud while CoreLogic users required their email to be delivered to their environment. The solution was to tag spam in the cloud for all recipients and deliver to the on-premises devices that would use AD groups to assign custom policies for First American and Corelogic users. These custom mail policies would then quarantine only the First American spam and deliver the tagged spam to CoreLogic as the company required. Finally, LDAP/AD routing was used to deliver mail to the many different email systems once the mail was inside the First American infrastructure.
Cisco Advantage
First American Financial Corp. implemented the Cisco IronPort Cloud Email Security as its new email backbone just a few months prior to its transformation into an independent company in 2010. It has encountered no difficulty in routing, hosting and holding CoreLogic’s email traffic, and is ensuring security for that email through subject-based encryption. The company’s IT team also created a connector between the Cisco IronPort email gateway and CoreLogic’s gateway to enable communication between the two backbones. This also provided a means for reporting on the volume of email bound for Corelogic that was still being processed by First American. In addition, the Cisco IronPort solution is helping the company to deflect a significant amount of spam. First American Financial Corp. estimates that roughly 92 percent of its incoming email is spam. Cisco IronPort’s Reputation Filters, which use data from the Cisco SensorBase Network to perform real-time email traffic threat assessments and identify suspicious email senders, are blocking more than 139 million spam emails per day.
