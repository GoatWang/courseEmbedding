Synopsis

RoboCop returns to fight his toughest opponent yet: his replacement!
RoboCop 2 pits two unstoppable cyborgs against each other in a battle to the death! When Detroit's descent into chaos is further compounded by a police department strike and a new designer drug called "Nuke," only RoboCop can stop the mayhem. But in his way are an evil corporation that profits from Motor City crime and a bigger and tougher cyborg with a deadly directive: Take out RoboCop. Containing the latest gadgetry and weaponry as well as the mind of the madman who designed "Nuke," this new cyborg isn't just more sophisticated than his predecessor... he's psychotic and out of control! And it's going to take everything RoboCop has – maybe even his life – to save Detroit from complete and utter anarchy.

Noah's Ark - Far From the Truth
The Good ... the special effects and the parts of the movie that stuck to the biblical account of the story were interesting ... however - the bad - there was soooooo much that was added THAT WAS NOT IN THE ORIGINAL BIBLICAL ACCOUNT that I found the movie was a big disappointment and it actually made it boring - there was no need to add all the extra story lines - it was silly and actually detracted from the main topic.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone ...

Overview



Though long (because it began life as a television miniseries), Noah's Ark on DVD comes with very little: an English audio track (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), a standard full-screen picture with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, dual layering, closed-captions, and a theatrical trailer. Some of these rather standard features are listed as special ones on the plastic DVD case, which also contains a chapter index, a few production notes, and plenty of advertising. Sound and picture quality are uninspiringly adequate.
