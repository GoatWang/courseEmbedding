Restart: David Duffield 2.0 / PeopleSoft founder is back in business

1 / 2


Back to Gallery
















It's a David Duffield-versus-Goliath rematch. 
Duffield rose to prominence building PeopleSoft Inc. into a software powerhouse -- celebrated for its rare combination of competitive edge and congenial culture -- but lost control of his company to nemesis Larry Ellison, chief executive officer of Oracle Corp., in 2004 after an 18-month hostile-takeover battle. 
Now, at 66, Duffield is back in business. This time he's making a bold attempt to challenge industry giants Oracle and SAP AG with on-demand software that allows customers to manage business tasks via the Internet instead of installing costly programs on company computers. In an interesting twist, that means taking on the old PeopleSoft products that Oracle still sells and supports.

Workday, his 2-year-old venture in Walnut Creek, faces significant challenges in a brutally competitive and crowded marketplace dominated by industry leaders and up-and-coming startups. But no one is discounting the possibility that this billionaire software legend might pull it off. He is one of the most beloved bosses in Bay Area history, so he's had no problem assembling top talent. He has plenty of his own money to power Workday. And, with his fifth startup, he has the track record to schmooze even the most risk-averse corporations. 
"There aren't that many people who would dream about building a set of applications to ultimately compete with SAP and Oracle," said Bruce Richardson, chief research officer at AMR Research. "But part of the attraction for customers is that it is a new way of doing things, and it's Dave. 
"It's like your favorite band or baseball team got all its best players back for a chance to do it all again. Most teams never get that chance. Dave is providing people with the dream of doing it a second time. The question is: Will they do it?" 
Analysts say Duffield's timing couldn't be better. He is entering the software business just as corporations, frustrated by years of wrangling with complex and expensive products, have begun searching for a simpler way to automate their businesses. Young trailblazers like Salesforce.com, NetSuite and RightNow Technologies are encouraging companies to migrate to online software. The approach has been gaining in popularity for the past eight years, since former Oracle executive Marc Benioff launched Salesforce.com, a subscription service that allows companies to manage sales leads on the Web. 
Gambling on Workday 
But analysts say Workday is still a high-stakes gambit. Chief among the challenges Workday faces: Larger companies may not want software they can't customize in any way they please. These companies may also be reluctant to entrust their most sensitive data to anyone no matter the security precautions. 
Neither SAP nor Oracle would comment on Workday. But at a news conference in Palo Alto earlier this month, SAP Chief Executive Officer Henning Kagermann said that while his company is developing online software, it won't be "the ultimate answer" for everyone. 
Duffield is betting Kagermann is wrong. Duffield's first 12 customers are small and mid-size companies, but his long-range ambition is to attract larger companies that typically invest tens of millions in software from Oracle and SAP. He hopes to do that by offering a product that is easier and less expensive to use, much faster to launch, and offers more features. Workday's products have the look and feel of an Internet site. And helping to shape them are its early customers -- like Tom McElroy, director of human resources services for Covad Communications, a 900-employee broadband company in San Jose. 
To make his pitch directly to the McElroys of the business world, Duffield took Workday executives and customers on a one-week road show, hitting five cities, with the final stop in San Francisco. "I wanted to make this personal and explain why we are doing this," Duffield told 75 prospective customers. That personal touch is vintage Duffield, who inspired as much loyalty in PeopleSoft customers as he did in PeopleSoft employees. To wit: Duffield has two titles on his business card: CEO and chief customer advocate. 
"Customers are your best salespeople," he said. "The higher the service levels you give a customer, particularly during the formative years, the more likely you will keep going and sell more business." 
That's the kind of message that resonates with McElroy, who joined Duffield at the road show in San Francisco. "Workday will revolutionize how Covad does business," McElroy said. "It's fun to be a part of the revolution." 
If it's a bona fide revolution, it's in its infancy. "Dave loves this industry and he is clearly driven," said Citi Investment Research analyst Brent Thill. "Ultimately he is going to make a really important mark on this industry as he did in the past. But it's early yet." 
Ironically, Duffield wouldn't be taking another turn at the Silicon Valley wheel of innovation if it were not for Oracle's Ellison. 
In 1987, Duffield, a former IBM executive, decided to mortgage his house to raise the money to start PeopleSoft. He was banking that there was a gold mine in the coming shift from mainframe computers to networked computers and in the growing demand for products to automate the back-office functions at corporations, from human resources to accounting. 
He was right. In 1989, just as the trend began sweeping corporate America, PeopleSoft delivered its first product and a company culture that would bind staffers and customers to PeopleSoft's mission. 
In 1999, as PeopleSoft stumbled in rough economic times, Duffield tapped a veteran technology executive, Craig Conway, to take over. Aneel Bhusri, once Duffield's heir apparent, remained on the board but left PeopleSoft to pursue a career in venture capital. 
Exit PeopleSoft 
Then Oracle initiated a surprise hostile takeover. In November 2004, the PeopleSoft board lost confidence in Conway and fired him. Duffield emerged from retirement to rejoin forces with Bhusri in a doomed effort to rescue PeopleSoft. By that time, PeopleSoft had $3 billion in annual revenue and 13,000 employees. A phone call from Bhusri on Dec. 10, 2004, broke the bad news: After an 18-month standoff, PeopleSoft's board had voted to accept a $10.3 billion buyout, a moment Duffield recalls as the single most painful of his life. 
The hard-fought battle suddenly over, Duffield pledged $10 million to help PeopleSoft employees laid off in the takeover and retreated to his Tahoe home, where he again turned his attention to supporting worthy causes and caring for his six adopted children. But he soon discovered he did not want to settle back into the placid landscape just yet. 
"Going back to PeopleSoft those few months after a five-year hiatus got the business juices flowing again," Duffield said. 
He and Bhusri, a partner with venture firm Greylock Partners, began discussing the potential of online software to transform the business-software market. In late January 2005, they met for breakfast at the Truckee Diner and resolved to form a startup. 
"We had all the ingredients for a potential success," Duffield said. "The market was springing up. We had the technology. We had the cream-of-the-crop talent. We had a good reputation right out of the gate. We felt we would be foolish not to try." 
Greylock Partners leaped at the chance to invest in Duffield's second act, as did Workday and former PeopleSoft board member Skip Battle. Together they have pumped $35 million into Workday. Workday also recruited a key adviser: Silicon Valley wunderkind Marc Andreessen, the Netscape co-founder who sparked the Internet revolution with the first Web browser. 
A re-energized Duffield dove into the startup with the boundless energy of his late schnauzer Maddie, who inspired him to endow a foundation to end euthanasia of stray dogs and cats. 
"Dave and Aneel did not come back for nostalgia's sake," Battle said. "This isn't like attending a Chubby Checker concert that isn't very good but makes you marvel that the guy can do it at all. This is the real deal." 
'Dave's Next Move' 
Workday attracted attention nearly from the get-go as rumors flew after the PeopleSoft buyout that Duffield might strike again. 
Duffield and Bhusri got an important head start by purchasing PeopleSoft alumni John Malatesta and Jim Hopp's company, Net-YourWork, which focused on easy-to-use Web software for midsize companies. 
Petros Dermetzis, Workday's vice president of development and its fifth employee, created a Web site, Dave's Next Move, to recruit developers and soon was flooded with resumes. Venture capitalists and journalists began knocking on the door of the startup that didn't yet have a name, let alone a sign. 
107 and counting 
Now, Workday has 107 employees spread out over a single floor in a downtown high-rise, 50 of whom were hired during the past four months. They have all come to work for Duffield who, in a business dominated by bombastic personalities, has distinguished himself with his unpretentious manner and disarming sense of humor. 
Both were on full display on a warm evening in May when Duffield presided over a spirited quarterly meeting with his longtime friend and business partner Bhusri. Together, the Workday co-founders fired up the crowd. 
In typical fashion, their presentation spent as much time skewering German software giant SAP as it did celebrating the achievements of Workday's first 100 employees. 
A highlight was a photograph of 18-month-old Leni, "Workbaby" No. 1, sitting on Duffield's lap. Leni is growing up with Workday. She attended the first-ever companywide meeting in October 2005, when she was just seven days old. Her parents, Workday employees Ralf and Laura Schroeder, are for the second time investing their careers in Duffield, the fatherly figure affectionately known by his initials D.A.D. The Schroeders met at PeopleSoft, where their first daughter, Clara -- "PeopleBaby" No. 2,467 -- was born 3 1/2 years ago. 
In blue jeans and a denim shirt, Duffield energetically handed out plaques listing the names of all 100 of Workday's first employees. He showed off his trademark humor as he recognized employees with "outstanding contributor" awards. Receptionist Betty Landes took home a thick glossy catalog of all the cool perks Duffield gets with his platinum frequent-flier status. 
Duffield saved his zingers for employee No. 100: Jeff Pulver, a PeopleSoft alum who among other assignments served time in Siebel System's rough-and-tumble trenches before joining Workday as vice president of marketing and business development. No. 2 two among the top 5 reasons Workday hired Pulver: "The amazing opportunity to leverage his experience building the happy, fun corporate culture at Siebel." 
Then Pulver and Duffield's son Mike, vice president of sales, brought the house down with their creative spoofs of the popular Apple television commercials that contrast a Mac hipster with a PC nerd. In their version, Mike Duffield plays an amiable, nimble Workday to Pulver's stodgy, bloated ERP (industry jargon for enterprise resource planning, the kind of business software on which PeopleSoft and its rivals SAP and Oracle built their fortunes). 
Employees roared their appreciation when Pulver, outfitted in a fat suit, keels over and hollers: "I've fallen and I can't get up." Duffield heartily joined in. 
"There will be naysayers who say I'm too old or I'm shooting for something that I will never be able to achieve," he said. "But the industry needs this."

Early life[edit]
Duffield received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and an MBA from Cornell University, and is the benefactor behind Duffield Hall,[2] a nanoscale science (or nanotechnology) and engineering facility at Cornell. While at Cornell, Duffield was a member of Beta Theta Pi.
Career[edit]
Duffield established two mainframe application software companies. He was CEO, chairman, and chief product architect at Integral Systems, the first company to offer DB2-based human resource and accounting systems. He also co-founded Information Associates, which specialized in applications for the higher education market. He began his career at IBM as a marketing representative and systems engineer.
Peoplesoft[edit]
Duffield founded PeopleSoft in 1987 and served as the company's CEO and board chairman. PeopleSoft grew to be the world's second-largest application software company before being acquired by Oracle in January 2005.[3]
Workday[edit]
In March 2005, Duffield and former PeopleSoft vice chair and head of product strategy, Aneel Bhusri, started Workday, Inc., a company that provides financial management and human capital management software delivered in a software as a service (SaaS) model. The company is headquartered in Pleasanton, California, and employed approximately 1,000 people in 2011,[4] with Duffield and Bhusri serving as co-CEOs at Workday. Duffield is also the company's chief customer advocate.[5]
Philanthropy and Maddie's Fund[edit]
Duffield is also known for his philanthropic activities on behalf of animals. In 1994, Duffield and his wife, Cheryl, established Maddie's Fund, originally named the Duffield Family Foundation.[6] In January 1999, the Board of Directors restructured the foundation, defined its mission, and adopted the current name.[6] The organization is named after Maddie, a Miniature Schnauzer who was the Duffields source of unconditional love and friendship for ten years, and a "lighthouse during the stormy period" of the couple's work careers.[6] Maddie died of cancer in 1997, and Duffield acted on his earlier promise to his pet, "If we ever make some money, I promise we will give it back to you and your kind so others can be as happy as we are today."[7]
The Duffields have endowed Maddie's Fund with more than $300 million, and have spent more than $153 million through fiscal year 2013-2014 to save the lives of dogs and cats.[7] The organization believes that the Duffields have given more of their personal wealth to the animal welfare cause than any other individuals.[7] "And although they don't want to make a big fuss over their unprecedented contribution, they do want to honor their cherished companion and the special bond they shared with her."[7]
In May 2016 the Duffields put their 21.48 acre estate in California on the market as they decided to move back to their home in Tahoe. The asking price for the property was $39 million, with the proceeds of the sale going towards Maddie's Fund.[8]

He also co-founded Information Associates, which specialized in applications for the higher education market. He began his career at IBM as a marketing representative and systems engineer.
Peoplesoft[edit]
Duffield founded PeopleSoft in 1987 and served as the company's CEO and board chairman. PeopleSoft grew to be the world's second-largest application software company before being acquired by Oracle in January 2005.[3]
Workday[edit]
In March 2005, Duffield and former PeopleSoft vice chair and head of product strategy, Aneel Bhusri, started Workday, Inc., a company that provides financial management and human capital management software delivered in a software as a service (SaaS) model. The company is headquartered in Pleasanton, California, and employed approximately 1,000 people in 2011,[4] with Duffield and Bhusri serving as co-CEOs at Workday. Duffield is also the company's chief customer advocate.[5]
Philanthropy and Maddie's Fund[edit]
Duffield is also known for his philanthropic activities on behalf of animals. In 1994, Duffield and his wife, Cheryl, established Maddie's Fund, originally named the Duffield Family Foundation.[6] In January 1999, the Board of Directors restructured the foundation, defined its mission, and adopted the current name.[6] The organization is named after Maddie, a Miniature Schnauzer who was the Duffields source of unconditional love and friendship for ten years, and a "lighthouse during the stormy period" of the couple's work careers.[6] Maddie died of cancer in 1997, and Duffield acted on his earlier promise to his pet, "If we ever make some money, I promise we will give it back to you and your kind so others can be as happy as we are today."[7]
The Duffields have endowed Maddie's Fund with more than $300 million, and have spent more than $153 million through fiscal year 2013-2014 to save the lives of dogs and cats.[7] The organization believes that the Duffields have given more of their personal wealth to the animal welfare cause than any other individuals.[7] "And although they don't want to make a big fuss over their unprecedented contribution, they do want to honor their cherished companion and the special bond they shared with her."[7]
In May 2016 the Duffields put their 21.48 acre estate in California on the market as they decided to move back to their home in Tahoe. The asking price for the property was $39 million, with the proceeds of the sale going towards Maddie's Fund.[8]
Awards[edit]
2013 EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award Recipient[9]
Personal life[edit]
David Duffield is married to Cheryl Duffield. Between 2005 and 2016 they lived in Alamo, California but now live near Lake Tahoe.[10]

Dave Duffield, Founder













Maddie's Fund
Dave Duffield, Founder




Dave Duffield is a recognized pioneer in enterprise software and human resources (HR) technology and the founder of several software companies including Workday and PeopleSoft.
Dave along with his wife, Cheryl are also the founders of Maddie's Fund®. As far back as he can remember, Dave was fond of dogs, but his love for them grew when a little Miniature Schnauzer named Maddie came into his life. Dave's early years with Maddie were a time of great stress as he struggled to break away from one company to start another. Always at his side offering unconditional love and devotion, Maddie helped get Dave and Cheryl through the down times. Dave has said, "Maddie was the lighthouse during the stormy period."
It was then that Dave and Cheryl made a promise: Should they ever be well off, their top priority would be to give back to Maddie and her kind. Maddie passed away in 1997, but Dave and Cheryl made good on their promise with the creation of Maddie's Fund. She continues to inspire them to revolutionize the status and well-being of companion animals.
Dave's career in the software industry spans more than 50 years. He is currently co-founder and chairman of Workday, Inc. Founded in 2005, Workday delivers human capital management, financial management, and analytics applications to the world's largest companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. 
Dave also founded the software giant PeopleSoft in 1987 and served as the company's CEO and board chairman. He was responsible for the company's vision, product and market direction, and commitment to customer service. In addition, he inspired the company's unique culture by promoting core values that focused on people, innovation, integrity, and fun. PeopleSoft grew to be the world's second-largest application software company before being acquired in January 2005.
Dave established two other mainframe application software companies earlier in his career-Integral Systems and Information Associates. He began his career at IBM as a marketing representative and systems engineer. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and an MBA from Cornell University.
In March 2015, Dave and Cheryl were named to Dog Fancy's list of "45 People Who Have Changed the Dog World." Their family currently includes 10 children, 7 grandchildren, 4 parrots, and 4 dogs.
