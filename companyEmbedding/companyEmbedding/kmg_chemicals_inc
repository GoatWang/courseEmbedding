Pearce leads Blue Jays in 4-3 win over Red Sox




				 18 Juillet, 2017,  12:07 | Author: Marie-Claire Cellier			















 


 
 
 
The Toronto Blue Jays look for a spark of consistency after splitting their last eight games.
The Boston Red Sox all of a sudden can't put runs on the board, and Happ has been pretty solid as of late, allowing three or less earned runs in each of his last six games."(Momentum) went right back to us", Pearce said.Happ stumbled his last time out when he allowed six runs (two earned) and seven hits in four innings of a 19-1 loss to the Houston Astros on July 9. Morales had a two-run double off starter Eduardo Rodriguez in the second inning.
Flipkart Sends Revised Offer To Buy Snapdeal?
					The board is, however, hopeful Flipkart would reconsider the offer", Business Standard had earlier quoted a source as saying. However, it was also being said that Snapdeal already has a plan B in place if the buyout doesn't pan out.

KMG Chemicals (KMG) Earning Somewhat Positive Media Coverage, Report Shows
					BidaskClub upgraded shares of KMG Chemicals from a "hold" rating to a "buy" rating in a research report on Tuesday, July 11th. The specialty chemicals company reported $0.53 EPS for the quarter, beating analysts' consensus estimates of $0.47 by $0.06.
					The 24-year-old southpaw is now in the midst of his third big league campaign overall, all of which have come as a member of the Red Sox."He's the one guy that this is his normal rest, this will be his regular fifth day (Tuesday)", manager John Farrell said of Johnson, who is 2-0 with a 4.29 ERA in four starts with the Red Sox this season. The Blue Jays are 5-2 in Happs last 7 starts vs. "Rather than being 10 to 14 days down from his previous start, which other guys would have been, it kind of lined up right in line with Brian's work".Another move will likely be needed for Tuesday, as scheduled starter Doug Fister pitched in Saturday's 16-inning affair and will not be able to start as scheduled. In three appearances over two major league stints - the first of his career - this season, he has not allowed a run or walked a batter in 3 2/3 innings, striking out two hitters and surrendering four hits. 1-for-10 (.100), Mookie Betts 3-for-17 (.176), Dustin Pedroia 6-for-29 (.207) and Hanley Ramirez 5-for-22 (.227) against Happ.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

	Energy Savings Overview of DRA Usage Pipeline Flow Dynamics and Role of DRA Pipeline operators use DRA to increase throughput, lower operating pressure and / or reduce energy costs Fluid molecules Turbulent Flow Orderly flow with DRAs Drag in pipelines is caused by turbulent liquid flow Increased turbulence can lead to energy loss and reduced throughput of a pipeline DRAs reduce drag throughout the turbulent fluid core The additives align turbulent fluid molecules to linearize the flow patterns DRA polymers have no effect on the composition of crude oil and refined products DRAs DRAs are injected at multiple segments along a pipeline; throughput improvement is immediate Flow Increase Pressure Reduction Value Enhancing Uses of DRA III.

	Compelling Value Proposition Flowchem DRA offers a compelling customer value proposition to pipeline operators, who are compensated for every barrel of crude oil or refined product that is moved through their pipeline assets (1) Based on 1,280 gallons of DRA (12 ppm per segment) daily on a 1,525 mile pipeline Compelling Economic Benefits to Using DRA Typical TURBOFLO® DRA Performance 36% Capacity Increase ($6.30/bbl) x (72K bbls/d) Incremental Daily DRA Cost (1) Results in over $50 million of customer net incremental revenue annually ~$450K ~$165K ~($25K) ~$590K (Recent Flowchem customer experience) Refined Products Light Crude Medium Crude Heavy Crude III. Flowchem Overview DRA are an instrumental part of maximizing throughput capacity, which drives pipeline margins and increases revenue to pipeline operators Without implementing a DRA solution, pipelines are limited to a maximum throughput capacity that can only be meaningfully increased by installing additional pipelines or pump stations, which are highly capital and time intensive Flowchem’s value proposition has been validated by customer data proving its ability to significantly increase pipeline throughput Pre-DRA Daily Revenue Incremental Daily Revenue Incremental Daily Cost Post-DRA Net Revenue
