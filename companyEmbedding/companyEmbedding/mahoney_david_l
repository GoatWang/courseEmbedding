In addition to his parents and wife, he is survived by four children, Marissa M., Kylie R., Haley E., and Nathan D., all of Ridgway; a sister, Susan E. Spare and her husband Carl of DuBois; and several nieces and nephews, including Joshua and Chelsey Sparce of DuBois. He was preceded in death by his maternal grandparents, Joseph and Mae Pavlock; and his paternal grandparents, William and Winifred Mahoney. A Memorial Service for David L. Mahoney will be held at the Awakening Alliance Church in Ridgway on Tuesday at 11 a.m. Officiating will be Ronald Burkett, pastor of the Hallton Church. Burial will be in Oakmont Cemetery.

ShareConditions Commonly Seen in PatientsThe following information is provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for the year 2014 and depicts the rates of sixteen chronic conditions found in Dr. Mahoney's Medicare patients. It should be noted that the prevalence of conditions listed below may not be characteristic of the provider's entire patient population, and in some cases information has been redacted from the original data source to protect patient information.Most Frequently SeenMoreMost Frequently SeenThroughout 2014, Dr. Mahoney saw the greatest relative rate of patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (75% of Medicare patients) compared to averages for all physicians in his state, likely indicating he is experienced in managing treatment and complications associated with this condition.Overview of Chronic Kidney Disease:seriousnessModerateprevalenceVery Commonmonetary costHigh

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) describes the gradual loss of kidney function over a long period of time. Any condition that damages the kidney can cause CKD, but diabetes and high blood pressure account for most cases. Because the loss of function is gradual, most people do not develop symptoms until there is irreversible kidney damage. CKD is diagnosed using tests that measure levels of waste products in blood and urine. Diagnosis includes using a staging system to determine how far the disease has progressed. Because kidney damage is irreversible, treatment aims to slow the progression of the disease by controlling underlying causes and making adjustments in diet and lifestyle. Once the kidneys have failed, dialysis, transplant and supportive care are the remaining treatment options. Anemia, bone disease and edema are common complications of CKD, but the effects of kidney damage cause problems in all organ systems. Measures that can help prevent CKD include preventing and treating known causes. If you have CKD, seek support to cope with the physical demands and emotional stress of a challenging disease.

Full Description


Chronic kidney disease (CKD) describes the gradual loss of kidney function over a long period of time. Any disease or condition that affects the kidney and causes kidney damage can cause CKD. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes, but birth defects, infections, obstructions and medications can also cause CKD. Because the loss of function is gradual, most people do not develop symptoms until there is irreversible kidney damage. Nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and appetite loss appear early on, but as the disease progresses more severe symptoms appear, including itching, swelling, easy bruising and decreased mental sharpness. The kidneys remove wastes and fluid from the blood, so CKD is diagnosed by measuring the levels of waste products in blood and urine. The level of creatinine, a waste product, in the blood is an important marker. High creatinine levels reflect poor kidney function. Diagnosis includes determining how far along the disease has progressed using a staging system (stages 1-5) based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The GFR is a calculated number that reflects kidney function. Because kidney damage is irreversible, treatment aims to slow the progression of the disease to prevent or delay complications. Controlling underlying causes and making adjustments in diet and lifestyle are important pieces of the treatment puzzle. Once the kidneys have failed, dialysis, transplant and supportive care are the remaining treatment options. Anemia, bone disease and edema are the most common complications of CKD, but additional complications reflect the effects of kidney damage on other organ systems, including the nervous system (dementia, neuropathy), heart and blood vessels (pericarditis, congestive heart failure), reproductive system (infertility and miscarriage) and immune system (reduced immunity).Measures that can help prevent CKD include controlling existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure and diabetes) and making lifestyle changes to prevent developing conditions that harm the kidney. You can be an active participant in preventing or delaying complications by working with a dietitian to make changes to reduce your intake of salt, phosphorus, potassium, protein and fluids. If you are living with CKD, seek support to help you face the challenging physical and emotional demands.

DENVER, June 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Lifeline Vascular Access®, a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. (NYSE:    DVA) and leading management company that serves providers of vascular care for patients with a variety of chronic conditions, announced the appointment of David L. Mahoney, MD, as its chief medical officer (CMO). As Lifeline's CMO, Dr. Mahoney will also serve as a member of the physician leadership team within the Office of the Chief Medical Officer at DaVita Kidney Care.










 







							 		Dr. David L. Mahoney, Chief Medical Officer of Lifeline Vascular Access
							  



 

 
 



"I am honored to join Lifeline as its CMO," said Dr. Mahoney. "I look forward to drawing on my previous experience as both a practicing nephrologist and an interventionalist as I assume this role in helping our physicians care for some of our country's most vulnerable patients." 
Dr. Mahoney has been practicing nephrology for 24 years, and, until recently, was a group medical director for DaVita Kidney Care. Previously he was an interventionalist – a physician who performs vascular access procedures – when he served as the medical director of a Lifeline-managed facility in Northern Virginia. 
"Dr. Mahoney's experience working across the vascular care continuum while managing multiple stakeholders made him a natural fit for this role," said Jonathan Lujan, general manager of Lifeline. "His inspired vision for the future of vascular care is what sets him apart, and our team is honored to welcome him to Lifeline."  
As CMO, Dr. Mahoney plans to be a liaison among interventionalists, physician practices, operations teams and patients. He is interested in further expanding Lifeline's vascular care services beyond dialysis access as the company continues to embrace care coordination in an evolving health care environment.
"I am delighted that Dr. Mahoney will be a member of our physician leadership team," said Allen R. Nissenson, MD, FACP, CMO of DaVita Kidney Care. "His creativity, background and experience will be a welcome addition as we move into integrated kidney care to better serve our patients."
Lifeline Vascular Access provides management services that streamline the delivery of patient care, bringing together all the pieces essential to the operation of an outpatient vascular center. With 70 locations across the country, Lifeline centers have had more than 1 million patient encounters with a procedure success rate of 98 percent.
