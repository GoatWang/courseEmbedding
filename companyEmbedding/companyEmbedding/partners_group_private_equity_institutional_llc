Switzerland’s Partners Group Changes Its Profile, not Its Approach

							Co-founder Alfred Gantner and new chairman Peter Wuffli aim to pursue global growth but vow to stick with Partners Group's diversified strategy. 
						


By Aaron Timms

Page 1 of 3


Its retractable roof and swooping, flying saucerlike
    shell design, Marlins Park is difficult to miss on the highway
    leading downtown from Miamis airport. The 37,000-seat
    stadium, home of the Miami Marlins baseball team, doesnt
    automatically suggest itself as a suitable venue for an elite
    private equity meeting. But when Partners
    Group, a Swiss private investment firm, decided to hold its
    annual investor conference in the U.S. for the first time, in
    March, it booked the gaudy stadium for the opening-night
    dinner. Founded in 1996 by three former Goldman Sachs Group
    bankers, Partners has expanded briskly over the past half
    decade, doubling its assets under management, to almost $44
    billion, and nearly tripling its staff, from 250 to 700. With
    the once-reclusive company looking to project itself onto the
    global stage and woo a larger category of institutional
    investors, the arena-style coming-out party represented a
    confident declaration of intent.
The firm is at its next juncture, says Alfred
    Gantner, one of the three co-founders. Partners new
    growth strategy goes hand in hand with an effort to
    institutionalize the leadership of the firm beyond its founders
    ­­ a rarity in the private equity industry, where
    most of the big shops are still stamped with the often-forceful
    personalities of their creators. The co-founders will continue
    to be active in investment decisions, but as Gantner puts it,
    they want the future of the firm to be less about them and more
    about Partners itself. The firm is more diverse,
    its more international, there are more stakeholders, so
    it makes sense for us to do the things that were doing
    now to take the firm to the next level, he says.
Partners is calling on some big names to boost its
    international profile  and face up to the challenges that
    greater size creates. Chairman Peter Wuffli, former CEO of UBS,
    is one of those names. Tapped to succeed Gantner, who continues
    to chair the firms global investment committee, the
    slight, bespectacled Wuffli took to the lectern at the dinner
    in March and introduced himself to roughly 200 investors seated
    at tables arranged around the stadium infield. Often
    coping with success is tougher than coping with failure,
    he said, explaining his determination to focus on risk
    management. When youre very successful, everybody
    applauds you, and you actually start to believe it. You get a
    creeping complacency, an arrogance. 
Wufflis words, echoing through the open roof into the
    salty Miami night air, carried a special resonance. The evening
    was not just a showcase for Partners; it marked Wufflis
    return to the spotlight after seven years in the comparative
    wilderness. Wuffli served for four years as chief executive of
    UBS before being pushed out in 2007 as the banks losses
    from its involvement in the U.S. subprime debacle, which
    eventually topped $37 billion, began to emerge. Hes kept
    a low profile in the years since then, overseeing the Elea
    Foundation for Ethics in Globalization, a Zurich-based
    philanthropic organization he founded with his wife, Susanna,
    and sitting on the boards of Lausanne-based business school IMD
    and the Zurich Opera House. He also penned a book on legal
    ethics, published in German under the title Liberale
    Ethik.
Partners rose out of the flowering of European private
    equity in the late 1990s, but it took a path distinct from the
    likes of Apax Partners and CVC Capital Partners. Most investors
    in German-speaking Central Europe, the firms first
    providers of capital, were unfamiliar with U.S.-style private
    equity, so the group chose a diversified strategy that relied
    largely on participating in other firms deals via primary
    investments through a fund of funds or buying existing private
    equity holdings on the secondary market. It also focused on
    small- to midcap deals that larger houses tended to pass over.
    This has given the firm its unique integrated approach, which
    allows Partners the flexibility to cycle in and out of
    different instruments  direct investments, primaries or
    secondaries  depending on where it sees the best
    long-term relative value. You always have the right
    instrument to hand, explains Urs Wietlisbach, one of the
    co-founders, who oversees client relations as chairman of the
    markets committee.
Lately, the group has been putting more emphasis on direct
    investments. They accounted for just over a third of the
    firms allocations last year, on a par with secondary
    investments, and the plan is to raise that share to 50 percent,
    according to Wietlisbach. Partners is looking to broaden its
    clientele beyond its traditional base of institutions in
    German-speaking Europe, the U.K. and Scandinavia. It has made
    some inroads recently: Asia and Latin America account for 13
    percent of the firms investors, by assets, up from just 1
    percent in 2006; over the same period North America has grown
    to 16 percent from 9 percent.
Successfully executing the firms growth strategy will
    require better contacts at a much higher level in the
    institutional investor world. To that end, Partners has
    recruited three high-profile individuals to its board. In
    addition to Wuffli, they are Charles Dallara, former head of
    the Institute of International Finance, who serves as chairman
    of the Americas, and Patrick Ward, a former managing director
    at Goldman Sachs who was one of that firms leading
    partners at the time of its 1999 IPO; he is chairman of the
    U.K. and the Middle East. These hires represent a serious
    statement of intent for a firm that has until now kept a fairly
    low international profile. Operating from its headquarters in
    the tiny Swiss canton of Zug, a low-tax haven thats home
    to numerous 
    hedge funds and commodities giant Glencore Xstrata, the
    firm had been run by a compact board of six people  all
    Swiss  on which its three co-founders exerted an outsize
    influence.
This firms had remarkable success, but its
    been built from the ground up, Dallara says. These
    guys have never had to build extremely senior relationships
    with the leaders of banks, insurance firms and 
    sovereign wealth funds. China, Japan and the Middle
    East are all areas where Partners has, in Dallaras view,
    significant catch-up work to do to ensure it is being heard at
    the top table of investors,
    especially by those in the sovereign wealth fund world.
Wuffli might appear an odd choice as the man to guide
    Partners to its next stage of development. He has no real
    private equity background to speak of; his main experience of
    day-to-day operations at UBS was as head of the asset
    management group. And in other respects he is a controversial
    figure. A 
    2005 Businessweek story described the former
    McKinsey & Co. consultant as the Master of
    Zurich, a figure of generational significance who had
    brought the glory days back to Swiss banking. In
    2008, after Wuffli had resigned from UBS, a scathing internal
    report blamed the banks big credit losses on a
    chronically inadequate system of risk management and laid a big
    part of that blame on the former CEO for allowing the situation
    to develop.
Partners co-founders see no risk in the elevation of
    Wuffli  who joined the firms board in 2009 and has
    steered its risk and audit committee since then  to the
    chairmanship. On the contrary, they see it as a crucial step in
    the evolution of Partners into a more mature outfit. It
    will make things better to have someone with Peters
    experience chairing board meetings, says Gantner, adding
    that Wufflis more inclusive, less headstrong style has
    already given board meetings a new level of
    discussion. Wuffli himself describes his role as helping
    the firm transition away from being a predominantly founder-led
    concern to an organization with a durable institutionalized
    culture. Im a values person, he says.
    The vision of this firm is to be responsible for the
    dreams of the 100 million beneficiaries for whom we
    invest.
Ward rose to become co-head of Goldmans 
    equities business and finished at the firm as chairman of
    Goldman Sachs Asset Management International. As boss of the
    IIF, Dallara made his name as a skilled negotiator in several
    of the financial-political crises of the past two decades,
    including the post-2010 restructuring of Greek debt. Their
    private equity experience is as thin as Wufflis. But
    Gantner, who served as chief executive until the firms
    IPO on the Zurich exchange in 2006, stresses that the newcomers
    do not sit on Partners investment committee or take a
    hand in the big asset allocation calls. Those matters remain
    firmly in the hands of Gantner, Wietlisbach and the third
    co-founder, Marcel Erni, who serves as Partners chief
    investment officer. André Frei and Christoph Rubeli, who
    were appointed cochief executives in 2013, take care of
    day-to-day management.
We felt that we were growing up as a firm, and it made
    sense to get some wise heads in so that we could better start
    to understand the direction were going in and how we can
    make sure we flourish as we grow and become more diverse,
    Gantner says. A firm succeeds if it grows beyond its
    founders. Thats not to say the move to open the
    board up to these high-wattage external personalities is
    without risk. Whether a firm like Partners can maintain the
    flexibility of thinking that has been its animating spirit to
    date even as it becomes more institutionalized remains to be
    seen. Theres a trade-off, concedes Gantner.
    The firm might get a little slower, absolutely. But we
    think its a risk worth taking.

Partners Group is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland.
PRESS RELEASE
Partners Group, the global private markets investment manager, has closed its 2011 vintage Global Value program with EUR 680 million in commitments, showing the continued appeal to investors of an integrated, global approach to private equity investing.
The program is the third and largest in Partners Group’s Global Value series, following 2006 and 2008 vintage programs, which closed on over EUR 400 million and over EUR 530 million respectively. The Global Value programs invest in direct, secondary and primary private equity investments as well as select mezzanine investments worldwide, allowing Partners Group the flexibility to build an “all-weather” portfolio by targeting the most attractive segments of the asset class in different markets and market conditions.
At the time of its final close, Partners Group Global Value 2011 was already more than 50% committed to a range of private equity investments, diversified across geographic regions, industries and transaction types. Completed investments include Global Blue, a leading global provider of travel-related financial services including tax-free shopping refund services, and SBF Group, the largest sporting goods retailer in Brazil. 





Dr. Stephan Schäli, Partner and Head of Private Equity at Partners Group, comments, “Both Global Blue and SBF Group stand to benefit from a growing middle class consumer group in emerging markets, an investment theme we believe will remain resilient to the volatility still seen in global markets. The Global Value 2011 program has also already benefitted from distributions from several mature assets in its secondary portfolio, as well as the early repayment of a mezzanine investment in a healthcare provider. With the market showing some pricing pressure for secondary investments, we continue to focus on assets at their inflection point where value can still be created and also on providing structuring solutions in complex transactions for the benefit of both sellers and buyers.”
Investors in Partners Group Global Value 2011 include a mix of new and prior investors from corporate and public pension plans, insurance companies and financial institutions from around the world. With its integrated investment approach, the program will draw on the expertise of Partners Group’s global team while benefiting from the extensive deal flow generated through the firm’s private equity platform.
About Partners Group

Partners Group has agreed to buy UK-based Key Retirement Group, a provider of advice and financial products for people near or in retirement. No financial terms were disclosed.
PRESS RELEASE
Partners Group, the global private markets investment manager, has agreed to acquire UK-based Key Retirement Group (“KRG” or “the Company”) on behalf of its clients. The Company is being acquired from Phoenix Equity Partners, a leading UK middle-market private equity firm, in a transaction that values the Company at over GBP 200 million.
Founded in 1998 and headquartered in Preston, KRG is a leading UK provider of independent specialist advice and financial products for individuals approaching or in retirement. The Company specializes in the origination and distribution of lifetime mortgages (LTMs), on behalf of third-party funders, which enable customers to release equity from their homes to fund their retirement. In 2016, KRG advised around 9,000 customers, providing around GBP 530 million in LTMs.
Following the acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, Partners Group will work with KRG’s management team, led by CEO-designate Simon Thompson, on value creation initiatives aimed at expanding the Company’s distribution capacity, driving forward product innovation and broadening its product portfolio.
Simon Thompson, CEO-designate of KRG, comments: “We are very pleased to welcome Partners Group as our new owner and look forward to further building on the significant growth we have enjoyed over the last few years. There is a real need for specialist financial services for those in or approaching retirement, which creates a compelling market opportunity for KRG. We believe the Partners Group team has the right experience and network to support the successful build-out of our platform and explore new segments of the market.” 





Andrew Deakin, Managing Director, Private Equity Europe, Partners Group, adds: “This is a great opportunity to support an established market leader within a high-growth market niche. KRG is the leading specialist adviser to the pre-retirement and retirement segment in the UK and has demonstrated strong organic growth since its inception. The business has significant scope for further value creation and we look forward to working with Simon Thompson and his team to build out KRG’s service offering over the next several years.”
