Why Choose An AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance Plan?


By enrolling in an AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance Plan, you could join the millions** of AARP members who are already enrolled in these plans. Not to mention, 96% of plan members surveyed are satisfied with their plan.†  Like all standardized Medicare supplement insurance plans, AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance Plans feature a variety of coverage options that:
Let you choose or keep any doctor who accepts Medicare patients.
Help cover some of the medical expenses not paid by Medicare Parts A & B.
Require no referrals to see a specialist who accepts Medicare patients.
Medicare supplement insurance companies in most states can only sell you a "standardized" Medicare supplement plan identified by a letter (e.g. Plan A).  Each standardized Medicare supplement plan must offer the same basic benefits, no matter which insurance company sells it.

Welcome to Leading Edge Health! 
						Who we are, what we do and what it is that defines us.
					
You know the brand. Now let your eyes do the walking – this is where you can buy all of your favorite Leading Edge Health products in one stop. They're all here, including:

Leading Edge Health is a collection of exclusive natural supplements that come with exceptionally high satisfaction rates, which typically hover above 95%. And they're all in one place – right here – giving you the chance to address just about any natural health topic you can imagine.




Our Credo
Who We Are
What We Do


Our Credo
We're not trying to change the world. We just want to give clients a selection of high-quality natural supplements to help folks live better.



 

That could be something to help men fight hair loss or address premature ejaculation. Maybe it's a natural alternative to HGH injections, a product to get rid of scars or something to help folks hit their target weight and look amazing when they hit the beach.

 

That's always been our focus, and it always will. Leading Edge Health makes natural health supplements that help folks live better with the customer care and satisfaction that you can't get with bigger companies!


Who We Are
Since 1999, Leading Edge Health has been an industry leader and provided high quality anti-aging, skin care and sexual health products that help clients be youthful and vibrant.

 

Leading Edge Health products do not require a prescription, and being natural, may side-step the risks of some pharmaceuticals. They're created by medical professionals and made by the same cGMP-certified manufacturer used by major retailers.

  


Leading Edge Health products come with approval from prominent physicians like Dr. Steven Lamm of The View and are guaranteed for a minimum 60 days.
 

 

They're used by hundreds of thousands of clients across the globe, who vouch for the life-enhancing results they enjoy with new testimonials by the day.


What We Do
Leading Edge Health makes supplements for men and women that change lives for the better – discreetly – whether that's for libido, hair loss, anti-aging or other.

 

We make products with only the freshest, high-quality ingredients. They're on the edge of recent breakthroughs too, like our Skinception products, and blend health with our modern understanding of the human body.

  

Leading Edge is a small company. We're proud to offer friendly, live customer service 7 days a week and find solutions for our clients to meet their wellness goals – and exceed them.

What We Do
A Force of Nature


We make HemoStyp, a bio-compatible sterile gauze that produces hemostasis in seconds when applied to
a cut or open wound. It is a patented hemostatic agent registered with the FDA to help control bleeding.
HemoStyp contains no harmful chemicals, additives, or animal by-products and can be easily removed with saline, or left in the wound to be absorbed, without compromising coagulation.
 HemoStyp is available in multiple configurations and sizes to help control most types of bleeding including: cuts, abrasions, and lacerations; nose bleeds; dental surgeries; post dialysis treatment; and punctures.
More about our products...
HemoStyp is an all-natural hemostatic product that is formulated  from oxidized regenerated cellulose. Cellulose molecules are found in the cellular structure of virtually all plant matter, which makes cellulose one of the most abundant organic compounds on earth. 
       HemoStyp is cellulose from cotton fiber. Cellulose from cotton  fiber is the purist form of cellulose  found in nature. Because of its purity and the fact that it degrades rapidly into biocompatible end products (glucose, water), it can be fully absorbed into the body and promotes wound healing.
Our oxidizing process makes HemoStyp a safe, effective, all-natural solution for rapid bleeding control.

HemoStyp® is a fast and effective hemostatic agent registered with the FDA to help control bleeding. 
      It is bio-compatble sterile gauze that promotes hemostasis in seconds when applied to an open wound. HemoStyp readily conforms to almost any type of wound and its all-natural formula contains no harmful chemicals, additives, or animal by-products.
Typical gauze products control  bleeding by becoming a scab. This takes time and usually requires direct pressure, gauze saturation, and drying. Once bleeding has stopped, the gauze must be removed to prevent  wound infection. When the gauze is removed, bleeding frequently begins again as the scab is disrupted.
HemoStyp quickly controls bleediing and is easy to remove when the bleeding has stopped. Simply add water and the gauze begins to dissolve into glucose and saline. When the gauze has transformed, usually within 60 seconds, just wipe the residue away from the bleeding site. The scab or clot is not compromised and the risk of re-bleeding is significantly reduced.
Testing and extensive field use have shown bleeding to be quickly and effectively controlled from cuts, abrasions, lacerations, puncture wounds, nose bleeds, dental surgeries, and other open wounds when HemoStyp is applied with just slight pressure.



A Force of Nature



HemoStyp is bioabsorbable hemostatic gauze  derived from cotton.  It is an all-natural product comprised of oxidized, esterified cellulose. Cellulose molecules can be found in
the cellular structure of virtually all plant matter, which makes cellulose one of the most abundant organic compounds on earth.
Because of its purity and the fact that it degrades rapidly into biocompatible end products (glucose, water), it does not adversely affect wound healing.
HemoStyp Hemostatic Gauze can quickly absorb water of exudates from the wound surface to form viscous gel. It is effective in immediate hemostasis, protecting the wound site and accelerating healing for trauma and post operational wounds.
HemoStyp is safe and easy to use. It is hypoallergenic and bacteriostatic and there are  no known side-effects associated with its use.

United Health Products Inc. Signs HemoStyp Product Distributors






Business Wire




Oct 18, 2013 8:41 AM EDT













 




























































  United Health Products, Inc. ( OTCQB: UEEC) announced that it has engaged two distributors, Nu Spectrum Solutions LLC and Critical Health Products Ltd,  to market and sell its proprietary and patented HemoStyp TM products. The exclusive agreements for specific markets include suggested initial stocking inventories and require yearly minimums.  Nu Spectrum Solutions LLC  Nu Spectrum Solutions has been granted the exclusive rights to sell to the US military and worldwide equestrian markets. Nu Spectrum Solutions LLC President, George Prussin, said “My extensive experience in the field tells me that the equestrian market for HemoStyp is an important and valuable one.” Prussin’s horse, Safely Kept, is in the Breeders’ Cup Hall of Fame. Prior to his involvement with the Breeders’ Cup, Prussin founded Shali Leasing and built it to a $1+ billion revenue company. For more information, please visit: http://nuspecmed.com/.  Critical Health Products Ltd  Critical Health Products was granted the exclusive right to all HemoStyp products (excluding equestrian) for sale and distribution in Australia, Oceania, and Southeast Asia. Ian French, President of Critical Health Products, said, “While the market for HemoStyp products is extremely broad, our initial focus will be centered on the first responder and medical communities.” Subsequently French will tap into his extensive experience and relationships with the Australian Armed Forces. For more information, please visit: http://www.criticalhealthcare.com.  Benefits of HemoStypTM   HemoStyp is an all-natural product comprised of regenerated oxidized cellulose gauze which is specifically formulated to aid in the process of hemostasis (clotting) when positioned on a cut or wound.   Unlike the other products in the wound care market, HemoStyp contains no potentially harmful chemicals or animal byproducts and is hypoallergenic.   Once it has completed its task, it is easily removed by dissolving it in water or saline solution. This method of removal neither disturbs the clotted surface nor encourages re-bleeding.    United Health Products continues to pursue multiple markets for HemoStyp including medical, dental and sports.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Our Credo
Who We Are
What We Do


Our Credo
We're not trying to change the world. We just want to give clients a selection of high-quality natural supplements to help folks live better.



 

That could be something to help men fight hair loss or address premature ejaculation. Maybe it's a natural alternative to HGH injections, a product to get rid of scars or something to help folks hit their target weight and look amazing when they hit the beach.

 

That's always been our focus, and it always will. Leading Edge Health makes natural health supplements that help folks live better with the customer care and satisfaction that you can't get with bigger companies!


Who We Are
Since 1999, Leading Edge Health has been an industry leader and provided high quality anti-aging, skin care and sexual health products that help clients be youthful and vibrant.

 

Leading Edge Health products do not require a prescription, and being natural, may side-step the risks of some pharmaceuticals. They're created by medical professionals and made by the same cGMP-certified manufacturer used by major retailers.

  


Leading Edge Health products come with approval from prominent physicians like Dr. Steven Lamm of The View and are guaranteed for a minimum 60 days.
 

 

They're used by hundreds of thousands of clients across the globe, who vouch for the life-enhancing results they enjoy with new testimonials by the day.


What We Do
Leading Edge Health makes supplements for men and women that change lives for the better – discreetly – whether that's for libido, hair loss, anti-aging or other.

 

We make products with only the freshest, high-quality ingredients. They're on the edge of recent breakthroughs too, like our Skinception products, and blend health with our modern understanding of the human body.

  

Leading Edge is a small company. We're proud to offer friendly, live customer service 7 days a week and find solutions for our clients to meet their wellness goals – and exceed them.

Who We Are
News

Our products are distributed under the brand name HemoStyp®, and other private label names, to the trauma, dental, dialysis, and veterinary markets.

What We Do
A Force of Nature


We make HemoStyp, a bio-compatible sterile gauze that produces hemostasis in seconds when applied to
a cut or open wound. It is a patented hemostatic agent registered with the FDA to help control bleeding.
HemoStyp contains no harmful chemicals, additives, or animal by-products and can be easily removed with saline, or left in the wound to be absorbed, without compromising coagulation.
 HemoStyp is available in multiple configurations and sizes to help control most types of bleeding including: cuts, abrasions, and lacerations; nose bleeds; dental surgeries; post dialysis treatment; and punctures.
More about our products...
HemoStyp is an all-natural hemostatic product that is formulated  from oxidized regenerated cellulose. Cellulose molecules are found in the cellular structure of virtually all plant matter, which makes cellulose one of the most abundant organic compounds on earth. 
       HemoStyp is cellulose from cotton fiber. Cellulose from cotton  fiber is the purist form of cellulose  found in nature. Because of its purity and the fact that it degrades rapidly into biocompatible end products (glucose, water), it can be fully absorbed into the body and promotes wound healing.
Our oxidizing process makes HemoStyp a safe, effective, all-natural solution for rapid bleeding control.

I was unable to preview before I bought the service however once I had paid I was unable to find anything remotely like the search engne had promised. I felt very let down particularly as I had spoken to eport link staff and tried to get a preview. I actually felt a bit duped. My enquiry was followed up and what happened to my request was very unusual, someone actually LISTENED and TOOK OWNERSHIP, I really did not expect this and had written off the fee as a bad experience. I then received a further emaila dn offer to assist. when the member of staff was unable to I was offered a refund. That is going ABOVE and BEYOND.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
