 Educational Background



LLB Degree 
Class of 1977 


York University - Osgoode Hall Law School

                  Osgoode Hall Law School is located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the oldest law school in Ontario, and is one of the professional faculties at York University. Osgoode Hall Law School is consistently ranked as one of the top law schools in Canada by Maclean's Magazine, ranking second among common-law schools in 2011 and 2012. Named after the first Chief Justice of Ontario, William Osgoode, the law school was established by The Law Society of Upper Canada in 1889.

The school was at the centre of the debates over the principles of modern legal education in the 1950s. Osgoode Hall Law School provided many of the founding members of the bar in the prairie provinces. Today, the law school offers a professional degree in law that is accepted for bar admission in every province in Canada with the exception of Quebec, as well as the American States of Massachusetts and New York. Osgoode has three joint degree programs, as well as Canada's largest graduate program in law. Osgoode Hall Law School has adopted the Juris Doctor degree designation which has replaced their previous Bachelor of Laws designation.

The law school is home to the Law Reform Commission of Ontario, the Osgoode Hall Law Journal, the German Law Journal, and the largest law library in the Commonwealth. Osgoode Hall Law School students may participate in a number of clinical and intensive programs, including the Community and Legal Aid Services Program (CLASP), the Poverty Law Intensive at Parkdale Community Legal Services, the Criminal Law Intensive, the Innocence Project, and the Osgoode Business Clinic.[5] According to the Official Guide to Canadian Law Schools, Osgoode Hall Law School has the most extensive range of clinical programs in Canada. The primary student government at Osgoode is the Legal and Literary Society.

Osgoode Hall Law School is particularly known for its leading role in the areas of constitutional law, the Charter and human rights, and international law. (Peter Hogg, Brian Slattery, Patrick J. Monahan, Jean-Gabriel Castel)

Some of the world's most important legal scholars teach at Osgoode, including Leslie Green who holds the University of Oxford's statutory Chair in Philosophy of Law. Former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and former judge at the Supreme Court of Canada, Louise Arbour taught at, and later became the associate dean of, Osgoode Hall Law School.                




B.A. Degree Economics with Honours

University of Calgary

                  The University of Calgary (or UCalgary) is a public research university located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Corporate Boards ▾




Independent Director

                    2012 - Current                  


Novagold Resources Inc.

                    NovaGold Resources Inc. (NYSE-AMEX, TSX: NG) capped a successful year of achieving key milestones at all of its projects by announcing a strategic plan to unlock the value of its world-class suite of mining development and exploration assets.

The Company is focused on permitting and developing its 50%-owned flagship property, Donlin Gold, one of the world's largest known undeveloped gold deposits. NovaGold is also committed to maximizing value of its non-core assets and is currently exploring opportunities to sell its interest in the Galore Creek copper-gold-silver project in British Columbia, Canada. Its interest in NovaCopper Inc., which held its interest in the Ambler District, also known as the Upper Kobuk Mineral Project, was spun out to shareholders of NovaGold on April 30, 2012.

As envisioned, NovaGold is now a well-financed, jurisdictionally secure Company well on its way of becoming a pure gold play exclusively focused on the advancement of Donlin Gold.

Donlin Gold, which is equally and jointly held with Barrick Gold Corporation — the world's largest gold company — is a uniquely attractive asset. In terms of the combined size, grade, exploration potential, production profile and jurisdiction, it is quite possibly the most important gold development project in the world today. Donlin Gold has approximately 39 million ounces of gold mineral resources, inclusive of mineral reserves (541 million tonnes at 2.24 g/t), not including an additional approximately six million ounces of inferred mineral resources (92 million tonnes at 2.0 g/t) with tremendous growth opportunities.¹

These numbers already place Donlin Gold well within the top 1% of known global gold deposits in terms of size. Yet, more potential exists. With the current mineral estimates from along just two miles of a well-established mineralized corridor that is five miles long, the site will undoubtedly yield further discoveries. Once in production, Donlin Gold should be the largest gold mine among seven major producing mines in Alaska.

NovaGold is well-financed with a cash balance of approximately US$350 million, which is sufficient to take Donlin Gold through permitting. Management has expertise in permitting, mine development, and operations and a track record for delivering projects on time and on budget.

Committed to responsible development and operating to the highest environmental standards, we act with a long-term view, creating mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, employees, investors, partners and other people critical to our success and the economic development of Alaska

Greg Lang and Sharon Dowdall Join the Board of Directors of NovaGold 
 


Published: April 18, 2012


April 18, 2012 - Vancouver, British Columbia - NovaGold Resources Inc. (TSX, NYSE-AMEX: NG) ("NovaGold” or "the Company”) is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Gregory A. Lang and Ms. Sharon Dowdall to NovaGold's Board of Directors, effective immediately.

	Mr. Lang is NovaGold's President and Chief Executive Officer. He has over 30 years of diverse experience in mine operations, project development, and evaluations. Prior to joining NovaGold earlier in 2012, he served as President of Barrick Gold of North America, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation ("Barrick Gold”), the largest gold producer in the world. In that capacity, Mr. Lang had executive responsibility for Barrick Gold's nine operations in the United States, Canada and the Dominican Republic, including the Donlin Gold project, equally owned by wholly-owned subsidiaries of NovaGold and Barrick Gold. Prior to Barrick Gold, Mr. Lang served in senior executive positions with Homestake Mining Company and International Corona Corporation, both now part of Barrick Gold. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Mining Engineering from the University of Missouri-Rolla and is a Graduate of the Stanford University Executive Program.

	In her 30-year career in the mining industry, Ms. Dowdall served in senior legal capacities for Franco-Nevada Corporation ("Franco-Nevada”), a major gold-focused royalty company; and Newmont Mining Corporation, one of the world's largest gold producers. During her 20-year tenure as Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary with Franco-Nevada, Ms. Dowdall was one of the principals who transformed an industry pioneer into one of the most successful precious metals enterprises in the world. Prior to joining Franco-Nevada, she practiced law with a major Canadian legal firm specializing in natural resources. Ms. Dowdall is the recipient of the 2011 Canadian General Counsel Award for Business Achievement. She currently serves on several Boards of Canadian exploration and development companies. Ms. Dowdall holds a B.A. (Hons.) from the University of Calgary and an LL.B, from Osgoode Hall at York University.

	"On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to welcome both Sharon and Greg to the Board of NovaGold,” said Thomas Kaplan, Chairman of the Board. "Greg is already leading NovaGold toward successful development of its flagship 50%-owned Donlin Gold project in Alaska. His exceptional track record of building some of the largest gold mines in the world, on budget and on time, is particularly important for the Company as it advances Donlin Gold up the value chain. Sharon's extensive experience in building significant shareholder value at Franco-Nevada is also highly fitting for NovaGold, where we deeply share Franco-Nevada's well-documented philosophy and practice of wealth creation.”

The Company is focused on advancing its 50%-owned flagship property, Donlin Gold, one of the world's largest known undeveloped gold deposits, which offers superior leverage to gold. NovaGold is also committed to maximizing value of its non-core assets and is currently exploring opportunities to sell all or part of the Company's interest in the Galore Creek copper-gold-silver project in British Columbia, Canada.
