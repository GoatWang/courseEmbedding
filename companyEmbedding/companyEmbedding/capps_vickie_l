dj Orthopedics Announces Key Executive Appointment; Names Vickie L. Capps Chief Financial Officer






July 15, 2002SAN DIEGO, Jul 15, 2002 (BW HealthWire) -- dj Orthopedics, Inc. (NYSE:DJO), a designer, manufacturer and marketer of products and services for the orthopedic sports medicine market, today announced a key appointment to its senior management team. Vickie L. Capps (41) has been named senior vice president and chief financial officer, replacing Cyril Talbot III.


	Ms. Capps, who brings more than 20 years of financial experience, including senior management positions with publicly-traded and multinational growth companies, will oversee the Company's ongoing financial operations, investor relations and Securities and Exchange Commission reporting activities.

	"We are continuing to strengthen our management team at the senior level to support our growth and profitability objectives. In addition to Vickie's significant financial management, operations, acquisitions and strategic financing experience, she has
	demonstrated outstanding leadership, team work and personnel development skills in her many years in financial management and investor relations. I am confident that Vickie will make a meaningful contribution to dj Ortho and we are delighted to welcome her to our team," said Les Cross, president and CEO of dj Orthopedics.

	During the past year, Ms. Capps held the position of senior vice president, finance and administration, and chief financial officer of AirFiber, Inc., a private San Diego-based technology company. Previously, she served for two years as vice president, finance and administration, and chief financial officer of Maxwell Technologies, Inc., a publicly-traded multi-divisional technology company, with revenues exceeding $100 million. While at Maxwell, Ms. Capps led several mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, negotiated new credit facilities, and played a key role in the executive team's development of strategy and vision.

	Prior to Maxwell, Ms. Capps served for seven years with Wavetek Wandel Goltermann, Inc., a multinational test instrument company now part of Acterna Corporation, where she held various senior financial management positions including senior vice president and chief financial officer. She began her career at Ernst & Young LLP.


	Ms. Capps is a California Certified Public Accountant and a member of the board of directors of Targeted Molecules Corporation, a private biotech company. She holds a bachelor of sciences degree in business administration/accounting from San Diego State University.

	dj Orthopedics is a global orthopedic sports medicine company specializing in the design, manufacture and marketing of surgical and non-surgical products and services that repair, regenerate and rehabilitate soft tissue and bone, help protect against injury, and treat osteoarthritis of the knee. Its broad range of more than 600 existing products, many of which are based on proprietary technologies, includes rigid knee braces, soft goods, specialty and other complementary orthopedic products and its recently introduced line of surgical products. These products provide solutions for patients and orthopedic sports medicine professionals throughout the patient's continuum of care.

	This press release contains or may contain forward-looking statements such as statements regarding the company's goals, strategies and industry trends. These forward-looking statements are based on the company's current expectations and goals, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements are the risk that we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy; our limited experience in designing, manufacturing and marketing products for the repair and regeneration segments of the orthopedic sports medicine market; our transition to direct distribution of our products in certain foreign countries; our ability to successfully develop or license and timely introduce and market new
	products or product enhancements; our dependence on our orthopedic professionals, agents and distributors for marketing our products; risks associated with our acquisition strategy and international operations; competition in our markets; the risk that our quarterly operating results are subject to substantial fluctuations; our high level of indebtedness and the restrictions
	imposed by the terms of our indebtedness; our ability to generate cash to service our debts; the effects of healthcare reform, managed care and buying groups on prices of our products; the uncertainty of domestic and foreign regulatory clearance and approval of our products; the sensitivity of our business to general economic conditions; uncertainty relating to third party
	reimbursement; pending litigation; and the other risk factors affecting the company detailed from time to time in the documents filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
