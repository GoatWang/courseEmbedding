Climate-induced changes in high elevation stream nitrate dynamicsProduct Type: Journal ArticleYear: 2009Author(s): Baron, J.S., T.S. Schmidt, and M.D. HartmanSuggested Citation: Baron, J.S., T.S. Schmidt, and M.D. Hartman. 2009. Climate-induced changes in high elevation stream nitrate dynamics. Global Change Biology. 15: 1777-1789. Mountain terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are responsive to external drivers of change, especially climate change and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N). we explored the consequences of a temperature-warming trend on stream nitrate in an alpine and subalpine watershed in the Colorado Front Range that has long been the recipient of elevated atmospheric N deposition. Mean annual stream nitrate concentrations since 2000 are higher by 50% than an earlier monitoring period of 1991-1999. Mean annual N export increased by 28% from 2.03 kg N ha -1yr-1 before 2000 to 2.84 kg N ha -1yr-1 in Loch Vale watershed since 2000. The substantial increase in N export comes as a surprise, since mean wet atmospheric N deposition from 1991 to 2006 (3.06 kg N ha -1yr-1) did not increase. There has been a period of below average precipitation from 2000 to 2006 and a steady increase in summer and fall temperatures of 0.12 degrees Cyr-1 in both seasons since 1991. Nitrate concentrations, as well as the weathering products calcium and sulfate, were higher from the period 2000-2006 in rock glacier meltwater at the top of the watershed above the influence of alpine and subalpine vegetation and soils. We conclude the observed recent N increases in Loch Val are the result of warmer summer and fall mean temperatures that are melting ice in glaciers and rock glaciers. This, in turn, has exposed sediments from which N produced by nitrification can be flushed. We suggest a water quality threshold may have been crossed around 2000. The phenomenon observed in Loch Vale may be indicative of N release from ice features such as rock glaciers worldwide as mountain glaciers retreat.

Sparkling Clean...fast!
The cleaning project had to be completed before the guests arrived. The fitting on my high pressure hose snapped!  

I went online to Pressure Washers DIRECT, ordered the Briggs & Stratton 25-foot replacement High Pressure Hose and received the part as promised.

Worth It!!!
I had to buy this hose to go with the telescoping washer wand that I bought to clean my gutters from the ground, my stock 14  hose did not fit the wand.  I now use this hose all the time just for the difference in pressure I get using it vs my stock hose.  Big difference!!!

REVIEWEDAPR.192013
Best Upgrade Ever
When I first bought my Craftsman Pressure Washer I was never satisfied with the original 1/4" hose.  After the hose began leaking I decided to upgrade to the larger 5/16" hose.  

I cannot begin to express what a change it has made in my life.  After seeing what a difference that spraying our "double-wide" using the new hose made we were contacted by Architectural Digest for a 16 page feature.  The neighbors were so impressed that they decided to incorporate our little settlement by the railroad tracks, name it after my family and elect me as Supreme Leader Emeritus (for life, of course).  

The new found confidence encouraged my son to minimize his meth exposure and re-take his GED test at the Alternative School.   We were all surprised, yet proud when he scored a perfect score on his ACT and was accepted to Duke Law for a full scholarship.  As a result of those changes my daughter decided to finally get rid of her current boyfriend, the one with the misspelled tattoos and career in fast-food preparation, and start seeing her original high school boyfriend, the Lt. Governor of our Commonwealth.  My wife, reveling in our new found success decided to bring home a close friend from her yoga class one night and.......well, let's just put it this way.........it was my BEST BIRTHDAY EVER !.  Even our dog enjoyed the benefits of the new Briggs & Stratton 25' (5/16") Replacement Hose by placing Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Show.....twice.

I'm not saying that your experiences will be similar, results may vary.  I will just say that my life has dramatically improved since purchasing this hose from Pressure Washers Direct and yours might too. 

Gotta run, some people are at my door with a big bunch a balloons and a large cardboard check......wonder what that's about?
