Investment Strategies & Money Management for Real People
Most investors worry that they don’t do enough research when choosing a money manager.
WrapManager can help you do research so you can be confident you’re investing with the Money Manager that best fits your situation.
Do the research. Invest with confidence.
 

 
 
 














Whether your goal is to grow your wealth or plan for retirement, we can help.


































And we do so with a specialized approach:
First, we come up with a detailed plan of action and recommend the Money Managers to meet your goals and then...
We proactively manage your account for a simple and transparent fee.
So, you not only get access to our money manager expertise and recommendations; you get a fiduciary - in the real sense of the word - looking after your money.
























Not to name drop but... people are talking about WrapManager:








































Here's how the process works:










#1We start by defining your Personalized Investment Plan
Before we do anything, our Certified Financial Planners or wealth managers will take the time to build out a plan that meets your goals. We hope to get a comprehensive view of your situation (assets, liabilities, insurance, other risk factors), your risk tolerance, your goals in life, and come up with a detailed strategy.




#2We’ll fine tune the plan and the strategy with you
It’s a partnership. You will have input and the time needed to feel confident about your strategy and the choices we are recommending. You’ll get an idea of where you will be in the future and the likelihood of reaching those goals, so you can make the necessary adjustments.




#3Once your investment plan is set, we’ll stay on top of it
Sometimes, you won’t hear from Financial Advisors unless there’s an issue.  We recommend a discussion, at least quarterly, so we can work with you to make necessary adjustments and make sure that you’re on track to meet your goals.














 









 


























Build a financial strategy for your life.
For qualified investors (1), it’s free of charge.

Careers




Work
My favorite time of the day is hearing a satisfied client say, “Yes.” My retirement dream includes the Big Island of Hawaii and a summer house on Lake George in upstate NY.
And here’s something my co-workers may not know about me… I had a painting of mine shown at the Hyde Collection in Glens Falls, NY.
 
Play
Some of my favorite fun things are my family, SF Giants, Stanford sports, long runs, random trivia, Hawaii, my 18 cousins, and my Grandparents (they just celebrated their 65th wedding anniversary). Guilty pleasure: TV, especially sports.

Careers




Work
My favorite part of the day is interacting with clients and coworkers. Gabe keeps things interesting and entertaining. My retirement dream includes having a home near family (in the Bay Area), plus lots of international travel and maybe even a vacation home in Kauai.
 
Play
I like to relax to NPR’s Weekend Edition on Saturday morning along with my favorite coffee (tough to do with my toddler running around). I’m a Bay Area native who enjoys cooking, concerts, classic movies, travel and most of all, spending time with my daughter Sairsha and my husband Cearull. Guilty pleasure: BBC period dramas like Downton Abbey.

Work
My favorite part of the day is seeing someone go the extra mile to take care of our clients, or going beyond to improve the knowledge or procedures within our firm. My retirement dream includes writing and publishing a book. And here’s something my co-workers may not know about me... I grew up working in my Grandparents’ antique shop and helping my father work on classic cars.
 
Play
Some of my favorite fun things include seeing live music, vintage fashion, collecting and listening to vinyl records, and classic films, especially the Thin Man. Outside of the office, I’m often planning my next road trip, trying out new gourmet recipes and scouring flea markets for unique home decor.  Guilty pleasure: quiet time at home.

Precision Investing, Robo vs. Traditional Advisors & More...























Goal based investing, retirement spending and the difference between robo and traditional advisors is discussed in this month's newsletter.

Use Goal-Based Investing to Invest with Precision
There is an emerging concept in health care known as “precision medicine.” According to the National Institutes of Health, “precision medicine is an emerging approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in environment, lifestyle and genes for each person.” In other words, instead of treating an illness with a blanket, one-size-fits-all approach, every individual is viewed as unique—which means their treatments are customized.
A similar concept applies to the world of investing. Instead of a one-size-fits-all investment solution for a wide array of investor goals, investors should be viewed as unique based on their specific needs and desires.

Recent Articles















Robo Advisors vs. Traditional Advisors: Should the Differences Matter to You?
Over the past few years, there’s been a technology-related buzz in the financial industry, but it’s not about the latest ‘app’ from Silicon Valley or about Snapchat’s IPO. It’s about a fairly new approach to managing money through “robo-advisors.” These 'advisors' are essentially online programs that use computer algorithms – instead of real investment managers and human advice – to make portfolio allocations over time.

4 Signs You’re Getting White Glove Service from Your Financial Advisor
A financial advisor’s job, at minimum, is to create an investment strategy based on your economic situation and goals. But that’s a bit like saying the job of a dancer is to move their body to music. Some do it better than others.
A good financial advisor should take the time to get to know you and your family, and spend as much time as it takes to get a firm understanding of your financial situation, goals, retirement income needs, estate planning needs, risk tolerance, etc. The result should be a comprehensive financial plan that considers multiple outcomes and gives an expectation of how much income you can expect to have in retirement.
If your current investment plan is little more than a template populated with your asset information - toss it. That plan is worth less than the paper it’s printed on. Financial planning is not one-size-fits-all. Read on to learn what you should expect from a top-notch financial advisor.

Investment Strategies & Money Management for Real People
Most investors worry that they don’t do enough research when choosing a money manager.
WrapManager can help you do research so you can be confident you’re investing with the Money Manager that best fits your situation.
Do the research. Invest with confidence.
 

 
 
 














Whether your goal is to grow your wealth or plan for retirement, we can help.


































And we do so with a specialized approach:
First, we come up with a detailed plan of action and recommend the Money Managers to meet your goals and then...
We proactively manage your account for a simple and transparent fee.
So, you not only get access to our money manager expertise and recommendations; you get a fiduciary - in the real sense of the word - looking after your money.
























Not to name drop but... people are talking about WrapManager:








































Here's how the process works:










#1We start by defining your Personalized Investment Plan
Before we do anything, our Certified Financial Planners or wealth managers will take the time to build out a plan that meets your goals. We hope to get a comprehensive view of your situation (assets, liabilities, insurance, other risk factors), your risk tolerance, your goals in life, and come up with a detailed strategy.




#2We’ll fine tune the plan and the strategy with you
It’s a partnership. You will have input and the time needed to feel confident about your strategy and the choices we are recommending. You’ll get an idea of where you will be in the future and the likelihood of reaching those goals, so you can make the necessary adjustments.




#3Once your investment plan is set, we’ll stay on top of it
Sometimes, you won’t hear from Financial Advisors unless there’s an issue.  We recommend a discussion, at least quarterly, so we can work with you to make necessary adjustments and make sure that you’re on track to meet your goals.














 









 


























Build a financial strategy for your life.
For qualified investors (1), it’s free of charge.
