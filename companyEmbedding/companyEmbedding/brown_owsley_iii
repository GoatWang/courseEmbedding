Owsley Brown II, who expanded his family’s Kentucky liquor company to reach a global market for its brands, among them Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, Southern Comfort and Finlandia vodka, died on Monday in Louisville, Ky. He was 69.Matthew Barzun, a son-in-law, said the cause was complications of pneumonia.Mr. Brown was a former chief executive of Brown-Forman, the company founded in Louisville in 1870 by his great-grandfather George Garvin Brown. The company’s first brand, Old Forester Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whisky, was America’s first bottled bourbon and remains one of Brown-Forman’s strongest sellers.Mr. Brown worked his way up the ranks of the family business, becoming chief executive in 1993. Two years later, he added the title of chairman.Besides expanding into foreign markets under Mr. Brown’s leadership, Brown-Forman also introduced a number of new products. In 1995, it released Tropical Freezes, which the company calls the first blended freezer cocktails. The drink, which comes in a foil package, was another big seller. In 2002, Brown-Forman joined with Miller Brewing to produce Jack Daniel’s Hard Cola.

But he resisted calls for merging Brown-Forman with another company. Speaking in June, he said mergers could “breed arrogance and complacency, and even a sense of entitlement.” Continue reading the main story

“One thing seems clear to me,” he said, “pursuing size for its own sake is a very poor choice.”

Mr. Brown lived in Louisville and was a leading philanthropist there. He is survived by his wife, Christy; his brothers W. L.

Mr. Barzun, a former United States ambassador to Sweden and now President Obama’s national campaign finance chairman, said Mr. Brown “deserves credit for turning a great American company into a great global company.”He said his father-in-law favored tradition and quality, be it in his choice of drink, his vision for Brown-Forman or his hopes for Louisville. In June, Mr. Brown received a corporate citizenship awarded from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, based in Washington, D.C. Mr. Brown’s favorite drink, he said, was Old Forester Bourbon over ice with a splash of water or club soda.

Owsley Brown II




			Owsley Brown1964 graduation
Owsley Brown II died on September 26, 2011. 
Read his obituary and an editorial from the Courier-Journal (Louisville, 
KY), and a remembrance by Christopher L. ("Kit") Kincade '64.

Editorial
Remembrance


Obituary
Carrier-Journal.com
Sep. 27, 2011Owsley Brown II, Louisville philanthropist and 
		retired chairman of his family-controlled liquor company died late 
		Monday after a brief illness.

		Son-in-law Matthew Barzun said the death was the result of complications 
		from pneumonia.

Brown, who turned 69 earlier this month, was a great-grandson of the 
		founder of Brown-Forman and worked in the family business for about 40 
		years, including 12 years as chief executive.

		During his tenure, the distiller expanded its footprint overseas, 
		bringing brands such as Jack Daniel's and Southern Comfort to millions 
		of new customers outside the United States.

		On Brown's watch as CEO from 1993 to 2005, the company's stock value 
		more than quadrupled and outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 index, a 
		broad measure of U.S. stocks. Brown also served as chairman from 1995 
		until his retirement in 2007.

		"Owsley was a personal friend to so many of us across the world and we 
		are all shocked and saddened by his premature death," Paul Varga, who 
		succeeded Brown as chief executive, said in a statement released Tuesday 
		by the company. "Owsley was a truly remarkable man with a brilliant 
		mind. ... He generously shared these unique gifts to build Brown-Forman 
		into the global success it is today and to establish long-lasting 
		friendships throughout our industry."

		"Owsley Brown has left a legacy in our city in so many ways, from the 
		arts, education and business community to the environment and interfaith 
		issues," Mayor Greg Fischer said in a statement Tuesday. "I've lost a 
		dear friend and the community has lost a compassionate man ."

		A Republican until December 2006 when he became a Democrat, Brown 
		supported Fischer, a Democrat, in his bid to replace Jerry Abramson, who 
		was not seeking reelection.

		U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that he 
		knew Brown for more than 30 years.

		"Louisville lost a great friend today; he will be missed," McConnell 
		said.

		When he retired, Brown, a graduate of Yale and Stanford universities, 
		said he would take a step toward another legacy: philanthropy. His 
		efforts extended to organizations that supported art and music, historic 
		preservation and environmental protection. He was active in Actors 
		Theatre of Louisville, the Fund for the Arts and River Fields, where he 
		was a board member.

		Last year, his family's Owsley Brown Charitable Foundation of which he 
		was president, gave $769,837 to a variety of churches and community 
		groups, including more than $100,000 in donations to the Center for 
		Interfaith Relations, according to tax records. In both 2006 and 2008, 
		tax records show the foundation's giving totaled $1.2 million.

		But his interest in the arts was more than financial.

		A 1971 Courier-Journal article said it wasn't uncommon for Brown — as 
		Actors' board president — to be seen cleaning windows or lugging props 
		at the theater in his spare time. He also helped lead efforts for Actors 
		to secure its current Main Street location.

		Jon Jory, who led the theater for 31 years and founded the Humana 
		Festival of New American Plays, said "Owsley was not only a friend, but 
		a friend who amazed me. ... I have used him as my example of what one 
		can be and do for years. "

		In a 2007 Courier-Journal article about Brown's retirement, Christina 
		Lee "Christy" Brown described her husband as a "brilliant thinker" with 
		a passion for architecture and history. Contemplative and humble, he 
		wouldn't readily admit that he spoke or read French, German and some 
		Italian, and created oil paintings in his spare time, she said.

		At the Speed Art Museum, he was vice chairman of the board and headed a 
		building committee overseeing a planned expansion.

		Christy and Owsley "were up in the galleries all the time," Speed 
		director Charles Venable said in a phone interview. Brown would arrange 
		his schedule so that meetings at the museum could be augmented by time 
		seeing what was new in the galleries, Venable said.

		Brown's death came five months after that of his mother, Sara 
		Shallenberger "Sally" Brown, the family matriarch who was 100, and had 
		spearheaded a restoration of the Locust Grove historic property.

		After earning a master's in business administration from Stanford, 
		Owsley Brown II worked as an Army intelligence officer at the Pentagon. 
		Most of his adult years were spent with the family business. He started 
		at Brown-Forman in 1961 as a summer employee, the company said.

		At Brown-Forman, Brown oversaw the acquisition of key brands including 
		Finlandia vodka and Sonoma-Cutrer Vineyards.

		While he broadened the company's spirits portfolio, his favorite 
		cocktail was traditional: The company's founding brand, Old Forester 
		Bourbon with ice and a little water in a tall glass.

		Earlier this year, Brown received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate 
		Citizenship and along with his wife, Christy, Greater Louisville Inc.'s 
		Gold Cup award in honor of their civic and philanthropic leadership.

		"Owsley instilled a culture of enduring growth for which the board and 
		family are truly indebted," Geo. Garvin Brown IV, chairman of 
		Brown-Forman's board of directors and Brown's cousin, said in a 
		statement. "The continued strength of the company and its role as a 
		responsible global citizen are the greatest testaments to his life's 
		work."

		Brown is survived by his wife, Christy; three children, Owsley III (Victoire), 
		Brooke Barzun (Matthew), and Augusta Holland (Gill); and nine 
		grandchildren.

		A public visitation will be held Thursday at The Speed Art Museum from 
		3-6 p.m. The funeral will be 10 a.m. Friday at Christ Church Cathedral 
		on Second Street followed by a private burial at Breeze Hill Farm, the 
		Oldham County farm he owned with his wife.

		The family requests that donations be directed to the Metro United Way 
		or the Fund for the Arts.

		"The last thing he would want in the world is for people to say, ‘well, 
		now that he's gone we can't accomplish what he was helping us to 
		accomplish,'" the Speed's Venable said. "He more than anybody knows that 
		life can be fleeting and that Louisville needs to raise the bar and 
		really do great things going forward."

Editorial
Carrier-Journal.com
Sep. 27, 2011


The sadly premature death Monday night of Owsley 
		Brown II at the age of 69 deprives Louisville of one of its most 
		generous and committed benefactors.

		U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth was right when he noted, "Nobody took the 
		responsibilities of being a citizen more seriously" than Mr. Brown. His 
		generosity and leadership in the fine arts, historic preservation and 
		the quest for world peace set a gold standard for community leadership.

		As chief executive of Brown-Forman from 1993 to 2005 and chairman from 
		1995 to 2007, Mr. Brown carried on a family legacy that dated back to 
		the liquor company's founding in 1870. While in charge of the company, 
		he led a vigorous effort to expand its international profile and to 
		modernize the marketing of its brands, with the result that labels such 
		as Jack Daniel's whiskey and Finlandia vodka became readily recognized 
		worldwide. The company's financial returns were impressive.

		However, as the liquor market — like most other industries — went 
		global, Brown-Forman remained a Louisville company and a major corporate 
		citizen. It has almost 1,200 local employees, still makes whiskey in 
		Jefferson County and has resisted the impulse to move its headquarters 
		despite what it feels is a tax climate that singles out its industry 
		unfairly.

		Mr. Brown's own role in his hometown was prominent. He served on 
		numerous boards, and led fund-raising drives for the Greater Louisville 
		Fund for the Arts and Actors Theatre of Louisville. He was lauded for 
		his leadership in the rehabilitation of the Actors Theatre building, the 
		Cathedral of the Assumption and Brown-Forman's building in the 600 block 
		of West Main Street.

		After retirement, Mr. Brown and his wife, Christy, expanded their 
		already sizable philanthropic and community outreach, donating hundreds 
		of thousands of dollars from his family's charitable foundation to 
		religious and community groups. Last year's gifts included more than 
		$100,000 to the Center for Interfaith Relations.

		In one of his final public pronouncements, Mr. Brown used the occasion 
		of receipt of the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship in June 
		to stress that in community life, as in business, better is preferable 
		to bigger — and bigger is desirable only when it results from becoming 
		better.

		That serves as a fitting epitaph for Mr. Brown — an emphasis on 
		excellence. And, as happened so often, he leaves his community yet 
		another insight to ponder.

Remembrance
Christopher L. ("Kit") Kincade '64
		Sep. 30, 2011
		Owsley was a tremendous force for good in the Louisville community. In 
		addition to the many philanthropic efforts cited in his obituary, Owsley 
		also supported a program called "Bulldogs in the Bluegrass," where we 
		bring Yale undergraduates to Louisville in the summer for internships. 
		The genius and driver behind that movement, Rowan Claypool '80, extols 
		the work of Owsley and his wife Christy in helping to get it off the 
		ground.

Owsley Stanley, Artisan of Acid, Is Dead at 76

Owsley Stanley, the prodigiously gifted applied chemist to the stars, who made LSD in quantity for the Grateful Dead, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Ken Kesey and other avatars of the psychedelic ’60s, died on Saturday in a car accident in Australia. He was 76 and lived in the bush near Cairns, in the Australian state of Queensland.His car swerved off a highway and down an embankment before hitting trees near Mareeba, a town in Queensland, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Stanley’s wife, Sheilah, was injured in the accident.Mr. Stanley, the Dead’s former financial backer, pharmaceutical supplier and sound engineer, was in recent decades a reclusive, almost mythically enigmatic figure. He moved to Australia in the 1980s, as he explained in his rare interviews, so he might survive what he believed to be a coming Ice Age that would annihilate the Northern Hemisphere.Once renowned as an artisan of acid, Mr. Stanley turned out LSD said to be purer and finer than any other. He was also among the first individuals (in many accounts, the very first) to mass-produce the drug; its resulting wide availability provided the chemical underpinnings of an era of love, music, grooviness and much else. Conservatively tallied, Mr. Stanley’s career output was more than a million doses, in some estimates more than five million.

His was the acid behind the Acid Tests conducted by the novelist Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters, the group of psychedelic adherents whose exploits were chronicled by Tom Wolfe in his 1968 book “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.” The music world immortalized Mr. Stanley in a host of songs, including the Dead’s “Alice D. Millionaire” (a play on a newspaper headline, describing one of his several arrests, that called him an “LSD Millionaire”) and Steely Dan’s “Kid Charlemagne.” Continue reading the main story

So widely known was Mr. Stanley that he appears in the Encyclopedia Britannica article on LSD under the apparently unironic index term “Augustus Owsley Stanley III (American chemist).” The Oxford English Dictionary contains an entry for the noun “Owsley” as “an extremely potent, high-quality type of LSD.” In 2007, Mr. Stanley was the subject of a long profile in an issue of Rolling Stone magazine commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Summer of Love.In short, Mr. Stanley lent the ’60s a great deal of its color — like White Lightning, Monterey Purple and Blue Cheer, the varieties of his LSD that were among the most popular. (He did not, contrary to popular lore, release a product called Purple Haze; in interviews, he sounded quite miffed that anything emerging from his laboratory could be thought to cause haziness rather than the crystalline clarity for which he personally vouched.)He also lent the era much of its sound, developing early, widely praised high-fidelity sound systems for live rock concerts, including the Dead’s towering “wall of sound.”Mr. Stanley was previously a ballet dancer and a member of the United States Air Force.Augustus Owsley Stanley III was born on Jan. 19, 1935, to a patrician Kentucky family. His paternal grandfather, for whom he was named, was a congressman, governor of Kentucky and United States senator. (Somewhat prophetically, given his grandson’s future pursuits, the elder Mr. Stanley was a vigorous public foe of Prohibition.)Young Owsley, whose adolescent hirsuteness caused him to be known ever after as Bear, was sent to a military preparatory school in Maryland. He was expelled in the ninth grade for furnishing the alcohol that, as he told Rolling Stone in 2007, had nearly all his classmates “blasted out of their minds” on homecoming weekend.

He briefly attended the University of Virginia before enlisting in the Air Force, where he learned electronics. He later worked in Los Angeles as a broadcast engineer for radio and television stations. He also studied ballet and for a time was a professional dancer.In 1963, Mr. Stanley enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley. The next year, he encountered LSD, a transformative experience. “I remember the first time I took acid and walked outside,” he said in the Rolling Stone interview. “The cars were kissing the parking meters.”

Mr. Stanley had found his calling, and at the time it was at least quasi-legitimate: LSD was not outlawed in California until 1966. What he needed to do was learn his craft, which he accomplished, as Rolling Stone reported, in three weeks in the university library, poring over chemistry journals. Soon afterward, he left college and a going concern, the Bear Research Group, was born.

In 1965, he met Mr. Kesey, and through him the Dead. Enraptured, he became their sound man, early underwriter, principal acolyte, sometime housemate and frequent touring companion. With Bob Thomas, he designed the band’s highly recognizable skull-and-lightning-bolt logo. Mr. Stanley also made many recordings of the Dead in performance, now considered valuable documentary records of the band’s early years. Many have been released commercially.Mr. Stanley remained with the band off and on through the early ’70s, when, according to Rolling Stone, his habits became too much even for the Grateful Dead and they parted company. (He had insisted, among other things, that the band eat meat — nothing but meat — a dietary regimen he followed until the end of his life.)His other clients included John Lennon, who, according to “The Beatles,” a 2005 biography by Bob Spitz, contracted to pay Mr. Stanley for a lifetime supply of his wares.In 1970, after a judge revoked Mr. Stanley’s bail from a 1967 drug arrest, he served two years in federal prison. There, he learned metalwork and jewelry making, trades he plied in recent years.Mr. Stanley, who became an Australian citizen in the 1990s, was treated for throat cancer in 2004. In the Rolling Stone interview, he attributed his survival to his carnivorous diet. (A heart attack he had suffered some years earlier he ascribed to eating broccoli as a child, forced on him by his mother.)Besides his wife, Sheilah, Mr. Stanley’s survivors include two sons, Pete and Starfinder; two daughters, Nina and Redbird; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.Though he helped transform the culture, Mr. Stanley asserted that he had never meant to do so. As he told The San Francisco Chronicle in 2007, he had set out only to make a product he knew he could take, because its ingredients were known.“And my friends all wanted to know what they were taking, too,” Mr. Stanley said. “Of course,” he added “my ‘friends’ expanded very rapidly.”

 Correction: November 8, 2011  
An obituary on March 15 about Owsley Stanley, one of the first people to mass-produce LSD, misstated the date of his death, using information from his family. It was March 12, not March 13. Mr. Stanley’s son pointed out the error in an e-mail on Friday. (The error was repeated in an Op-Ed article on March 19 and in a report in the Week in Review section on March 20.)

Owsley Stanley (born Augustus Owsley Stanley III, January 19, 1935 – March 12, 2011) was an American audio engineer and chemist. He was a key figure in the San Francisco Bay Area hippie movement during the 1960s and played a pivotal role in the counterculture of the 1960s. Under the professional name Bear, he was the soundman for the rock band the Grateful Dead, whom he met when Ken Kesey invited them to an Acid Test party. As their sound engineer, Stanley frequently recorded live tapes behind his mixing board, designed their trademark skull logo,[1] and developed their Wall of Sound sound system, one of the largest mobile public address systems ever constructed.
Stanley was the first private individual to manufacture mass quantities of LSD.[2][3][4] By his own account, between 1965 and 1967, Stanley produced no less than 500 grams of LSD, amounting to a little more than five million doses at the time.[5]
Stanley died in a car accident in Australia, on March 12, 2011.[4][6][7]

Ancestry[edit]
Stanley was the son of a political family from Kentucky. His father was a government attorney. His grandfather, A. Owsley Stanley, a member of the United States Senate after serving as Governor of Kentucky and in the U.S. House of Representatives, campaigned against Prohibition in the 1920s.[4]
Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
At an early age, he committed himself to St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C.[8] He studied engineering at the University of Virginia before dropping out.[9] In 1956 when Stanley was 21, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and served for 18 months before being discharged in 1958. Later, inspired by a 1958 performance of the Bolshoi Ballet, he studied ballet in Los Angeles, supporting himself for a time as a professional dancer.[10] In 1963, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became involved in the psychoactive drug scene. He dropped out after a semester, took a technical job at KGO-TV, and began producing LSD in a small lab located in the bathroom of a house near campus; his makeshift laboratory was raided by police on February 21, 1965. He beat the charges and successfully sued for the return of his equipment. The police were looking for methamphetamine but found only LSD,[citation needed] which was not illegal at the time.
Stanley moved to Los Angeles to pursue the production of LSD. He used his Berkeley lab to buy 500 grams of lysergic acid monohydrate, the basis for LSD. His first shipment arrived on March 30, 1965 and he produced 300,000 hits (270 micrograms each) of LSD by May 1965; then he returned to the Bay Area.
In September 1965, Stanley became the primary LSD supplier to Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. By this time, Sandoz LSD was hard to come by, and "Owsley Acid" had become the new standard.[citation needed] He was featured (most prominently his freak-out at the Muir Beach Acid Test in November 1965) in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (1968), Tom Wolfe's book detailing the history of Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. Stanley attended the Watts Acid Test on February 12, 1966 with his new apprentice Tim Scully, and provided the LSD.
Stanley also provided LSD to the Beatles during filming of Magical Mystery Tour (1967),[11] and former Three Dog Night singer Chuck Negron has noted that Owsley and Leary gave Negron's band free LSD.[12]
Involvement with the Grateful Dead[edit]
Stanley met the members of the Grateful Dead during 1965.[13] He both financed them and worked with them as their first soundman.[14] Along with his close friend Bob Thomas, Stanley designed the Lightning Bolt Skull Logo.[1] The lightning bolt design came to him after seeing a similar design on a roadside advertisement: "One day in the rain, I looked out the side and saw a sign along the freeway which was a circle with a white bar across it. The top of the circle was orange, and the bottom blue. I couldn't read the name of the firm, and so was just looking at the shape. A thought occurred to me: if the orange were red and the bar across were a lightning bolt cutting across at an angle, then we would have a very nice, unique and highly identifiable mark to put on the equipment."[1]
During his time as the sound engineer for the Grateful Dead, Stanley started what became the long-term practice of recording the Dead while they rehearsed and performed. His initial motivation for creating what he dubbed his "sonic journal" was to improve his ability to mix the sound,[citation needed] but the fortuitous result was an extensive trove of recordings from the heyday of the San Francisco concert/dance scene in the mid-1960s.
In addition to his large archive of Dead performances, Stanley made numerous live recordings of other leading 1960s and 1970s artists appearing in San Francisco, including Quicksilver Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane, early Jefferson Starship, Old and in the Way, Janis Joplin, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Taj Mahal, Santana, Miles Davis, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, and Blue Cheer.[6]
Richmond LSD lab[edit]
Stanley and Scully built electronic equipment for the Grateful Dead until late spring 1966. At this point, Stanley rented a house in Point Richmond, Richmond, California. He, Scully, and Melissa Cargill (Stanley's girlfriend and a skilled chemist, introduced to Stanley by Susan Cowper, a former girlfriend) set up a lab in the basement. The Point Richmond lab turned out more than 300,000 tablets (270 micrograms each) of LSD, dubbed "White Lightning". When LSD became illegal in California on October 6, 1966, Scully decided to set up a new lab in Denver, Colorado. The new lab was set up in the basement of a house across the street from the Denver Zoo in early 1967.[citation needed]
Legal trouble and continued involvement with the Grateful Dead[edit]
STP was distributed in the summer of 1967 in 20 mg tablets and quickly acquired a bad reputation (later research in normal volunteers showed that 20 mg was over six times the dose required to produce hallucinogenic effects, and its slow onset of action may have caused street users to take even more than a single tablet).[15] Stanley and Scully made trial batches of STP in 10 mg tablets and then of STP mixed with LSD in a few hundred yellow tablets, but soon ceased production of STP. Stanley and Scully produced about 196 grams of LSD in 1967, but 96 grams of this was confiscated by the police.
In late 1967, Stanley's La Espiral, Orinda lab was raided by police; he was found in possession of 350,000 doses of LSD and 1,500 doses of STP. His defense was that the illegal substances were for personal use, but he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison. The same year, Stanley officially shortened his name to "Owsley Stanley". After he was released from prison, Stanley resumed working for the Grateful Dead as their live sound engineer. On January 31, 1970, at 3:00 am, 19 members of the Grateful Dead and crew were arrested for possession of a variety of drugs at a French Quarter hotel, after returning from a concert at "The Warehouse" in New Orleans.
According to Rolling Stone,[16] everyone in the band except Ron "Pigpen" McKernan and Tom Constanten - neither of whom used psychedelic drugs - was included in the arrest, along with several members of their retinue, including Stanley and some locals. Stanley was charged with illegal possession of narcotics, dangerous non-narcotics, LSD, and barbiturates. Another West Coast–based rock band, Jefferson Airplane, had been arrested two weeks earlier in the same situation. According to an article in the Baton Rouge State Times, Stanley identified himself to the police as "The King of Acid" and technician of the band. The 1970 Grateful Dead song "Truckin'" is based on the incident ("Busted, down on Bourbon Street / Set up, like a bowling pin / Knocked down, it gets to wearing thin / They just won't let you be").[17]
Stanley was confined to federal prison from 1970 to 1972, after a federal judge intervened and revoked his release from the 1967 case. Stanley took advantage of the opportunity there to learn the trade of metalwork and jewelry-making.[4]
Immediately following his release, Stanley resumed working for the Grateful Dead as a roadie and sound engineer in the summer of 1972. As much of his portfolio had been delegated to as many as four sound engineers during his prison sentence, he struggled to regain his past influence among the band and support staff. In a later interview with Dennis McNally, he opined that he received "just a taste" of his previous position; according to Stanley, "I found on my release from jail that the crew, most of whom had been hired in my absence, did not want anything changed. No improvements for the sound, no new gear, nothing different on stage. They wanted to maintain the same old same old which under their limited abilities, they had memorized to the point where they could sleepwalk through shows. Bob Matthews, who had been mixing since my departure, did not want to completely relinquish the mixing desk, which was a total pain in the ass for me, since he was basically a studio engineer and no match for my live mixing ability." The situation was exacerbated by his disdain for the coarse language and deleterious drugs (most notably alcohol and cocaine) favored by the band's physically imposing roadies, many of whom perceived themselves as "macho cowboys" in contrast to Stanley's diminutive stature and erudite mien.
The tensions culminated in a logistical mishap at a October 1972 concert at Vanderbilt University when students recruited by Stanley to deputize for an absentee Matthews absconded with half of the band's PA system, resulting in a fellow employee throwing Stanley into a water cooler. The altercation led Stanley to request the formal codification of his perceived managerial power over the equipment staff, including unprecedented hire/fire privileges.[18]
Although Stanley stopped touring with the band following their refusal of his demands, he continued to be employed by the Grateful Dead through their 1975 hiatus in a more diaphanous capacity. During this period, he served as lead designer of the band's Wall of Sound PA system and assisted Phil Lesh in salvaging the technically deficient recordings assembled for Steal Your Face (1976), a poorly-received live album culled from the final October 1974 pre-hiatus shows at Winterland Ballroom.[19]
Post–Grateful Dead career[edit]
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stanley briefly served as the mixing engineer for Jefferson Starship while eking out an indigent livelihood through marijuana cultivation in Marin County. A naturalized Australian citizen since 1996, Stanley lived with his wife Sheilah in the bush of Tropical North Queensland, where he worked to create sculpture, much of it wearable art. Due to his anticipation of a "thermal cataclysm"[20] related to climate change, he began to spend much of his time in Australia in 1982 while frequently returning to the United States to sell his jewelry (which commanded high prices) on Grateful Dead tours, where he retained backstage access; during this period, his clientele included such luminaries as Keith Richards.[2]
Stanley made his first public appearance in decades at the Australian ethnobotanical conference Entheogenesis Australis in 2009, giving three talks during his time in Melbourne.[21][permanent dead link]
Death[edit]



Wikinews has related news: Owsley Stanley, icon of 1960s counterculture, dies at 76


Stanley died after a car accident in Australia on Saturday, March 12, 2011,[4] not Sunday, March 13, as reported in most publications[6][7][8][22][23] (a widely propagated error stemming from the Monday release to the press of the initial family statement, which was written on Sunday, stating he "died yesterday"). The statement released on behalf of Stanley's family said the car crash occurred near his home, on a rural stretch of highway near Mareeba, Queensland. He was survived by his wife Sheilah, four children, eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
"The Owsley Stanley Foundation" was created by Owsley's immediate family and some of his close friends, and was incorporated on August 25, 2011 as a California non-profit corporation dedicated to fostering diverse charitable, artistic, musical, and scientific endeavors for the public benefit.[24]
His ashes were placed on the soundboard at the Grateful Dead 50th anniversary shows in Chicago, on July 3–5, 2015.[25]
In popular culture[edit]
In literature[edit]

Owsley's association with Ken Kesey and the Grateful dead is described in Tom Wolfe's novel The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test (1968).
Stanley's incarceration is lamented in Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971) as one of the many signs of the death of the 1960s.[26]
In Steve Hillard's novel Mirkwood: A Novel About JRR Tolkien (2011), a fictional character named Osley modeled loosely after Stanley is described as a fugitive from the 1960s and the "Henry Ford of Psychedelics".

In music[edit]

A newspaper headline identifying Stanley as an "LSD Millionaire" ran in the Los Angeles Times the day before the state of California, on October 6, 1966, criminalized the drug. The headline inspired the Grateful Dead song, "Alice D. Millionaire".[13]
Stanley is mentioned by his first name in the song "Who Needs the Peace Corps?" by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, which first appeared on the band's album We're Only in It for the Money (1968) ("I'll go to Frisco, buy a wig and sleep on Owsley's floor.").[27][28][29][30][31][32]
Stanley is referred to in Jefferson Airplane's song "Mexico" on the Early Flight (1974) album.
The Steely Dan song "Kid Charlemagne", from the album The Royal Scam (1976), is loosely based on Stanley.[33][34][35][36]

Ancestry[edit]
Stanley was the son of a political family from Kentucky. His father was a government attorney. His grandfather, A. Owsley Stanley, a member of the United States Senate after serving as Governor of Kentucky and in the U.S. House of Representatives, campaigned against Prohibition in the 1920s.[4]
Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
At an early age, he committed himself to St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C.[8] He studied engineering at the University of Virginia before dropping out.[9] In 1956 when Stanley was 21, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and served for 18 months before being discharged in 1958. Later, inspired by a 1958 performance of the Bolshoi Ballet, he studied ballet in Los Angeles, supporting himself for a time as a professional dancer.[10] In 1963, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became involved in the psychoactive drug scene. He dropped out after a semester, took a technical job at KGO-TV, and began producing LSD in a small lab located in the bathroom of a house near campus; his makeshift laboratory was raided by police on February 21, 1965. He beat the charges and successfully sued for the return of his equipment. The police were looking for methamphetamine but found only LSD,[citation needed] which was not illegal at the time.
Stanley moved to Los Angeles to pursue the production of LSD. He used his Berkeley lab to buy 500 grams of lysergic acid monohydrate, the basis for LSD. His first shipment arrived on March 30, 1965 and he produced 300,000 hits (270 micrograms each) of LSD by May 1965; then he returned to the Bay Area.
In September 1965, Stanley became the primary LSD supplier to Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. By this time, Sandoz LSD was hard to come by, and "Owsley Acid" had become the new standard.[citation needed] He was featured (most prominently his freak-out at the Muir Beach Acid Test in November 1965) in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (1968), Tom Wolfe's book detailing the history of Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. Stanley attended the Watts Acid Test on February 12, 1966 with his new apprentice Tim Scully, and provided the LSD.
Stanley also provided LSD to the Beatles during filming of Magical Mystery Tour (1967),[11] and former Three Dog Night singer Chuck Negron has noted that Owsley and Leary gave Negron's band free LSD.[12]
Involvement with the Grateful Dead[edit]
Stanley met the members of the Grateful Dead during 1965.[13] He both financed them and worked with them as their first soundman.[14] Along with his close friend Bob Thomas, Stanley designed the Lightning Bolt Skull Logo.[1] The lightning bolt design came to him after seeing a similar design on a roadside advertisement: "One day in the rain, I looked out the side and saw a sign along the freeway which was a circle with a white bar across it. The top of the circle was orange, and the bottom blue. I couldn't read the name of the firm, and so was just looking at the shape. A thought occurred to me: if the orange were red and the bar across were a lightning bolt cutting across at an angle, then we would have a very nice, unique and highly identifiable mark to put on the equipment."[1]
During his time as the sound engineer for the Grateful Dead, Stanley started what became the long-term practice of recording the Dead while they rehearsed and performed. His initial motivation for creating what he dubbed his "sonic journal" was to improve his ability to mix the sound,[citation needed] but the fortuitous result was an extensive trove of recordings from the heyday of the San Francisco concert/dance scene in the mid-1960s.
In addition to his large archive of Dead performances, Stanley made numerous live recordings of other leading 1960s and 1970s artists appearing in San Francisco, including Quicksilver Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane, early Jefferson Starship, Old and in the Way, Janis Joplin, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Taj Mahal, Santana, Miles Davis, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, and Blue Cheer.[6]
Richmond LSD lab[edit]
Stanley and Scully built electronic equipment for the Grateful Dead until late spring 1966. At this point, Stanley rented a house in Point Richmond, Richmond, California. He, Scully, and Melissa Cargill (Stanley's girlfriend and a skilled chemist, introduced to Stanley by Susan Cowper, a former girlfriend) set up a lab in the basement. The Point Richmond lab turned out more than 300,000 tablets (270 micrograms each) of LSD, dubbed "White Lightning". When LSD became illegal in California on October 6, 1966, Scully decided to set up a new lab in Denver, Colorado. The new lab was set up in the basement of a house across the street from the Denver Zoo in early 1967.[citation needed]
Legal trouble and continued involvement with the Grateful Dead[edit]
STP was distributed in the summer of 1967 in 20 mg tablets and quickly acquired a bad reputation (later research in normal volunteers showed that 20 mg was over six times the dose required to produce hallucinogenic effects, and its slow onset of action may have caused street users to take even more than a single tablet).[15] Stanley and Scully made trial batches of STP in 10 mg tablets and then of STP mixed with LSD in a few hundred yellow tablets, but soon ceased production of STP. Stanley and Scully produced about 196 grams of LSD in 1967, but 96 grams of this was confiscated by the police.
In late 1967, Stanley's La Espiral, Orinda lab was raided by police; he was found in possession of 350,000 doses of LSD and 1,500 doses of STP. His defense was that the illegal substances were for personal use, but he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison. The same year, Stanley officially shortened his name to "Owsley Stanley". After he was released from prison, Stanley resumed working for the Grateful Dead as their live sound engineer. On January 31, 1970, at 3:00 am, 19 members of the Grateful Dead and crew were arrested for possession of a variety of drugs at a French Quarter hotel, after returning from a concert at "The Warehouse" in New Orleans.
According to Rolling Stone,[16] everyone in the band except Ron "Pigpen" McKernan and Tom Constanten - neither of whom used psychedelic drugs - was included in the arrest, along with several members of their retinue, including Stanley and some locals. Stanley was charged with illegal possession of narcotics, dangerous non-narcotics, LSD, and barbiturates. Another West Coast–based rock band, Jefferson Airplane, had been arrested two weeks earlier in the same situation. According to an article in the Baton Rouge State Times, Stanley identified himself to the police as "The King of Acid" and technician of the band. The 1970 Grateful Dead song "Truckin'" is based on the incident ("Busted, down on Bourbon Street / Set up, like a bowling pin / Knocked down, it gets to wearing thin / They just won't let you be").[17]
Stanley was confined to federal prison from 1970 to 1972, after a federal judge intervened and revoked his release from the 1967 case. Stanley took advantage of the opportunity there to learn the trade of metalwork and jewelry-making.[4]
Immediately following his release, Stanley resumed working for the Grateful Dead as a roadie and sound engineer in the summer of 1972. As much of his portfolio had been delegated to as many as four sound engineers during his prison sentence, he struggled to regain his past influence among the band and support staff. In a later interview with Dennis McNally, he opined that he received "just a taste" of his previous position; according to Stanley, "I found on my release from jail that the crew, most of whom had been hired in my absence, did not want anything changed. No improvements for the sound, no new gear, nothing different on stage. They wanted to maintain the same old same old which under their limited abilities, they had memorized to the point where they could sleepwalk through shows. Bob Matthews, who had been mixing since my departure, did not want to completely relinquish the mixing desk, which was a total pain in the ass for me, since he was basically a studio engineer and no match for my live mixing ability." The situation was exacerbated by his disdain for the coarse language and deleterious drugs (most notably alcohol and cocaine) favored by the band's physically imposing roadies, many of whom perceived themselves as "macho cowboys" in contrast to Stanley's diminutive stature and erudite mien.
The tensions culminated in a logistical mishap at a October 1972 concert at Vanderbilt University when students recruited by Stanley to deputize for an absentee Matthews absconded with half of the band's PA system, resulting in a fellow employee throwing Stanley into a water cooler. The altercation led Stanley to request the formal codification of his perceived managerial power over the equipment staff, including unprecedented hire/fire privileges.[18]
Although Stanley stopped touring with the band following their refusal of his demands, he continued to be employed by the Grateful Dead through their 1975 hiatus in a more diaphanous capacity. During this period, he served as lead designer of the band's Wall of Sound PA system and assisted Phil Lesh in salvaging the technically deficient recordings assembled for Steal Your Face (1976), a poorly-received live album culled from the final October 1974 pre-hiatus shows at Winterland Ballroom.[19]
Post–Grateful Dead career[edit]
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stanley briefly served as the mixing engineer for Jefferson Starship while eking out an indigent livelihood through marijuana cultivation in Marin County. A naturalized Australian citizen since 1996, Stanley lived with his wife Sheilah in the bush of Tropical North Queensland, where he worked to create sculpture, much of it wearable art. Due to his anticipation of a "thermal cataclysm"[20] related to climate change, he began to spend much of his time in Australia in 1982 while frequently returning to the United States to sell his jewelry (which commanded high prices) on Grateful Dead tours, where he retained backstage access; during this period, his clientele included such luminaries as Keith Richards.[2]
Stanley made his first public appearance in decades at the Australian ethnobotanical conference Entheogenesis Australis in 2009, giving three talks during his time in Melbourne.[21][permanent dead link]
Death[edit]



Wikinews has related news: Owsley Stanley, icon of 1960s counterculture, dies at 76


Stanley died after a car accident in Australia on Saturday, March 12, 2011,[4] not Sunday, March 13, as reported in most publications[6][7][8][22][23] (a widely propagated error stemming from the Monday release to the press of the initial family statement, which was written on Sunday, stating he "died yesterday"). The statement released on behalf of Stanley's family said the car crash occurred near his home, on a rural stretch of highway near Mareeba, Queensland. He was survived by his wife Sheilah, four children, eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
"The Owsley Stanley Foundation" was created by Owsley's immediate family and some of his close friends, and was incorporated on August 25, 2011 as a California non-profit corporation dedicated to fostering diverse charitable, artistic, musical, and scientific endeavors for the public benefit.[24]
His ashes were placed on the soundboard at the Grateful Dead 50th anniversary shows in Chicago, on July 3–5, 2015.[25]
In popular culture[edit]
In literature[edit]

Owsley's association with Ken Kesey and the Grateful dead is described in Tom Wolfe's novel The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test (1968).
Stanley's incarceration is lamented in Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971) as one of the many signs of the death of the 1960s.[26]
In Steve Hillard's novel Mirkwood: A Novel About JRR Tolkien (2011), a fictional character named Osley modeled loosely after Stanley is described as a fugitive from the 1960s and the "Henry Ford of Psychedelics".

In music[edit]

A newspaper headline identifying Stanley as an "LSD Millionaire" ran in the Los Angeles Times the day before the state of California, on October 6, 1966, criminalized the drug. The headline inspired the Grateful Dead song, "Alice D. Millionaire".[13]
Stanley is mentioned by his first name in the song "Who Needs the Peace Corps?" by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, which first appeared on the band's album We're Only in It for the Money (1968) ("I'll go to Frisco, buy a wig and sleep on Owsley's floor.").[27][28][29][30][31][32]
Stanley is referred to in Jefferson Airplane's song "Mexico" on the Early Flight (1974) album.
The Steely Dan song "Kid Charlemagne", from the album The Royal Scam (1976), is loosely based on Stanley.[33][34][35][36]

Owsley Stanley (born Augustus Owsley Stanley III, January 19, 1935 – March 12, 2011) was an American audio engineer and chemist. He was a key figure in the San Francisco Bay Area hippie movement during the 1960s and played a pivotal role in the counterculture of the 1960s. Under the professional name Bear, he was the soundman for the rock band the Grateful Dead, whom he met when Ken Kesey invited them to an Acid Test party. As their sound engineer, Stanley frequently recorded live tapes behind his mixing board, designed their trademark skull logo,[1] and developed their Wall of Sound sound system, one of the largest mobile public address systems ever constructed.
Stanley was the first private individual to manufacture mass quantities of LSD.[2][3][4] By his own account, between 1965 and 1967, Stanley produced no less than 500 grams of LSD, amounting to a little more than five million doses at the time.[5]
Stanley died in a car accident in Australia, on March 12, 2011.[4][6][7]

Ancestry[edit]
Stanley was the son of a political family from Kentucky. His father was a government attorney. His grandfather, A. Owsley Stanley, a member of the United States Senate after serving as Governor of Kentucky and in the U.S. House of Representatives, campaigned against Prohibition in the 1920s.[4]
Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
At an early age, he committed himself to St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C.[8] He studied engineering at the University of Virginia before dropping out.[9] In 1956 when Stanley was 21, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and served for 18 months before being discharged in 1958. Later, inspired by a 1958 performance of the Bolshoi Ballet, he studied ballet in Los Angeles, supporting himself for a time as a professional dancer.[10] In 1963, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became involved in the psychoactive drug scene. He dropped out after a semester, took a technical job at KGO-TV, and began producing LSD in a small lab located in the bathroom of a house near campus; his makeshift laboratory was raided by police on February 21, 1965. He beat the charges and successfully sued for the return of his equipment. The police were looking for methamphetamine but found only LSD,[citation needed] which was not illegal at the time.
Stanley moved to Los Angeles to pursue the production of LSD. He used his Berkeley lab to buy 500 grams of lysergic acid monohydrate, the basis for LSD. His first shipment arrived on March 30, 1965 and he produced 300,000 hits (270 micrograms each) of LSD by May 1965; then he returned to the Bay Area.
In September 1965, Stanley became the primary LSD supplier to Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. By this time, Sandoz LSD was hard to come by, and "Owsley Acid" had become the new standard.[citation needed] He was featured (most prominently his freak-out at the Muir Beach Acid Test in November 1965) in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (1968), Tom Wolfe's book detailing the history of Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. Stanley attended the Watts Acid Test on February 12, 1966 with his new apprentice Tim Scully, and provided the LSD.
Stanley also provided LSD to the Beatles during filming of Magical Mystery Tour (1967),[11] and former Three Dog Night singer Chuck Negron has noted that Owsley and Leary gave Negron's band free LSD.[12]
Involvement with the Grateful Dead[edit]
Stanley met the members of the Grateful Dead during 1965.[13] He both financed them and worked with them as their first soundman.[14] Along with his close friend Bob Thomas, Stanley designed the Lightning Bolt Skull Logo.[1] The lightning bolt design came to him after seeing a similar design on a roadside advertisement: "One day in the rain, I looked out the side and saw a sign along the freeway which was a circle with a white bar across it. The top of the circle was orange, and the bottom blue. I couldn't read the name of the firm, and so was just looking at the shape. A thought occurred to me: if the orange were red and the bar across were a lightning bolt cutting across at an angle, then we would have a very nice, unique and highly identifiable mark to put on the equipment."[1]
During his time as the sound engineer for the Grateful Dead, Stanley started what became the long-term practice of recording the Dead while they rehearsed and performed. His initial motivation for creating what he dubbed his "sonic journal" was to improve his ability to mix the sound,[citation needed] but the fortuitous result was an extensive trove of recordings from the heyday of the San Francisco concert/dance scene in the mid-1960s.
In addition to his large archive of Dead performances, Stanley made numerous live recordings of other leading 1960s and 1970s artists appearing in San Francisco, including Quicksilver Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane, early Jefferson Starship, Old and in the Way, Janis Joplin, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Taj Mahal, Santana, Miles Davis, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, and Blue Cheer.[6]
Richmond LSD lab[edit]
Stanley and Scully built electronic equipment for the Grateful Dead until late spring 1966. At this point, Stanley rented a house in Point Richmond, Richmond, California. He, Scully, and Melissa Cargill (Stanley's girlfriend and a skilled chemist, introduced to Stanley by Susan Cowper, a former girlfriend) set up a lab in the basement. The Point Richmond lab turned out more than 300,000 tablets (270 micrograms each) of LSD, dubbed "White Lightning". When LSD became illegal in California on October 6, 1966, Scully decided to set up a new lab in Denver, Colorado. The new lab was set up in the basement of a house across the street from the Denver Zoo in early 1967.[citation needed]
Legal trouble and continued involvement with the Grateful Dead[edit]
STP was distributed in the summer of 1967 in 20 mg tablets and quickly acquired a bad reputation (later research in normal volunteers showed that 20 mg was over six times the dose required to produce hallucinogenic effects, and its slow onset of action may have caused street users to take even more than a single tablet).[15] Stanley and Scully made trial batches of STP in 10 mg tablets and then of STP mixed with LSD in a few hundred yellow tablets, but soon ceased production of STP. Stanley and Scully produced about 196 grams of LSD in 1967, but 96 grams of this was confiscated by the police.
In late 1967, Stanley's La Espiral, Orinda lab was raided by police; he was found in possession of 350,000 doses of LSD and 1,500 doses of STP. His defense was that the illegal substances were for personal use, but he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison. The same year, Stanley officially shortened his name to "Owsley Stanley". After he was released from prison, Stanley resumed working for the Grateful Dead as their live sound engineer. On January 31, 1970, at 3:00 am, 19 members of the Grateful Dead and crew were arrested for possession of a variety of drugs at a French Quarter hotel, after returning from a concert at "The Warehouse" in New Orleans.
According to Rolling Stone,[16] everyone in the band except Ron "Pigpen" McKernan and Tom Constanten - neither of whom used psychedelic drugs - was included in the arrest, along with several members of their retinue, including Stanley and some locals. Stanley was charged with illegal possession of narcotics, dangerous non-narcotics, LSD, and barbiturates. Another West Coast–based rock band, Jefferson Airplane, had been arrested two weeks earlier in the same situation. According to an article in the Baton Rouge State Times, Stanley identified himself to the police as "The King of Acid" and technician of the band. The 1970 Grateful Dead song "Truckin'" is based on the incident ("Busted, down on Bourbon Street / Set up, like a bowling pin / Knocked down, it gets to wearing thin / They just won't let you be").[17]
Stanley was confined to federal prison from 1970 to 1972, after a federal judge intervened and revoked his release from the 1967 case. Stanley took advantage of the opportunity there to learn the trade of metalwork and jewelry-making.[4]
Immediately following his release, Stanley resumed working for the Grateful Dead as a roadie and sound engineer in the summer of 1972. As much of his portfolio had been delegated to as many as four sound engineers during his prison sentence, he struggled to regain his past influence among the band and support staff. In a later interview with Dennis McNally, he opined that he received "just a taste" of his previous position; according to Stanley, "I found on my release from jail that the crew, most of whom had been hired in my absence, did not want anything changed. No improvements for the sound, no new gear, nothing different on stage. They wanted to maintain the same old same old which under their limited abilities, they had memorized to the point where they could sleepwalk through shows. Bob Matthews, who had been mixing since my departure, did not want to completely relinquish the mixing desk, which was a total pain in the ass for me, since he was basically a studio engineer and no match for my live mixing ability." The situation was exacerbated by his disdain for the coarse language and deleterious drugs (most notably alcohol and cocaine) favored by the band's physically imposing roadies, many of whom perceived themselves as "macho cowboys" in contrast to Stanley's diminutive stature and erudite mien.
The tensions culminated in a logistical mishap at a October 1972 concert at Vanderbilt University when students recruited by Stanley to deputize for an absentee Matthews absconded with half of the band's PA system, resulting in a fellow employee throwing Stanley into a water cooler. The altercation led Stanley to request the formal codification of his perceived managerial power over the equipment staff, including unprecedented hire/fire privileges.[18]
Although Stanley stopped touring with the band following their refusal of his demands, he continued to be employed by the Grateful Dead through their 1975 hiatus in a more diaphanous capacity. During this period, he served as lead designer of the band's Wall of Sound PA system and assisted Phil Lesh in salvaging the technically deficient recordings assembled for Steal Your Face (1976), a poorly-received live album culled from the final October 1974 pre-hiatus shows at Winterland Ballroom.[19]
Post–Grateful Dead career[edit]
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stanley briefly served as the mixing engineer for Jefferson Starship while eking out an indigent livelihood through marijuana cultivation in Marin County. A naturalized Australian citizen since 1996, Stanley lived with his wife Sheilah in the bush of Tropical North Queensland, where he worked to create sculpture, much of it wearable art. Due to his anticipation of a "thermal cataclysm"[20] related to climate change, he began to spend much of his time in Australia in 1982 while frequently returning to the United States to sell his jewelry (which commanded high prices) on Grateful Dead tours, where he retained backstage access; during this period, his clientele included such luminaries as Keith Richards.[2]
Stanley made his first public appearance in decades at the Australian ethnobotanical conference Entheogenesis Australis in 2009, giving three talks during his time in Melbourne.[21][permanent dead link]
Death[edit]



Wikinews has related news: Owsley Stanley, icon of 1960s counterculture, dies at 76


Stanley died after a car accident in Australia on Saturday, March 12, 2011,[4] not Sunday, March 13, as reported in most publications[6][7][8][22][23] (a widely propagated error stemming from the Monday release to the press of the initial family statement, which was written on Sunday, stating he "died yesterday"). The statement released on behalf of Stanley's family said the car crash occurred near his home, on a rural stretch of highway near Mareeba, Queensland. He was survived by his wife Sheilah, four children, eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
"The Owsley Stanley Foundation" was created by Owsley's immediate family and some of his close friends, and was incorporated on August 25, 2011 as a California non-profit corporation dedicated to fostering diverse charitable, artistic, musical, and scientific endeavors for the public benefit.[24]
His ashes were placed on the soundboard at the Grateful Dead 50th anniversary shows in Chicago, on July 3–5, 2015.[25]
In popular culture[edit]
In literature[edit]

Owsley's association with Ken Kesey and the Grateful dead is described in Tom Wolfe's novel The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test (1968).
Stanley's incarceration is lamented in Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971) as one of the many signs of the death of the 1960s.[26]
In Steve Hillard's novel Mirkwood: A Novel About JRR Tolkien (2011), a fictional character named Osley modeled loosely after Stanley is described as a fugitive from the 1960s and the "Henry Ford of Psychedelics".

In music[edit]

A newspaper headline identifying Stanley as an "LSD Millionaire" ran in the Los Angeles Times the day before the state of California, on October 6, 1966, criminalized the drug. The headline inspired the Grateful Dead song, "Alice D. Millionaire".[13]
Stanley is mentioned by his first name in the song "Who Needs the Peace Corps?" by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, which first appeared on the band's album We're Only in It for the Money (1968) ("I'll go to Frisco, buy a wig and sleep on Owsley's floor.").[27][28][29][30][31][32]
Stanley is referred to in Jefferson Airplane's song "Mexico" on the Early Flight (1974) album.
The Steely Dan song "Kid Charlemagne", from the album The Royal Scam (1976), is loosely based on Stanley.[33][34][35][36]

Owsley Stanley (born Augustus Owsley Stanley III, January 19, 1935 – March 12, 2011) was an American audio engineer and chemist. He was a key figure in the San Francisco Bay Area hippie movement during the 1960s and played a pivotal role in the counterculture of the 1960s. Under the professional name Bear, he was the soundman for the rock band the Grateful Dead, whom he met when Ken Kesey invited them to an Acid Test party. As their sound engineer, Stanley frequently recorded live tapes behind his mixing board, designed their trademark skull logo,[1] and developed their Wall of Sound sound system, one of the largest mobile public address systems ever constructed.
Stanley was the first private individual to manufacture mass quantities of LSD.[2][3][4] By his own account, between 1965 and 1967, Stanley produced no less than 500 grams of LSD, amounting to a little more than five million doses at the time.[5]
Stanley died in a car accident in Australia, on March 12, 2011.[4][6][7]

Ancestry[edit]
Stanley was the son of a political family from Kentucky. His father was a government attorney. His grandfather, A. Owsley Stanley, a member of the United States Senate after serving as Governor of Kentucky and in the U.S. House of Representatives, campaigned against Prohibition in the 1920s.[4]
Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
At an early age, he committed himself to St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C.[8] He studied engineering at the University of Virginia before dropping out.[9] In 1956 when Stanley was 21, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and served for 18 months before being discharged in 1958. Later, inspired by a 1958 performance of the Bolshoi Ballet, he studied ballet in Los Angeles, supporting himself for a time as a professional dancer.[10] In 1963, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became involved in the psychoactive drug scene. He dropped out after a semester, took a technical job at KGO-TV, and began producing LSD in a small lab located in the bathroom of a house near campus; his makeshift laboratory was raided by police on February 21, 1965. He beat the charges and successfully sued for the return of his equipment. The police were looking for methamphetamine but found only LSD,[citation needed] which was not illegal at the time.
Stanley moved to Los Angeles to pursue the production of LSD. He used his Berkeley lab to buy 500 grams of lysergic acid monohydrate, the basis for LSD. His first shipment arrived on March 30, 1965 and he produced 300,000 hits (270 micrograms each) of LSD by May 1965; then he returned to the Bay Area.
In September 1965, Stanley became the primary LSD supplier to Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. By this time, Sandoz LSD was hard to come by, and "Owsley Acid" had become the new standard.[citation needed] He was featured (most prominently his freak-out at the Muir Beach Acid Test in November 1965) in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (1968), Tom Wolfe's book detailing the history of Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. Stanley attended the Watts Acid Test on February 12, 1966 with his new apprentice Tim Scully, and provided the LSD.
Stanley also provided LSD to the Beatles during filming of Magical Mystery Tour (1967),[11] and former Three Dog Night singer Chuck Negron has noted that Owsley and Leary gave Negron's band free LSD.[12]
Involvement with the Grateful Dead[edit]
Stanley met the members of the Grateful Dead during 1965.[13] He both financed them and worked with them as their first soundman.[14] Along with his close friend Bob Thomas, Stanley designed the Lightning Bolt Skull Logo.[1] The lightning bolt design came to him after seeing a similar design on a roadside advertisement: "One day in the rain, I looked out the side and saw a sign along the freeway which was a circle with a white bar across it. The top of the circle was orange, and the bottom blue. I couldn't read the name of the firm, and so was just looking at the shape. A thought occurred to me: if the orange were red and the bar across were a lightning bolt cutting across at an angle, then we would have a very nice, unique and highly identifiable mark to put on the equipment."[1]
During his time as the sound engineer for the Grateful Dead, Stanley started what became the long-term practice of recording the Dead while they rehearsed and performed. His initial motivation for creating what he dubbed his "sonic journal" was to improve his ability to mix the sound,[citation needed] but the fortuitous result was an extensive trove of recordings from the heyday of the San Francisco concert/dance scene in the mid-1960s.
In addition to his large archive of Dead performances, Stanley made numerous live recordings of other leading 1960s and 1970s artists appearing in San Francisco, including Quicksilver Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane, early Jefferson Starship, Old and in the Way, Janis Joplin, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Taj Mahal, Santana, Miles Davis, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, and Blue Cheer.[6]
Richmond LSD lab[edit]
Stanley and Scully built electronic equipment for the Grateful Dead until late spring 1966. At this point, Stanley rented a house in Point Richmond, Richmond, California. He, Scully, and Melissa Cargill (Stanley's girlfriend and a skilled chemist, introduced to Stanley by Susan Cowper, a former girlfriend) set up a lab in the basement. The Point Richmond lab turned out more than 300,000 tablets (270 micrograms each) of LSD, dubbed "White Lightning". When LSD became illegal in California on October 6, 1966, Scully decided to set up a new lab in Denver, Colorado. The new lab was set up in the basement of a house across the street from the Denver Zoo in early 1967.[citation needed]
Legal trouble and continued involvement with the Grateful Dead[edit]
STP was distributed in the summer of 1967 in 20 mg tablets and quickly acquired a bad reputation (later research in normal volunteers showed that 20 mg was over six times the dose required to produce hallucinogenic effects, and its slow onset of action may have caused street users to take even more than a single tablet).[15] Stanley and Scully made trial batches of STP in 10 mg tablets and then of STP mixed with LSD in a few hundred yellow tablets, but soon ceased production of STP. Stanley and Scully produced about 196 grams of LSD in 1967, but 96 grams of this was confiscated by the police.
In late 1967, Stanley's La Espiral, Orinda lab was raided by police; he was found in possession of 350,000 doses of LSD and 1,500 doses of STP. His defense was that the illegal substances were for personal use, but he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison. The same year, Stanley officially shortened his name to "Owsley Stanley". After he was released from prison, Stanley resumed working for the Grateful Dead as their live sound engineer. On January 31, 1970, at 3:00 am, 19 members of the Grateful Dead and crew were arrested for possession of a variety of drugs at a French Quarter hotel, after returning from a concert at "The Warehouse" in New Orleans.
According to Rolling Stone,[16] everyone in the band except Ron "Pigpen" McKernan and Tom Constanten - neither of whom used psychedelic drugs - was included in the arrest, along with several members of their retinue, including Stanley and some locals. Stanley was charged with illegal possession of narcotics, dangerous non-narcotics, LSD, and barbiturates. Another West Coast–based rock band, Jefferson Airplane, had been arrested two weeks earlier in the same situation. According to an article in the Baton Rouge State Times, Stanley identified himself to the police as "The King of Acid" and technician of the band. The 1970 Grateful Dead song "Truckin'" is based on the incident ("Busted, down on Bourbon Street / Set up, like a bowling pin / Knocked down, it gets to wearing thin / They just won't let you be").[17]
Stanley was confined to federal prison from 1970 to 1972, after a federal judge intervened and revoked his release from the 1967 case. Stanley took advantage of the opportunity there to learn the trade of metalwork and jewelry-making.[4]
Immediately following his release, Stanley resumed working for the Grateful Dead as a roadie and sound engineer in the summer of 1972. As much of his portfolio had been delegated to as many as four sound engineers during his prison sentence, he struggled to regain his past influence among the band and support staff. In a later interview with Dennis McNally, he opined that he received "just a taste" of his previous position; according to Stanley, "I found on my release from jail that the crew, most of whom had been hired in my absence, did not want anything changed. No improvements for the sound, no new gear, nothing different on stage. They wanted to maintain the same old same old which under their limited abilities, they had memorized to the point where they could sleepwalk through shows. Bob Matthews, who had been mixing since my departure, did not want to completely relinquish the mixing desk, which was a total pain in the ass for me, since he was basically a studio engineer and no match for my live mixing ability." The situation was exacerbated by his disdain for the coarse language and deleterious drugs (most notably alcohol and cocaine) favored by the band's physically imposing roadies, many of whom perceived themselves as "macho cowboys" in contrast to Stanley's diminutive stature and erudite mien.
The tensions culminated in a logistical mishap at a October 1972 concert at Vanderbilt University when students recruited by Stanley to deputize for an absentee Matthews absconded with half of the band's PA system, resulting in a fellow employee throwing Stanley into a water cooler. The altercation led Stanley to request the formal codification of his perceived managerial power over the equipment staff, including unprecedented hire/fire privileges.[18]
Although Stanley stopped touring with the band following their refusal of his demands, he continued to be employed by the Grateful Dead through their 1975 hiatus in a more diaphanous capacity. During this period, he served as lead designer of the band's Wall of Sound PA system and assisted Phil Lesh in salvaging the technically deficient recordings assembled for Steal Your Face (1976), a poorly-received live album culled from the final October 1974 pre-hiatus shows at Winterland Ballroom.[19]
Post–Grateful Dead career[edit]
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stanley briefly served as the mixing engineer for Jefferson Starship while eking out an indigent livelihood through marijuana cultivation in Marin County. A naturalized Australian citizen since 1996, Stanley lived with his wife Sheilah in the bush of Tropical North Queensland, where he worked to create sculpture, much of it wearable art. Due to his anticipation of a "thermal cataclysm"[20] related to climate change, he began to spend much of his time in Australia in 1982 while frequently returning to the United States to sell his jewelry (which commanded high prices) on Grateful Dead tours, where he retained backstage access; during this period, his clientele included such luminaries as Keith Richards.[2]
Stanley made his first public appearance in decades at the Australian ethnobotanical conference Entheogenesis Australis in 2009, giving three talks during his time in Melbourne.[21][permanent dead link]

Stanley is mentioned by his first name in the song "Who Needs the Peace Corps?" by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, which first appeared on the band's album We're Only in It for the Money (1968) ("I'll go to Frisco, buy a wig and sleep on Owsley's floor.").[27][28][29][30][31][32]
Stanley is referred to in Jefferson Airplane's song "Mexico" on the Early Flight (1974) album.
The Steely Dan song "Kid Charlemagne", from the album The Royal Scam (1976), is loosely based on Stanley.[33][34][35][36]

Owsley Stanley (born Augustus Owsley Stanley III, January 19, 1935 – March 12, 2011) was an American audio engineer and chemist. He was a key figure in the San Francisco Bay Area hippie movement during the 1960s and played a pivotal role in the counterculture of the 1960s. Under the professional name Bear, he was the soundman for the rock band the Grateful Dead, whom he met when Ken Kesey invited them to an Acid Test party. As their sound engineer, Stanley frequently recorded live tapes behind his mixing board, designed their trademark skull logo,[1] and developed their Wall of Sound sound system, one of the largest mobile public address systems ever constructed.
Stanley was the first private individual to manufacture mass quantities of LSD.[2][3][4] By his own account, between 1965 and 1967, Stanley produced no less than 500 grams of LSD, amounting to a little more than five million doses at the time.[5]
Stanley died in a car accident in Australia, on March 12, 2011.[4][6][7]

Ancestry[edit]
Stanley was the son of a political family from Kentucky. His father was a government attorney. His grandfather, A. Owsley Stanley, a member of the United States Senate after serving as Governor of Kentucky and in the U.S. House of Representatives, campaigned against Prohibition in the 1920s.[4]
Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
At an early age, he committed himself to St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C.[8] He studied engineering at the University of Virginia before dropping out.[9] In 1956 when Stanley was 21, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and served for 18 months before being discharged in 1958. Later, inspired by a 1958 performance of the Bolshoi Ballet, he studied ballet in Los Angeles, supporting himself for a time as a professional dancer.[10] In 1963, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became involved in the psychoactive drug scene. He dropped out after a semester, took a technical job at KGO-TV, and began producing LSD in a small lab located in the bathroom of a house near campus; his makeshift laboratory was raided by police on February 21, 1965. He beat the charges and successfully sued for the return of his equipment. The police were looking for methamphetamine but found only LSD,[citation needed] which was not illegal at the time.
Stanley moved to Los Angeles to pursue the production of LSD. He used his Berkeley lab to buy 500 grams of lysergic acid monohydrate, the basis for LSD. His first shipment arrived on March 30, 1965 and he produced 300,000 hits (270 micrograms each) of LSD by May 1965; then he returned to the Bay Area.
In September 1965, Stanley became the primary LSD supplier to Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. By this time, Sandoz LSD was hard to come by, and "Owsley Acid" had become the new standard.[citation needed] He was featured (most prominently his freak-out at the Muir Beach Acid Test in November 1965) in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (1968), Tom Wolfe's book detailing the history of Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. Stanley attended the Watts Acid Test on February 12, 1966 with his new apprentice Tim Scully, and provided the LSD.
Stanley also provided LSD to the Beatles during filming of Magical Mystery Tour (1967),[11] and former Three Dog Night singer Chuck Negron has noted that Owsley and Leary gave Negron's band free LSD.[12]
Involvement with the Grateful Dead[edit]
Stanley met the members of the Grateful Dead during 1965.[13] He both financed them and worked with them as their first soundman.[14] Along with his close friend Bob Thomas, Stanley designed the Lightning Bolt Skull Logo.[1] The lightning bolt design came to him after seeing a similar design on a roadside advertisement: "One day in the rain, I looked out the side and saw a sign along the freeway which was a circle with a white bar across it. The top of the circle was orange, and the bottom blue. I couldn't read the name of the firm, and so was just looking at the shape. A thought occurred to me: if the orange were red and the bar across were a lightning bolt cutting across at an angle, then we would have a very nice, unique and highly identifiable mark to put on the equipment."[1]
During his time as the sound engineer for the Grateful Dead, Stanley started what became the long-term practice of recording the Dead while they rehearsed and performed. His initial motivation for creating what he dubbed his "sonic journal" was to improve his ability to mix the sound,[citation needed] but the fortuitous result was an extensive trove of recordings from the heyday of the San Francisco concert/dance scene in the mid-1960s.
In addition to his large archive of Dead performances, Stanley made numerous live recordings of other leading 1960s and 1970s artists appearing in San Francisco, including Quicksilver Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane, early Jefferson Starship, Old and in the Way, Janis Joplin, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Taj Mahal, Santana, Miles Davis, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, and Blue Cheer.[6]
Richmond LSD lab[edit]
Stanley and Scully built electronic equipment for the Grateful Dead until late spring 1966. At this point, Stanley rented a house in Point Richmond, Richmond, California. He, Scully, and Melissa Cargill (Stanley's girlfriend and a skilled chemist, introduced to Stanley by Susan Cowper, a former girlfriend) set up a lab in the basement. The Point Richmond lab turned out more than 300,000 tablets (270 micrograms each) of LSD, dubbed "White Lightning". When LSD became illegal in California on October 6, 1966, Scully decided to set up a new lab in Denver, Colorado. The new lab was set up in the basement of a house across the street from the Denver Zoo in early 1967.[citation needed]
Legal trouble and continued involvement with the Grateful Dead[edit]
STP was distributed in the summer of 1967 in 20 mg tablets and quickly acquired a bad reputation (later research in normal volunteers showed that 20 mg was over six times the dose required to produce hallucinogenic effects, and its slow onset of action may have caused street users to take even more than a single tablet).[15] Stanley and Scully made trial batches of STP in 10 mg tablets and then of STP mixed with LSD in a few hundred yellow tablets, but soon ceased production of STP. Stanley and Scully produced about 196 grams of LSD in 1967, but 96 grams of this was confiscated by the police.
In late 1967, Stanley's La Espiral, Orinda lab was raided by police; he was found in possession of 350,000 doses of LSD and 1,500 doses of STP. His defense was that the illegal substances were for personal use, but he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison. The same year, Stanley officially shortened his name to "Owsley Stanley". After he was released from prison, Stanley resumed working for the Grateful Dead as their live sound engineer. On January 31, 1970, at 3:00 am, 19 members of the Grateful Dead and crew were arrested for possession of a variety of drugs at a French Quarter hotel, after returning from a concert at "The Warehouse" in New Orleans.
According to Rolling Stone,[16] everyone in the band except Ron "Pigpen" McKernan and Tom Constanten - neither of whom used psychedelic drugs - was included in the arrest, along with several members of their retinue, including Stanley and some locals. Stanley was charged with illegal possession of narcotics, dangerous non-narcotics, LSD, and barbiturates. Another West Coast–based rock band, Jefferson Airplane, had been arrested two weeks earlier in the same situation. According to an article in the Baton Rouge State Times, Stanley identified himself to the police as "The King of Acid" and technician of the band. The 1970 Grateful Dead song "Truckin'" is based on the incident ("Busted, down on Bourbon Street / Set up, like a bowling pin / Knocked down, it gets to wearing thin / They just won't let you be").[17]
Stanley was confined to federal prison from 1970 to 1972, after a federal judge intervened and revoked his release from the 1967 case. Stanley took advantage of the opportunity there to learn the trade of metalwork and jewelry-making.[4]
Immediately following his release, Stanley resumed working for the Grateful Dead as a roadie and sound engineer in the summer of 1972. As much of his portfolio had been delegated to as many as four sound engineers during his prison sentence, he struggled to regain his past influence among the band and support staff. In a later interview with Dennis McNally, he opined that he received "just a taste" of his previous position; according to Stanley, "I found on my release from jail that the crew, most of whom had been hired in my absence, did not want anything changed. No improvements for the sound, no new gear, nothing different on stage. They wanted to maintain the same old same old which under their limited abilities, they had memorized to the point where they could sleepwalk through shows. Bob Matthews, who had been mixing since my departure, did not want to completely relinquish the mixing desk, which was a total pain in the ass for me, since he was basically a studio engineer and no match for my live mixing ability." The situation was exacerbated by his disdain for the coarse language and deleterious drugs (most notably alcohol and cocaine) favored by the band's physically imposing roadies, many of whom perceived themselves as "macho cowboys" in contrast to Stanley's diminutive stature and erudite mien.
The tensions culminated in a logistical mishap at a October 1972 concert at Vanderbilt University when students recruited by Stanley to deputize for an absentee Matthews absconded with half of the band's PA system, resulting in a fellow employee throwing Stanley into a water cooler. The altercation led Stanley to request the formal codification of his perceived managerial power over the equipment staff, including unprecedented hire/fire privileges.[18]
Although Stanley stopped touring with the band following their refusal of his demands, he continued to be employed by the Grateful Dead through their 1975 hiatus in a more diaphanous capacity. During this period, he served as lead designer of the band's Wall of Sound PA system and assisted Phil Lesh in salvaging the technically deficient recordings assembled for Steal Your Face (1976), a poorly-received live album culled from the final October 1974 pre-hiatus shows at Winterland Ballroom.[19]
Post–Grateful Dead career[edit]
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stanley briefly served as the mixing engineer for Jefferson Starship while eking out an indigent livelihood through marijuana cultivation in Marin County. A naturalized Australian citizen since 1996, Stanley lived with his wife Sheilah in the bush of Tropical North Queensland, where he worked to create sculpture, much of it wearable art. Due to his anticipation of a "thermal cataclysm"[20] related to climate change, he began to spend much of his time in Australia in 1982 while frequently returning to the United States to sell his jewelry (which commanded high prices) on Grateful Dead tours, where he retained backstage access; during this period, his clientele included such luminaries as Keith Richards.[2]
Stanley made his first public appearance in decades at the Australian ethnobotanical conference Entheogenesis Australis in 2009, giving three talks during his time in Melbourne.[21][permanent dead link]
Death[edit]



Wikinews has related news: Owsley Stanley, icon of 1960s counterculture, dies at 76


Stanley died after a car accident in Australia on Saturday, March 12, 2011,[4] not Sunday, March 13, as reported in most publications[6][7][8][22][23] (a widely propagated error stemming from the Monday release to the press of the initial family statement, which was written on Sunday, stating he "died yesterday"). The statement released on behalf of Stanley's family said the car crash occurred near his home, on a rural stretch of highway near Mareeba, Queensland. He was survived by his wife Sheilah, four children, eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
"The Owsley Stanley Foundation" was created by Owsley's immediate family and some of his close friends, and was incorporated on August 25, 2011 as a California non-profit corporation dedicated to fostering diverse charitable, artistic, musical, and scientific endeavors for the public benefit.[24]
His ashes were placed on the soundboard at the Grateful Dead 50th anniversary shows in Chicago, on July 3–5, 2015.[25]
In popular culture[edit]
In literature[edit]

Owsley's association with Ken Kesey and the Grateful dead is described in Tom Wolfe's novel The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test (1968).
Stanley's incarceration is lamented in Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971) as one of the many signs of the death of the 1960s.[26]
In Steve Hillard's novel Mirkwood: A Novel About JRR Tolkien (2011), a fictional character named Osley modeled loosely after Stanley is described as a fugitive from the 1960s and the "Henry Ford of Psychedelics".

In music[edit]

A newspaper headline identifying Stanley as an "LSD Millionaire" ran in the Los Angeles Times the day before the state of California, on October 6, 1966, criminalized the drug. The headline inspired the Grateful Dead song, "Alice D. Millionaire".[13]
Stanley is mentioned by his first name in the song "Who Needs the Peace Corps?" by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, which first appeared on the band's album We're Only in It for the Money (1968) ("I'll go to Frisco, buy a wig and sleep on Owsley's floor.").[27][28][29][30][31][32]
Stanley is referred to in Jefferson Airplane's song "Mexico" on the Early Flight (1974) album.
The Steely Dan song "Kid Charlemagne", from the album The Royal Scam (1976), is loosely based on Stanley.[33][34][35][36]

Owsley Stanley (born Augustus Owsley Stanley III, January 19, 1935 – March 12, 2011) was an American audio engineer and chemist. He was a key figure in the San Francisco Bay Area hippie movement during the 1960s and played a pivotal role in the counterculture of the 1960s. Under the professional name Bear, he was the soundman for the rock band the Grateful Dead, whom he met when Ken Kesey invited them to an Acid Test party. As their sound engineer, Stanley frequently recorded live tapes behind his mixing board, designed their trademark skull logo,[1] and developed their Wall of Sound sound system, one of the largest mobile public address systems ever constructed.
Stanley was the first private individual to manufacture mass quantities of LSD.[2][3][4] By his own account, between 1965 and 1967, Stanley produced no less than 500 grams of LSD, amounting to a little more than five million doses at the time.[5]
Stanley died in a car accident in Australia, on March 12, 2011.[4][6][7]

Ancestry[edit]
Stanley was the son of a political family from Kentucky. His father was a government attorney. His grandfather, A. Owsley Stanley, a member of the United States Senate after serving as Governor of Kentucky and in the U.S. House of Representatives, campaigned against Prohibition in the 1920s.[4]
Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
At an early age, he committed himself to St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C.[8] He studied engineering at the University of Virginia before dropping out.[9] In 1956 when Stanley was 21, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and served for 18 months before being discharged in 1958. Later, inspired by a 1958 performance of the Bolshoi Ballet, he studied ballet in Los Angeles, supporting himself for a time as a professional dancer.[10] In 1963, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became involved in the psychoactive drug scene. He dropped out after a semester, took a technical job at KGO-TV, and began producing LSD in a small lab located in the bathroom of a house near campus; his makeshift laboratory was raided by police on February 21, 1965. He beat the charges and successfully sued for the return of his equipment. The police were looking for methamphetamine but found only LSD,[citation needed] which was not illegal at the time.
Stanley moved to Los Angeles to pursue the production of LSD. He used his Berkeley lab to buy 500 grams of lysergic acid monohydrate, the basis for LSD. His first shipment arrived on March 30, 1965 and he produced 300,000 hits (270 micrograms each) of LSD by May 1965; then he returned to the Bay Area.
In September 1965, Stanley became the primary LSD supplier to Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. By this time, Sandoz LSD was hard to come by, and "Owsley Acid" had become the new standard.[citation needed] He was featured (most prominently his freak-out at the Muir Beach Acid Test in November 1965) in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (1968), Tom Wolfe's book detailing the history of Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. Stanley attended the Watts Acid Test on February 12, 1966 with his new apprentice Tim Scully, and provided the LSD.
Stanley also provided LSD to the Beatles during filming of Magical Mystery Tour (1967),[11] and former Three Dog Night singer Chuck Negron has noted that Owsley and Leary gave Negron's band free LSD.[12]
Involvement with the Grateful Dead[edit]
Stanley met the members of the Grateful Dead during 1965.[13] He both financed them and worked with them as their first soundman.[14] Along with his close friend Bob Thomas, Stanley designed the Lightning Bolt Skull Logo.[1] The lightning bolt design came to him after seeing a similar design on a roadside advertisement: "One day in the rain, I looked out the side and saw a sign along the freeway which was a circle with a white bar across it. The top of the circle was orange, and the bottom blue. I couldn't read the name of the firm, and so was just looking at the shape. A thought occurred to me: if the orange were red and the bar across were a lightning bolt cutting across at an angle, then we would have a very nice, unique and highly identifiable mark to put on the equipment."[1]
During his time as the sound engineer for the Grateful Dead, Stanley started what became the long-term practice of recording the Dead while they rehearsed and performed. His initial motivation for creating what he dubbed his "sonic journal" was to improve his ability to mix the sound,[citation needed] but the fortuitous result was an extensive trove of recordings from the heyday of the San Francisco concert/dance scene in the mid-1960s.
In addition to his large archive of Dead performances, Stanley made numerous live recordings of other leading 1960s and 1970s artists appearing in San Francisco, including Quicksilver Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane, early Jefferson Starship, Old and in the Way, Janis Joplin, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Taj Mahal, Santana, Miles Davis, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, and Blue Cheer.[6]
Richmond LSD lab[edit]
Stanley and Scully built electronic equipment for the Grateful Dead until late spring 1966. At this point, Stanley rented a house in Point Richmond, Richmond, California. He, Scully, and Melissa Cargill (Stanley's girlfriend and a skilled chemist, introduced to Stanley by Susan Cowper, a former girlfriend) set up a lab in the basement. The Point Richmond lab turned out more than 300,000 tablets (270 micrograms each) of LSD, dubbed "White Lightning". When LSD became illegal in California on October 6, 1966, Scully decided to set up a new lab in Denver, Colorado. The new lab was set up in the basement of a house across the street from the Denver Zoo in early 1967.[citation needed]
Legal trouble and continued involvement with the Grateful Dead[edit]
STP was distributed in the summer of 1967 in 20 mg tablets and quickly acquired a bad reputation (later research in normal volunteers showed that 20 mg was over six times the dose required to produce hallucinogenic effects, and its slow onset of action may have caused street users to take even more than a single tablet).[15] Stanley and Scully made trial batches of STP in 10 mg tablets and then of STP mixed with LSD in a few hundred yellow tablets, but soon ceased production of STP. Stanley and Scully produced about 196 grams of LSD in 1967, but 96 grams of this was confiscated by the police.
In late 1967, Stanley's La Espiral, Orinda lab was raided by police; he was found in possession of 350,000 doses of LSD and 1,500 doses of STP. His defense was that the illegal substances were for personal use, but he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison. The same year, Stanley officially shortened his name to "Owsley Stanley". After he was released from prison, Stanley resumed working for the Grateful Dead as their live sound engineer. On January 31, 1970, at 3:00 am, 19 members of the Grateful Dead and crew were arrested for possession of a variety of drugs at a French Quarter hotel, after returning from a concert at "The Warehouse" in New Orleans.
According to Rolling Stone,[16] everyone in the band except Ron "Pigpen" McKernan and Tom Constanten - neither of whom used psychedelic drugs - was included in the arrest, along with several members of their retinue, including Stanley and some locals. Stanley was charged with illegal possession of narcotics, dangerous non-narcotics, LSD, and barbiturates. Another West Coast–based rock band, Jefferson Airplane, had been arrested two weeks earlier in the same situation. According to an article in the Baton Rouge State Times, Stanley identified himself to the police as "The King of Acid" and technician of the band. The 1970 Grateful Dead song "Truckin'" is based on the incident ("Busted, down on Bourbon Street / Set up, like a bowling pin / Knocked down, it gets to wearing thin / They just won't let you be").[17]
Stanley was confined to federal prison from 1970 to 1972, after a federal judge intervened and revoked his release from the 1967 case. Stanley took advantage of the opportunity there to learn the trade of metalwork and jewelry-making.[4]
Immediately following his release, Stanley resumed working for the Grateful Dead as a roadie and sound engineer in the summer of 1972. As much of his portfolio had been delegated to as many as four sound engineers during his prison sentence, he struggled to regain his past influence among the band and support staff. In a later interview with Dennis McNally, he opined that he received "just a taste" of his previous position; according to Stanley, "I found on my release from jail that the crew, most of whom had been hired in my absence, did not want anything changed. No improvements for the sound, no new gear, nothing different on stage. They wanted to maintain the same old same old which under their limited abilities, they had memorized to the point where they could sleepwalk through shows. Bob Matthews, who had been mixing since my departure, did not want to completely relinquish the mixing desk, which was a total pain in the ass for me, since he was basically a studio engineer and no match for my live mixing ability." The situation was exacerbated by his disdain for the coarse language and deleterious drugs (most notably alcohol and cocaine) favored by the band's physically imposing roadies, many of whom perceived themselves as "macho cowboys" in contrast to Stanley's diminutive stature and erudite mien.
The tensions culminated in a logistical mishap at a October 1972 concert at Vanderbilt University when students recruited by Stanley to deputize for an absentee Matthews absconded with half of the band's PA system, resulting in a fellow employee throwing Stanley into a water cooler. The altercation led Stanley to request the formal codification of his perceived managerial power over the equipment staff, including unprecedented hire/fire privileges.[18]
Although Stanley stopped touring with the band following their refusal of his demands, he continued to be employed by the Grateful Dead through their 1975 hiatus in a more diaphanous capacity. During this period, he served as lead designer of the band's Wall of Sound PA system and assisted Phil Lesh in salvaging the technically deficient recordings assembled for Steal Your Face (1976), a poorly-received live album culled from the final October 1974 pre-hiatus shows at Winterland Ballroom.[19]
Post–Grateful Dead career[edit]
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stanley briefly served as the mixing engineer for Jefferson Starship while eking out an indigent livelihood through marijuana cultivation in Marin County. A naturalized Australian citizen since 1996, Stanley lived with his wife Sheilah in the bush of Tropical North Queensland, where he worked to create sculpture, much of it wearable art. Due to his anticipation of a "thermal cataclysm"[20] related to climate change, he began to spend much of his time in Australia in 1982 while frequently returning to the United States to sell his jewelry (which commanded high prices) on Grateful Dead tours, where he retained backstage access; during this period, his clientele included such luminaries as Keith Richards.[2]
Stanley made his first public appearance in decades at the Australian ethnobotanical conference Entheogenesis Australis in 2009, giving three talks during his time in Melbourne.[21][permanent dead link]
Death[edit]



Wikinews has related news: Owsley Stanley, icon of 1960s counterculture, dies at 76


Stanley died after a car accident in Australia on Saturday, March 12, 2011,[4] not Sunday, March 13, as reported in most publications[6][7][8][22][23] (a widely propagated error stemming from the Monday release to the press of the initial family statement, which was written on Sunday, stating he "died yesterday"). The statement released on behalf of Stanley's family said the car crash occurred near his home, on a rural stretch of highway near Mareeba, Queensland. He was survived by his wife Sheilah, four children, eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
"The Owsley Stanley Foundation" was created by Owsley's immediate family and some of his close friends, and was incorporated on August 25, 2011 as a California non-profit corporation dedicated to fostering diverse charitable, artistic, musical, and scientific endeavors for the public benefit.[24]
His ashes were placed on the soundboard at the Grateful Dead 50th anniversary shows in Chicago, on July 3–5, 2015.[25]
In popular culture[edit]
In literature[edit]

Owsley's association with Ken Kesey and the Grateful dead is described in Tom Wolfe's novel The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test (1968).
Stanley's incarceration is lamented in Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971) as one of the many signs of the death of the 1960s.[26]
In Steve Hillard's novel Mirkwood: A Novel About JRR Tolkien (2011), a fictional character named Osley modeled loosely after Stanley is described as a fugitive from the 1960s and the "Henry Ford of Psychedelics".

In music[edit]

A newspaper headline identifying Stanley as an "LSD Millionaire" ran in the Los Angeles Times the day before the state of California, on October 6, 1966, criminalized the drug. The headline inspired the Grateful Dead song, "Alice D. Millionaire".[13]
Stanley is mentioned by his first name in the song "Who Needs the Peace Corps?" by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, which first appeared on the band's album We're Only in It for the Money (1968) ("I'll go to Frisco, buy a wig and sleep on Owsley's floor.").[27][28][29][30][31][32]
Stanley is referred to in Jefferson Airplane's song "Mexico" on the Early Flight (1974) album.
The Steely Dan song "Kid Charlemagne", from the album The Royal Scam (1976), is loosely based on Stanley.[33][34][35][36]
