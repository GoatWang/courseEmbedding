Early life and education[edit]
Chiarelli was born in Seattle, Washington on March 23, 1950. He is a Distinguished Military Graduate of Seattle University Army ROTC. Chiarelli was commissioned a second lieutenant in September 1972. Throughout his career, he has served in Army units in the United States, Germany, and Belgium. He has commanded at every level from platoon to corps.
Career[edit]
His first assignments were with the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, including: support platoon leader for 3rd Squadron (Air), 5th Cavalry Regiment; squadron assistant intelligence staff officer (S-2); squadron intelligence staff officer (S-2); troop executive officer; and troop commander.[2]
Chiarelli's principal staff assignments were Operations Officer (G-3), 1st Cavalry Division, at Fort Hood, Texas; Executive Assistant and, later, Executive Officer to the Supreme Allied Commander, Commander United States European Command at SHAPE Headquarters, Mons, Belgium; and the Director of Operations, Readiness, and Mobilization (G-3/5/7) at Headquarters, Department of the Army.
He commanded a mechanized infantry battalion and a mechanized infantry brigade at Fort Lewis, Washington; served as the assistant division commander for support in the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas; served as commanding general, 1st Cavalry Division, and led it both in the Iraq War and during Operation Iraqi Freedom II; and served as commanding general of Multi-National Corps – Iraq.
He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in political science from Seattle University, a Master of Public Administration degree from the Daniel J. Evans School of Public Affairs at the University of Washington, and a Master of Arts degree in national security strategy from Salve Regina University. He is also a graduate of the U.S. Naval Command and Staff College and the National War College.
Chiarelli has worked to reduce suicide rates in the Army. Out of concerns for stigma, he began using the term posttraumatic stress, dropping the word "disorder" from the medical name posttraumatic stress disorder. His term had subsequently become standard use in the armed forces, but was not taken up by the medical community. The name "posttraumatic stress injury" has been proposed by some psychiatrists in 2012, and is endorsed by Chiarelli.[3]
Chiarelli is currently CEO of One Mind, which is dedicated to benefiting all affected by brain illness and injury through fostering fundamental changes – using open science principles and creating global public-private partnerships among governmental, corporate, scientific and philanthropic communities – that will radically accelerate the development and implementation of improved diagnostics, treatments and cures – while eliminating the stigma that comes with mental illness.

Early life and education[edit]
Chiarelli was born in Seattle, Washington on March 23, 1950. He is a Distinguished Military Graduate of Seattle University Army ROTC. Chiarelli was commissioned a second lieutenant in September 1972. Throughout his career, he has served in Army units in the United States, Germany, and Belgium. He has commanded at every level from platoon to corps.
Career[edit]
His first assignments were with the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, including: support platoon leader for 3rd Squadron (Air), 5th Cavalry Regiment; squadron assistant intelligence staff officer (S-2); squadron intelligence staff officer (S-2); troop executive officer; and troop commander.[2]
Chiarelli's principal staff assignments were Operations Officer (G-3), 1st Cavalry Division, at Fort Hood, Texas; Executive Assistant and, later, Executive Officer to the Supreme Allied Commander, Commander United States European Command at SHAPE Headquarters, Mons, Belgium; and the Director of Operations, Readiness, and Mobilization (G-3/5/7) at Headquarters, Department of the Army.
He commanded a mechanized infantry battalion and a mechanized infantry brigade at Fort Lewis, Washington; served as the assistant division commander for support in the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas; served as commanding general, 1st Cavalry Division, and led it both in the Iraq War and during Operation Iraqi Freedom II; and served as commanding general of Multi-National Corps – Iraq.
He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in political science from Seattle University, a Master of Public Administration degree from the Daniel J. Evans School of Public Affairs at the University of Washington, and a Master of Arts degree in national security strategy from Salve Regina University. He is also a graduate of the U.S. Naval Command and Staff College and the National War College.
Chiarelli has worked to reduce suicide rates in the Army. Out of concerns for stigma, he began using the term posttraumatic stress, dropping the word "disorder" from the medical name posttraumatic stress disorder. His term had subsequently become standard use in the armed forces, but was not taken up by the medical community. The name "posttraumatic stress injury" has been proposed by some psychiatrists in 2012, and is endorsed by Chiarelli.[3]
Chiarelli is currently CEO of One Mind, which is dedicated to benefiting all affected by brain illness and injury through fostering fundamental changes – using open science principles and creating global public-private partnerships among governmental, corporate, scientific and philanthropic communities – that will radically accelerate the development and implementation of improved diagnostics, treatments and cures – while eliminating the stigma that comes with mental illness.

                           worldwide
                           The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 (Goldwater-Nichols) is frequently praised by civilian
                              national security specialists and military leaders as correcting the organizational and structural deficiencies stemming from
                              the National Security Act of 1947. Critics charge that prior to Goldwater-Nichols the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) were unable
                              to adequately fulfill their responsibility to provide pragmatic and timely unified military advice to the President, National
                              Security Council, and/or Secretary of Defense-collectively referred to as the National Command Authorities (NCA). This caused
                              the NCA to rely on civilian staffs for advice that should have been provided by professional military officers. Those calling
                              for defense reform cited the conflict of interest inherent in the dual responsibilities of the Service Chiefs. Furthermore,
                              they charged that the Service Chiefs did not have sufficient time to perform both roles; i.e., head of their Service and member
                              of the jcs. Goldwater-Nichols made the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs (CJCS) the principal military advisor to the NCA. No longer
                              was the CJCS required to formally ask for, and receive, input from the Service Chiefs before answering a question posed by
                              the NCA. Additionally, this major defense reorganization empowered the Commanders of Unified and Specified Commands (CinCs)
                              and instituted a formalized joint officer personnel policy law (Title IV). The Joint Staff was enlarged and strengthened to
                              support the expanded role of the Chairman and the CinCs. Incentives were legislated to force the Services to assign quality
                              officers to joint duty assignments. To the disappointment of those supporting radical reform, Goldwater-Nichols did not end
                              dual hatting, create a General Staff, and abolish the JCS. For traditionalists, reform cost the Service Chiefs and Staffs
                              their preeminent role in defense policy formulation

                           Gen. Peter Chiarelli, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, spoke about the effects of war -- what we are finding out about them,
                              what we are doing in response to them, and the role that senior leaders like the student will play in mitigating or helping

                           The authors contend that in recent years the political power base of the military reform movement has grown significantly.
                              In the future its influence on defense policy-making is likely to increase. The study analyzes the politics of military reform
                              but does not judge specific reform proposals or tactics. The reform debate's participants, motivations, interests, strategies
                              and linkages are examined. The analysis is accomplished through the use of three case studies: (1) the establishment of the
                              Office of Operational Test and Evaluation with the Office of the Secretary of Defense; (2) the current weapon system procurement
                              and spare parts controversy; and (3) efforts concerning Joint Chiefs of Staff reform and Department of Defense reorganization.
                              Finally, having analyzed the dynamics of the military reform movement and the responses it has elicited, the authors propose
                              a new strategy for Department of Defense decision- makers so they may effectively participate in the process

                           Service chiefs wear two hats: as advisors to the National Command Authorities and as advocates of parochial service interests.
                              As a result divided loyalties have traditionally barred the Joint Chiefs of Staff from providing timely and effective advice
                              to the President and the Secretary of Defense. After troubling operational experiences in Korea, Vietnam, and the Iranian
                              hostage rescue mission, a hue and cry arose over reforming--or even replacing--JCS as an institution. Following years of congressional
                              hearings the Goldwater-Nichols DOD Reorganization Act neither ended dual-hatting nor replaced JCS. It has, however, strengthened
                              the role of the Chairman and promoted jointness. Organizational realignment under Goldwater-Nichols has not offset resource
                              allocation problems which are "what the services do 90 percent of the time." Replacing JCS with a National Military Advisory
                              Council, and the Joint Staff with a general staff, are two long overdue reforms

Peter Chiarelli has pressed harder than any other officer to change the way soldiers view post-traumatic stress and other mental-health injuries. (Alex Wong/GETTY IMAGES)   By Greg Jaffe  By Greg Jaffe   January 28, 2012  Follow @GregJaffe     Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, the Army’s vice chief of staff, is leaving the Army in much the same manner that he served in it over the past decade: as an iconoclast. The general, who retires Tuesday, used a final interview with The Washington Post to argue that the law banning women from combat jobs in the military was an unnecessary anachronism — and that women are already effectively serving in combat roles. “I have felt for the longest period of time that on a nonlinear battlefield there are no safe jobs,” he said. “Everyone is in a situation where they are, in fact, in harm’s way.” Chiarelli insisted that the Army should set clear physical standards for combat jobs and then require men and women to meet them. “There is this mistaken belief that somehow that through prohibiting women in combat jobs we can protect them,” Chiarelli said. “I would rather have standards that we apply across the board.” Chiarelli made his case for allowing women to hold combat jobs as he prepared to leave the military after more than 40 years of service, including two combat tours in Iraq. Both tours came during periods when the insurgency in Iraq appeared to be gaining strength and U.S. casualties were mounting. As the Army’s second-highest-ranking general in the Pentagon, Chiarelli has pressed harder than any other officer to change the way soldiers view post-traumatic stress and other mental-health injuries. So far his efforts have not yielded a reduction in the Army’s record-high suicide rate — a source of disappointment to the general. Chiarelli’s passionate advocacy and willingness to criticize his own service, however, have won him admirers in the Pentagon and among soldiers and their families. “Going to combat with the 1st Cavalry Division is something I will always remember . . . but the thing that I have done that has given me the most satisfaction is to try to at least begin the process of eliminating the stigma associated with behavioral-health issues,” he said. In 2010, about 200,000 soldiers sought mental-health counseling for wounds such as post traumatic stress. “Everybody gasped, and I said that I hope it goes up higher than that,” Chiarelli said. Last year, more than 280,000 soldiers received treatment or counseling from behavioral-health specialists. Chiarelli, 61, tackled the issue of soldiers’ mental health at a time when the Army’s suicide rate was spiking. He has pressed to ensure that soldiers receive more intensive mental-health screening after deployments and to hire more behavioral-health specialists at Army bases. Each month, he meets with commanders around the globe by video teleconference to review the details of recent suicides in an attempt to identify trends and possible missed opportunities in which commanders could have intervened. The conferences, which last two hours, are described as gut-wrenching.  Last year, a record 164 active-duty troops committed suicide, compared with about 159 the previous year. Although suicides among active-duty troops remain high, Chiarelli says that improved diagnosis and treatment of these hidden mental wounds has helped stem the increase in suicides the Army was experiencing before 2009. These days, he looks for glimmers of progress in statistics that others might see as deeply troubling. For example, the number of hospitalizations of troops who have suicidal thoughts has increased every year since he became vice chief of staff in 2008. “I look at that and say leaders are involved and are not ignoring things that they once ignored when it comes to this area,” he said. Recently, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta asked Chiarelli to retire from the Army and serve as undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, one of the Pentagon’s most senior civilian jobs. The position would have allowed Chiarelli to remain involved in mental-health issues, but he turned it down to return to Washington state. “I have my mom on the West Coast all by herself,” he said. “She turns 90 on February 15th. I have a family responsibility after 40 years of service to be with her.” He acknowledged that he leaves behind many problems, including a medical system that is poorly structured to treat the mental wounds of war. “Soldiers would tell me point blank that [the doctor] talks to me for five minutes and throws a bag of pills at me,” Chiarelli said. “We have some real issues right now with the shortage of behavioral-health experts and a business model that does not lend itself to taking care of these people in the most effective way.” Throughout his military career, Chiarelli has had a reputation as an innovator. In Baghdad’s Sadr City, he launched a massive effort to employ young men to fix the slum’s dilapidated sewer system. His efforts helped shape the Army’s approach to counterinsurgency warfare, which stresses that winning the support of the people is as important as killing the enemy. It’s unclear, however, whether another four-star general will continue his efforts to improve mental-health care for soldiers. “I think that anyone who looks at the numbers after a while is going to say, ‘Wow, we have got a problem here,’ ” he said. “That is how I got involved in it. . . . It is going to still need pushing.”          world national-security  Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false          Please provide a valid email address.

He is a retired General with almost 40 years of experience, and was appointed the Chief Executive Officer of One Mind in 2012.

As the 32nd Vice Chief of Staff in the Army, Chiarelli was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Army and its 1.1 million active and reserve soldiers.

He was also the Senior Military Assistant to the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates from March 2007 to August 2008.

He retired from the Army in 2012.

In 2013, Chiarelli received the Patriot Award, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society's highest honor for his work to help soldiers and families suffering from the invisible wounds of war.

Chiarelli holds a Bachelor of Science in Political Science from Seattle University, a Master of Public Administration from the Daniel J.

Early life and education[edit]
Chiarelli was born in Seattle, Washington on March 23, 1950. He is a Distinguished Military Graduate of Seattle University Army ROTC. Chiarelli was commissioned a second lieutenant in September 1972. Throughout his career, he has served in Army units in the United States, Germany, and Belgium. He has commanded at every level from platoon to corps.
Career[edit]
His first assignments were with the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, including: support platoon leader for 3rd Squadron (Air), 5th Cavalry Regiment; squadron assistant intelligence staff officer (S-2); squadron intelligence staff officer (S-2); troop executive officer; and troop commander.[2]
Chiarelli's principal staff assignments were Operations Officer (G-3), 1st Cavalry Division, at Fort Hood, Texas; Executive Assistant and, later, Executive Officer to the Supreme Allied Commander, Commander United States European Command at SHAPE Headquarters, Mons, Belgium; and the Director of Operations, Readiness, and Mobilization (G-3/5/7) at Headquarters, Department of the Army.
He commanded a mechanized infantry battalion and a mechanized infantry brigade at Fort Lewis, Washington; served as the assistant division commander for support in the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas; served as commanding general, 1st Cavalry Division, and led it both in the Iraq War and during Operation Iraqi Freedom II; and served as commanding general of Multi-National Corps – Iraq.
He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in political science from Seattle University, a Master of Public Administration degree from the Daniel J. Evans School of Public Affairs at the University of Washington, and a Master of Arts degree in national security strategy from Salve Regina University. He is also a graduate of the U.S. Naval Command and Staff College and the National War College.
Chiarelli has worked to reduce suicide rates in the Army. Out of concerns for stigma, he began using the term posttraumatic stress, dropping the word "disorder" from the medical name posttraumatic stress disorder. His term had subsequently become standard use in the armed forces, but was not taken up by the medical community. The name "posttraumatic stress injury" has been proposed by some psychiatrists in 2012, and is endorsed by Chiarelli.[3]
Chiarelli is currently CEO of One Mind, which is dedicated to benefiting all affected by brain illness and injury through fostering fundamental changes – using open science principles and creating global public-private partnerships among governmental, corporate, scientific and philanthropic communities – that will radically accelerate the development and implementation of improved diagnostics, treatments and cures – while eliminating the stigma that comes with mental illness.

He is also a graduate of the U.S. Naval Command and Staff College and the National War College.
Chiarelli has worked to reduce suicide rates in the Army. Out of concerns for stigma, he began using the term posttraumatic stress, dropping the word "disorder" from the medical name posttraumatic stress disorder. His term had subsequently become standard use in the armed forces, but was not taken up by the medical community. The name "posttraumatic stress injury" has been proposed by some psychiatrists in 2012, and is endorsed by Chiarelli.[3]
Chiarelli is currently CEO of One Mind, which is dedicated to benefiting all affected by brain illness and injury through fostering fundamental changes – using open science principles and creating global public-private partnerships among governmental, corporate, scientific and philanthropic communities – that will radically accelerate the development and implementation of improved diagnostics, treatments and cures – while eliminating the stigma that comes with mental illness.

Early life and education[edit]
Chiarelli was born in Seattle, Washington on March 23, 1950. He is a Distinguished Military Graduate of Seattle University Army ROTC. Chiarelli was commissioned a second lieutenant in September 1972. Throughout his career, he has served in Army units in the United States, Germany, and Belgium. He has commanded at every level from platoon to corps.
Career[edit]
His first assignments were with the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, including: support platoon leader for 3rd Squadron (Air), 5th Cavalry Regiment; squadron assistant intelligence staff officer (S-2); squadron intelligence staff officer (S-2); troop executive officer; and troop commander.[2]
Chiarelli's principal staff assignments were Operations Officer (G-3), 1st Cavalry Division, at Fort Hood, Texas; Executive Assistant and, later, Executive Officer to the Supreme Allied Commander, Commander United States European Command at SHAPE Headquarters, Mons, Belgium; and the Director of Operations, Readiness, and Mobilization (G-3/5/7) at Headquarters, Department of the Army.
He commanded a mechanized infantry battalion and a mechanized infantry brigade at Fort Lewis, Washington; served as the assistant division commander for support in the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas; served as commanding general, 1st Cavalry Division, and led it both in the Iraq War and during Operation Iraqi Freedom II; and served as commanding general of Multi-National Corps – Iraq.
He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in political science from Seattle University, a Master of Public Administration degree from the Daniel J. Evans School of Public Affairs at the University of Washington, and a Master of Arts degree in national security strategy from Salve Regina University. He is also a graduate of the U.S. Naval Command and Staff College and the National War College.
Chiarelli has worked to reduce suicide rates in the Army. Out of concerns for stigma, he began using the term posttraumatic stress, dropping the word "disorder" from the medical name posttraumatic stress disorder. His term had subsequently become standard use in the armed forces, but was not taken up by the medical community. The name "posttraumatic stress injury" has been proposed by some psychiatrists in 2012, and is endorsed by Chiarelli.[3]
Chiarelli is currently CEO of One Mind, which is dedicated to benefiting all affected by brain illness and injury through fostering fundamental changes – using open science principles and creating global public-private partnerships among governmental, corporate, scientific and philanthropic communities – that will radically accelerate the development and implementation of improved diagnostics, treatments and cures – while eliminating the stigma that comes with mental illness.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
