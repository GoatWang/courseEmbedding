DESCRIPTION



Tax Management Portfolio, Real Estate Leases, No. 593-2nd, analyzes the tax issues encountered by both lessor and lessee in contemporary leases of real property.



This Portfolio discusses issues to be considered in 
originating a lease, including §467 rental agreements. It also presents 
the lessor's and lessee's perspectives, with respect to tax principles, 
in determining who should pay for lessee improvements. Also discussed 
are the issues raised when a lease is modified, terminated, or 
transferred.



There are different reasons for using a sale of real 
property by its owner and the simultaneous leaseback of the property as a
 method of financing the property (as opposed to borrowing). This 
Portfolio analyzes the income tax consequences to the seller-lessee and 
the buyer-lessor, and outlines the various tax problems inherent in 
structuring such transactions. Special emphasis is placed on tax 
planning, from the standpoints of both the seller-lessee and the 
buyer-lessor, to maximize the tax benefits inherent in sale and 
leaseback and related transactions.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."
