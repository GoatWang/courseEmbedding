Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

Argentina Lithium & Energy – Probing the Depths 
Christopher Ecclestone |
        May 23, 2017 |
        2 Comments


One of the paradoxes of recent times has been the “talking down” of brine lake Lithium deposits (salares) as being in some way “too difficult” or too “long term”. Having said that though two of the most high flying stories of recent times, Orocobre and Lithium Americas are both salar-based and there has been a staking boom in the Argentine part of the Lithium Triangle that makes California in the 1850s pale into insignificance. Explorers, quite literally, cannot get enough of Argentine lithium territory.
The caution relating to salares exploitation is powered by the mishaps that befell Orocobre and Rincon. However, in both these cases the lessons learnt will mean that others will have the benefit of their difficult experiences. The argument that there is a longer lead time for salar development (due to the need to kickstart the evaporation process) does not hold much water (pardon the bad pun) due to the much longer (and more expensive) drilling and resource estimation phase at a hardrock deposit and the much higher development costs at underground mines.
The Background Music
After nearly a decade and a half of irregular iconoclastic governments in Argentina ruled most recently by the dynasts of the Kirchner family and before that the Duhalde regime the country has returned to a certain orthodoxy with the election of Mauricio Macri as President in the last quarter of 2016. While not reinserting Argentine directly into the good books of mining investors it has certainly made thinking about the possibilities not being grounds for insanity. Amongst the measures taken so far that have enhanced the perspective for miners are:

Lifted currency controls – devalued Peso may result in lower costs for project development
Eliminated export taxes on concentrates and gold/silver doré
Some import restrictions lifted – may allow better sourcing of equipment

These changes have removed the major bugbears of foreign miners operating in the country. This reopening has coincided with the Lithium boom. There is a good case to be made that the relative lack of salares moving to production was due to the double negatives of the low lithium price between 2011 and 2016 and the death throes of the Kirchner regime making Argentina an unattractive place to advance projects.
The Prime Asset
 {  Get our daily investorintel update SubscribeEmail address is invalidThank you for joining InvestorIntel daily email updates!
    }It is probably evident to those who know the Grosso group that it should be so well-positioned here. Argentina Lithium & Energy Corp. (TSXV: LIT | OTCQX: PNXLF) has the option to earn a 100% interest in the Arizaro Lithium Brine Project. The terms of the option agreement include $6mn in staged payments and $4.2mn in expenditures over a four-year period. Additionally, the company must issue 2.5mn common shares with certain resale restrictions.
The territory optioned covers 20,500 hectares in the central core of the Arizaro Salar, the largest in Argentina and third largest in the “Lithium Triangle”. The whole salar covers an area of 1600 km2 within a watershed of 6000 km2  and is located in the Andean province of Salta.

However, like many other salares in Argentina it has a portion of the pie rather than the whole pie. Other players with parts of the Salar de Arizaro are Lithium X, Eramet, Sentient and REMSA (an entity of Salta’s government).
Volcanic and associated hydrothermal activity is believed to be the main source of lithium and other solutes to the basin. This is verified by the deposits of travertine and occurrences of ulexite that have been found, as well as the presence of lithium bearing clay (hectorite), and lithium mica (lepidolite), in the surrounding areas of the basin. The generation of salt deposits has occurred in stages over time; early-deposited halite and gypsum layers that have been deformed by Andean tectonic activity are found on the eastern side of the salar. The rugged, lunar landscape nature of the salar’s surface can be seen below.

Very little historic exploration work has been done on the Arizaro Salar, however the central area is interpreted to have the geologic conditions and thickness to be the most prospective for quality brine resources. Historical sampling on the western margins of the Salar de Arizaro show elevated lithium values near surface contained within a classic halite dominant salar, much like nearby Rincon, Salar del Hombre Muerto and Atacama projects, all of which host advanced or producing lithium brine operations. This salar has a prevalence of halite to the west and gypsum to the east. These evaporites are covered by surficial deposits along the eastern margin of the salar.
The Arizaro salar benefits from good infrastructure in the Puna region, and is set to benefit from further development of adjacent large-scale mining projects, including First Quantum’s Taca-Taca copper project and Fortuna Silver’s Lindero gold project. Salar de Arizaro is traversed by a highway and railroad that connect the area to the Chile port of Anotfagasta some 450kms west and east to Pocitos on the main Argentine rail network, where natural gas and an industrial park are found.
The development of brine projects on some other salars in the region has been hindered by a lack of fresh water for processing. At Arizaro, there is a known water recharge area, and the Company has made securing a water source a key component of the exploration program in order to prepare for a feasible mining project.
Exploration
In association with work on the Taca Taca project, holes of approximately 100 metres depth were drilled into the salar and detected interbedded volcanic material, reflecting the volcanic activity that accompanied the evaporite sedimentation. The presence of geological structures such as faults and flow channels solutions were also detected. However, as might be expected these holes were not directed towards establishing the Lithium content of the salar.
Until recently little work had been done and the historical references are mainly to a report from the USGS in 1987 which reported date sampling of brines from the subsurface (to a mere two metres depth) that returned lithium values, up to 160 mg/L, confirming the presence of lithium in the basin but really only (literally) scratching the surface.
Argentina Lithium’s exploration campaign thus far includes both near-surface geochemical sampling and a Vertical Electric Sounding (VES) geophysical survey to delineate conductive zones at depth that may host lithium-bearing brines. Data from this first stage of the program has been used to define targets for a drill program that is planned for early in the second quarter of 2017.
The goal now is exploration for deep layers of lithium-rich brine which are not directly linked to the surface fluids at the Arizaro salar. This initial exploration program at Arizaro was, therefore, designed to acquire initial hydrogeological understanding of this largely un-tested salar and to identify conductive zones at depth that may host lithium-bearing brines. VES is effective to depths of approximately 400-500 metres below which alternative surveys such as Controlled Source Audio-frequency Magneto-tellurics are required.
Near-surface fluid samples collected from the trenches returned low lithium (<10 mg/l) and potash (<1,500 mg/l) levels. However, in the company’s opinion, the very large size of the salar and its geomorphology support the potential for discovery of deep brine layers with potential to host higher concentrations of lithium, as well as potash.
The consultants that undertook the VES tests have concluded from the results that, as well as the geologic and geomorphologic setting, climatic conditions, and hydrogeological environment at Arizaro, when compared to other well-studied salars, including Hombre Muerto, Rincón, Antofalla, Llullaillaco, and Rio Grande, indicate that there is a high probability to find brines at depth with high densities of 1,210 to 1,225 g/l and conductivities higher than 200 microS/cm. The VES results identified clear targets for an initial drill campaign. Now three or four holes of up to 400 metres in depth are planned to test these targets.
Conclusion
It’s early days for the companies in the Generation X of the Lithium wave. Those from the preceding generation that started out late last decade have moved towards production, now it’s the turn of those spawned by the 2016 Lithium price surge or those from the previous generation who were thwarted when prices took a tumble (and political circumstances deteriorated) resulting in wholesale shelving of development plans.
With a price tailwind, a dramatically improved political situation and the deep insertion of Joe Grosso in the Argentine political and economic scene, the scene is set for Argentina Lithium & Energy to make advances if the exploration data starts to stack up in a favorable way.

John, well International Lithium have one of the more attractive properties and have managed to land a large and serious whale in the form of Ganfeng. One has to only look at Neometals to see how lucrative that can be if well-handled.

Lithium - Argentina





The development of a lithium project in Argentina

 





ERAMET is developing a project to produce lithium from its deposit located in the Andean Cordillera of the Salta province, North West of Argentina, 3,800 meters above sea level. 
Lithium is a versatile metal, essential in a variety of end-market applications such as energy storage, which is set to be a key challenge for the next century. In 2025, the battery market is expected to represent over half of lithium demand versus roughly a third in 2014. More broadly, the global lithium market is expected to more than double in size by 2025, according to analysts and key industry players. 
The Centenario-Ratones deposit contains a significant level of resources, supporting an annual industrial production level of 20,000 tons of lithium carbonate for decades. ERAMET has developed an innovative Direct Extraction Process to extract the lithium contained in the brine; this process is lower-cost and more environmentally-friendly than the conventional evaporation method of obtaining lithium. The proprietary technology was developed by ERAMET’s leading Research and Development (“R&D”) Center, ERAMET Research (based near Paris, France) in partnership with the French Petroleum and Renewable Energy Institute (IFP Energies Nouvelles).
In 2016, the ERAMET Lithium Project will enter the last phase of its development. After two years of development and optimization studies at lab scale and through continuous piloting, the Direct Extraction Process will be piloted at an industrial scale this year to finalize engineering studies and qualify the product with our future clients.
ERAMET aims to become a major player in the lithium industry before the end of the decade.
 



The Centenario-Ratones deposit contains significant level of resources


 
A lithium deposit was identified by ERAMET on Centenario-Ratones salt lake in 2012. Exploration campaigns enabled to identify deep lithium-bearing brine resources in volumes and quality, allowing an an industrial production of 20,000 tons of lithium carbonate for many decades.
The total surface area of the deposit, discovered by ERAMET, spans more than 500 km2 and the drainable resource area covers c.260 km2, with a possible extension to the North of the deposit. Exploration campaigns identified deep lithium-bearing brine resources in significant volumes and quality, supporting an annual industrial production of 20,000 tons of lithium carbonate for decades. This would represent a 10+ % global market share currently. 
ERAMINE SUDAMERICA S.A, 100% subsidiary of ERAMET, owns the mining concessions of the deposit area which cover the right to explore and extract lithium and associated minerals. The mining contract with the Salta Province was signed in April 2014 and covers all phases of mining project: exploration, feasibility study and exploitation across the whole mine life.
Salta Province is an established lithium and borates mining region which ranked #17 out of 124 regions all over the world in the 2014 Fraser Institute’s mining investment attractiveness index. (lien vers etude)
ERAMET’s Centenario-Ratones deposit is fully accessible with limited need for new infrastructure:
Logistics, site access and product exporting is done via the existing road network which is used daily by inhabitants and currently producing mining companies in the region.
An existing natural gas supply pipeline is located 100km North of the project at Pocitos, with sufficient capacity to supply the industrial plant.
Fresh water is available on site.
 



An innovative, low-cost and environmentally friendly Direct Extraction Process


 
Owning a good quality deposit is necessary but not sufficient to become a significant player in the lithium industry. A process suited to the resources of the deposit is also mandatory.
Thanks to its leading R&D center, ERAMET Research (located near Paris, France), ERAMET has developed an innovative Direct Extraction Process in partnership with IFP Energies Nouvelles which is well adapted to the resources of the Centenario-Ratones deposit. The process is lower-cost and more environmentally friendly than the conventional evaporation process used to extract lithium.
Find out the extraction process 
ERAMET’s Direct Extraction Process works as follows: the brine is pumped out of the deposit and goes through ERAMET’s proprietary Extraction Material, which only captures lithium and is insensitive to the other elements contained in the brine. The lithium-depleted brine is sent back to the salar, while the lithium trapped in the Extraction Material is released and then transformed into lithium carbonate through a simple refining process. 
The Direct Extraction Process presents major benefits compared to conventional lithium evaporation processes and paves the way for a more environmentally-friendly and economic production of lithium over the coming decades. Thanks to this process: 
The deposit is better valued as the process yield is twice the yield of the conventional evaporation process. Half the lithium resources are then need to produce the same annual quantity of lithium carbonate.
The hydric balance of the deposit is better preserved because the brine is sent back to the salar after lithium extraction.
The plant production will be more flexible. The production lead time will be significantly reduced compared to the 18 months required by the conventional evaporation process.
The plant will require less reagents and less energy, will not produce any chemical waste and its environmental footprint will be twenty times smaller than that of a conventional process. 
The development of a new process is essential because the conventional evaporation process has important environmental and economic impacts. It implies high CAPEX levels to build the large evaporation ponds, a lithium recovery rate half of that for the Direct Extraction process, a huge amount of chemical reagents required, a large amount of residues produced and a major impact on the hydric balance of the salar as the pumped brine is totally evaporated and not returned to the salar.
 



Strong commitment to sustainable development and responsible mining


 
Beyond the environmental qualities of the Direct Extraction Process, ERAMET is committed to continue to pursue the highest environmental and social standards within the industry, in compliance with its Sustainable Development Policy. 
ERAMINE SUDAMERICA, a 100%-owned subsidiary of ERAMET in Argentina, maintains a constant and active dialog with all our stakeholders: local communities, provincial administration and representatives, national administration and representatives, etc. 
In addition, through various programmes, ERAMINE SUDAMERICA is committed to having the maximum positive impact on local communities: 
Local community employment (nearly half of current workforce comes from the nearest villages and the rest from Salta City).
Organization of training sessions for local communities to help them diversify their economic activities and revenues.
Re-introduction of quinoa as an alternative income for local communities (the first harvest was collected in early 2015). 
Assistance with the construction of a local waste landfill, multi-purpose facility for the school of the nearest village and a “ride-for-free” programme.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Bigger than Lithium: Investing in the REAL Source of Clean Energy

Bigger Than Lithium:
Investing in the REAL Source of Clean Energy


Your email address:







July 26th, 2017
When you think “clean energy,” what comes to mind?
Probably the energy industry's darlings, solar and wind. Both are expected to see some major growth within the next few years and become a significant part of the world's energy mix.
But that's not where you should be putting your money.
Long before solar and wind come into their own (neither can produce energy at more than 33% efficiency just yet), the world will be needing a stronger energy source.
Enter nuclear power.
Yes, the much-vilified power production method really is the best carbon-free energy source we have.
But don't worry, we're not asking you to invest in nuclear power companies, or even in energy companies at all!
Oh no, we've got our eyes on the real prize: uranium.
Much like the growth we're seeing in lithium today, uranium is about to see a major price boost as the world's nuclear energy capacity climbs and demand takes off.
And for a limited time, we're offering you access to our research into the market, organized into a single report: “Avoid an Investment Meltdown: Start with These Three Uranium Stocks.”
This report explains it all, from the state of the uranium market to why the coming nuclear resurgence will drive the next major movement.
These three stocks are already set to profit big time on the best clean energy source the world has.
But you don't have any time to lose: not only is the stage already being set for this massive upswing, but this report won't be available forever!
To get “Avoid an Investment Meltdown: Start with These Three Uranium Stocks” sent to your inbox right away, simply enter your e-mail below and hit “Send My Report.” We'll e-mail you in minutes with your absolutely free insight into this re-emerging market.
You'll also be signed up for the Energy and Capital newsletter. Week to week, our team of dedicated research analysts will keep you up to date on the latest energy innovations and investments to keep your portfolio growing!
Start making money right now. Join us today!
