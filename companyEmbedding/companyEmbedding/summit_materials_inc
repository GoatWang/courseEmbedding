(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our results of operations and financial condition. Historical results may not be indicative of future performance. Forward-looking statements reflect our current views about future events, are based on assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Factors that may cause differences between actual results and those contemplated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in the Prospectus and any factors discussed in the sections entitled "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" of this report. This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated interim financial statements and the related notes and other information included in this report.  Overview  We are one of the fastest growing construction materials companies in the United States. Our materials include aggregates, which we supply across the country, with a focus on Texas, Kansas, Kentucky, Utah and Missouri, and cement, which we supply primarily in Missouri, Iowa and along the Mississippi River. Within our markets, we offer customers a single-source provider for construction materials and related downstream products through our vertical integration. In addition to supplying aggregates to customers, we use our materials internally to produce ready-mixed concrete and asphalt paving mix, which may be sold externally or used in our paving and related services businesses. Our vertical integration creates opportunities to increase aggregates volumes, optimize margin at each stage of production and provide customers with efficiency gains, convenience and reliability, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage.  We have completed 36 acquisitions, which are organized into 11 operating companies that make up our three distinct operating segments-West, Central and East regions-spanning 18 U.S. states and British Columbia, Canada and 33 metropolitan statistical areas. Our highly experienced management team, led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Hill, a 30-year industry veteran, has successfully enhanced the operations of acquired companies by focusing on scale advantages, cost efficiencies and pricing discipline to improve profitability and cash flow.  As of June 27, 2015, we had 2.1 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves serving our aggregates and cement businesses and operated over 200 sites and plants, to which we believe we have adequate road, barge and/or railroad access. From time to time, in connection with certain acquisitions, we engage a third party engineering firm to perform an aggregates reserves audit, but we do not perform annual reserve audits.  Table of Contents  Including the Davenport Assets (as defined below) acquired in July 2015, we operate and currently have assets in 18 U.S. states and in British Columbia, Canada. The map below illustrates our geographic footprint:  [[Image Removed: LOGO]]  Recent Developments  On August 5, 2015, we priced the offering of 19,500,000 shares of Summit Inc.'s Class A common stock at a price to the public of $25.75 per share. The underwriters have been granted a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,925,000 shares of Class A common stock. The offering is expected to close on August 11, 2015, subject to customary closing conditions. Summit Inc. intends to use all of the net proceeds from the offering to purchase for cash 3,750,000 newly-issued LP Units from Summit Holdings and 15,750,000 outstanding LP Units from certain pre-IPO owners, including affiliates of the Sponsors and certain of our directors and officers. Summit Holdings intends to use the proceeds it receives to pay all or a portion of the $80.0 million deferred purchase price of Davenport Assets.  On July 17, 2015, we acquired certain assets from Lafarge, including a cement plant, a quarry and seven cement distribution terminals (the "Davenport Assets") for a purchase price of $450.0 million in cash and a cement distribution terminal in Bettendorf, Iowa. We funded $370.0 million of the purchase price using proceeds from new senior notes and term debt issued by Summit LLC. The remaining $80.0 million of the purchase price is due to Lafarge no later than December 31, 2015 and accrues interest at an annual rate of 7.5%, payable monthly.  On July 8, 2015, we issued $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due July 15, 2023 (the "2023 Notes", collectively with the 2020 Notes, "Senior Notes"). The 2023 Notes were issued at 100% of their par value. Interest on the 2023 Notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year commencing on January 15, 2016.  On July 17, 2015, we refinanced our term loan under our senior secured credit facilities (the "Refinancing"). The Refinancing, among other things: (i) reduced the applicable margins used to calculate interest rates for term loans under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities to 3.25% for LIBOR rate loans and 2.25% for base rate loans, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.00% (and one 25 basis point step down upon Summit LLC achieving a certain first lien net leverage ratio);  We used the net proceeds from the 2023 Notes and the Refinancing to finance the initial $370.0 million cash purchase price for the Davenport Assets, to refinance our existing senior secured term loan facility, to redeem $183.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2020 Notes and to pay related fees and expenses.  Business Trends and Conditions  The U.S. construction materials industry is composed of four primary sectors:  Table of Contents  typically range from small, privately-held companies focused on a single material, product or market to multinational companies that offer a wide array of construction materials, products and related services. We estimate that approximately 65% of the aggregates in the United States are held by private companies.  Our revenue is derived from multiple end-use markets including private residential and nonresidential construction, as well as public infrastructure construction. Residential and nonresidential construction consists of new construction and repair and remodel markets. The construction sectors in the local economies in which we operate have begun to show signs of recovery. However, we could still be affected by any economic stagnation or decline, which could vary by local region and market. Our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical changes in construction spending, especially in the private sector. From a macroeconomic view, we see positive indicators for the construction sector, including upward trends in housing starts, construction employment and highway obligations. All of these factors should result in increased construction activity in the private sector. However, we do not expect this recovery to be consistent across the United States. Certain of our markets are showing greater, more rapid signs of recovery. Increased construction activity in the private sector could lead to increased public infrastructure spending in the relatively near future. Public infrastructure includes spending by federal, state and local governments for roads, highways, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects. Public infrastructure projects have historically been a relatively stable portion of state and federal budgets. Our acquisitions to date have been primarily focused in states with certain constitutional protections for transportation funding sources, which we believe limits our exposure to state and local budgetary uncertainties.  Transportation infrastructure projects, driven by both federal and state funding programs, represent a significant share of the U.S. construction materials market. Federal funds are allocated to the states, which are required to match a portion of the federal funds they receive. Federal highway spending uses funds predominantly from the Federal Highway Trust Fund, which derives its revenue from taxes on diesel fuel, gasoline and other user fees. The dependability of federal funding allows the state departments of transportation to plan for their long term highway construction and maintenance needs. Funding for the existing federal transportation funding program expired on September 30, 2014 and on August 1, 2014, a Highway Trust Fund extension bill was enacted. This bill provides funding that is expected to last through July 2015. On July 30, 2015 Congress passed a bill to extend funding through October 29, 2015. This bill also included provisions to raise approximately $8.0 billion in revenue to fund the program through the October 2015 extension. Any additional funding or successor programs have yet to be approved. With the nation's infrastructure aging, we expect U.S. infrastructure spending to grow over the long term, and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on any such increase.  In addition to federal funding, highway construction and maintenance funding is also available through state, county and local agencies. Our five largest states by revenue (Texas, Kansas, Kentucky, Utah and Missouri, which represented approximately 34%, 19%, 11%, 10% and 9%, respectively, of our total revenue in 2014) each have funds whose revenue sources have certain constitutional protections and are dedicated for transportation projects.   Texas Department of Transportation's budget from 2014 to 2016 is $25.3 billion.   Kansas has a 10-year $8.2 billion highway bill that was passed in May 2010.   Kentucky's biennial highway construction plan has funding of $3.6 billion from July 2014 to June 2016.   Utah's transportation investment fund has $3.5 billion committed through 2018.   Missouri has an estimated $0.7 billion in annual construction funding committed to essential road and bridge programs through 2017.  Within many of our markets, state and local governments have taken actions to maintain or grow highway funding during a time of uncertainty with respect to federal funding. For example:   On November 4, 2014, voters in Texas passed a proposition that will provide $1.7 billion of incremental funding annually to the Texas Department of Transportation. The funds must be used for construction, maintenance, rehabilitation and acquiring right-of-way for public roads. The Texas legislature recently passed the largest two-year budget in the history of the Texas Department of Transportation (with growth in both new construction and maintenance). In addition, increased energy sector activity in parts of Texas has driven an increase in private construction demand, which we expect to continue. In particular, Houston and Austin, Texas have seen rapid residential demand expansion, which we expect to provide a stimulus for non-residential and public infrastructure demand, as job growth has drawn new residents.   Increases in heavy truck registration fees, dedicated sales tax revenue and bond issuances have enabled Kansas to maintain stability in public infrastructure spending.   We believe that public infrastructure spending in Kentucky, which comprises the majority of our revenue in the state, will remain consistent in the upcoming years.   We expect primarily maintenance-related public demand in Utah and Missouri, both of which have recently completed large spending programs.  Table of Contents  Use and consumption of our products fluctuate due to seasonality. Nearly all of the products used by us, and by our customers, in the private construction or public infrastructure industries are used outdoors. Our highway operations and production and distribution facilities are also located outdoors. Therefore, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions, in particular extended rainy and cold weather in the spring and fall and major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms and heavy snows, can adversely affect our business and operations through a decline in both the use of our products and demand for our services. In addition, construction materials production and shipment levels follow activity in the construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during the second and third quarters of our fiscal year typically result in higher activity and revenue levels during those quarters.  We are subject to commodity price risk with respect to price changes in liquid asphalt and energy, including fossil fuels and electricity for aggregates, cement, ready-mixed concrete and asphalt paving mix production, natural gas for hot mix asphalt production and diesel fuel for distribution vehicles and production related mobile equipment. Liquid asphalt escalator provisions in most of our private and commercial contracts limit our exposure to price fluctuations in this commodity. We often obtain similar escalators on public infrastructure contracts. In addition, we enter into various firm purchase commitments, with terms generally less than one year, for certain raw materials. As a result of the contract escalation clauses and effective use of the firm purchase commitments, commodity prices did not have a material effect on our results of operations in the three and six months ended June 27, 2015 as compared to the three and six months ended June 28, 2014.  Backlog  Our products are generally delivered upon receipt of orders or requests from customers, or shortly thereafter. Accordingly, the backlog associated with product sales is converted into revenue within a relatively short period of time. Inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers. Therefore, a period over period increase or decrease of backlog does not necessarily result in an improvement or a deterioration of our business. Our backlog includes only those products and projects for which we have obtained a purchase order or a signed contract with the customer and does not include products purchased and sold or services awarded and provided within the period.  Our paving and related services backlog represents our estimate of revenue that will be realized under the applicable contracts. We generally include a project in backlog at the time it is awarded and funding is in place. Many of our paving and related services are awarded and completed within one year and therefore may not be reflected in our beginning or ending contract backlog. Historically, we have not been materially adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications. However, subject to applicable contract terms, substantially all contracts in our backlog may be cancelled or modified by our customers.  As a vertically-integrated business, approximately 25% of our aggregates sales volume was further processed and sold as a downstream product, such as ready-mixed concrete or asphalt paving mix, or used in our paving and related services business, and approximately 81% of the asphalt paving mix we sold was installed by our own paving crews during the six months ended June 27, 2015. The following table sets forth, our backlog as of the indicated dates:   June 27, June 28, (in thousands) 2015 2014 Aggregate (in tons) 5,967 6,067 Asphalt (in tons) 2,578 2,815 Ready-mixed concrete (in cubic yards) 326 209 Construction services (1) $ 451,055 $ 441,088  (1) The dollar value of the construction services backlog includes the value of the aggregate and asphalt tons and ready-mixed concrete cubic yards in backlog that are expected to be sourced internally.  Financial Highlights  The principal factors in evaluating our financial condition and operating results for the three and six months ended June 27, 2015 as compared to June 28, 2014 are:   Net revenue increased $36.6 million and $75.7 million in the three and six months ended June 27, 2015, respectively, as a result of pricing and volume increases across our product lines, which includes volume contributions from our acquisitions.  Table of Contents   In March 2015, we completed an IPO of Summit Inc.'s Class A common stock, the proceeds of which were used: (i) to redeem $288.2 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2020 Notes at a redemption price of 100% and an applicable premium thereon; (ii) to purchase a portion of the noncontrolling interests of Continental Cement; (iii) to pay a one-time fee of $13.8 million in connection with the termination of a transaction and management fee agreement; and (iv) for general corporate purposes. The redemption of the 2020 Notes occurred in April 2015.  Acquisitions  In addition to our organic growth, we continued to grow our business through acquisitions, completing the following transactions in 2015 and 2014:   On July 17, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Davenport Assets.   On June 1, 2015, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Lewis & Lewis, Inc., a vertically integrated, aggregates-based business in Wyoming.   On October 3, 2014, we purchased Concrete Supply, which included two sand and gravel sites and 10 ready-mixed concrete plants in Topeka and northeast Kansas, and a ready-mixed concrete plant in western Missouri.   On September 30, 2014, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests in Colorado County S&G, a Texas limited liability company, M & M Gravel Sales, Inc., a Texas corporation, Marek Materials Co. Operating, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership, and Marek Materials Co., L.L.C., a Texas limited liability company, which collectively supply aggregates to the west Houston, Texas markets.   On September 19, 2014, we acquired all of the membership interests of Southwest Ready Mix, which included two ready-mixed concrete plants and serves the downtown and southwest Houston, Texas markets.   On September 4, 2014, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares and certain shareholder notes of Rock Head Holdings Ltd. and B.I.M. Holdings Ltd., which collectively indirectly owned all the shares of Mainland Sand and Gravel Ltd., a supplier of construction aggregates to the Vancouver metropolitan area based in Surrey, British Columbia.   On July 29, 2014, we acquired all of the assets of Canyon Redi-Mix, Inc. The acquired assets include two ready-mixed concrete plants, which serve the Permian Basin region of West Texas.   On June 9, 2014, we acquired all of the membership interests of Buckhorn Materials, LLC ("Buckhorn"), an aggregates quarry in South Carolina, and Construction Materials Group LLC, a sand pit in South Carolina.   On March 31, 2014, we acquired all of the stock of Troy Vines, an integrated aggregates and ready-mixed concrete business headquartered in Midland, Texas, which serves the Permian Basin region of West Texas.   On January 17, 2014, we acquired certain aggregates and ready-mixed concrete assets of Alleyton in Houston, Texas, which expands our presence in the Texas market.  Results of Operations  The following discussion of our results of operations is focused on the key financial measures we use to evaluate the performance of our business from both a consolidated and operating segment perspective. Operating income and margins are discussed in terms of changes in volume, pricing and mix of revenue source (i.e., type of product sales or service revenue). We focus on operating margin, which we define as operating income as a percentage of revenue, as a key metric when assessing the performance of the business, as we believe that analyzing changes in costs in relation to changes in revenue provides more meaningful insight into the results of operations than examining costs in isolation.  Table of Contents  Operating income (loss) reflects our profit (loss) from continuing operations after taking into consideration cost of revenue, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion and transaction costs. Cost of revenue generally increases ratably with revenue, as labor, transportation costs and subcontractor costs are recorded in cost of revenue. General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue vary throughout the year due to the seasonality of our business. As a result of our revenue growth occurring primarily through acquisitions, general and administrative costs and depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion have historically grown ratably with revenue. However, as volumes increase, we expect these costs, as a percentage of revenue, to decrease. Our transaction costs fluctuate with the number and size of acquisitions completed each year.  The table below includes revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for the three and six months ended June 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014.   Three months ended Six months ended June 27, 2015 June 28, 2014 June 27, 2015 June 28, 2014 Operating Operating Operating Operating (in thousands) Revenue income (loss) Revenue income (loss) Revenue income (loss) Revenue income (loss) West $ 208,068 $ 27,120 $ 172,236 $ 23,135 $ 335,742 $ 26,935 $ 267,130 $ 18,029 Central 117,920 24,195 109,117 19,159 174,529 14,477 156,659 9,794 East 38,955 6,523 42,942 3,713 48,659 (4,308 ) 51,597 (8,843 ) Corporate (1) - (15,538 ) - (12,085 ) - (53,810 ) - (20,077 ) Total $ 364,943 $ 42,300 $ 324,295 $ 33,922 $ 558,930 $ (16,706 ) $ 475,386 $ (1,097 )  (1) Corporate results primarily consist of compensation and office expenses for employees included in the Company's headquarters and, in the six months ended June 27, 2015, $28.3 million of costs associated with the March 2015 IPO.  Non-GAAP Performance Measures  The performance of our segments is evaluated based on several factors including a measure we call Adjusted EBITDA by segment. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion, loss on debt financings, IPO costs, stock compensation costs and transaction costs. Adjusted EBITDA is determined before considering the loss from discontinued operations, loss on debt financings and IPO costs, as these amounts are not viewed by management as part of our core business when assessing the performance of our segments or allocation of resources. Accretion expense is recognized on our asset retirement obligations and reflects the time value of money. Given that accretion is similar in nature to interest expense, it is treated consistently with interest expense, and is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.  We also evaluate the performance of our business based on a metric we call Gross Profit, which we define as operating income (loss) before general and administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion and transaction costs. Adjusted EBITDA and Gross Profit are used by the chief operating decision maker, along with other factors, to allocate resources. These measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations to U.S. GAAP financial measures included in the tables below, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. However, they should not be construed as being more important than other comparable U.S. GAAP measures and must be considered in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare such financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.

Materials.











We see opportunity around every corner to help build your community.Sourced from the highest quality sites.
Efficient production for consistency and strength.
Integrated product offering to our customers.
Summit Materials is a vertically integrated construction materials company that produces aggregates, cement, ready-mix concrete and asphalt, and offers paving, construction and other services.   These types of products and services touch almost every aspect of your daily life, from the roads you drive to work to the cell phone you use to call home.










Building Materials Fact
Concrete
has been used in some form since Roman times, it is the most universal construction material today.
 











Our Materials.





 

AggregatesAggregates are the building blocks of our nation’s construction industry. These natural resources are the foundation of products and services that develop our public and private infrastructure. The aggregate materials are sourced from our quarries, and are the key materials in production of asphalt, concrete and cement. We stand behind the process and quality from rock to road.
 





 

CementCement, when combined with aggregates and water, produces concrete. Cement is the binder that makes concrete durable, weather resistant and adaptable. Our state of the art cement plant and production process enable our companies and our customers to offer superior concrete products.
 





 

Ready-MixReady-mix is a highly versatile construction material that can be used to make everything from curbs to kitchen counters. Its flexible recipe characteristics allow for an end product that can assume almost any color, shape, texture and strength. Ready-mix concrete can be customized to suit your needs.
 





 

AsphaltAsphalt is one of the most common roadway materials used today; approximately 94 percent of our nation's roads are paved with asphalt. It is formed by the combination of aggregates and liquid asphalt. Asphalt is 100 percent renewable and the U.S. alone recycles nearly 60 million tons of asphalt each year.  
 





 

Paving ConstructionPaving is the final stage of Summit’s vertically integrated product offering. Our companies perform quality work that complements our materials by providing a downstream outlet to distribute these products. Our skilled labor force and quality service offering provide a one stop shop to our customers.
 






Our Process.




Site PlanningA site is chosen to be sustainable throughout and beyond extraction. Before the first stone is removed, we are already planning for the lifecycle of the site.




Safe ExtractionWe partner with our neighbors and our legislators to work responsibly in our environment throughout the extraction process.




Site RepurposingAs the last stone is removed, a site’s lifecycle progresses as it continues to provide communities with varying types of future development.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "intends," "trends," "plans," "estimates," "projects" or "anticipates" or similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans, expectations or intentions. Any and all statements made relating to the expectations for our anticipated benefits from recent acquisitions, the macroeconomic outlook for our markets, potential acquisition activity, our estimated and projected earnings, margins, costs, expenditures, cash flows, sales volumes and financial results are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those expected. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results.
In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or our objectives and plans will be achieved. Important factors could affect our results and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the factors discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Such factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC's website atwww.sec.gov.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.

Reports First Quarter 2017 ResultsBusiness WireMay 3, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareDENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Summit Materials, Inc. (NYSE: SUM, “Summit” or the “Company”), a leading vertically integrated construction materials company, today announced results for the first quarter 2017.For the three months ended April 1, 2017, the Company reported a basic loss per share of ($0.50) on a net loss of ($52.4) million, compared to a basic loss per share of ($0.42) on a net loss of ($21.1) million in the prior year period. On an adjusted basis, Summit reported a diluted loss per share of ($0.50) on a net loss of ($54.8) million, versus a diluted loss per share of ($0.42) on a net loss of ($42.5) million in the prior year period.“Our business performed ahead of expectations during the first quarter, as organic growth in materials sales volumes and average selling prices contributed to strong year-over-year increases in gross margins and Adjusted EBITDA,” stated Tom Hill, CEO of Summit Materials. “Demand within our core early-cycle residential and commercial construction markets continues to accelerate, while a combination of federal and state level funding for critical infrastructure projects remains a significant opportunity for us, particularly in Texas where a combination of FAST Act, Proposition 1 and Proposition 7 funding combine to support robust multi-year investment in public infrastructure.”“We forecast positive organic materials volume and price growth for the full-year 2017,” continued Hill. “Within our aggregates businesses, Utah, Virginia and the Carolinas are poised for another strong year, while our businesses in Austin and Vancouver have rebounded from prior year levels, with both regions reporting solid organic volume growth in the first quarter. As expected, our Cement Segment has continued to benefit from a combination of steady demand for product within our Mississippi River corridor markets and sustained growth in average selling prices,” continued Hill. “On an organic basis, sales volumes and average selling prices for cement increased 17.6% and 6.3%, respectively, in the first quarter 2017, when compared to the prior year period.”“On a year-to-date basis, we have completed six acquisitions, including four transactions that have closed since February,” continued Hill. “Together, these four acquisitions bring another 90 million tons of permitted aggregates reserves into our portfolio, while expanding our vertically-integrated aggregates and products businesses in Northeast Houston, South Carolina, Missouri and Vancouver. Our acquisition pipeline remains very active, with more than 20 transactions currently under review, including four potential acquisitions that are in late-stage diligence.”“Given contributions from recently completed acquisitions, together with expectations for continued organic growth within our business, we have increased our full-year Adjusted EBITDA guidance,” continued Hill. “For the full-year 2017, we project total Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $430 million to $445 million, up from the prior range of $410 million to $425 million. On a year-to-date basis, we have invested $180 million across six transactions, positioning us to meet or possibly exceed our full-year acquired EBITDA target of $40 million to $60 million per year. We are pleased with our strong start to the year and look forward to building on this momentum as we continue to create value for our shareholders.”“Exiting the first quarter, we had more than $370 million in cash and availability under our revolving credit facility,” stated Brian Harris, CFO of Summit Materials. “Given continued growth in trailing twelve-month free cash flow, together with available cash and liquidity, we are well positioned to support the ongoing growth of our business.”“Net leverage was 3.7x as of April 1, 2017, versus 4.5x in the prior year period and down from 3.9x at year-end 2016,” continued Harris. “Looking ahead, we continue to target a further reduction in net leverage to approximately 3.0x by year-end 2017, assuming the mid-point of our upwardly revised 2017 Adjusted EBITDA guidance.”First Quarter 2017 | Financial PerformanceNet revenue increased by 24.5% to $259.0 million in the first quarter 2017, versus $208.0 in the prior year period. The improvement in net revenue was primarily attributable to acquisition related sales volumes, higher organic sales volumes of aggregates, cement and asphalt, together with higher organic sales prices on aggregates and cement.Read MoreGross profit increased 29.3% to $66.7 million in the first quarter 2017, versus $51.6 million in the prior year period. Gross profit generated from the Company’s aggregates and cement assets represented 50% of total gross profit in the first quarter 2017, consistent with the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA increased 62% year-over-year to $13.6 million, versus $8.4 million in the prior year period, in what is typically the seasonally slowest quarter of the year.Selling, general and administrative expense increased 28.9% to $58.5 million, versus $45.4 million in the prior year period. Increased labor expense was mainly related to increased salaries and benefits resulting from completed acquisitions, coupled with higher employee incentive compensation.The Company reported an adjusted diluted net loss of ($0.50) per diluted share in the first quarter 2017, using 110.2 million weighted-average total shares. The shares of Class A common stock are issued by Summit Materials, Inc., and as such the earnings and equity interests of non-controlling interests, including LP units, are not included in basic earnings per share. Summit believes adjusted diluted net loss and Adjusted EPS are more representative of earnings performance, as these measures exclude the non-operating impact to earnings per share of any potential exchange of LP units for Class A common stock in any given quarter.West Segment: Adjusted EBITDA increased by 18.2% to $15.7 million in the first quarter 2017, when compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 11.9% in the first quarter 2017, versus 11.7% in the prior year period. Improved organic growth in average selling prices for aggregates, strong organic volume growth in asphalt and acquisition-related EBITDA contributions were partially offset by a decline in organic aggregates and ready-mix volumes, along with a slight organic decline in organic ready-mix average selling prices.East Segment: Adjusted EBITDA increased by 37.0% to $4.3 million in the first quarter 2017, when compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was down slightly to 5.2% in the first quarter 2017, versus 5.3% in the prior year period. Improved organic growth in average selling prices for aggregates, strong organic volume growth in aggregates and asphalt and acquisition-related EBITDA contributions were partially offset by a slight organic decline in ready-mix concrete volumes.Cement Segment: Adjusted EBITDA increased to $2.7 million in the first quarter 2017, versus $1.0 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 6.1% in the first quarter 2017, up from 2.9% in the prior year period. A year-over-year increase in average selling prices, organic sales volumes, improved production efficiencies and cost reductions all contributed to improved results.First Quarter 2017 | Results by Line of BusinessAggregates Business: Aggregates net revenues increased by 23.5% to $61.6 million the first quarter 2017, when compared to the prior year period. Aggregates gross profit as a percentage of aggregates net revenues increased 70 basis points to 43.6% in the first quarter 2017, versus 42.9% in the prior year period. Organic aggregates sales volumes and average selling prices increased 0.6% and 2.9%, respectively, in the first quarter 2017, when compared to the prior year period. Improved market conditions in the Company’s Austin, North Texas and Vancouver markets, together with continued strength in the Utah markets, contributed to the year-over-year improvement in organic volumes.Cement Business: Cement segment net revenues increased 29.0% to $43.8 million in the first quarter 2017, when compared to the prior year period. Cement gross profit as a percentage of cement segment net revenues was 14.3% in the first quarter 2017, 150 basis points higher than in the prior year period. Organic sales volumes and average selling prices of cement increased 17.6% and 6.3%, respectively, when compared to the prior year period. Favorable weather conditions and new customer acquisitions contributed to strong organic demand in the first quarter, while continued organic growth in sales prices was attributable to previously announced price increases.Products Business: Net revenues increased 21.9% to $124.0 million in the first quarter 2017, when compared to the prior year period. Products gross margin as a percentage of net revenues declined 190 basis points to 21.2% in the first quarter 2017, when compared to the prior year period. Organic sales volumes of asphalt and ready-mix concrete increased 64.5% and decreased 11.4%, respectively, when compared to the prior year period. Strong paving activity in the Austin market contributed to increased organic volume growth in asphalt, while lower organic sales volumes of ready-mix concrete was attributable to residential softness in the Houston market.Acquisition Program UpdateThe Company has completed six acquisitions on a year-to-date basis, including four acquisitions that have closed since February 2017. In total, these four acquisitions bring to Summit approximately 90 million tons of permitted aggregates reserves, four quarries, three ready-mix concrete plants, one asphalt plant and related paving operations. The four acquisitions represent compelling bolt-on opportunities to existing platform businesses in Texas, South Carolina, Missouri and British Columbia. The total combined acquisition spend on the four acquisitions was approximately $70 million. Together with the previously announced acquisitions of Everist Materials and Razorback Concrete, the combined year-to-date acquisition spend is approximately $180 million.Hanna’s Bend Aggregate (Texas). Hanna’s Bend is a sand and gravel supplier with significant permitted reserves in northeast Houston. Hanna’s Bend is an ideal fit with Summit’s existing aggregates operations in the Houston market. The Company estimates that Hanna’s Bend’s end-market exposure is largely weighted toward non-residential and residential construction markets.Carolina Sand (South Carolina). Carolina Sand is a construction and specialty sand supplier that enhances Summit’s existing exposure to the coastal South Carolina market and brings attractive synergy opportunities to the Company’s business in that region. The Company estimates that Carolina Sand’s end-market exposure is entirely weighted toward the private markets, with an emphasis on non-residential construction.Sandidge Concrete (Missouri). Sandidge is a ready-mix concrete business in southern Missouri that represents an attractive bolt-on acquisition to our existing Con-Agg platform. The Company estimates that Sandidge’s end market exposure is weighted mainly toward private markets with some public market exposure.Winvan Paving (British Columbia). Vancouver-based Winvan is an asphalt and paving company that represents an attractive bolt-on acquisition to our aggregates business in British Columbia and is consistent with our vertically integrated materials growth strategy. The Company estimates that Winvan’s end-market exposure is weighted equally between private and public markets.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt April 1, 2017, the Company had cash on hand of $156.1 million and borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility of $215.4 million. The borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility is net of $19.6 million of outstanding letters of credit, and is fully available to the Company within the terms and covenant requirements of its credit agreement. As of April 1, 2017, the Company had $1.5 billion in debt outstanding. The Company’s debt instruments are long-dated. The Company’s $235.0 million revolving credit facility has a maturity of March 2020, while the $250 million 8.5% senior unsecured notes and the $650 million 6.125% senior unsecured notes have maturities of April 2022 and July 2023, respectively. The Company also has a $639 million senior secured term loan maturing July 2022. The Company’s weighted average estimated cost of debt was 5.6% as of March 2017.2017 Financial Guidance & OutlookThe Company is raising its full-year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA guidance from a range of $410.0 million to $425.0 million to a range of $430 million to $445 million. The upwardly revised Adjusted EBITDA outlook assumes organic improvement, coupled with the partial-year impact of the six acquisitions announced since the beginning of 2017. No additional potential acquisitions are included within the Company’s full-year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA guidance.Including the impact of six acquisitions completed on a year-to-date basis, the Company is raising its gross capital expenditure guidance by $5 million to a range of $140 million to $160 million for the full-year 2017. Revised capital expenditure guidance includes several maintenance and profit-improvement projects. Longer-term, the Company expects gross capital expenditures to approximate 7-8% of net revenue per annum.Webcast and Conference Call InformationSummit Materials will conduct a conference call today at 11:00 a.m. eastern time (9:00 a.m. mountain time) to review the Company’s first quarter 2017 financial results.

Summit is a geographically diverse, materials-based business of scale that offers customers a single-source provider of construction materials and related downstream products in the public infrastructure, residential and nonresidential, and end markets. Summit has a strong track record of successful acquisitions since its founding and continues to pursue growth opportunities in new and existing markets. For more information about Summit Materials, please visit www.summit-materials.com.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulates the use of “non-GAAP financial measures,” such as Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, gross profit, free cash flow and net leverage which are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). We have provided these measures because, among other things, we believe that they provide investors with additional information to measure our performance, evaluate our ability to service our debt and evaluate certain flexibility under our restrictive covenants. Our adjusted net income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and gross profit may vary from the use of such terms by others and should not be considered as alternatives to or more important than net income (loss), operating income (loss), revenue or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance or to cash flows as measures of liquidity.Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and other non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA are that these measures do not reflect: (i) our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (iii) interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest and principal payments on our debt; and (iv) income tax payments we are required to make. Because of these limitations, we rely primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and other non-GAAP measures on a supplemental basis.Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, gross profit, adjusted net income (loss), Adjusted EPS and free cash flow reflect additional ways of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to U.S. GAAP financial measures included in the tables attached to this press release, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release are included in the attached tables. Because GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis are not accessible, and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort, we have not provided reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP measures. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “intends,” “trends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “projects” or “anticipates” or similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans, expectations or intentions. Any and all statements made relating to the expectations for our anticipated benefits from recent acquisitions, the macroeconomic outlook for our markets, potential acquisition activity, our estimated and projected earnings, margins, costs, expenditures, cash flows, sales volumes and financial results are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those expected. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results.In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or our objectives and plans will be achieved.
