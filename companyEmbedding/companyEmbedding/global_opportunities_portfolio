Portfolio Characteristics 

 
Portfolio Characteristics 



P/B Ratio
The price to book (P/B) value ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. The book value of a company is a measure of how much a company&#39;s assets are worth assuming the company&#39;s debts are paid off. Negative book values are excluded from this calculation and holding price to book ratios over 25 are set to 25.

as of 30-Jun-2017



1.71




P/E Ratio - Forward
The forward price-to-earnings ratio is used to assess a company’s valuation. To compute this ratio, the latest closing price is divided by the company’s consensus mean EPS estimate for the next unreported fiscal year. The ratio represents a weighted harmonic mean of the forward price-to-earnings ratios of its holdings with negative values being excluded from the calculation.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary.

Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.

International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.

The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.

Performance may be attributable to unusually high IPO profits. There is no guarantee this level of performance will be repeated. IPO securities have no trading history and the price may be volatile.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.

Commentary

As of June 30, 2017 

	Quarter in review


		The JPMorgan Global Bond Opportunities Fund returned 1.22% (I Class Shares) compared to the Bloomberg Barclays Multiverse Index return of 2.64%, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.

		Exposure to high yield contributed to performance due to a combination of strong fundamentals, a good earnings season, continued low default rates and supportive technicals.

		Investment-grade debt helped results as the sector posted strong performance after a strong earnings season. Technicals were favorable due to continued foreign investor demand.

		Emerging market debt also contributed, partly due to the attractive carry of selective hard/local currency sovereign bonds.

		The Fund's government rates exposure detracted as our core view of higher yields in developed markets was challenged, particularly in the beginning of the quarter.

		Our emerging markets foreign exchange exposure detracted, mainly due to political volatility in Brazil and underperformance of the Russian ruble.


	Looking ahead


		We maintain our expectations that global growth momentum will continue and central bank accommodation will remain supportive for global risk assets in the near term.

		We have a negative view on U.S. duration as we expect a more hawkish Fed and a rebound in U.S. growth to drive Treasury yields higher by year-end to the 2.5-3.0% range.

		We are still constructive on spread sectors through investment-grade and high-yield corporates due to positive technicals and credit fundamentals. High-yield default rates are low and spreads could provide a modest cushion in an environment of rising rates.

		We particularly believe that European bank capital (Alternative Tier 1) offers improving fundamentals and benefits from continued buying from the ECB.

		We continue to be selective on emerging markets as we are constructive on the general improvement in these developing economies, but recognize significant dispersion across countries’ political and economic environments.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 0.90% for A Shares, 1.30% for C Shares, 0.65% for I Shares and 0.50% for R6 Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 12/31/2017 for A Shares, 12/31/2017 for C Shares, 12/31/2017 for I Shares and 12/31/2017 for R6 Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Bloomberg Barclays Multiverse Index is a measure of the global fixed-income bond market that combines the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index and the Bloomberg Barclays Global High Yield Index. The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index measures grade debt from twenty-four different local currency markets. The Bloomberg Barclays Global High-Yield Index measures the global high-yield fixed income markets. The performance of the Lipper Global Income Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. An individual cannot invest directly in an index. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops. The Fund is aggressively managed and, therefore, is subject to greater fluctuation than an investment in a growth fund investing in proven growth equities. Net currency exposure is inclusive of the fund's derivative positions. International investing bears greater risk due to social, economic, regulatory and political instability in countries in "emerging markets." This makes emerging market securities more volatile and less liquid developed market securities. Changes in exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can also affect returns. Securities rated below investment grade are considered "high-yield," "non-investment grade," "below investment-grade," or "junk bonds." They generally are rated in the fifth or lower rating categories of Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. Although they can provide higher yields than higher rated securities, they can carry greater risk. The value of investments in mortgage-related and asset-backed securities will be influenced by the factors affecting the housing market and the assets underlying such securities. The securities may decline in value, face valuation difficulties, become more volatile and/or become illiquid. They are also subject to prepayment risk, which occurs when mortgage holders refinance or otherwise repay their loans sooner than expected, creating an early return of principal to holders of the loans.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. Duration: Measures price sensitivity of fixed income securities to interest rate changes. Average Life: The length of time the principal of a debt issue is expected to be outstanding.

Under the new operating structure, its main Google business will include search, ads, maps, apps, YouTube and Android and the related technical infrastructure (the 'Google business'). Businesses such as Calico, Nest, and Fiber, as well as its investing arms, such as Google Ventures and Google Capital, and incubator projects, such as Google X, will be managed separately from the Google business. The new legal and operating structure will be introduced in phases over the coming months and when finalized, Google anticipates that it will result in two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes, with the Google business presented separately from other Alphabet businesses taken as a whole.

Services provided include pay television, broadband internet, fixed line telephony and mobile phones for both residential and corporate customers. It operates in Western Europe, the United States, Israel and the Overseas Territories (currently comprising the French Caribbean and the Indian Ocean regions and the Dominican Republic). The company was founded by Patrick Drahi on May 18, 2015 and is headquartered in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.Baidu, Inc.www.baidu.comBaidu is the leading internet search engine in China. As with Google, advertisers bid on Baidu-generated "key words." Baidu is paid a fee when one uses its search function, clicks on a key word, and moves to the advertiser's website. The company has nearly 80% market share of Chinese search, making it more dominant than Google is in the United States.

As online penetration increases, advertisers should begin to switch their advertising spending from more traditional media (ie TV, newspaper) to online mediums (ie internet search, video).  The average Chinese person spends roughly 3x of his or her personal time using the internet versus watching TV. Despite this dynamic, 60% of China's advertising budgets are spent on TV, 6x those that target the internet. As the proportion of advertising spend adjusts to time spent on various media activities, online advertising spending should begin to take share.

As social networking websites like Facebook and Twitter become more prevalent, concerns arise over whether these platforms can become a popular method for advertising, diverting business from Baidu. However, the effectiveness and return on investment of the search medium is well-documented, while the newer social advertising business models are still young and unproven.Ryanair Holdingswww.ryanair.comRyanair Holdings Plc operates an ultra-low cost, scheduled-passenger airline serving short-haul, point-to-point routes between Ireland, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Morocco.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




Fixed-income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation, and reinvestment risks; and possible loss of principal. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities falls. Asset-backed, mortgage-backed or mortgage-related securities are subject to prepayment and extension risks. High yield bonds are subject to greater price volatility, illiquidity, and possibility of default. International investments are subject to special risks, including currency fluctuations and social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Derivatives, such as options and futures, can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. As a non-diversified Fund, it is permitted to invest a higher percentage of its assets in any one issuer than a diversified fund, which may magnify the Fund’s losses from events affecting a particular issuer. Leverage may increase volatility and possibility of loss.  Active management does not ensure gains or protect against market declines.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: The performance shown represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Principal value and investment returns will fluctuate, and investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. For performance data including the effects of sales charges, Class A and A2 shares reflect the deduction of a maximum front-end sales charge of 4.25%. Class C1 shares have no initial or contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), but are subject to a 12b-1 fee. One-year returns for Class C shares reflect a CDSC of 1.0%. Total return figures are based on the NAV per share applied to shareholder subscriptions and redemptions, which may differ from the NAV per share disclosed in Fund shareholder reports. Performance would have been lower if fees had not been waived in various periods.
Different minimums may apply to clients of certain service agents. See the Fund's prospectus for additional information.
An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.


Net Asset Value (NAV): An investment option’s net asset value (“NAV”) per unit or unit price is calculated by dividing the value of its net assets by the total number of units outstanding. 
























Morningstar proprietary ratings are based on risk-adjusted returns and are subject to change every month. The Overall Morningstar Rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. A 4- or 5-star rating does not necessarily imply that a fund achieved positive results for the period. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Share classes have a common portfolio and different expense structures.














**Gross expenses are the Fund's total annual operating expenses for the share class(es) shown.  Net expenses for Class(es) A, A2, C, C1, FI, I, IS & R reflect contractual fee waivers and/or reimbursements, where these reductions reduce the Fund's gross expenses, which cannot be terminated prior to Dec 31, 2018 without Board consent.

 Characteristics 






characteristics












Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.


Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest), or an equivalent and/or similar rating. For this purpose, Brandywine Global Investment Management assigns each security the middle rating from these three agencies. When only two agencies provide ratings, the lower of the two ratings will be assigned. When only one agency assigns a rating, that rating will be used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Funds portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

 Holdings 






Holdings








IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

Investment Approach

The Portfolio seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing globally in high-quality established and emerging companies that the investment team believes are undervalued at the time of purchase. To achieve its objective, the investment team seeks companies with sustainable competitive advantages and long-term growth that creates value, rather than focusing on short-term events, with stock selection informed by rigorous fundamental analysis.

Class A shares include maximum front-end sales charge of 5.50% (Alternatives), 5.25% (Equity) and 4.25% (Fixed Income).  Class B shares include deferred sales charge of 5.00% which declines to zero after sixth year.  Class C shares include deferred sales charge of 1.00% which declines to zero after first year. Class L shares, Class I, and Class IS shares are not subject to a sales charge.
Where the net expense ratio is lower than the gross expense ratio, certain fees have been waived and/ or expenses reimbursed. These waivers and/or reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of the applicable fund’s current prospectus (unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus) or until such time as the fund's Board of Directors/Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the fund's current prospectus. The minimum initial investment is $5,000,000 for Class I shares.

 The Fund has suspended offering Class L shares of the Portfolio for sale to all investors.
Class IS shares, are  being offered only to eligible investors who must meet a minimum initial investment of $10,000,000 or be a defined contribution, defined benefit or other employer sponsored employee benefit plan, whether or not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), in each case subject to the discretion of the Portfolio's investment advisor.
Growth of Investment illustration is based on an initial investment of $10,000 made since fund inception, assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but does not include sales charges and fees. Performance would have been lower if sales charges and fees had been included. Results are hypothetical.

Subject to change daily. Fund information, Portfolio Composition and Characteristics are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security or securities in the sectors and/or countries presented. 

 Returns are net of fees and assume all dividends and income. Returns for less than one year are cumulative (not annualized). Performance of other share classes will vary.

 Please keep in mind that double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS DEFINITIONS 
Active share is a measure of the percentage of stock holdings in a manager’s portfolio that differs from the benchmark index (based on holdings and weight of holdings). Active share scores range from 0% - 100%. A score of 100% means you are completely different from the benchmark. Free-cash-flow yield is a financial ratio that measures a company’s operating free-cash-flow minus its capital expenditures per share and dividing by its price per share. Free-cash-flow yield ratio is calculated by using the underlying securities of the portfolio. Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a calculation that represents the rate of return a company makes on the cash it invests in its business. Tracking error is the standard deviation of the difference between the portfolio and the benchmark returns. 
Turnover is sourced from the fund's current prospectus.
The index data displayed under allocations are calculated using MSIM and other third-party methodologies and may differ from data published by the vendor.
RISK/RETURN DEFINITIONS 
 Active share is the fraction of the portfolio or fund that is invested differently than its benchmark as of the last day of the reporting period. A portfolio with a high degree of Active share does not assure a fund’s relative outperformance. Alpha is the excess return or value added (positive or negative) of the portfolio’s return relative to the return of the benchmark. Beta is a measure of the relative volatility of a security or portfolio to the market's upward or downward movements. A beta greater than 1.0 identifies an issue or fund that will move more than the market, while a beta less than 1.0 identifies an issue or fund that will move less than the market. The Beta of the Market is always equal to 1. Information ratio is the portfolio’s alpha or excess return per unit of risk, as measured by tracking error, versus the portfolio’s benchmark. R squared measures how well an investment’s returns correlate to an index. An R squared of 100 means the portfolio performance is 100% correlated to the index’s, whereas a low r-squared means that the portfolio performance is less correlated to the index’s. Sharpe ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated as the ratio of excess return to standard deviation. The Sharpe ratio determines reward per unit of risk. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the historical risk-adjusted performance. Standard deviation measures how widely individual performance returns, within a performance series, are dispersed from the average or mean value. Tracking error is the amount by which the performance of the portfolio differs from that of the benchmark.
RISK CONSIDERATIONS 
 There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Privately placed and restricted securities may be subject to resale restrictions as well as a lack of publicly available information, which will increase their illiquidity and could adversely affect the ability to value and sell them (liquidity risk).
Morningstar
 Rankings: The percentile rankings are based on the average annual total returns for the periods stated and do not include any sales charges, but do include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains and Rule 12b-1 fees. The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1.
Ratings: The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Ratings do not take into account sales loads.

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.
