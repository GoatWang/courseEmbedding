What Makes Us Exceptional— And Sets Us Apart 

Masters of One. Most financial professionals are “jack-of-all-trades, master of none.” The DRL Group has taken a different approach to financial services. “We are Masters of One”, having spent decades doing one thing well: fixed-income investing. We specialize in the bond market, helping provide fixed-income solutions for our clients. You can expect this singular focus from the DRL Group.
Price-Efficient Trade Execution: Thanks to our state-of-the-art technology, DRL Group clients have access to both the primary and secondary bond markets. This provides you with efficient pricing because we can execute trades on both the buy and sell side of the transaction, which in most cases, could result in higher returns.
Municipal and Corporate Bond Specialists. Our team of professionals is focused on providing fixed-income solutions to produce a stable income stream—and help protect principal value. We create customized bond portfolios to preserve capital and minimize risk, while maximizing client returns in unpredictable market environments.
Tax Free Investment Solutions. Our clients are interested in shielding their investment income from taxes. For investors who want tax-exempt investment solutions, we can purchase at dealer level pricing, with a nominal mark up on attractive tax-free bonds. This results in higher yields for our clientele.
Well Versed with Major Market Fluctuations. With over 35 years of collective industry expertise, we have been through significant ups and downs of the economy and the market. We have extensive experience adapting our clients’ portfolios to ever-changing market conditions. We will do the same for you.
Personalized Process. All clients receive the personal attention they deserve. We take the time to understand each client’s needs based on their tax bracket, age, goals, and financial situation. We continuously analyze and update strategies to meet our clients’ evolving individual objectives for income, growth, and asset protection. And, our clients deal directly with the owners of the firm—not junior advisors or a call center. We know our clients’ time is extremely valuable, so when a client calls, we pick up the phone. You can always expect good, old-fashioned service.
Award Recognition. The DRL Group has been consistently recognized as one of Houston’s Top Wealth Managers. The National Association of Board Certified Advisory Practices (NABCAP) named us among the Top Wealth Managers two years running, and the Houston Business Journal featured us in both 2012 and 2013. We have also been showcased as one of the Best Businesses of Katy, TX, for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. You’ll be taken care of by an award-winning team.
Independent. Since we are not owned by a bank or an insurance company, we sell no proprietary, high commission products. Instead, the financial products we do offer are dependent on what’s in the best interest of our clients. All of our operations are highly regulated. Your investment funds are held at our custodian, National Financial Services, a 100%-owned subsidiary of Fidelity Investments.

All Fixed Income News












In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
Lower-quality debt securities generally offer higher yields, but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the fund carefully before investing. Download a prospectus, or a summary prospectus, if available, that contains this and other information about the fund, and read it carefully before investing.

Notes & Disclosures
 For share classes offered after the fund's inception date, the total returns quoted reflect the performance of the fund's initial share class(es), adjusted to reflect applicable non-recurring sales charges. Performance for these share classes has not been adjusted to reflect any class-specific distribution or servicing fees or any differences in operating expenses. Had such fees and expenses been reflected, returns for these share class returns during such periods would have been lower. Performance is historical and not indicative of future results. Investment return, yield, and principal value will fluctuate and an investor will receive more or less than the original cost upon redemption. Investors should consider, when deciding whether to purchase a particular class of shares, the investment amount, anticipated holding period and other relevant factors, and should read the prospectus carefully.Source: Morningstar, Inc.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the fund carefully before investing. Download a prospectus, or a summary prospectus, if available, that contains this and other information about the fund, and read it carefully before investing.

Notes & Disclosures
 Effective 3/31/03 the fund converted to a multiclass structure, and outstanding shares on such date were reclassified as Class Z shares.  Class Z shares are closed to new investors.  The fund also offers other share classes that have different sales and distribution charges.  Had sales charges and distribution expenses to which the fund's other share classes are subject been applicable to Class Z shares, returns would have been lower. Performance is historical and not indicative of future results. Investment return, yield, and principal value will fluctuate and an investor will receive more or less than the original cost upon redemption. Investors should consider, when deciding whether to purchase a particular class of shares, the investment amount, anticipated holding period and other relevant factors, and should read the prospectus carefully.Source: Morningstar, Inc.

Ratings reflect sales loads.The fund represents a single portfolio with multiple share classes that have different expense structures.Subsidized yield may reflect the waiver of receipt of a portion of the management fee, and/or a reimbursement of the fund expenses by the Dreyfus Corporation, which would have had the effect of lowering the fund's expense ratio and generating a higher yield.The Dreyfus Corporation has contractually agreed  to waive receipt of its fees and/or assume the expenses of the fund so that total annual fund operating expenses of none of the classes (excluding Rule 12b-1 fees, shareholder services fees for Class A, C, I, Y and Z shares, taxes,
brokerage commissions, extraordinary expenses, interest expenses and
commitment fees on borrowings) exceed 0.45%. Dreyfus may terminate this agreement upon at least 90 days' prior notice to investors, but has 
committed not to do so until at least January 1, 2018.The "Dreyfus Investment Style Classification" graphically depicts the fund's investment strategy as described in its Prospectus.

What Makes Us Exceptional— And Sets Us Apart 

Masters of One. Most financial professionals are “jack-of-all-trades, master of none.” The DRL Group has taken a different approach to financial services. “We are Masters of One”, having spent decades doing one thing well: fixed-income investing. We specialize in the bond market, helping provide fixed-income solutions for our clients. You can expect this singular focus from the DRL Group.
Price-Efficient Trade Execution: Thanks to our state-of-the-art technology, DRL Group clients have access to both the primary and secondary bond markets. This provides you with efficient pricing because we can execute trades on both the buy and sell side of the transaction, which in most cases, could result in higher returns.
Municipal and Corporate Bond Specialists. Our team of professionals is focused on providing fixed-income solutions to produce a stable income stream—and help protect principal value. We create customized bond portfolios to preserve capital and minimize risk, while maximizing client returns in unpredictable market environments.
Tax Free Investment Solutions. Our clients are interested in shielding their investment income from taxes. For investors who want tax-exempt investment solutions, we can purchase at dealer level pricing, with a nominal mark up on attractive tax-free bonds. This results in higher yields for our clientele.
Well Versed with Major Market Fluctuations. With over 35 years of collective industry expertise, we have been through significant ups and downs of the economy and the market. We have extensive experience adapting our clients’ portfolios to ever-changing market conditions. We will do the same for you.
Personalized Process. All clients receive the personal attention they deserve. We take the time to understand each client’s needs based on their tax bracket, age, goals, and financial situation. We continuously analyze and update strategies to meet our clients’ evolving individual objectives for income, growth, and asset protection. And, our clients deal directly with the owners of the firm—not junior advisors or a call center. We know our clients’ time is extremely valuable, so when a client calls, we pick up the phone. You can always expect good, old-fashioned service.
Award Recognition. The DRL Group has been consistently recognized as one of Houston’s Top Wealth Managers. The National Association of Board Certified Advisory Practices (NABCAP) named us among the Top Wealth Managers two years running, and the Houston Business Journal featured us in both 2012 and 2013. We have also been showcased as one of the Best Businesses of Katy, TX, for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. You’ll be taken care of by an award-winning team.
Independent. Since we are not owned by a bank or an insurance company, we sell no proprietary, high commission products. Instead, the financial products we do offer are dependent on what’s in the best interest of our clients. All of our operations are highly regulated. Your investment funds are held at our custodian, National Financial Services, a 100%-owned subsidiary of Fidelity Investments.
