Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy).

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.50)Consensus Price Target: $15.00 (15.87% downside)

	Re:


	Transocean Partners LLC Registration Statement on Form S-1




	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	We have acted as U.S. counsel for Transocean Partners LLC (the Company), a Marshall Islands limited liability company, with respect
	to certain legal matters in connection with the offer and sale by Transocean Partners Holdings Limited of common units representing limited liability company interests in the Company. We have also participated in the preparation of a Prospectus (the
	Prospectus) forming part of the Registration Statement on Form S-1, No. 333-196958 (the Registration Statement).


	This opinion is based on various facts and assumptions, and is conditioned upon certain representations made by the Company as to factual
	matters through a certificate of an officer of the Company (the Officers Certificate). In addition, this opinion is based upon the factual representations of the Company concerning its business, properties, and governing documents
	as set forth in the Registration Statement.


	In our capacity as counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and factual examinations
	and inquiries, including an examination of originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of such documents, corporate records, and other instruments, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this
	opinion. In our examination, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures thereon, the legal capacity of natural persons executing such documents, and the conformity to authentic
	original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. For the purpose of our opinion, we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in the above-referenced documents or in the Officers Certificate. In
	addition, in rendering this opinion we have assumed the truth and accuracy of all representations and statements made to us which are qualified as to knowledge or belief, without regard to such qualification.


	We are opining herein as to the effect on the subject transaction only of the federal income tax laws of the United States, and we express no
	opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of other federal laws, foreign laws, the laws of any state or any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any other local agencies within any
	state. We hereby confirm that all statements of legal conclusions contained in the discussion in the Prospectus under the caption Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations constitute the opinion of Baker Botts L.L.P. with respect
	to the matters set forth therein as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, subject to the assumptions, qualifications, and limitations set forth therein. No opinion is expressed as to any matter not discussed therein.


	This opinion is rendered to you as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, and we undertake no obligation to update this opinion
	subsequent to the date hereof. This opinion is based on various statutory provisions, regulations promulgated thereunder, and interpretations thereof by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts having jurisdiction over such matters, all of which
	are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. Also, any variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the representations described above, including in the Registration Statement and the Officers Certificate, may
	affect the conclusions stated herein.

	Purchasers transferees, immediately after the Closing Date, to be the owner of such valid leasehold interests or fee ownership interests in and to the Assets as are necessary to enable Purchaser, or Purchasers transferees, to own and
	operate the Assets in substantially the same manner that the Assets were owned and/or operated by Seller, or Sellers transferors, immediately prior to the date hereof, (ii) without limiting the generality of the other provisions of this
	Agreement, the Contribution Agreement or the Omnibus Agreement, any judicial determination substantially to the effect that Seller did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange therefor or was rendered insolvent by reason of the sale,

	(b)(iii)

	above, to the extent that Seller is notified by Purchaser of such Liabilities within three years after the Closing Date; and (c) (i) any documentary, filing, recording, transfer, deed and conveyance Taxes (as defined in the

	notified by Purchaser of any such Tax liabilities within the applicable statute of limitations plus 60 days, but excluding any Taxes reserved on the books of Purchaser on the Closing Date. Any indemnification pursuant to this paragraph 2 shall be
	treated as an adjustment to the Asset Purchase Price.


	3. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this Agreement, the aggregate
	liability under (i) clause (a) of paragraph 2 of this Agreement, (ii) similar indemnity provisions contained in all other Assignments and Bills of Sale executed in connection with the Contribution Agreement and (iii) the

	Post-Closing Adjustment

	 means the amount equal to $[]
	(

	Initial Net Working Capital

	) minus Actual Net Working Capital. Any Post-Closing Adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 4 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Asset Purchase Price.

	reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Transocean Parties by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus,
	any issuer free writing prospectus or road show or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto. Each Transocean Party acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page of the Prospectus regarding
	delivery of the Units and (ii) under the heading Underwriting in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Units, the sentences related to
	concessions and reallowances and the paragraphs related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any
	Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.




	(c) In case any proceeding (including any
	governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 11(a) or 11(b), such person (the 

	indemnified party

	) shall promptly notify the person against
	whom such indemnity may be sought (the 

	indemnifying party

	) in writing, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party to the extent that the
	indemnifying party does not suffer actual prejudice as a result of such failure, and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified
	party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own
	counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the
	indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable amount of time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the
	indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in
	respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for any
	such indemnified parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such control persons and affiliates of any Underwriters, such firm shall be
	designated in writing by Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC. In the case of any such separate firm for the Transocean Parties, and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company.
	The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff,




	 




	32







	the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any
	time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall
	be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party
	shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or
	threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such
	indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.




	(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 11(a) or 11(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or
	insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable
	by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties, on the one hand, and the indemnified
	party or parties, on the other hand, from the offering of the Units or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 11(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative
	benefits referred to in clause 11(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties, on the one hand, and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that
	resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Transocean Parties, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the
	offering of the Units shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Units (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Unitholder and the total underwriting discounts and commissions
	received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Units. The relative fault of the Transocean Parties, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on
	the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by any of the
	Transocean Parties or by the Underwriters and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters respective obligations to contribute pursuant
	to this Section 11 are several in proportion to the respective number of Units they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.




	(e) The Transocean Parties and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 11 were determined by

	pro rata

	allocation (even if the
	Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in




	 




	33







	Section 11(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 11(d) shall be deemed to include,
	subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 11, no
	Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Units exceeds the amount of any damages that
	such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities
	Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 11 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be
	available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.




	(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this
	Section 11 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Transocean Parties and the Selling Unitholder contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of
	this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter, the Transocean Parties or any person controlling any Transocean Party and
	(iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Units.




	12.

	Termination of this Agreement

	.




	(a)

	Termination

	. The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Transocean Parties, if after the
	execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Firm Closing Date or, with respect to any Additional Units, an Option Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be,
	either of the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company should have been suspended on any exchange or on any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities
	settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any
	outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in
	your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Units on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.




	(b)

	Survival

	. If this Agreement is terminated, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except
	as provided in Section 9 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 2, 9, 11, and 17 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.




	13.

	Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters

	. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.




	 




	34







	If, on the Firm Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more
	of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Units that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Units which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to
	purchase is not more than

	one-tenth

	of the aggregate number of the Units to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Firm Units set
	forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate number of Firm Units set forth opposite the names of all such

	non-defaulting

	Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may
	specify, to purchase the Units which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date;

	provided

	that in no event shall the number of Units that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant
	to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 13 by an amount in excess of

	one-ninth

	of such number of Units without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Firm Closing Date, any
	Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Units and the aggregate number of Firm Units with respect to which such default occurs is more than

	one-tenth

	of the aggregate number of Firm
	Units to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Transocean Parties for the purchase of such Firm Units are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of
	any

	non-defaulting

	Underwriter or the Transocean Parties. In any such case either you or the Transocean Parties shall have the right to postpone the Firm Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven
	days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or
	Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Units and the aggregate number of Additional Units with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Units to be purchased on such Option
	Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Units to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (ii) purchase not less than the number of Additional
	Units that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such
	Underwriter under this Agreement.




	14.

	Entire Agreement

	. (a) This Agreement represents the entire agreement
	between the Transocean Parties, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, with respect to the preparation of any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale
	of the Units.




	(b) The Transocean Parties acknowledge that in connection with the offering of the Units: (i) the
	Underwriters have acted at arms-length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Transocean Parties or any other person, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Transocean Parties only those duties and obligations set forth in this
	Agreement and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Transocean Parties. The Transocean Parties waive to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims they may have against the Underwriters arising from
	an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Units.




	 




	35







	15.

	Counterparts

	. This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of
	which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.




	16.

	Applicable Law

	. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York. The Transocean Parties hereby
	submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the United States federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York (a 

	New York Court

	) in any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
	or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Transocean Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
	in a New York Court and irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such suit or proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Transocean Parties have appointed
	Transocean Partners LLC as their authorized agent (the 

	Authorized Agent

	) upon whom process may be served in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein which
	may be instituted in any New York Court, by any Underwriter, the directors, officers, affiliates, employees and agents of any Underwriter, or by any person who controls any Underwriter, and expressly accepts the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any
	such court in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding. The Transocean Parties hereby represent and warrant that the Authorized Agent has accepted such appointment and has agreed to act as said agent for service of process, and each of them
	agrees to take any and all action, including the filing of any and all documents that may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and effect as aforesaid. Service of process upon the Authorized Agent shall be deemed, in every
	respect, effective service of process upon the Transocean Parties. To the extent that any of the Transocean Parties has or hereafter may acquire any immunity (on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise) from the jurisdiction of any court or from any
	legal process with respect to itself or its property, each of the Transocean Parties irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such immunity in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding.




	17.

	Judgment Currency

	. If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder into
	any currency other than United States dollars, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Underwriters could purchase
	United States dollars with such other currency in The City of New York on the business day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Transocean Parties with respect to any sum due to any Underwriter or any person
	controlling any Underwriter shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than United States dollars, not be discharged until the first business day following receipt by such Underwriter or controlling person of any sum in such other
	currency, and only to the extent that such Underwriter or controlling person may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase United States dollars with such other currency. If the United States dollars so purchased are less than the sum
	originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person hereunder, the Transocean Parties agree as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Underwriter or controlling person against such loss. If the United
	States dollars so purchased are greater than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person hereunder, such Underwriter or controlling person agrees to pay to any such Transocean Party an amount equal to the excess of the dollars
	so purchased over the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person hereunder.




	 




	36







	18.

	Foreign Taxes

	. All payments made by the Transocean Parties under this Agreement,
	if any, will be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of any non-U.S. taxing authority unless the
	Transocean Parties are or become required by law to withhold or deduct such taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges. In such event, the Transocean Parties will pay such additional amounts as will result, after such withholding or
	deduction, in the receipt by each Underwriter and each person controlling any Underwriter, as the case may be, of the amounts that would otherwise have been receivable in respect thereof, except to the extent such taxes, duties, assessments or other
	governmental charges (i) were imposed by reason of any present or former connection between an Underwriter and any such non-U.S. jurisdiction, otherwise than solely from the execution of this Agreement or the receipt of payments hereunder or
	thereunder; or (ii) would not have been imposed but for the failure of such Underwriter to comply with any certification, identification or other reporting requirements concerning nationality, residence, identity or connection with such
	non-U.S. jurisdiction of such Underwriter if such compliance is required or imposed by law as a precondition to an exemption from, or reduction in, such tax, duty or charge. The Transocean Parties further agree to indemnify and hold harmless the
	Underwriters against any documentary, stamp, value added, sales, financial transaction or similar issuance or recordation tax, including any interest and penalties, on the placement of the Units and on the execution and delivery of this Agreement.




	19.

	Headings

	. The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and
	shall not be deemed a part of this Agreement.




	20.

	), providing for the public offering (the 

	Public Offering

	) by the Underwriters of up
	to

	[


	


	]

	common units (the 

	Units

	) representing limited liability company interests in the Company (the 

	Common Units

	).




	To induce the Underwriters that may participate in the Public Offering to continue their efforts in connection with the Public Offering,
	the undersigned hereby agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters, it will not, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending 180 days after the date of the final prospectus (the
	

	Restricted Period

	) relating to the Public Offering (the 

	Prospectus

	), (1) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any
	option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Common Units beneficially owned (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3




	 




	E-1







	of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 

	Exchange Act

	)), by the undersigned or any other securities so owned convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
	Common Units or (2) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Common Units, whether any such transaction described in clause (1) or
	(2) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Units or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to (a) transactions relating to Common Units or other securities acquired in open market
	transactions after the completion of the Public Offering,

	provided

	that no filing under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act shall be required or shall be voluntarily made in connection with subsequent sales of Common Units or other
	securities acquired in such open market transactions or (b) the establishment of a trading plan pursuant to Rule

	10b5-1

	under the Exchange Act for the transfer of Common Units,

	provided

	that
	(i) such plan does not provide for the transfer of Common Units during the Restricted Period and (ii) to the extent a public announcement or filing under the Exchange Act, if any, is required of or voluntarily made by or on behalf of the
	undersigned or the Company regarding the establishment of such plan, such announcement or filing shall include a statement to the effect that no transfer of Common Units may be made under such plan during the Restricted Period. In addition, the
	undersigned agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters, it will not, during the Restricted Period, make any demand for or exercise any right with respect to, the registration of any Common
	Units or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Units. The undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with the Companys transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of
	the undersigneds Common Units except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.




	If the undersigned is an officer or
	director of the Company, (i) the Representatives agree that, at least three business days before the effective date of any release or waiver of the foregoing restrictions in connection with a transfer of Common Units, Morgan Stanley will notify
	the Company of the impending release or waiver, and (ii) the Company has agreed in the Underwriting Agreement to announce the impending release or waiver by press release through a major news service at least two business days before the
	effective date of the release or waiver. Any release or waiver granted by the Representatives hereunder to any such officer or director shall only be effective two business days after the publication date of such press release. The provisions of
	this paragraph will not apply if (a) the release or waiver is effected solely to permit a transfer not for consideration and (b) the transferee has agreed in writing to be bound by the same terms described in this letter to the extent and
	for the duration that such terms remain in effect at the time of the transfer.




	The undersigned understands that the
	Transocean Parties and the Underwriters are relying upon this agreement in proceeding toward consummation of the Public Offering. The undersigned further understands that this agreement is irrevocable and shall be binding upon the undersigneds
	heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns.




	Whether or not the Public Offering actually occurs depends on a number
	of factors, including market conditions. Any Public Offering will only be made pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, the terms of which are subject to negotiation between the Transocean Parties and the Underwriters.




	Very truly yours,

	ARTICLE
	III






	FURTHER ASSURANCES





	From time to time after the date hereof, and without any further consideration, each of the Parties shall execute, acknowledge and deliver additional instruments, notices and other documents, and will do
	all such other acts and things, all in accordance with applicable law, as may be necessary or appropriate to more fully and effectively carry out the purposes and intent

	of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that the Parties have used their good faith efforts to identify all of the assets being contributed as
	required in connection with this Agreement. It is the express intent of the Parties that the Company Group own all assets necessary to operate the assets that are identified in this Agreement and in the Registration Statement. To the extent that any
	assets were not identified but are necessary to the operation of the assets that are so identified in this Agreement and in the Registration Statement, then the intent of the Parties is that all such unidentified assets are intended to be conveyed
	to the Company Group pursuant to this Agreement. To the extent any such assets are identified at a later date, the Parties shall take all appropriate action required in order to convey such assets to the applicable member of the Company Group.
	Likewise, to the extent that any assets that are conveyed to the Company Group hereunder are later identified by the Parties as assets that the Parties did not intend to convey to the Company Group as reflected in the Registration Statement, the
	Parties shall take all appropriate action required to convey such assets to the appropriate Party.




	Furthermore, without
	limiting any liabilities or other remedies of the Parties applicable under this Agreement or any other agreements, if and to the extent that the valid, complete and perfected transfer or assignment of any assets by any Party to any member of the
	Company Group or the acquisition of any assets from any Party by any member of the Company Group would be a violation of applicable law, or require any additional consents, approvals or notifications in connection with the transfer of such assets by
	any Party to any member of the Company Group that have not been obtained or made by the Effective Time, then, unless the Parties shall otherwise mutually determine, the transfer or assignment of such assets to such member of the Company Group or the
	assumption of such assets by such member of the Company Group, as the case may be, shall be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported transfer, assignment or assumption shall be null and void until such time as all legal impediments are
	removed or such consents, approvals and notifications have been obtained or made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in such event the applicable Party shall (a) hold such assets in trust for the benefit of the Company Group, (b) not transfer
	or assign such assets, in whole or in part, other than with the prior consent of the Company, and (c) use best efforts to assure that each member of the Company Group receives all of the benefits of the assets attempted to have been transferred
	to it until such time as the attempted transfer is complete, and each member of the Company Group shall bear all costs associated with such assets (except costs associated with the attempted transfer or perfecting such transfer, and subject to
	offset of any benefits of the assets not received by the Company Group against associated costs incurred by the applicable Party) as if the transfer had been valid and complete.

	Entire Agreement

	.

	5.6


	Governing Law

	either Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the court, administrative agency or arbitrator shall interpret this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
	Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible. If any sentence in this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
	interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.




	5.10

	.

	in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, the Party or the Parties who are or are to be thereby aggrieved shall have the right to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief of their rights
	under this Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies at law or in equity, and all such rights and remedies shall be cumulative. The Parties agree that the remedies at law for any breach or threatened breach, including monetary
	damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are waived.




	 




	8
