Why Alternative Medicines?
July 8, 2009 

What most of us normally understand as “Medicine,” is ALLOPATHY MEDICINE
(commonly called WESTERN MEDICINE).
This is what is offered by doctors who go through a very well structured and trained MBBS course at Medical Colleges. Of course it is this category of MEDICINE that all of us also get from our neighbourhood hospitals and clinics.
So we naturally tend to think that “this is the ONLY” form of MEDICINE
We can all agree there is no substitute for Allopathic (Western) Medicine, when it comes to emergency medical care.
HOWEVER, “ALLOPATHIC CARE” IS “JUST ONE ALTERNATIVE” FOR PREVENTIVE MEDICINE OR ASSESSMENT CARE.
THERE ARE IMPORTANT ALTERNATIVES TO WESTERN or ALLOPATHY MEDICINE.
· These ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES, like:
(1) Naturopathy,
(2) Homeopathy,
(3) Ayurvedic,
(4) Traditional Chinese Medicine (including  Acupuncture),
(5) & Malay Traditional Medicine.
are among the most sought after treatment options in most parts of the civilized world.
MAS AYU PRODUCTS ARE  IMPORTANT “ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE” BECAUSE:
(1) PRODUCTS DEVELOPED  AFTER 6 YEARS OF SCIENTIFIC & CLINICAL RESEARCH
(2) PRODUCTS TESTED ON OVER 10,000 PATIENTS OVER A PERIOD OF 5 YEARS
(3) “MAS AYU” RECIPES WORK TOWARDS CREATING A DISEASE REFUSAL STATE (DRS)

The historical development of AK Healthcare and Natural Products , now branded as the Mas Ayu range , can be traced back to the initial fundamental research studies conducted by Prof. Dr. Ananthan Krishnan , who is both pharmacist and naturopath . After serving for more than eighteen years in government hospitals , becoming more aware of the deleterious effects allopathic chemical based drugs used in hospitals . Dr. Ananthan Krishnan , impelled by an unending quest to develop safer products , embarked on a long independent research in Pharmacy and Naturopathy center in Puchong , Malaysia which established in 1996. This extended clinical research , included a four year theoretical study on all types of modern , traditional and alternative medicine systems that was current in the world.
The theoretical study led him to the seeds , especially edible seeds, comprising spices , beans , cereals and vitamins . The research centered on the use of edible raw seeds for the treatment and prevention of disease. Various prototype extemporaneous formulae were developed and refined, used on patients who sought treatment in the center . The first phase of research involved a total of approximately 12,000 patients , covered common ailments , and the health empowering and medical effects of these safe products were discovered . The formulae were further refined through a multi – centered study in 2004 covering approximately another 10,000 patients . Having developed permanent formulae , the products were submitted to the Malaysian Drug Control Authority , for approval and registration in 2004, and resulting in the registration of 14 products in April 2004.

Concept Redesign of 
                the TATA Safari Interior
 




 





 




The brief sets out the scope of redesigning the interiors of the Tata Safari Dicor.  The Safari concept would be the first expression of TATA motors to showcase a future muscular crossover, looking 10 years into the future. As the first concept SUV to roll out of the TATA motors hangar, a bold new direction was sought out, to showcase the vehicle, by seeking inspiration in art and architecture.
                        The entire programme was structured around a timeline that spanned four months, the initial period of which was marked with random explorations based on the premise of what comprises a concept car. An incremental understanding of design, with the hope of identifying a language for the vehicle, formed the basis for the explorations. The concepts were categorised into themes such as modern, conceptual, avant-garde etc. A greater percentage of time was dedicated to the exploratory stage, setting a solid foundation of ideas, based on which the final concept drew essence. The new vehicle interior embodied futuristic overtones, biodynamic form language, and crossover traits. The brief at this point was re-explored and the premises were further strengthened to develop the final concept with vehicular constraints such as the white body architecture, passenger safety and ergonomics.
                        Car designers have an approach to their vocation that makes the word obsessive seem dilettante. We have to think about things, which consumers do not know exist, but which excite powerful urges in consumer psychology.
