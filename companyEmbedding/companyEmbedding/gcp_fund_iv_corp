Adherence to the principles of good clinical practices (GCPs), including adequate human subject protection (HSP) is universally recognized as a critical requirement to the conduct of research involving human subjects.  Many countries have adopted GCP principles as laws and/or regulations.  The Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) regulations for the conduct of clinical trials, which have been in effect since the 1970s, address both GCP and HSP.  These FDA regulations and guidance documents are accessible from this site.  International GCP guidance documents on which FDA has collaborated and that have been adopted as official FDA guidance are also be found here.  Finally, this site includes links to other sites relevant to the conduct of clinical trials, both nationally and internationally.   Bioresearch MonitoringFDA’s bioresearch monitoring (BIMO) program conducts on-site inspections of both clinical and nonclinical studies performed to support research and marketing applications/submissions to the agency.  Links to the compliance programs for each inspection type and contact information for each Center’s BIMO program are also accessible from this site.Office of Good Clinical PracticeSee the Office of Good Clinical Practice's (OGCP's) mission statement on the OGCP's Web page. Sign up for Good Clinical Practice/Human Subject Protection e-mail updatesIn June 2009, FDA redesigned its web site.  As a result, some links (URLs) embedded within Guidance documents, Rules, and other documents are no longer valid.  If you find a link that does not work, please try searching for the document using the document’s title.  For additional assistance, go to Contact FDA.  We apologize for any inconvenience this redesign might have caused.

Atlantic-Pacific Capital served as exclusive global placement agent



Atlantic-Pacific 
      Capital, one of the largest privately-owned global placement agent 
      and advisory firms focussed on alternative investments, is pleased to 
      announce the final closing of Growth Capital Partners Fund IV (“Fund IV” 
      or the “Fund”) with £205 million of capital commitments. Fund IV 
      received outstanding support from a diverse group of institutional 
      investors, including public pension funds, corporate pension funds and 
      investment management groups across the US and Europe.
    

      “We are pleased to have partnered with Growth 
      Capital Partners (“GCP”) on their fourth fundraise. Investors were 
      very receptive to GCP’s distinct and differentiated strategy in the UK 
      lower middle market, which has proven to generate strong results on a 
      consistent basis. We congratulate the team on a successful fundraise,” 
      commented Richard

      Atlantic-Pacific Capital was instrumental throughout the fundraising 
      process in helping us secure commitments in excess of our target. Fund 
      IV is off to a promising start with four seed assets, and we remain 
      committed to investing in UK SMEs – a key driver of the UK economy.”
