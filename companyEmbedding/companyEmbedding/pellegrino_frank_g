Occupation


Former President of General Fibre Company
Inventor




Frank G. Pellegrino (1923 – 2008) was an American engineer, inventor, and industrialist. He served as president of the General Fibre Company. During his tenure, General Fibre became the largest manufacturer of duck decoy models in the United States, producing over a million per year in the 1950s.[1][2] Pellegrino also negotiated the sale of the International Hat Company to Interco, Inc.[3] Additionally, he created a variety of inventions related to the plastic molding industry. Most notably, Pellegrino invented automated assembly line machines in the formation of plastic objects.[4] These machines were used by General Fibre in the production of a variety of plastic models, duck decoys, and Michelob paraphernalia throughout the 1960s to 1980s.

Pellegrino was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He was an electrical engineering graduate of Iowa State University.[5] He was the son of Ida Kropp and Frank Pellegrino, the philanthropist and president of the International Hat Company.[6][7] He served as an American naval officer, in the Pacific theater, during World War II.[5] After World War II, Pellegrino was stationed in Japan as part of the US occupation and rebuilding effort.[5] In 1948, he returned to St. Louis and married into the high society, old money Henry family; marrying Virginia Anne Henry, daughter of Harry W. Henry, president of the Graham Paper Company.[8] That same year, Pellegrino was hired as vice president of General Fibre by President George Tilles, Jr.
In the mid-1950s, Pellegrino became president of General Fiber, following the retirement of Lewis Tilles Apple. The company had manufactured the original M1 fiber helmet liner in 1941 before moving into the production of fiber components for the military pressed fiber sun helmets used by American soldiers during World War II. After the war ended, the company required a production transition back to civilian orders. In 1946, General Fibre switched into the duck, goose, and swan decoy model market.[2] The models were used by hunters to attract prey.[2] During his management of the company, General Fiber reached its peak production of these models in the late 1950s and early 1960s. However, it was during this time that Pellegrino began shifting the company's business model out of the production of wood fiber pulp products into the emerging plastics and plastic molding industry.[1]
In the early 1960s, he designed and engineered new automated machines in the manufacturing of plastic goods. These included plastic models, construction helmets, and various products for the Anheuser-Busch company.
Pellegrino died in 2008.[5] He is buried in Sunset Memorial Park in St. Louis.[5]

International Hat Company, formerly named the International Harvest Hat Company, was a St. Louis, Missouri-based manufacturer of commercial hats and military helmets.[9] The company was one of the largest hat manufacturers in the United States and, at one time, the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world.[6] It is best remembered for its design and mass production of tropical shaped, pressed fiber military sun helmets for soldiers of the United States Army, Marines, and Navy during and after World War II. Additionally, the American owned company was a major producer of harvest hats, straw hats, fiber sun hats, enameled dress hats, baseball caps, and earmuffs throughout most of the 20th century. However, it is the International Hat military sun helmets that have become the most notable collector's items.
Established in 1917 as a private corporation, the company began with a single product line of harvest straw hats.[4] By the late 1930s, the company had expanded into fiber pressed sun hats and leather harvest hats.[4] During World War II, International Hat developed and produced several models of military sun helmets, including a model with rudimentary ventilation.[10] After the war, the company became interested in plastic molding injection, moving increasingly away from pressed fiber. In the 1950s, General Fibre Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, changed its name to General Moulding Company to reflect these production changes in basic materials. By the 1960s, International Hat was mostly producing baseball caps, straw hats, earmuffs, plastic helmets, and plastic sun hats. During this era of expansion, the company had a proclivity for building its factories in small rural cities, often becoming the largest employer and economic backbone of those communities.[11][12] On several occasions, International Hat donated land or facility equipment for the creation of municipal parks located adjacent to one of its factories, namely for the purpose of benefiting employees, their families, and the local community.[13]
After sixty-one years of business, the company was sold in 1978 to Interco, Inc., where it continued operating as a subsidiary.[14][15] In 1988, Interco was the target of a hostile takeover bid. Consequently, International Hat was divested the following year to Paramount Cap Company, as part of a debt restructuring plan instituted by the parent company.[3] However, Interco subsequently went bankrupt in 1991, after selling 16 of its 20 subsidiaries.[16] Although International Hat was liquidated, several of its original factories are still in operation by other hat companies in Southeastern Missouri.[3][17] Additionally, one of International Hat's warehouses in the historic district of Soulard, Missouri has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1][18] International Hat operated the historical building from 1954 to 1976.[2] It is presently used as a senior and disabled living facility.[1]

History[edit]
First location and early company history[edit]




International Hat Company's second headquarters at 2528 Texas Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri.[9] The company's second factory, acquired in 1928 from Koken Barbers' Supply Company, produced all World War II era military helmets manufactured by the company.[6]


The company was founded by Isaac Apple on August 17, 1917 as International Harvest Hat Company.[4] The prominent St. Louis families of Apple and Tilles incorporated International Harvest Hat during the turbulence of World War I.[5] The Apple family had previously founded the Apple Hat Company, which was based in Fort Smith, Arkansas.[19][20] Among the co-founders of International Harvest Hat was George Tilles, Sr., whose sister Hannah, was married to Isaac Apple.[20] However, the elderly Tilles left operational management of the company to his brother-in-law Isaac Apple.[21] The other original minority shareholders at the time of incorporation included Alexander E. Rosenthal, Harry J. Talbot, and John C. Talbot.[22] Rosenthal, who had previously been at the Apple Hat Company, was appointed as the first general manager of International Harvest Hat.[23] However, in 1918, he was arrested in Galveston, Texas on charges of embezzlement for the unauthorized sale of nineteen bales of harvest straw hats.[23]
The original business model of the company was commercial hat production of harvest straw hats.[4] On the micro-economic level, St. Louis had become a center of hat manufacturing during the Second Industrial Revolution.[24] In 1900, 129 businesses in St. Louis were producing custom hats for women, with approximately 600 employees in the industry.[24] Within the decade, St. Louis was the fifth largest producer of fur felt hats.[24] International Harvest Hat proposed to do the same thing for straw harvest hats, by ramping up production capacity and challenging the manufacturing centers in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey.[24] The timing of market entry was favorable to the company's goals, as the organization was established at the peak decade of the commercial hat apparel market. In 1910, over 42 million hats were produced in the United States, an all-time record for domestic production.[25][26]
On the macroeconomic level, the company was founded at a time of ascendance for the United States. In 1916, the United States economic output, for the first time in history, was greater than that of the British Empire, establishing the United States as the world's largest economic superpower.[27] From World War I to the beginnings of the Great Depression, it was under these economic environmental conditions that the company originally produced a product line of harvest hats. Such hats of the period were a staple of farmers and field hands across the US.[21] By the 1920s, St. Louis replaced New England as the world's dominant manufacturing center for harvest hats.[28] International Harvest Hat was a major contributor to this regional shift in industrialization. By the early 1920s, the company had become the largest industrial producer of harvest hats in the world.[6] In 1928, the company produced over 36,000 per day and approximately 9.4 million harvest hats per year.[29]
With the rise of the automobile, fashions began to change by the 1930s. In 1931, the company expanded into men's straw dress hats to adopt to evolving fashion trends.[4] In 1938, the company name was changed to International Hat Company to better reflect the growing diversity of its product lines.[4] In 1940, the product lines were further expanded when International Hat began production of military sun helmets for the US military.[10] The war effort led to a realignment of production geared towards military apparel.[10]
With the death of Isaac Apple in 1935, his nephew George Tilles, Jr., was promoted to president of the company. Tilles served as president until his retirement in 1956 and as chairman of the board until his death in 1958.[21] Through the depression of the 1930s, Tilles managed the expansion of the company's facilities from a modest 5,000 square foot factory to a modernized 150,000 square foot factory.[30] Under Tilles, International Hat saw increasing growth during World War II. By 1942, the company's operations had grown to include its main factory facility, several warehouses, two buying offices in Mexico, and a sales office in New York City.[4] The company was also importing goods from a dozen countries.[4]
New markets and expansion[edit]




Frank Pellegrino, President and Chairman (1956–1975), built five factories, created two municipal parks, and expanded the post-WWII product lines of the company into plastic helmets and baseball caps.


Following World War II, the International Hat Company entered an expansionist period with new markets, facilities, product lines, and basic materials. Frank Pellegrino served as vice president under George Tilles, Jr., becoming president of International Hat from 1956 until 1971 and chairman until his death in 1975.[21][31] Tilles placed Pellegrino in charge of opening a second factory.[13] In 1946, a new facility was constructed and operational in Oran, Missouri, becoming the largest employer in the city.[32]
Pellegrino managed International Hat into a company of over 1,500 employees with six domestic factories. During the 1950s and 1960s, International Hat expanded from its factory in St. Louis to include five other factories located in Southeast Missouri. A number of these locations became one factory towns. Additionally, a sixth plant was opened in Texas.[15] Reflecting this period of expansion into foreign markets, the company headquarters was also moved from St. Louis to New York City.[15] During this era, the company continued producing military helmets and straw hats. However, the company expanded its products lines into plastic hats and helmets, as an early entrant into this new consumer market. As press fiber waned, plastic allowed for more automated production and lighter materials, without the ventilation issues of pressed fiber trapping heat. Throughout the 1960s, the company began shifting into the baseball cap market.[11] In 1967, International Hat began its first consumer focused advertising campaign, to expand its reach in the retail sector, with advertising agency Stemmler, Bartram, Fisher & Payne.[33] In the 1970s, the company expanded into the winter apparel market, selling earmuffs manufactured by VIP Industries.[34]
Under Pellegrino, this would later prove as the height of the expansion of the company in terms of size, productivity, and financial success.[35]
Sale, decline, and liquidation[edit]
Jean S. Goodson became president of International Hat in 1971, following Pellegrino's retirement.[31] That same year Pellegrino was elected chairman of the board, which he retained until his death in 1975. Goodson began cutting down on the company's imports from the New York office and limiting the production of dress hats to focus on other product lines.[35] Unsatisfied with his performance, the board of directors requested Frank G. Pellegrino, Sr., minority shareholder and son of Frank P. Pellegrino, represent International Hat in pursuing the sale of the company.[36] At that time, Pellegrino was president of General Moulding Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, in the production of plastic molds for the parent company's hats and helmets. In 1977, Pellegrino initiated the sale of the company to Interco, Incorporated, a conglomerate of furniture, apparel, and shoe companies (now known as Furniture Brands International). On March 31, 1978, a special meeting of the stockholders was held to consider the terms by which Interco offered International Hat.[35] The stockholders accepted the deal and International Hat was officially sold to Interco by the end of the day.[15] The original shareholders were bought out and Jean Goodson continued on as a member of the Interco board of directors from 1978 until his retirement in 1985.[15][37] The company was purchased for 166,667 shares of Interco common stock.[38]
As a subsidiary, International Hat continued operation until June 14, 1989.[39][40] The domestic hat apparel market had undergone a steady increase in global competition since the 1970s during a time of record sales of hats in the US.[41] The company was pressured by changing market conditions, particularly the US loss of market share from cheaper imports coming in from Brazil, Spain, Taiwan, and China.[42] In 1984, China alone exported 2.98 million dozens of hats to the United States.[3] By 1989, 6.5 million dozens of hats were being imported from China, representing 31 percent of the total market share of the hat apparel industry.[3] Demand for hats actually increased during this period, whereas the US market share of hats decreased from 27.1 percent to 22.2 percent from 1984 to 1989.[3]
However, the mortal blow to the company derived from Interco's response to a hostile takeover bid. In 1988, Steven and Mitchell Rales, of the Cardinal Acquisition Corporation, offered $2.5 billion for the company.[43] In response to the offer, Interco's board authorized $1.95 billion in additional debt to buyback stock.[16] Senior management hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to restructure the company, including a plan to sell 16 of Interco's 20 companies.[44][45] While this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover, the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years.[46] From 1989 to 1991, Interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions in an attempt to remain solvent.[47] While the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation, the full value of these assets was never realized by Interco, as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds.[48] The combination of selling the majority of its companies, while being saddled by over $2 billion in debt, created unsustainable negative cash flow, resulting in Inteco's bankruptcy in 1991.[46] Thus in spite of being a profitable subsidiary, International Hat was liquidated in 1989 in a fire sale to Paramount Cap Company.[3]
Successors[edit]
The factories in Dexter, Marble Hill, and Oran were re-opened in May 1989, after being sold in the liquidation to Paramount Cap Company.[3][17] The Dexter plant was shuttered in 2000 before being sold to Venture Products, Inc. and re-opened in 2001.[49] The factory in Oran was sold to Carr Textile Corporation, which was subsequently sold to Venture Products, Inc.[50] At present, the Oran hat plant is operational in the production of straw hats.
Products[edit]

International Hat produced a variety of products over eighty-three years of operations. However, it is most well known for its production of several different models of fiber pressed military sun helmets provided to the US armed services during World War II. From World War II to the Gulf War, the pressed fiber sun helmet is noted for the historic length of its military usage in the United States, outlasting the M1 steel helmet by approximately ten years.[52] This makes the pressed fiber sun helmet one of the longest used helmets in service by the United States military.[52] Throughout World War II, International Hat was one of two major government contracted manufacturers of the pressed fiber sun helmets for US military personnel.[53][52] Hawley Products Company was the other major government contractor.[53][54] Between Hawley Products Company and International Hat Company, over 100,000 sun helmets were produced for military use in the European and Pacific theaters.[51]
The United States Marine Corps used the International Hat sun helmet both as combat gear and as part of the Marine Corps training uniform.[53][55] The pith helmet, nicknamed the "elephant hat", was first issued to the 1st Marine Division for its 1941 deployment to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The pith helmet has been retained as the mark of the marksmanship range coach.[56]
Although the International Hat sun helmet was designed and introduced before the M1 steel helmet, the International Hat sun helmet continued to be used in the military for many decades, including the Korean War and Vietnam War.[53][52] By the Gulf War, only certain personnel in the US Navy had the pressed fiber sun helmet as serviceable gear.[53]
Military logistics records preserve the stock number, product type, military service date, and quantity produced for military use. Each service branch of the military kept separate quartermaster records until 1947. In particular, the US Army is known to have commissioned 38,423 International Hat helmets for World War II and its aftermath.[10]

Legal issues[edit]




Manufacturing code hearing (1934) Washington, D.C. with International Hat Company representatives seated at the bottom of left table. International Hat was an early participant in the establishment of industry standards, product certification, and claimant issues arising from patent infringement cases within the hat segment of the U.S. apparel industry.


International Hat has had several labor issues settled in the US legal system. The company also participated in ways to avoid legal issues. In 1934, Frank P. Pellegrino represented the company in Washington D.C. at the US Hat Manufacturing Code hearing, to update manufacturing and labor practices within the industry, as the industry attempted to mitigate the need for government regulation during the New Deal era. International Hat's labor issues were generally with the National Labor Relations Board and the issue of unionization. Over the decades, the employees of the company never unionized, although unsuccessful attempts at unionization were made in joining the United Hatters, Cap, and Millinery Workers International, an AFL-CIO affiliate of 20,000 hat workers.[25][57]
Unionization never proved popular with the employees or the culture of the company.[57] In 1976, the Oran factory voted to unionize with the Retail Clerks Union but the motion failed.[58] In 1985, the National Labor Relations Board ruled against International Hat Company for allegedly violating elements of the National Labor Relations Act.[57] The company was claimed to have infringed upon the right of Tex Barnes, a cutter at the International Hat factory in Piedmont, Missouri to organize a union.[57] Barnes led the efforts for certification in April 1980 and was also a member the union's negotiating committee.[57] However, as in previous instances, the union lost the election when put to an employee vote.[57] The union was formally decertified on March 4, 1982.[57] Barnes filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company nine months later.[57] Although the National Labor Relations Board ruled in Barnes' favor, the United States Court of Appeals Eighth Circuit vacated and remanded the earlier decision.[57]
Philanthropy[edit]
Main articles: Tilles Memorial City Park and Maria Pellegrino Park
International Hat engaged in various philanthropic activities. Most notably, was the establishment of two municipal parks under President and Chairman Pellegrino. Following the death of his business associate and the former president, Pellegrino donated land and money for the construction of a municipal park in Oran, the George Tilles Jr. Memorial Park.[32] In 1968, Pellegrino commissioned a new park in Marble Hill, MO.[59] Maria Pellegrino Park was dedicated in memory of Pellegrino's mother and opened to the public on June 2, 1972.[60] During the dedication ceremonies, the Mayor declared the event to be remembered as "Pellegrino Appreciation Day."[61] International Hat directly donated money to building the large pavilion at Pellegrino Park.[60]
Another philanthropic activity of the company was the donation of hats to certain American volunteer organizations. In 1981, International Hat donated 4,764 hats to the national convention of the Girls Scouts of America.[62] In 1989, the company produced 200 specially made women's spring hats for the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GWFC) convention delegates in Marble Hill.[63]
Legacy[edit]
In the subsequent decades of World War II, International Hat military fiber sun helmets, produced at the original factory in St. Louis, have become collector's items for military helmet and World War II collectors of American military uniform apparel. This is particularly true of the International Hat Marine helmets, which bear the USMC insignia on the front of the helmet.[53]
Facilities[edit]
Main article: International Hat Company warehouse




The International Hat Company warehouse, in the historic district of the Soulard neighborhood in St. Louis, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 20, 1980.[1]

International Hat had multiple domestic and international facilities. At the height of its expansion, International Hat operated seven domestic factories, several warehouses, several international buying offices, and a sales office in New York.[4] Among all its facilities, the International Hat Company warehouse in the Soulard neighborhood of St. Louis is of particular historic note. On October 20, 1980, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1] Built in 1904, by renowned architect Albert B. Groves, the building was originally a factory for the Brown Shoe Company.[1] In 1954, the factory was subsequently converted into a warehouse by the International Hat Company, which owned and operated the site until 1976.[1] The site has been recognized as a testament to Grove's architectural expertise in early 20th century industrial design.
In 1917, the original International Hat headquarters was located at 711 Lucas Avenue.[6] From 1917 to 1928, the factory manufactured straw harvest hats.[6] By the 1920s, the company was the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world from this facility.[6] In 1928, the company purchased 2528 Texas Avenue from Koken Barbers' Supply Company and sold the original factory at 711 Lucas to Koken as part of the deal.[6] The Texas location would continue manufacturing straw harvest hats, as well as all military sun helmets produced during and after World War II.[4] This five-story building included 87,000 square feet, or approximately two acres.[64][65] In 2016, this facility was purchased by two non-profit organizations, DeSales Community Development and St. Louis Makes to form a new joint private non-profit organization called Brick City Makes.[66][67] The Brick City Makes hub is noted as being the first non-profit organization in the United States to renovate an industrial building in order to provide rent space and development, as a business incubator, for entrepreneurial manufacturers.[65][66] The Brick City Makes business incubator, at the former International Hat factory, is the first model in the US to focus on business support services that grow the expertise and profitability of manufacturers and inventors until their organizations are large enough to exit the incubator and launch independently elsewhere.[66][68]
Six factories were located in Missouri and the seventh operated in Texas. The majority of warehouses were located with the factories onsite. From 1928 to the 1960s, the largest International Hat factory also served as the headquarters of the company, which was located in St. Louis, Missouri.[6] The other factories in Missouri were located in Chaffee, Dexter, Marble Hill, Piedmont, and Oran.[11][69][70] The Oran factory was constructed in 1946.[71] The factory was expanded in 1948 and 1968.[72] It eventually closed in 1984.[73] The Chaffee plant was closed in 1981 after opening in the summer of 1980 with 100 employees.[74][75][76] The Chaffee factory was operated by Florsheim Shoe Company, another subsidiary of Interco.[77] The Marble Hill factory was expanded in 1972.[78] The facility employed approximately 300 workers.[79] The Dexter facility was opened in 1959 and operated for 30 years under International Hat, eventually closing permanently in 1989.[3]

International Hat Company, formerly named the International Harvest Hat Company, was a St. Louis, Missouri-based manufacturer of commercial hats and military helmets.[9] The company was one of the largest hat manufacturers in the United States and, at one time, the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world.[6] It is best remembered for its design and mass production of tropical shaped, pressed fiber military sun helmets for soldiers of the United States Army, Marines, and Navy during and after World War II. Additionally, the American owned company was a major producer of harvest hats, straw hats, fiber sun hats, enameled dress hats, baseball caps, and earmuffs throughout most of the 20th century. However, it is the International Hat military sun helmets that have become the most notable collector's items.
Established in 1917 as a private corporation, the company began with a single product line of harvest straw hats.[4] By the late 1930s, the company had expanded into fiber pressed sun hats and leather harvest hats.[4] During World War II, International Hat developed and produced several models of military sun helmets, including a model with rudimentary ventilation.[10] After the war, the company became interested in plastic molding injection, moving increasingly away from pressed fiber. In the 1950s, General Fibre Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, changed its name to General Moulding Company to reflect these production changes in basic materials. By the 1960s, International Hat was mostly producing baseball caps, straw hats, earmuffs, plastic helmets, and plastic sun hats. During this era of expansion, the company had a proclivity for building its factories in small rural cities, often becoming the largest employer and economic backbone of those communities.[11][12] On several occasions, International Hat donated land or facility equipment for the creation of municipal parks located adjacent to one of its factories, namely for the purpose of benefiting employees, their families, and the local community.[13]
After sixty-one years of business, the company was sold in 1978 to Interco, Inc., where it continued operating as a subsidiary.[14][15] In 1988, Interco was the target of a hostile takeover bid. Consequently, International Hat was divested the following year to Paramount Cap Company, as part of a debt restructuring plan instituted by the parent company.[3] However, Interco subsequently went bankrupt in 1991, after selling 16 of its 20 subsidiaries.[16] Although International Hat was liquidated, several of its original factories are still in operation by other hat companies in Southeastern Missouri.[3][17] Additionally, one of International Hat's warehouses in the historic district of Soulard, Missouri has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1][18] International Hat operated the historical building from 1954 to 1976.[2] It is presently used as a senior and disabled living facility.[1]

History[edit]
First location and early company history[edit]




International Hat Company's second headquarters at 2528 Texas Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri.[9] The company's second factory, acquired in 1928 from Koken Barbers' Supply Company, produced all World War II era military helmets manufactured by the company.[6]


The company was founded by Isaac Apple on August 17, 1917 as International Harvest Hat Company.[4] The prominent St. Louis families of Apple and Tilles incorporated International Harvest Hat during the turbulence of World War I.[5] The Apple family had previously founded the Apple Hat Company, which was based in Fort Smith, Arkansas.[19][20] Among the co-founders of International Harvest Hat was George Tilles, Sr., whose sister Hannah, was married to Isaac Apple.[20] However, the elderly Tilles left operational management of the company to his brother-in-law Isaac Apple.[21] The other original minority shareholders at the time of incorporation included Alexander E. Rosenthal, Harry J. Talbot, and John C. Talbot.[22] Rosenthal, who had previously been at the Apple Hat Company, was appointed as the first general manager of International Harvest Hat.[23] However, in 1918, he was arrested in Galveston, Texas on charges of embezzlement for the unauthorized sale of nineteen bales of harvest straw hats.[23]
The original business model of the company was commercial hat production of harvest straw hats.[4] On the micro-economic level, St. Louis had become a center of hat manufacturing during the Second Industrial Revolution.[24] In 1900, 129 businesses in St. Louis were producing custom hats for women, with approximately 600 employees in the industry.[24] Within the decade, St. Louis was the fifth largest producer of fur felt hats.[24] International Harvest Hat proposed to do the same thing for straw harvest hats, by ramping up production capacity and challenging the manufacturing centers in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey.[24] The timing of market entry was favorable to the company's goals, as the organization was established at the peak decade of the commercial hat apparel market. In 1910, over 42 million hats were produced in the United States, an all-time record for domestic production.[25][26]
On the macroeconomic level, the company was founded at a time of ascendance for the United States. In 1916, the United States economic output, for the first time in history, was greater than that of the British Empire, establishing the United States as the world's largest economic superpower.[27] From World War I to the beginnings of the Great Depression, it was under these economic environmental conditions that the company originally produced a product line of harvest hats. Such hats of the period were a staple of farmers and field hands across the US.[21] By the 1920s, St. Louis replaced New England as the world's dominant manufacturing center for harvest hats.[28] International Harvest Hat was a major contributor to this regional shift in industrialization. By the early 1920s, the company had become the largest industrial producer of harvest hats in the world.[6] In 1928, the company produced over 36,000 per day and approximately 9.4 million harvest hats per year.[29]
With the rise of the automobile, fashions began to change by the 1930s. In 1931, the company expanded into men's straw dress hats to adopt to evolving fashion trends.[4] In 1938, the company name was changed to International Hat Company to better reflect the growing diversity of its product lines.[4] In 1940, the product lines were further expanded when International Hat began production of military sun helmets for the US military.[10] The war effort led to a realignment of production geared towards military apparel.[10]
With the death of Isaac Apple in 1935, his nephew George Tilles, Jr., was promoted to president of the company. Tilles served as president until his retirement in 1956 and as chairman of the board until his death in 1958.[21] Through the depression of the 1930s, Tilles managed the expansion of the company's facilities from a modest 5,000 square foot factory to a modernized 150,000 square foot factory.[30] Under Tilles, International Hat saw increasing growth during World War II. By 1942, the company's operations had grown to include its main factory facility, several warehouses, two buying offices in Mexico, and a sales office in New York City.[4] The company was also importing goods from a dozen countries.[4]
New markets and expansion[edit]




Frank Pellegrino, President and Chairman (1956–1975), built five factories, created two municipal parks, and expanded the post-WWII product lines of the company into plastic helmets and baseball caps.


Following World War II, the International Hat Company entered an expansionist period with new markets, facilities, product lines, and basic materials. Frank Pellegrino served as vice president under George Tilles, Jr., becoming president of International Hat from 1956 until 1971 and chairman until his death in 1975.[21][31] Tilles placed Pellegrino in charge of opening a second factory.[13] In 1946, a new facility was constructed and operational in Oran, Missouri, becoming the largest employer in the city.[32]
Pellegrino managed International Hat into a company of over 1,500 employees with six domestic factories. During the 1950s and 1960s, International Hat expanded from its factory in St. Louis to include five other factories located in Southeast Missouri. A number of these locations became one factory towns. Additionally, a sixth plant was opened in Texas.[15] Reflecting this period of expansion into foreign markets, the company headquarters was also moved from St. Louis to New York City.[15] During this era, the company continued producing military helmets and straw hats. However, the company expanded its products lines into plastic hats and helmets, as an early entrant into this new consumer market. As press fiber waned, plastic allowed for more automated production and lighter materials, without the ventilation issues of pressed fiber trapping heat. Throughout the 1960s, the company began shifting into the baseball cap market.[11] In 1967, International Hat began its first consumer focused advertising campaign, to expand its reach in the retail sector, with advertising agency Stemmler, Bartram, Fisher & Payne.[33] In the 1970s, the company expanded into the winter apparel market, selling earmuffs manufactured by VIP Industries.[34]
Under Pellegrino, this would later prove as the height of the expansion of the company in terms of size, productivity, and financial success.[35]
Sale, decline, and liquidation[edit]
Jean S. Goodson became president of International Hat in 1971, following Pellegrino's retirement.[31] That same year Pellegrino was elected chairman of the board, which he retained until his death in 1975. Goodson began cutting down on the company's imports from the New York office and limiting the production of dress hats to focus on other product lines.[35] Unsatisfied with his performance, the board of directors requested Frank G. Pellegrino, Sr., minority shareholder and son of Frank P. Pellegrino, represent International Hat in pursuing the sale of the company.[36] At that time, Pellegrino was president of General Moulding Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, in the production of plastic molds for the parent company's hats and helmets. In 1977, Pellegrino initiated the sale of the company to Interco, Incorporated, a conglomerate of furniture, apparel, and shoe companies (now known as Furniture Brands International). On March 31, 1978, a special meeting of the stockholders was held to consider the terms by which Interco offered International Hat.[35] The stockholders accepted the deal and International Hat was officially sold to Interco by the end of the day.[15] The original shareholders were bought out and Jean Goodson continued on as a member of the Interco board of directors from 1978 until his retirement in 1985.[15][37] The company was purchased for 166,667 shares of Interco common stock.[38]
As a subsidiary, International Hat continued operation until June 14, 1989.[39][40] The domestic hat apparel market had undergone a steady increase in global competition since the 1970s during a time of record sales of hats in the US.[41] The company was pressured by changing market conditions, particularly the US loss of market share from cheaper imports coming in from Brazil, Spain, Taiwan, and China.[42] In 1984, China alone exported 2.98 million dozens of hats to the United States.[3] By 1989, 6.5 million dozens of hats were being imported from China, representing 31 percent of the total market share of the hat apparel industry.[3] Demand for hats actually increased during this period, whereas the US market share of hats decreased from 27.1 percent to 22.2 percent from 1984 to 1989.[3]
However, the mortal blow to the company derived from Interco's response to a hostile takeover bid. In 1988, Steven and Mitchell Rales, of the Cardinal Acquisition Corporation, offered $2.5 billion for the company.[43] In response to the offer, Interco's board authorized $1.95 billion in additional debt to buyback stock.[16] Senior management hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to restructure the company, including a plan to sell 16 of Interco's 20 companies.[44][45] While this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover, the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years.[46] From 1989 to 1991, Interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions in an attempt to remain solvent.[47] While the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation, the full value of these assets was never realized by Interco, as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds.[48] The combination of selling the majority of its companies, while being saddled by over $2 billion in debt, created unsustainable negative cash flow, resulting in Inteco's bankruptcy in 1991.[46] Thus in spite of being a profitable subsidiary, International Hat was liquidated in 1989 in a fire sale to Paramount Cap Company.[3]
Successors[edit]
The factories in Dexter, Marble Hill, and Oran were re-opened in May 1989, after being sold in the liquidation to Paramount Cap Company.[3][17] The Dexter plant was shuttered in 2000 before being sold to Venture Products, Inc. and re-opened in 2001.[49] The factory in Oran was sold to Carr Textile Corporation, which was subsequently sold to Venture Products, Inc.[50] At present, the Oran hat plant is operational in the production of straw hats.
Products[edit]

International Hat produced a variety of products over eighty-three years of operations. However, it is most well known for its production of several different models of fiber pressed military sun helmets provided to the US armed services during World War II. From World War II to the Gulf War, the pressed fiber sun helmet is noted for the historic length of its military usage in the United States, outlasting the M1 steel helmet by approximately ten years.[52] This makes the pressed fiber sun helmet one of the longest used helmets in service by the United States military.[52] Throughout World War II, International Hat was one of two major government contracted manufacturers of the pressed fiber sun helmets for US military personnel.[53][52] Hawley Products Company was the other major government contractor.[53][54] Between Hawley Products Company and International Hat Company, over 100,000 sun helmets were produced for military use in the European and Pacific theaters.[51]
The United States Marine Corps used the International Hat sun helmet both as combat gear and as part of the Marine Corps training uniform.[53][55] The pith helmet, nicknamed the "elephant hat", was first issued to the 1st Marine Division for its 1941 deployment to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The pith helmet has been retained as the mark of the marksmanship range coach.[56]
Although the International Hat sun helmet was designed and introduced before the M1 steel helmet, the International Hat sun helmet continued to be used in the military for many decades, including the Korean War and Vietnam War.[53][52] By the Gulf War, only certain personnel in the US Navy had the pressed fiber sun helmet as serviceable gear.[53]
Military logistics records preserve the stock number, product type, military service date, and quantity produced for military use. Each service branch of the military kept separate quartermaster records until 1947. In particular, the US Army is known to have commissioned 38,423 International Hat helmets for World War II and its aftermath.[10]

Legal issues[edit]




Manufacturing code hearing (1934) Washington, D.C. with International Hat Company representatives seated at the bottom of left table. International Hat was an early participant in the establishment of industry standards, product certification, and claimant issues arising from patent infringement cases within the hat segment of the U.S. apparel industry.


International Hat has had several labor issues settled in the US legal system. The company also participated in ways to avoid legal issues. In 1934, Frank P. Pellegrino represented the company in Washington D.C. at the US Hat Manufacturing Code hearing, to update manufacturing and labor practices within the industry, as the industry attempted to mitigate the need for government regulation during the New Deal era. International Hat's labor issues were generally with the National Labor Relations Board and the issue of unionization. Over the decades, the employees of the company never unionized, although unsuccessful attempts at unionization were made in joining the United Hatters, Cap, and Millinery Workers International, an AFL-CIO affiliate of 20,000 hat workers.[25][57]
Unionization never proved popular with the employees or the culture of the company.[57] In 1976, the Oran factory voted to unionize with the Retail Clerks Union but the motion failed.[58] In 1985, the National Labor Relations Board ruled against International Hat Company for allegedly violating elements of the National Labor Relations Act.[57] The company was claimed to have infringed upon the right of Tex Barnes, a cutter at the International Hat factory in Piedmont, Missouri to organize a union.[57] Barnes led the efforts for certification in April 1980 and was also a member the union's negotiating committee.[57] However, as in previous instances, the union lost the election when put to an employee vote.[57] The union was formally decertified on March 4, 1982.[57] Barnes filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company nine months later.[57] Although the National Labor Relations Board ruled in Barnes' favor, the United States Court of Appeals Eighth Circuit vacated and remanded the earlier decision.[57]
Philanthropy[edit]
Main articles: Tilles Memorial City Park and Maria Pellegrino Park
International Hat engaged in various philanthropic activities. Most notably, was the establishment of two municipal parks under President and Chairman Pellegrino. Following the death of his business associate and the former president, Pellegrino donated land and money for the construction of a municipal park in Oran, the George Tilles Jr. Memorial Park.[32] In 1968, Pellegrino commissioned a new park in Marble Hill, MO.[59] Maria Pellegrino Park was dedicated in memory of Pellegrino's mother and opened to the public on June 2, 1972.[60] During the dedication ceremonies, the Mayor declared the event to be remembered as "Pellegrino Appreciation Day."[61] International Hat directly donated money to building the large pavilion at Pellegrino Park.[60]
Another philanthropic activity of the company was the donation of hats to certain American volunteer organizations. In 1981, International Hat donated 4,764 hats to the national convention of the Girls Scouts of America.[62] In 1989, the company produced 200 specially made women's spring hats for the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GWFC) convention delegates in Marble Hill.[63]
Legacy[edit]
In the subsequent decades of World War II, International Hat military fiber sun helmets, produced at the original factory in St. Louis, have become collector's items for military helmet and World War II collectors of American military uniform apparel. This is particularly true of the International Hat Marine helmets, which bear the USMC insignia on the front of the helmet.[53]
Facilities[edit]
Main article: International Hat Company warehouse




The International Hat Company warehouse, in the historic district of the Soulard neighborhood in St. Louis, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 20, 1980.[1]

International Hat had multiple domestic and international facilities. At the height of its expansion, International Hat operated seven domestic factories, several warehouses, several international buying offices, and a sales office in New York.[4] Among all its facilities, the International Hat Company warehouse in the Soulard neighborhood of St. Louis is of particular historic note. On October 20, 1980, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1] Built in 1904, by renowned architect Albert B. Groves, the building was originally a factory for the Brown Shoe Company.[1] In 1954, the factory was subsequently converted into a warehouse by the International Hat Company, which owned and operated the site until 1976.[1] The site has been recognized as a testament to Grove's architectural expertise in early 20th century industrial design.
In 1917, the original International Hat headquarters was located at 711 Lucas Avenue.[6] From 1917 to 1928, the factory manufactured straw harvest hats.[6] By the 1920s, the company was the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world from this facility.[6] In 1928, the company purchased 2528 Texas Avenue from Koken Barbers' Supply Company and sold the original factory at 711 Lucas to Koken as part of the deal.[6] The Texas location would continue manufacturing straw harvest hats, as well as all military sun helmets produced during and after World War II.[4] This five-story building included 87,000 square feet, or approximately two acres.[64][65] In 2016, this facility was purchased by two non-profit organizations, DeSales Community Development and St. Louis Makes to form a new joint private non-profit organization called Brick City Makes.[66][67] The Brick City Makes hub is noted as being the first non-profit organization in the United States to renovate an industrial building in order to provide rent space and development, as a business incubator, for entrepreneurial manufacturers.[65][66] The Brick City Makes business incubator, at the former International Hat factory, is the first model in the US to focus on business support services that grow the expertise and profitability of manufacturers and inventors until their organizations are large enough to exit the incubator and launch independently elsewhere.[66][68]
Six factories were located in Missouri and the seventh operated in Texas. The majority of warehouses were located with the factories onsite. From 1928 to the 1960s, the largest International Hat factory also served as the headquarters of the company, which was located in St. Louis, Missouri.[6] The other factories in Missouri were located in Chaffee, Dexter, Marble Hill, Piedmont, and Oran.[11][69][70] The Oran factory was constructed in 1946.[71] The factory was expanded in 1948 and 1968.[72] It eventually closed in 1984.[73] The Chaffee plant was closed in 1981 after opening in the summer of 1980 with 100 employees.[74][75][76] The Chaffee factory was operated by Florsheim Shoe Company, another subsidiary of Interco.[77] The Marble Hill factory was expanded in 1972.[78] The facility employed approximately 300 workers.[79] The Dexter facility was opened in 1959 and operated for 30 years under International Hat, eventually closing permanently in 1989.[3]

International Hat Company, formerly named the International Harvest Hat Company, was a St. Louis, Missouri-based manufacturer of commercial hats and military helmets.[9] The company was one of the largest hat manufacturers in the United States and, at one time, the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world.[6] It is best remembered for its design and mass production of tropical shaped, pressed fiber military sun helmets for soldiers of the United States Army, Marines, and Navy during and after World War II. Additionally, the American owned company was a major producer of harvest hats, straw hats, fiber sun hats, enameled dress hats, baseball caps, and earmuffs throughout most of the 20th century. However, it is the International Hat military sun helmets that have become the most notable collector's items.
Established in 1917 as a private corporation, the company began with a single product line of harvest straw hats.[4] By the late 1930s, the company had expanded into fiber pressed sun hats and leather harvest hats.[4] During World War II, International Hat developed and produced several models of military sun helmets, including a model with rudimentary ventilation.[10] After the war, the company became interested in plastic molding injection, moving increasingly away from pressed fiber. In the 1950s, General Fibre Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, changed its name to General Moulding Company to reflect these production changes in basic materials. By the 1960s, International Hat was mostly producing baseball caps, straw hats, earmuffs, plastic helmets, and plastic sun hats. During this era of expansion, the company had a proclivity for building its factories in small rural cities, often becoming the largest employer and economic backbone of those communities.[11][12] On several occasions, International Hat donated land or facility equipment for the creation of municipal parks located adjacent to one of its factories, namely for the purpose of benefiting employees, their families, and the local community.[13]
After sixty-one years of business, the company was sold in 1978 to Interco, Inc., where it continued operating as a subsidiary.[14][15] In 1988, Interco was the target of a hostile takeover bid. Consequently, International Hat was divested the following year to Paramount Cap Company, as part of a debt restructuring plan instituted by the parent company.[3] However, Interco subsequently went bankrupt in 1991, after selling 16 of its 20 subsidiaries.[16] Although International Hat was liquidated, several of its original factories are still in operation by other hat companies in Southeastern Missouri.[3][17] Additionally, one of International Hat's warehouses in the historic district of Soulard, Missouri has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1][18] International Hat operated the historical building from 1954 to 1976.[2] It is presently used as a senior and disabled living facility.[1]

History[edit]
First location and early company history[edit]




International Hat Company's second headquarters at 2528 Texas Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri.[9] The company's second factory, acquired in 1928 from Koken Barbers' Supply Company, produced all World War II era military helmets manufactured by the company.[6]


The company was founded by Isaac Apple on August 17, 1917 as International Harvest Hat Company.[4] The prominent St. Louis families of Apple and Tilles incorporated International Harvest Hat during the turbulence of World War I.[5] The Apple family had previously founded the Apple Hat Company, which was based in Fort Smith, Arkansas.[19][20] Among the co-founders of International Harvest Hat was George Tilles, Sr., whose sister Hannah, was married to Isaac Apple.[20] However, the elderly Tilles left operational management of the company to his brother-in-law Isaac Apple.[21] The other original minority shareholders at the time of incorporation included Alexander E. Rosenthal, Harry J. Talbot, and John C. Talbot.[22] Rosenthal, who had previously been at the Apple Hat Company, was appointed as the first general manager of International Harvest Hat.[23] However, in 1918, he was arrested in Galveston, Texas on charges of embezzlement for the unauthorized sale of nineteen bales of harvest straw hats.[23]
The original business model of the company was commercial hat production of harvest straw hats.[4] On the micro-economic level, St. Louis had become a center of hat manufacturing during the Second Industrial Revolution.[24] In 1900, 129 businesses in St. Louis were producing custom hats for women, with approximately 600 employees in the industry.[24] Within the decade, St. Louis was the fifth largest producer of fur felt hats.[24] International Harvest Hat proposed to do the same thing for straw harvest hats, by ramping up production capacity and challenging the manufacturing centers in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey.[24] The timing of market entry was favorable to the company's goals, as the organization was established at the peak decade of the commercial hat apparel market. In 1910, over 42 million hats were produced in the United States, an all-time record for domestic production.[25][26]
On the macroeconomic level, the company was founded at a time of ascendance for the United States. In 1916, the United States economic output, for the first time in history, was greater than that of the British Empire, establishing the United States as the world's largest economic superpower.[27] From World War I to the beginnings of the Great Depression, it was under these economic environmental conditions that the company originally produced a product line of harvest hats. Such hats of the period were a staple of farmers and field hands across the US.[21] By the 1920s, St. Louis replaced New England as the world's dominant manufacturing center for harvest hats.[28] International Harvest Hat was a major contributor to this regional shift in industrialization. By the early 1920s, the company had become the largest industrial producer of harvest hats in the world.[6] In 1928, the company produced over 36,000 per day and approximately 9.4 million harvest hats per year.[29]
With the rise of the automobile, fashions began to change by the 1930s. In 1931, the company expanded into men's straw dress hats to adopt to evolving fashion trends.[4] In 1938, the company name was changed to International Hat Company to better reflect the growing diversity of its product lines.[4] In 1940, the product lines were further expanded when International Hat began production of military sun helmets for the US military.[10] The war effort led to a realignment of production geared towards military apparel.[10]
With the death of Isaac Apple in 1935, his nephew George Tilles, Jr., was promoted to president of the company. Tilles served as president until his retirement in 1956 and as chairman of the board until his death in 1958.[21] Through the depression of the 1930s, Tilles managed the expansion of the company's facilities from a modest 5,000 square foot factory to a modernized 150,000 square foot factory.[30] Under Tilles, International Hat saw increasing growth during World War II. By 1942, the company's operations had grown to include its main factory facility, several warehouses, two buying offices in Mexico, and a sales office in New York City.[4] The company was also importing goods from a dozen countries.[4]
New markets and expansion[edit]




Frank Pellegrino, President and Chairman (1956–1975), built five factories, created two municipal parks, and expanded the post-WWII product lines of the company into plastic helmets and baseball caps.


Following World War II, the International Hat Company entered an expansionist period with new markets, facilities, product lines, and basic materials. Frank Pellegrino served as vice president under George Tilles, Jr., becoming president of International Hat from 1956 until 1971 and chairman until his death in 1975.[21][31] Tilles placed Pellegrino in charge of opening a second factory.[13] In 1946, a new facility was constructed and operational in Oran, Missouri, becoming the largest employer in the city.[32]
Pellegrino managed International Hat into a company of over 1,500 employees with six domestic factories. During the 1950s and 1960s, International Hat expanded from its factory in St. Louis to include five other factories located in Southeast Missouri. A number of these locations became one factory towns. Additionally, a sixth plant was opened in Texas.[15] Reflecting this period of expansion into foreign markets, the company headquarters was also moved from St. Louis to New York City.[15] During this era, the company continued producing military helmets and straw hats. However, the company expanded its products lines into plastic hats and helmets, as an early entrant into this new consumer market. As press fiber waned, plastic allowed for more automated production and lighter materials, without the ventilation issues of pressed fiber trapping heat. Throughout the 1960s, the company began shifting into the baseball cap market.[11] In 1967, International Hat began its first consumer focused advertising campaign, to expand its reach in the retail sector, with advertising agency Stemmler, Bartram, Fisher & Payne.[33] In the 1970s, the company expanded into the winter apparel market, selling earmuffs manufactured by VIP Industries.[34]
Under Pellegrino, this would later prove as the height of the expansion of the company in terms of size, productivity, and financial success.[35]
Sale, decline, and liquidation[edit]
Jean S. Goodson became president of International Hat in 1971, following Pellegrino's retirement.[31] That same year Pellegrino was elected chairman of the board, which he retained until his death in 1975. Goodson began cutting down on the company's imports from the New York office and limiting the production of dress hats to focus on other product lines.[35] Unsatisfied with his performance, the board of directors requested Frank G. Pellegrino, Sr., minority shareholder and son of Frank P. Pellegrino, represent International Hat in pursuing the sale of the company.[36] At that time, Pellegrino was president of General Moulding Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, in the production of plastic molds for the parent company's hats and helmets. In 1977, Pellegrino initiated the sale of the company to Interco, Incorporated, a conglomerate of furniture, apparel, and shoe companies (now known as Furniture Brands International). On March 31, 1978, a special meeting of the stockholders was held to consider the terms by which Interco offered International Hat.[35] The stockholders accepted the deal and International Hat was officially sold to Interco by the end of the day.[15] The original shareholders were bought out and Jean Goodson continued on as a member of the Interco board of directors from 1978 until his retirement in 1985.[15][37] The company was purchased for 166,667 shares of Interco common stock.[38]
As a subsidiary, International Hat continued operation until June 14, 1989.[39][40] The domestic hat apparel market had undergone a steady increase in global competition since the 1970s during a time of record sales of hats in the US.[41] The company was pressured by changing market conditions, particularly the US loss of market share from cheaper imports coming in from Brazil, Spain, Taiwan, and China.[42] In 1984, China alone exported 2.98 million dozens of hats to the United States.[3] By 1989, 6.5 million dozens of hats were being imported from China, representing 31 percent of the total market share of the hat apparel industry.[3] Demand for hats actually increased during this period, whereas the US market share of hats decreased from 27.1 percent to 22.2 percent from 1984 to 1989.[3]
However, the mortal blow to the company derived from Interco's response to a hostile takeover bid. In 1988, Steven and Mitchell Rales, of the Cardinal Acquisition Corporation, offered $2.5 billion for the company.[43] In response to the offer, Interco's board authorized $1.95 billion in additional debt to buyback stock.[16] Senior management hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to restructure the company, including a plan to sell 16 of Interco's 20 companies.[44][45] While this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover, the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years.[46] From 1989 to 1991, Interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions in an attempt to remain solvent.[47] While the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation, the full value of these assets was never realized by Interco, as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds.[48] The combination of selling the majority of its companies, while being saddled by over $2 billion in debt, created unsustainable negative cash flow, resulting in Inteco's bankruptcy in 1991.[46] Thus in spite of being a profitable subsidiary, International Hat was liquidated in 1989 in a fire sale to Paramount Cap Company.[3]
Successors[edit]
The factories in Dexter, Marble Hill, and Oran were re-opened in May 1989, after being sold in the liquidation to Paramount Cap Company.[3][17] The Dexter plant was shuttered in 2000 before being sold to Venture Products, Inc. and re-opened in 2001.[49] The factory in Oran was sold to Carr Textile Corporation, which was subsequently sold to Venture Products, Inc.[50] At present, the Oran hat plant is operational in the production of straw hats.

International Hat produced a variety of products over eighty-three years of operations. However, it is most well known for its production of several different models of fiber pressed military sun helmets provided to the US armed services during World War II. From World War II to the Gulf War, the pressed fiber sun helmet is noted for the historic length of its military usage in the United States, outlasting the M1 steel helmet by approximately ten years.[52] This makes the pressed fiber sun helmet one of the longest used helmets in service by the United States military.[52] Throughout World War II, International Hat was one of two major government contracted manufacturers of the pressed fiber sun helmets for US military personnel.[53][52] Hawley Products Company was the other major government contractor.[53][54] Between Hawley Products Company and International Hat Company, over 100,000 sun helmets were produced for military use in the European and Pacific theaters.[51]
The United States Marine Corps used the International Hat sun helmet both as combat gear and as part of the Marine Corps training uniform.[53][55] The pith helmet, nicknamed the "elephant hat", was first issued to the 1st Marine Division for its 1941 deployment to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The pith helmet has been retained as the mark of the marksmanship range coach.[56]
Although the International Hat sun helmet was designed and introduced before the M1 steel helmet, the International Hat sun helmet continued to be used in the military for many decades, including the Korean War and Vietnam War.[53][52] By the Gulf War, only certain personnel in the US Navy had the pressed fiber sun helmet as serviceable gear.[53]
Military logistics records preserve the stock number, product type, military service date, and quantity produced for military use. Each service branch of the military kept separate quartermaster records until 1947. In particular, the US Army is known to have commissioned 38,423 International Hat helmets for World War II and its aftermath.[10]

Legal issues[edit]




Manufacturing code hearing (1934) Washington, D.C. with International Hat Company representatives seated at the bottom of left table. International Hat was an early participant in the establishment of industry standards, product certification, and claimant issues arising from patent infringement cases within the hat segment of the U.S. apparel industry.


International Hat has had several labor issues settled in the US legal system. The company also participated in ways to avoid legal issues. In 1934, Frank P. Pellegrino represented the company in Washington D.C. at the US Hat Manufacturing Code hearing, to update manufacturing and labor practices within the industry, as the industry attempted to mitigate the need for government regulation during the New Deal era. International Hat's labor issues were generally with the National Labor Relations Board and the issue of unionization. Over the decades, the employees of the company never unionized, although unsuccessful attempts at unionization were made in joining the United Hatters, Cap, and Millinery Workers International, an AFL-CIO affiliate of 20,000 hat workers.[25][57]
Unionization never proved popular with the employees or the culture of the company.[57] In 1976, the Oran factory voted to unionize with the Retail Clerks Union but the motion failed.[58] In 1985, the National Labor Relations Board ruled against International Hat Company for allegedly violating elements of the National Labor Relations Act.[57] The company was claimed to have infringed upon the right of Tex Barnes, a cutter at the International Hat factory in Piedmont, Missouri to organize a union.[57] Barnes led the efforts for certification in April 1980 and was also a member the union's negotiating committee.[57] However, as in previous instances, the union lost the election when put to an employee vote.[57] The union was formally decertified on March 4, 1982.[57] Barnes filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company nine months later.[57] Although the National Labor Relations Board ruled in Barnes' favor, the United States Court of Appeals Eighth Circuit vacated and remanded the earlier decision.[57]
Philanthropy[edit]
Main articles: Tilles Memorial City Park and Maria Pellegrino Park
International Hat engaged in various philanthropic activities. Most notably, was the establishment of two municipal parks under President and Chairman Pellegrino. Following the death of his business associate and the former president, Pellegrino donated land and money for the construction of a municipal park in Oran, the George Tilles Jr. Memorial Park.[32] In 1968, Pellegrino commissioned a new park in Marble Hill, MO.[59] Maria Pellegrino Park was dedicated in memory of Pellegrino's mother and opened to the public on June 2, 1972.[60] During the dedication ceremonies, the Mayor declared the event to be remembered as "Pellegrino Appreciation Day."[61] International Hat directly donated money to building the large pavilion at Pellegrino Park.[60]
Another philanthropic activity of the company was the donation of hats to certain American volunteer organizations. In 1981, International Hat donated 4,764 hats to the national convention of the Girls Scouts of America.[62] In 1989, the company produced 200 specially made women's spring hats for the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GWFC) convention delegates in Marble Hill.[63]
Legacy[edit]
In the subsequent decades of World War II, International Hat military fiber sun helmets, produced at the original factory in St. Louis, have become collector's items for military helmet and World War II collectors of American military uniform apparel. This is particularly true of the International Hat Marine helmets, which bear the USMC insignia on the front of the helmet.[53]
Facilities[edit]
Main article: International Hat Company warehouse




The International Hat Company warehouse, in the historic district of the Soulard neighborhood in St. Louis, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 20, 1980.[1]

International Hat had multiple domestic and international facilities. At the height of its expansion, International Hat operated seven domestic factories, several warehouses, several international buying offices, and a sales office in New York.[4] Among all its facilities, the International Hat Company warehouse in the Soulard neighborhood of St. Louis is of particular historic note. On October 20, 1980, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1] Built in 1904, by renowned architect Albert B. Groves, the building was originally a factory for the Brown Shoe Company.[1] In 1954, the factory was subsequently converted into a warehouse by the International Hat Company, which owned and operated the site until 1976.[1] The site has been recognized as a testament to Grove's architectural expertise in early 20th century industrial design.
In 1917, the original International Hat headquarters was located at 711 Lucas Avenue.[6] From 1917 to 1928, the factory manufactured straw harvest hats.[6] By the 1920s, the company was the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world from this facility.[6] In 1928, the company purchased 2528 Texas Avenue from Koken Barbers' Supply Company and sold the original factory at 711 Lucas to Koken as part of the deal.[6] The Texas location would continue manufacturing straw harvest hats, as well as all military sun helmets produced during and after World War II.[4] This five-story building included 87,000 square feet, or approximately two acres.[64][65] In 2016, this facility was purchased by two non-profit organizations, DeSales Community Development and St. Louis Makes to form a new joint private non-profit organization called Brick City Makes.[66][67] The Brick City Makes hub is noted as being the first non-profit organization in the United States to renovate an industrial building in order to provide rent space and development, as a business incubator, for entrepreneurial manufacturers.[65][66] The Brick City Makes business incubator, at the former International Hat factory, is the first model in the US to focus on business support services that grow the expertise and profitability of manufacturers and inventors until their organizations are large enough to exit the incubator and launch independently elsewhere.[66][68]
Six factories were located in Missouri and the seventh operated in Texas. The majority of warehouses were located with the factories onsite. From 1928 to the 1960s, the largest International Hat factory also served as the headquarters of the company, which was located in St. Louis, Missouri.[6] The other factories in Missouri were located in Chaffee, Dexter, Marble Hill, Piedmont, and Oran.[11][69][70] The Oran factory was constructed in 1946.[71] The factory was expanded in 1948 and 1968.[72] It eventually closed in 1984.[73] The Chaffee plant was closed in 1981 after opening in the summer of 1980 with 100 employees.[74][75][76] The Chaffee factory was operated by Florsheim Shoe Company, another subsidiary of Interco.[77] The Marble Hill factory was expanded in 1972.[78] The facility employed approximately 300 workers.[79] The Dexter facility was opened in 1959 and operated for 30 years under International Hat, eventually closing permanently in 1989.[3]

International Hat Company, formerly named the International Harvest Hat Company, was a St. Louis, Missouri-based manufacturer of commercial hats and military helmets.[9] The company was one of the largest hat manufacturers in the United States and, at one time, the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world.[6] It is best remembered for its design and mass production of tropical shaped, pressed fiber military sun helmets for soldiers of the United States Army, Marines, and Navy during and after World War II. Additionally, the American owned company was a major producer of harvest hats, straw hats, fiber sun hats, enameled dress hats, baseball caps, and earmuffs throughout most of the 20th century. However, it is the International Hat military sun helmets that have become the most notable collector's items.
Established in 1917 as a private corporation, the company began with a single product line of harvest straw hats.[4] By the late 1930s, the company had expanded into fiber pressed sun hats and leather harvest hats.[4] During World War II, International Hat developed and produced several models of military sun helmets, including a model with rudimentary ventilation.[10] After the war, the company became interested in plastic molding injection, moving increasingly away from pressed fiber. In the 1950s, General Fibre Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, changed its name to General Moulding Company to reflect these production changes in basic materials. By the 1960s, International Hat was mostly producing baseball caps, straw hats, earmuffs, plastic helmets, and plastic sun hats. During this era of expansion, the company had a proclivity for building its factories in small rural cities, often becoming the largest employer and economic backbone of those communities.[11][12] On several occasions, International Hat donated land or facility equipment for the creation of municipal parks located adjacent to one of its factories, namely for the purpose of benefiting employees, their families, and the local community.[13]
After sixty-one years of business, the company was sold in 1978 to Interco, Inc., where it continued operating as a subsidiary.[14][15] In 1988, Interco was the target of a hostile takeover bid. Consequently, International Hat was divested the following year to Paramount Cap Company, as part of a debt restructuring plan instituted by the parent company.[3] However, Interco subsequently went bankrupt in 1991, after selling 16 of its 20 subsidiaries.[16] Although International Hat was liquidated, several of its original factories are still in operation by other hat companies in Southeastern Missouri.[3][17] Additionally, one of International Hat's warehouses in the historic district of Soulard, Missouri has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1][18] International Hat operated the historical building from 1954 to 1976.[2] It is presently used as a senior and disabled living facility.[1]

History[edit]
First location and early company history[edit]




International Hat Company's second headquarters at 2528 Texas Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri.[9] The company's second factory, acquired in 1928 from Koken Barbers' Supply Company, produced all World War II era military helmets manufactured by the company.[6]


The company was founded by Isaac Apple on August 17, 1917 as International Harvest Hat Company.[4] The prominent St. Louis families of Apple and Tilles incorporated International Harvest Hat during the turbulence of World War I.[5] The Apple family had previously founded the Apple Hat Company, which was based in Fort Smith, Arkansas.[19][20] Among the co-founders of International Harvest Hat was George Tilles, Sr., whose sister Hannah, was married to Isaac Apple.[20] However, the elderly Tilles left operational management of the company to his brother-in-law Isaac Apple.[21] The other original minority shareholders at the time of incorporation included Alexander E. Rosenthal, Harry J. Talbot, and John C. Talbot.[22] Rosenthal, who had previously been at the Apple Hat Company, was appointed as the first general manager of International Harvest Hat.[23] However, in 1918, he was arrested in Galveston, Texas on charges of embezzlement for the unauthorized sale of nineteen bales of harvest straw hats.[23]
The original business model of the company was commercial hat production of harvest straw hats.[4] On the micro-economic level, St. Louis had become a center of hat manufacturing during the Second Industrial Revolution.[24] In 1900, 129 businesses in St. Louis were producing custom hats for women, with approximately 600 employees in the industry.[24] Within the decade, St. Louis was the fifth largest producer of fur felt hats.[24] International Harvest Hat proposed to do the same thing for straw harvest hats, by ramping up production capacity and challenging the manufacturing centers in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey.[24] The timing of market entry was favorable to the company's goals, as the organization was established at the peak decade of the commercial hat apparel market. In 1910, over 42 million hats were produced in the United States, an all-time record for domestic production.[25][26]
On the macroeconomic level, the company was founded at a time of ascendance for the United States. In 1916, the United States economic output, for the first time in history, was greater than that of the British Empire, establishing the United States as the world's largest economic superpower.[27] From World War I to the beginnings of the Great Depression, it was under these economic environmental conditions that the company originally produced a product line of harvest hats. Such hats of the period were a staple of farmers and field hands across the US.[21] By the 1920s, St. Louis replaced New England as the world's dominant manufacturing center for harvest hats.[28] International Harvest Hat was a major contributor to this regional shift in industrialization. By the early 1920s, the company had become the largest industrial producer of harvest hats in the world.[6] In 1928, the company produced over 36,000 per day and approximately 9.4 million harvest hats per year.[29]
With the rise of the automobile, fashions began to change by the 1930s. In 1931, the company expanded into men's straw dress hats to adopt to evolving fashion trends.[4] In 1938, the company name was changed to International Hat Company to better reflect the growing diversity of its product lines.[4] In 1940, the product lines were further expanded when International Hat began production of military sun helmets for the US military.[10] The war effort led to a realignment of production geared towards military apparel.[10]
With the death of Isaac Apple in 1935, his nephew George Tilles, Jr., was promoted to president of the company. Tilles served as president until his retirement in 1956 and as chairman of the board until his death in 1958.[21] Through the depression of the 1930s, Tilles managed the expansion of the company's facilities from a modest 5,000 square foot factory to a modernized 150,000 square foot factory.[30] Under Tilles, International Hat saw increasing growth during World War II. By 1942, the company's operations had grown to include its main factory facility, several warehouses, two buying offices in Mexico, and a sales office in New York City.[4] The company was also importing goods from a dozen countries.[4]
New markets and expansion[edit]




Frank Pellegrino, President and Chairman (1956–1975), built five factories, created two municipal parks, and expanded the post-WWII product lines of the company into plastic helmets and baseball caps.


Following World War II, the International Hat Company entered an expansionist period with new markets, facilities, product lines, and basic materials. Frank Pellegrino served as vice president under George Tilles, Jr., becoming president of International Hat from 1956 until 1971 and chairman until his death in 1975.[21][31] Tilles placed Pellegrino in charge of opening a second factory.[13] In 1946, a new facility was constructed and operational in Oran, Missouri, becoming the largest employer in the city.[32]
Pellegrino managed International Hat into a company of over 1,500 employees with six domestic factories. During the 1950s and 1960s, International Hat expanded from its factory in St. Louis to include five other factories located in Southeast Missouri. A number of these locations became one factory towns. Additionally, a sixth plant was opened in Texas.[15] Reflecting this period of expansion into foreign markets, the company headquarters was also moved from St. Louis to New York City.[15] During this era, the company continued producing military helmets and straw hats. However, the company expanded its products lines into plastic hats and helmets, as an early entrant into this new consumer market. As press fiber waned, plastic allowed for more automated production and lighter materials, without the ventilation issues of pressed fiber trapping heat. Throughout the 1960s, the company began shifting into the baseball cap market.[11] In 1967, International Hat began its first consumer focused advertising campaign, to expand its reach in the retail sector, with advertising agency Stemmler, Bartram, Fisher & Payne.[33] In the 1970s, the company expanded into the winter apparel market, selling earmuffs manufactured by VIP Industries.[34]
Under Pellegrino, this would later prove as the height of the expansion of the company in terms of size, productivity, and financial success.[35]
Sale, decline, and liquidation[edit]
Jean S. Goodson became president of International Hat in 1971, following Pellegrino's retirement.[31] That same year Pellegrino was elected chairman of the board, which he retained until his death in 1975. Goodson began cutting down on the company's imports from the New York office and limiting the production of dress hats to focus on other product lines.[35] Unsatisfied with his performance, the board of directors requested Frank G. Pellegrino, Sr., minority shareholder and son of Frank P. Pellegrino, represent International Hat in pursuing the sale of the company.[36] At that time, Pellegrino was president of General Moulding Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, in the production of plastic molds for the parent company's hats and helmets. In 1977, Pellegrino initiated the sale of the company to Interco, Incorporated, a conglomerate of furniture, apparel, and shoe companies (now known as Furniture Brands International). On March 31, 1978, a special meeting of the stockholders was held to consider the terms by which Interco offered International Hat.[35] The stockholders accepted the deal and International Hat was officially sold to Interco by the end of the day.[15] The original shareholders were bought out and Jean Goodson continued on as a member of the Interco board of directors from 1978 until his retirement in 1985.[15][37] The company was purchased for 166,667 shares of Interco common stock.[38]
As a subsidiary, International Hat continued operation until June 14, 1989.[39][40] The domestic hat apparel market had undergone a steady increase in global competition since the 1970s during a time of record sales of hats in the US.[41] The company was pressured by changing market conditions, particularly the US loss of market share from cheaper imports coming in from Brazil, Spain, Taiwan, and China.[42] In 1984, China alone exported 2.98 million dozens of hats to the United States.[3] By 1989, 6.5 million dozens of hats were being imported from China, representing 31 percent of the total market share of the hat apparel industry.[3] Demand for hats actually increased during this period, whereas the US market share of hats decreased from 27.1 percent to 22.2 percent from 1984 to 1989.[3]
However, the mortal blow to the company derived from Interco's response to a hostile takeover bid. In 1988, Steven and Mitchell Rales, of the Cardinal Acquisition Corporation, offered $2.5 billion for the company.[43] In response to the offer, Interco's board authorized $1.95 billion in additional debt to buyback stock.[16] Senior management hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to restructure the company, including a plan to sell 16 of Interco's 20 companies.[44][45] While this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover, the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years.[46] From 1989 to 1991, Interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions in an attempt to remain solvent.[47] While the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation, the full value of these assets was never realized by Interco, as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds.[48] The combination of selling the majority of its companies, while being saddled by over $2 billion in debt, created unsustainable negative cash flow, resulting in Inteco's bankruptcy in 1991.[46] Thus in spite of being a profitable subsidiary, International Hat was liquidated in 1989 in a fire sale to Paramount Cap Company.[3]
Successors[edit]
The factories in Dexter, Marble Hill, and Oran were re-opened in May 1989, after being sold in the liquidation to Paramount Cap Company.[3][17] The Dexter plant was shuttered in 2000 before being sold to Venture Products, Inc. and re-opened in 2001.[49] The factory in Oran was sold to Carr Textile Corporation, which was subsequently sold to Venture Products, Inc.[50] At present, the Oran hat plant is operational in the production of straw hats.
Products[edit]

International Hat produced a variety of products over eighty-three years of operations. However, it is most well known for its production of several different models of fiber pressed military sun helmets provided to the US armed services during World War II. From World War II to the Gulf War, the pressed fiber sun helmet is noted for the historic length of its military usage in the United States, outlasting the M1 steel helmet by approximately ten years.[52] This makes the pressed fiber sun helmet one of the longest used helmets in service by the United States military.[52] Throughout World War II, International Hat was one of two major government contracted manufacturers of the pressed fiber sun helmets for US military personnel.[53][52] Hawley Products Company was the other major government contractor.[53][54] Between Hawley Products Company and International Hat Company, over 100,000 sun helmets were produced for military use in the European and Pacific theaters.[51]
The United States Marine Corps used the International Hat sun helmet both as combat gear and as part of the Marine Corps training uniform.[53][55] The pith helmet, nicknamed the "elephant hat", was first issued to the 1st Marine Division for its 1941 deployment to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The pith helmet has been retained as the mark of the marksmanship range coach.[56]
Although the International Hat sun helmet was designed and introduced before the M1 steel helmet, the International Hat sun helmet continued to be used in the military for many decades, including the Korean War and Vietnam War.[53][52] By the Gulf War, only certain personnel in the US Navy had the pressed fiber sun helmet as serviceable gear.[53]
Military logistics records preserve the stock number, product type, military service date, and quantity produced for military use. Each service branch of the military kept separate quartermaster records until 1947. In particular, the US Army is known to have commissioned 38,423 International Hat helmets for World War II and its aftermath.[10]

Legal issues[edit]




Manufacturing code hearing (1934) Washington, D.C. with International Hat Company representatives seated at the bottom of left table. International Hat was an early participant in the establishment of industry standards, product certification, and claimant issues arising from patent infringement cases within the hat segment of the U.S. apparel industry.


International Hat has had several labor issues settled in the US legal system. The company also participated in ways to avoid legal issues. In 1934, Frank P. Pellegrino represented the company in Washington D.C. at the US Hat Manufacturing Code hearing, to update manufacturing and labor practices within the industry, as the industry attempted to mitigate the need for government regulation during the New Deal era. International Hat's labor issues were generally with the National Labor Relations Board and the issue of unionization. Over the decades, the employees of the company never unionized, although unsuccessful attempts at unionization were made in joining the United Hatters, Cap, and Millinery Workers International, an AFL-CIO affiliate of 20,000 hat workers.[25][57]
Unionization never proved popular with the employees or the culture of the company.[57] In 1976, the Oran factory voted to unionize with the Retail Clerks Union but the motion failed.[58] In 1985, the National Labor Relations Board ruled against International Hat Company for allegedly violating elements of the National Labor Relations Act.[57] The company was claimed to have infringed upon the right of Tex Barnes, a cutter at the International Hat factory in Piedmont, Missouri to organize a union.[57] Barnes led the efforts for certification in April 1980 and was also a member the union's negotiating committee.[57] However, as in previous instances, the union lost the election when put to an employee vote.[57] The union was formally decertified on March 4, 1982.[57] Barnes filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company nine months later.[57] Although the National Labor Relations Board ruled in Barnes' favor, the United States Court of Appeals Eighth Circuit vacated and remanded the earlier decision.[57]
Philanthropy[edit]
Main articles: Tilles Memorial City Park and Maria Pellegrino Park
International Hat engaged in various philanthropic activities. Most notably, was the establishment of two municipal parks under President and Chairman Pellegrino. Following the death of his business associate and the former president, Pellegrino donated land and money for the construction of a municipal park in Oran, the George Tilles Jr. Memorial Park.[32] In 1968, Pellegrino commissioned a new park in Marble Hill, MO.[59] Maria Pellegrino Park was dedicated in memory of Pellegrino's mother and opened to the public on June 2, 1972.[60] During the dedication ceremonies, the Mayor declared the event to be remembered as "Pellegrino Appreciation Day."[61] International Hat directly donated money to building the large pavilion at Pellegrino Park.[60]
Another philanthropic activity of the company was the donation of hats to certain American volunteer organizations. In 1981, International Hat donated 4,764 hats to the national convention of the Girls Scouts of America.[62] In 1989, the company produced 200 specially made women's spring hats for the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GWFC) convention delegates in Marble Hill.[63]
Legacy[edit]
In the subsequent decades of World War II, International Hat military fiber sun helmets, produced at the original factory in St. Louis, have become collector's items for military helmet and World War II collectors of American military uniform apparel. This is particularly true of the International Hat Marine helmets, which bear the USMC insignia on the front of the helmet.[53]
Facilities[edit]
Main article: International Hat Company warehouse




The International Hat Company warehouse, in the historic district of the Soulard neighborhood in St. Louis, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 20, 1980.[1]

International Hat had multiple domestic and international facilities. At the height of its expansion, International Hat operated seven domestic factories, several warehouses, several international buying offices, and a sales office in New York.[4] Among all its facilities, the International Hat Company warehouse in the Soulard neighborhood of St. Louis is of particular historic note. On October 20, 1980, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1] Built in 1904, by renowned architect Albert B. Groves, the building was originally a factory for the Brown Shoe Company.[1] In 1954, the factory was subsequently converted into a warehouse by the International Hat Company, which owned and operated the site until 1976.[1] The site has been recognized as a testament to Grove's architectural expertise in early 20th century industrial design.
In 1917, the original International Hat headquarters was located at 711 Lucas Avenue.[6] From 1917 to 1928, the factory manufactured straw harvest hats.[6] By the 1920s, the company was the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world from this facility.[6] In 1928, the company purchased 2528 Texas Avenue from Koken Barbers' Supply Company and sold the original factory at 711 Lucas to Koken as part of the deal.[6] The Texas location would continue manufacturing straw harvest hats, as well as all military sun helmets produced during and after World War II.[4] This five-story building included 87,000 square feet, or approximately two acres.[64][65] In 2016, this facility was purchased by two non-profit organizations, DeSales Community Development and St. Louis Makes to form a new joint private non-profit organization called Brick City Makes.[66][67] The Brick City Makes hub is noted as being the first non-profit organization in the United States to renovate an industrial building in order to provide rent space and development, as a business incubator, for entrepreneurial manufacturers.[65][66] The Brick City Makes business incubator, at the former International Hat factory, is the first model in the US to focus on business support services that grow the expertise and profitability of manufacturers and inventors until their organizations are large enough to exit the incubator and launch independently elsewhere.[66][68]
Six factories were located in Missouri and the seventh operated in Texas. The majority of warehouses were located with the factories onsite. From 1928 to the 1960s, the largest International Hat factory also served as the headquarters of the company, which was located in St. Louis, Missouri.[6] The other factories in Missouri were located in Chaffee, Dexter, Marble Hill, Piedmont, and Oran.[11][69][70] The Oran factory was constructed in 1946.[71] The factory was expanded in 1948 and 1968.[72] It eventually closed in 1984.[73] The Chaffee plant was closed in 1981 after opening in the summer of 1980 with 100 employees.[74][75][76] The Chaffee factory was operated by Florsheim Shoe Company, another subsidiary of Interco.[77] The Marble Hill factory was expanded in 1972.[78] The facility employed approximately 300 workers.[79] The Dexter facility was opened in 1959 and operated for 30 years under International Hat, eventually closing permanently in 1989.[3]

International Hat Company, formerly named the International Harvest Hat Company, was a St. Louis, Missouri-based manufacturer of commercial hats and military helmets.[9] The company was one of the largest hat manufacturers in the United States and, at one time, the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world.[6] It is best remembered for its design and mass production of tropical shaped, pressed fiber military sun helmets for soldiers of the United States Army, Marines, and Navy during and after World War II. Additionally, the American owned company was a major producer of harvest hats, straw hats, fiber sun hats, enameled dress hats, baseball caps, and earmuffs throughout most of the 20th century. However, it is the International Hat military sun helmets that have become the most notable collector's items.
Established in 1917 as a private corporation, the company began with a single product line of harvest straw hats.[4] By the late 1930s, the company had expanded into fiber pressed sun hats and leather harvest hats.[4] During World War II, International Hat developed and produced several models of military sun helmets, including a model with rudimentary ventilation.[10] After the war, the company became interested in plastic molding injection, moving increasingly away from pressed fiber. In the 1950s, General Fibre Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, changed its name to General Moulding Company to reflect these production changes in basic materials. By the 1960s, International Hat was mostly producing baseball caps, straw hats, earmuffs, plastic helmets, and plastic sun hats. During this era of expansion, the company had a proclivity for building its factories in small rural cities, often becoming the largest employer and economic backbone of those communities.[11][12] On several occasions, International Hat donated land or facility equipment for the creation of municipal parks located adjacent to one of its factories, namely for the purpose of benefiting employees, their families, and the local community.[13]
After sixty-one years of business, the company was sold in 1978 to Interco, Inc., where it continued operating as a subsidiary.[14][15] In 1988, Interco was the target of a hostile takeover bid. Consequently, International Hat was divested the following year to Paramount Cap Company, as part of a debt restructuring plan instituted by the parent company.[3] However, Interco subsequently went bankrupt in 1991, after selling 16 of its 20 subsidiaries.[16] Although International Hat was liquidated, several of its original factories are still in operation by other hat companies in Southeastern Missouri.[3][17] Additionally, one of International Hat's warehouses in the historic district of Soulard, Missouri has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1][18] International Hat operated the historical building from 1954 to 1976.[2] It is presently used as a senior and disabled living facility.[1]

History[edit]
First location and early company history[edit]




International Hat Company's second headquarters at 2528 Texas Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri.[9] The company's second factory, acquired in 1928 from Koken Barbers' Supply Company, produced all World War II era military helmets manufactured by the company.[6]


The company was founded by Isaac Apple on August 17, 1917 as International Harvest Hat Company.[4] The prominent St. Louis families of Apple and Tilles incorporated International Harvest Hat during the turbulence of World War I.[5] The Apple family had previously founded the Apple Hat Company, which was based in Fort Smith, Arkansas.[19][20] Among the co-founders of International Harvest Hat was George Tilles, Sr., whose sister Hannah, was married to Isaac Apple.[20] However, the elderly Tilles left operational management of the company to his brother-in-law Isaac Apple.[21] The other original minority shareholders at the time of incorporation included Alexander E. Rosenthal, Harry J. Talbot, and John C. Talbot.[22] Rosenthal, who had previously been at the Apple Hat Company, was appointed as the first general manager of International Harvest Hat.[23] However, in 1918, he was arrested in Galveston, Texas on charges of embezzlement for the unauthorized sale of nineteen bales of harvest straw hats.[23]
The original business model of the company was commercial hat production of harvest straw hats.[4] On the micro-economic level, St. Louis had become a center of hat manufacturing during the Second Industrial Revolution.[24] In 1900, 129 businesses in St. Louis were producing custom hats for women, with approximately 600 employees in the industry.[24] Within the decade, St. Louis was the fifth largest producer of fur felt hats.[24] International Harvest Hat proposed to do the same thing for straw harvest hats, by ramping up production capacity and challenging the manufacturing centers in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey.[24] The timing of market entry was favorable to the company's goals, as the organization was established at the peak decade of the commercial hat apparel market. In 1910, over 42 million hats were produced in the United States, an all-time record for domestic production.[25][26]
On the macroeconomic level, the company was founded at a time of ascendance for the United States. In 1916, the United States economic output, for the first time in history, was greater than that of the British Empire, establishing the United States as the world's largest economic superpower.[27] From World War I to the beginnings of the Great Depression, it was under these economic environmental conditions that the company originally produced a product line of harvest hats. Such hats of the period were a staple of farmers and field hands across the US.[21] By the 1920s, St. Louis replaced New England as the world's dominant manufacturing center for harvest hats.[28] International Harvest Hat was a major contributor to this regional shift in industrialization. By the early 1920s, the company had become the largest industrial producer of harvest hats in the world.[6] In 1928, the company produced over 36,000 per day and approximately 9.4 million harvest hats per year.[29]
With the rise of the automobile, fashions began to change by the 1930s. In 1931, the company expanded into men's straw dress hats to adopt to evolving fashion trends.[4] In 1938, the company name was changed to International Hat Company to better reflect the growing diversity of its product lines.[4] In 1940, the product lines were further expanded when International Hat began production of military sun helmets for the US military.[10] The war effort led to a realignment of production geared towards military apparel.[10]
With the death of Isaac Apple in 1935, his nephew George Tilles, Jr., was promoted to president of the company. Tilles served as president until his retirement in 1956 and as chairman of the board until his death in 1958.[21] Through the depression of the 1930s, Tilles managed the expansion of the company's facilities from a modest 5,000 square foot factory to a modernized 150,000 square foot factory.[30] Under Tilles, International Hat saw increasing growth during World War II. By 1942, the company's operations had grown to include its main factory facility, several warehouses, two buying offices in Mexico, and a sales office in New York City.[4] The company was also importing goods from a dozen countries.[4]
New markets and expansion[edit]




Frank Pellegrino, President and Chairman (1956–1975), built five factories, created two municipal parks, and expanded the post-WWII product lines of the company into plastic helmets and baseball caps.


Following World War II, the International Hat Company entered an expansionist period with new markets, facilities, product lines, and basic materials. Frank Pellegrino served as vice president under George Tilles, Jr., becoming president of International Hat from 1956 until 1971 and chairman until his death in 1975.[21][31] Tilles placed Pellegrino in charge of opening a second factory.[13] In 1946, a new facility was constructed and operational in Oran, Missouri, becoming the largest employer in the city.[32]
Pellegrino managed International Hat into a company of over 1,500 employees with six domestic factories. During the 1950s and 1960s, International Hat expanded from its factory in St. Louis to include five other factories located in Southeast Missouri. A number of these locations became one factory towns. Additionally, a sixth plant was opened in Texas.[15] Reflecting this period of expansion into foreign markets, the company headquarters was also moved from St. Louis to New York City.[15] During this era, the company continued producing military helmets and straw hats. However, the company expanded its products lines into plastic hats and helmets, as an early entrant into this new consumer market. As press fiber waned, plastic allowed for more automated production and lighter materials, without the ventilation issues of pressed fiber trapping heat. Throughout the 1960s, the company began shifting into the baseball cap market.[11] In 1967, International Hat began its first consumer focused advertising campaign, to expand its reach in the retail sector, with advertising agency Stemmler, Bartram, Fisher & Payne.[33] In the 1970s, the company expanded into the winter apparel market, selling earmuffs manufactured by VIP Industries.[34]
Under Pellegrino, this would later prove as the height of the expansion of the company in terms of size, productivity, and financial success.[35]
Sale, decline, and liquidation[edit]
Jean S. Goodson became president of International Hat in 1971, following Pellegrino's retirement.[31] That same year Pellegrino was elected chairman of the board, which he retained until his death in 1975. Goodson began cutting down on the company's imports from the New York office and limiting the production of dress hats to focus on other product lines.[35] Unsatisfied with his performance, the board of directors requested Frank G. Pellegrino, Sr., minority shareholder and son of Frank P. Pellegrino, represent International Hat in pursuing the sale of the company.[36] At that time, Pellegrino was president of General Moulding Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, in the production of plastic molds for the parent company's hats and helmets. In 1977, Pellegrino initiated the sale of the company to Interco, Incorporated, a conglomerate of furniture, apparel, and shoe companies (now known as Furniture Brands International). On March 31, 1978, a special meeting of the stockholders was held to consider the terms by which Interco offered International Hat.[35] The stockholders accepted the deal and International Hat was officially sold to Interco by the end of the day.[15] The original shareholders were bought out and Jean Goodson continued on as a member of the Interco board of directors from 1978 until his retirement in 1985.[15][37] The company was purchased for 166,667 shares of Interco common stock.[38]
As a subsidiary, International Hat continued operation until June 14, 1989.[39][40] The domestic hat apparel market had undergone a steady increase in global competition since the 1970s during a time of record sales of hats in the US.[41] The company was pressured by changing market conditions, particularly the US loss of market share from cheaper imports coming in from Brazil, Spain, Taiwan, and China.[42] In 1984, China alone exported 2.98 million dozens of hats to the United States.[3] By 1989, 6.5 million dozens of hats were being imported from China, representing 31 percent of the total market share of the hat apparel industry.[3] Demand for hats actually increased during this period, whereas the US market share of hats decreased from 27.1 percent to 22.2 percent from 1984 to 1989.[3]
However, the mortal blow to the company derived from Interco's response to a hostile takeover bid. In 1988, Steven and Mitchell Rales, of the Cardinal Acquisition Corporation, offered $2.5 billion for the company.[43] In response to the offer, Interco's board authorized $1.95 billion in additional debt to buyback stock.[16] Senior management hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to restructure the company, including a plan to sell 16 of Interco's 20 companies.[44][45] While this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover, the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years.[46] From 1989 to 1991, Interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions in an attempt to remain solvent.[47] While the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation, the full value of these assets was never realized by Interco, as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds.[48] The combination of selling the majority of its companies, while being saddled by over $2 billion in debt, created unsustainable negative cash flow, resulting in Inteco's bankruptcy in 1991.[46] Thus in spite of being a profitable subsidiary, International Hat was liquidated in 1989 in a fire sale to Paramount Cap Company.[3]
Successors[edit]
The factories in Dexter, Marble Hill, and Oran were re-opened in May 1989, after being sold in the liquidation to Paramount Cap Company.[3][17] The Dexter plant was shuttered in 2000 before being sold to Venture Products, Inc. and re-opened in 2001.[49] The factory in Oran was sold to Carr Textile Corporation, which was subsequently sold to Venture Products, Inc.[50] At present, the Oran hat plant is operational in the production of straw hats.
Products[edit]

International Hat produced a variety of products over eighty-three years of operations. However, it is most well known for its production of several different models of fiber pressed military sun helmets provided to the US armed services during World War II. From World War II to the Gulf War, the pressed fiber sun helmet is noted for the historic length of its military usage in the United States, outlasting the M1 steel helmet by approximately ten years.[52] This makes the pressed fiber sun helmet one of the longest used helmets in service by the United States military.[52] Throughout World War II, International Hat was one of two major government contracted manufacturers of the pressed fiber sun helmets for US military personnel.[53][52] Hawley Products Company was the other major government contractor.[53][54] Between Hawley Products Company and International Hat Company, over 100,000 sun helmets were produced for military use in the European and Pacific theaters.[51]
The United States Marine Corps used the International Hat sun helmet both as combat gear and as part of the Marine Corps training uniform.[53][55] The pith helmet, nicknamed the "elephant hat", was first issued to the 1st Marine Division for its 1941 deployment to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The pith helmet has been retained as the mark of the marksmanship range coach.[56]
Although the International Hat sun helmet was designed and introduced before the M1 steel helmet, the International Hat sun helmet continued to be used in the military for many decades, including the Korean War and Vietnam War.[53][52] By the Gulf War, only certain personnel in the US Navy had the pressed fiber sun helmet as serviceable gear.[53]
Military logistics records preserve the stock number, product type, military service date, and quantity produced for military use. Each service branch of the military kept separate quartermaster records until 1947. In particular, the US Army is known to have commissioned 38,423 International Hat helmets for World War II and its aftermath.[10]

Legal issues[edit]




Manufacturing code hearing (1934) Washington, D.C. with International Hat Company representatives seated at the bottom of left table. International Hat was an early participant in the establishment of industry standards, product certification, and claimant issues arising from patent infringement cases within the hat segment of the U.S. apparel industry.


International Hat has had several labor issues settled in the US legal system. The company also participated in ways to avoid legal issues. In 1934, Frank P. Pellegrino represented the company in Washington D.C. at the US Hat Manufacturing Code hearing, to update manufacturing and labor practices within the industry, as the industry attempted to mitigate the need for government regulation during the New Deal era. International Hat's labor issues were generally with the National Labor Relations Board and the issue of unionization. Over the decades, the employees of the company never unionized, although unsuccessful attempts at unionization were made in joining the United Hatters, Cap, and Millinery Workers International, an AFL-CIO affiliate of 20,000 hat workers.[25][57]
Unionization never proved popular with the employees or the culture of the company.[57] In 1976, the Oran factory voted to unionize with the Retail Clerks Union but the motion failed.[58] In 1985, the National Labor Relations Board ruled against International Hat Company for allegedly violating elements of the National Labor Relations Act.[57] The company was claimed to have infringed upon the right of Tex Barnes, a cutter at the International Hat factory in Piedmont, Missouri to organize a union.[57] Barnes led the efforts for certification in April 1980 and was also a member the union's negotiating committee.[57] However, as in previous instances, the union lost the election when put to an employee vote.[57] The union was formally decertified on March 4, 1982.[57] Barnes filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company nine months later.[57] Although the National Labor Relations Board ruled in Barnes' favor, the United States Court of Appeals Eighth Circuit vacated and remanded the earlier decision.[57]
Philanthropy[edit]
Main articles: Tilles Memorial City Park and Maria Pellegrino Park
International Hat engaged in various philanthropic activities. Most notably, was the establishment of two municipal parks under President and Chairman Pellegrino. Following the death of his business associate and the former president, Pellegrino donated land and money for the construction of a municipal park in Oran, the George Tilles Jr. Memorial Park.[32] In 1968, Pellegrino commissioned a new park in Marble Hill, MO.[59] Maria Pellegrino Park was dedicated in memory of Pellegrino's mother and opened to the public on June 2, 1972.[60] During the dedication ceremonies, the Mayor declared the event to be remembered as "Pellegrino Appreciation Day."[61] International Hat directly donated money to building the large pavilion at Pellegrino Park.[60]
Another philanthropic activity of the company was the donation of hats to certain American volunteer organizations. In 1981, International Hat donated 4,764 hats to the national convention of the Girls Scouts of America.[62] In 1989, the company produced 200 specially made women's spring hats for the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GWFC) convention delegates in Marble Hill.[63]
Legacy[edit]
In the subsequent decades of World War II, International Hat military fiber sun helmets, produced at the original factory in St. Louis, have become collector's items for military helmet and World War II collectors of American military uniform apparel. This is particularly true of the International Hat Marine helmets, which bear the USMC insignia on the front of the helmet.[53]
Facilities[edit]
Main article: International Hat Company warehouse




The International Hat Company warehouse, in the historic district of the Soulard neighborhood in St. Louis, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 20, 1980.[1]

International Hat had multiple domestic and international facilities. At the height of its expansion, International Hat operated seven domestic factories, several warehouses, several international buying offices, and a sales office in New York.[4] Among all its facilities, the International Hat Company warehouse in the Soulard neighborhood of St. Louis is of particular historic note. On October 20, 1980, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1] Built in 1904, by renowned architect Albert B. Groves, the building was originally a factory for the Brown Shoe Company.[1] In 1954, the factory was subsequently converted into a warehouse by the International Hat Company, which owned and operated the site until 1976.[1] The site has been recognized as a testament to Grove's architectural expertise in early 20th century industrial design.
In 1917, the original International Hat headquarters was located at 711 Lucas Avenue.[6] From 1917 to 1928, the factory manufactured straw harvest hats.[6] By the 1920s, the company was the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world from this facility.[6] In 1928, the company purchased 2528 Texas Avenue from Koken Barbers' Supply Company and sold the original factory at 711 Lucas to Koken as part of the deal.[6] The Texas location would continue manufacturing straw harvest hats, as well as all military sun helmets produced during and after World War II.[4] This five-story building included 87,000 square feet, or approximately two acres.[64][65] In 2016, this facility was purchased by two non-profit organizations, DeSales Community Development and St. Louis Makes to form a new joint private non-profit organization called Brick City Makes.[66][67] The Brick City Makes hub is noted as being the first non-profit organization in the United States to renovate an industrial building in order to provide rent space and development, as a business incubator, for entrepreneurial manufacturers.[65][66] The Brick City Makes business incubator, at the former International Hat factory, is the first model in the US to focus on business support services that grow the expertise and profitability of manufacturers and inventors until their organizations are large enough to exit the incubator and launch independently elsewhere.[66][68]
Six factories were located in Missouri and the seventh operated in Texas. The majority of warehouses were located with the factories onsite. From 1928 to the 1960s, the largest International Hat factory also served as the headquarters of the company, which was located in St. Louis, Missouri.[6] The other factories in Missouri were located in Chaffee, Dexter, Marble Hill, Piedmont, and Oran.[11][69][70] The Oran factory was constructed in 1946.[71] The factory was expanded in 1948 and 1968.[72] It eventually closed in 1984.[73] The Chaffee plant was closed in 1981 after opening in the summer of 1980 with 100 employees.[74][75][76] The Chaffee factory was operated by Florsheim Shoe Company, another subsidiary of Interco.[77] The Marble Hill factory was expanded in 1972.[78] The facility employed approximately 300 workers.[79] The Dexter facility was opened in 1959 and operated for 30 years under International Hat, eventually closing permanently in 1989.[3]

International Hat Company, formerly named the International Harvest Hat Company, was a St. Louis, Missouri-based manufacturer of commercial hats and military helmets.[9] The company was one of the largest hat manufacturers in the United States and, at one time, the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world.[6] It is best remembered for its design and mass production of tropical shaped, pressed fiber military sun helmets for soldiers of the United States Army, Marines, and Navy during and after World War II. Additionally, the American owned company was a major producer of harvest hats, straw hats, fiber sun hats, enameled dress hats, baseball caps, and earmuffs throughout most of the 20th century. However, it is the International Hat military sun helmets that have become the most notable collector's items.
Established in 1917 as a private corporation, the company began with a single product line of harvest straw hats.[4] By the late 1930s, the company had expanded into fiber pressed sun hats and leather harvest hats.[4] During World War II, International Hat developed and produced several models of military sun helmets, including a model with rudimentary ventilation.[10] After the war, the company became interested in plastic molding injection, moving increasingly away from pressed fiber. In the 1950s, General Fibre Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, changed its name to General Moulding Company to reflect these production changes in basic materials. By the 1960s, International Hat was mostly producing baseball caps, straw hats, earmuffs, plastic helmets, and plastic sun hats. During this era of expansion, the company had a proclivity for building its factories in small rural cities, often becoming the largest employer and economic backbone of those communities.[11][12] On several occasions, International Hat donated land or facility equipment for the creation of municipal parks located adjacent to one of its factories, namely for the purpose of benefiting employees, their families, and the local community.[13]
After sixty-one years of business, the company was sold in 1978 to Interco, Inc., where it continued operating as a subsidiary.[14][15] In 1988, Interco was the target of a hostile takeover bid. Consequently, International Hat was divested the following year to Paramount Cap Company, as part of a debt restructuring plan instituted by the parent company.[3] However, Interco subsequently went bankrupt in 1991, after selling 16 of its 20 subsidiaries.[16] Although International Hat was liquidated, several of its original factories are still in operation by other hat companies in Southeastern Missouri.[3][17] Additionally, one of International Hat's warehouses in the historic district of Soulard, Missouri has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1][18] International Hat operated the historical building from 1954 to 1976.[2] It is presently used as a senior and disabled living facility.[1]

History[edit]
First location and early company history[edit]




International Hat Company's second headquarters at 2528 Texas Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri.[9] The company's second factory, acquired in 1928 from Koken Barbers' Supply Company, produced all World War II era military helmets manufactured by the company.[6]


The company was founded by Isaac Apple on August 17, 1917 as International Harvest Hat Company.[4] The prominent St. Louis families of Apple and Tilles incorporated International Harvest Hat during the turbulence of World War I.[5] The Apple family had previously founded the Apple Hat Company, which was based in Fort Smith, Arkansas.[19][20] Among the co-founders of International Harvest Hat was George Tilles, Sr., whose sister Hannah, was married to Isaac Apple.[20] However, the elderly Tilles left operational management of the company to his brother-in-law Isaac Apple.[21] The other original minority shareholders at the time of incorporation included Alexander E. Rosenthal, Harry J. Talbot, and John C. Talbot.[22] Rosenthal, who had previously been at the Apple Hat Company, was appointed as the first general manager of International Harvest Hat.[23] However, in 1918, he was arrested in Galveston, Texas on charges of embezzlement for the unauthorized sale of nineteen bales of harvest straw hats.[23]
The original business model of the company was commercial hat production of harvest straw hats.[4] On the micro-economic level, St. Louis had become a center of hat manufacturing during the Second Industrial Revolution.[24] In 1900, 129 businesses in St. Louis were producing custom hats for women, with approximately 600 employees in the industry.[24] Within the decade, St. Louis was the fifth largest producer of fur felt hats.[24] International Harvest Hat proposed to do the same thing for straw harvest hats, by ramping up production capacity and challenging the manufacturing centers in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey.[24] The timing of market entry was favorable to the company's goals, as the organization was established at the peak decade of the commercial hat apparel market. In 1910, over 42 million hats were produced in the United States, an all-time record for domestic production.[25][26]
On the macroeconomic level, the company was founded at a time of ascendance for the United States. In 1916, the United States economic output, for the first time in history, was greater than that of the British Empire, establishing the United States as the world's largest economic superpower.[27] From World War I to the beginnings of the Great Depression, it was under these economic environmental conditions that the company originally produced a product line of harvest hats. Such hats of the period were a staple of farmers and field hands across the US.[21] By the 1920s, St. Louis replaced New England as the world's dominant manufacturing center for harvest hats.[28] International Harvest Hat was a major contributor to this regional shift in industrialization. By the early 1920s, the company had become the largest industrial producer of harvest hats in the world.[6] In 1928, the company produced over 36,000 per day and approximately 9.4 million harvest hats per year.[29]
With the rise of the automobile, fashions began to change by the 1930s. In 1931, the company expanded into men's straw dress hats to adopt to evolving fashion trends.[4] In 1938, the company name was changed to International Hat Company to better reflect the growing diversity of its product lines.[4] In 1940, the product lines were further expanded when International Hat began production of military sun helmets for the US military.[10] The war effort led to a realignment of production geared towards military apparel.[10]
With the death of Isaac Apple in 1935, his nephew George Tilles, Jr., was promoted to president of the company. Tilles served as president until his retirement in 1956 and as chairman of the board until his death in 1958.[21] Through the depression of the 1930s, Tilles managed the expansion of the company's facilities from a modest 5,000 square foot factory to a modernized 150,000 square foot factory.[30] Under Tilles, International Hat saw increasing growth during World War II. By 1942, the company's operations had grown to include its main factory facility, several warehouses, two buying offices in Mexico, and a sales office in New York City.[4] The company was also importing goods from a dozen countries.[4]
New markets and expansion[edit]




Frank Pellegrino, President and Chairman (1956–1975), built five factories, created two municipal parks, and expanded the post-WWII product lines of the company into plastic helmets and baseball caps.


Following World War II, the International Hat Company entered an expansionist period with new markets, facilities, product lines, and basic materials. Frank Pellegrino served as vice president under George Tilles, Jr., becoming president of International Hat from 1956 until 1971 and chairman until his death in 1975.[21][31] Tilles placed Pellegrino in charge of opening a second factory.[13] In 1946, a new facility was constructed and operational in Oran, Missouri, becoming the largest employer in the city.[32]
Pellegrino managed International Hat into a company of over 1,500 employees with six domestic factories. During the 1950s and 1960s, International Hat expanded from its factory in St. Louis to include five other factories located in Southeast Missouri. A number of these locations became one factory towns. Additionally, a sixth plant was opened in Texas.[15] Reflecting this period of expansion into foreign markets, the company headquarters was also moved from St. Louis to New York City.[15] During this era, the company continued producing military helmets and straw hats. However, the company expanded its products lines into plastic hats and helmets, as an early entrant into this new consumer market. As press fiber waned, plastic allowed for more automated production and lighter materials, without the ventilation issues of pressed fiber trapping heat. Throughout the 1960s, the company began shifting into the baseball cap market.[11] In 1967, International Hat began its first consumer focused advertising campaign, to expand its reach in the retail sector, with advertising agency Stemmler, Bartram, Fisher & Payne.[33] In the 1970s, the company expanded into the winter apparel market, selling earmuffs manufactured by VIP Industries.[34]
Under Pellegrino, this would later prove as the height of the expansion of the company in terms of size, productivity, and financial success.[35]
Sale, decline, and liquidation[edit]
Jean S. Goodson became president of International Hat in 1971, following Pellegrino's retirement.[31] That same year Pellegrino was elected chairman of the board, which he retained until his death in 1975. Goodson began cutting down on the company's imports from the New York office and limiting the production of dress hats to focus on other product lines.[35] Unsatisfied with his performance, the board of directors requested Frank G. Pellegrino, Sr., minority shareholder and son of Frank P. Pellegrino, represent International Hat in pursuing the sale of the company.[36] At that time, Pellegrino was president of General Moulding Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, in the production of plastic molds for the parent company's hats and helmets. In 1977, Pellegrino initiated the sale of the company to Interco, Incorporated, a conglomerate of furniture, apparel, and shoe companies (now known as Furniture Brands International). On March 31, 1978, a special meeting of the stockholders was held to consider the terms by which Interco offered International Hat.[35] The stockholders accepted the deal and International Hat was officially sold to Interco by the end of the day.[15] The original shareholders were bought out and Jean Goodson continued on as a member of the Interco board of directors from 1978 until his retirement in 1985.[15][37] The company was purchased for 166,667 shares of Interco common stock.[38]
As a subsidiary, International Hat continued operation until June 14, 1989.[39][40] The domestic hat apparel market had undergone a steady increase in global competition since the 1970s during a time of record sales of hats in the US.[41] The company was pressured by changing market conditions, particularly the US loss of market share from cheaper imports coming in from Brazil, Spain, Taiwan, and China.[42] In 1984, China alone exported 2.98 million dozens of hats to the United States.[3] By 1989, 6.5 million dozens of hats were being imported from China, representing 31 percent of the total market share of the hat apparel industry.[3] Demand for hats actually increased during this period, whereas the US market share of hats decreased from 27.1 percent to 22.2 percent from 1984 to 1989.[3]
However, the mortal blow to the company derived from Interco's response to a hostile takeover bid. In 1988, Steven and Mitchell Rales, of the Cardinal Acquisition Corporation, offered $2.5 billion for the company.[43] In response to the offer, Interco's board authorized $1.95 billion in additional debt to buyback stock.[16] Senior management hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to restructure the company, including a plan to sell 16 of Interco's 20 companies.[44][45] While this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover, the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years.[46] From 1989 to 1991, Interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions in an attempt to remain solvent.[47] While the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation, the full value of these assets was never realized by Interco, as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds.[48] The combination of selling the majority of its companies, while being saddled by over $2 billion in debt, created unsustainable negative cash flow, resulting in Inteco's bankruptcy in 1991.[46] Thus in spite of being a profitable subsidiary, International Hat was liquidated in 1989 in a fire sale to Paramount Cap Company.[3]
Successors[edit]
The factories in Dexter, Marble Hill, and Oran were re-opened in May 1989, after being sold in the liquidation to Paramount Cap Company.[3][17] The Dexter plant was shuttered in 2000 before being sold to Venture Products, Inc. and re-opened in 2001.[49] The factory in Oran was sold to Carr Textile Corporation, which was subsequently sold to Venture Products, Inc.[50] At present, the Oran hat plant is operational in the production of straw hats.
Products[edit]

International Hat produced a variety of products over eighty-three years of operations. However, it is most well known for its production of several different models of fiber pressed military sun helmets provided to the US armed services during World War II. From World War II to the Gulf War, the pressed fiber sun helmet is noted for the historic length of its military usage in the United States, outlasting the M1 steel helmet by approximately ten years.[52] This makes the pressed fiber sun helmet one of the longest used helmets in service by the United States military.[52] Throughout World War II, International Hat was one of two major government contracted manufacturers of the pressed fiber sun helmets for US military personnel.[53][52] Hawley Products Company was the other major government contractor.[53][54] Between Hawley Products Company and International Hat Company, over 100,000 sun helmets were produced for military use in the European and Pacific theaters.[51]
The United States Marine Corps used the International Hat sun helmet both as combat gear and as part of the Marine Corps training uniform.[53][55] The pith helmet, nicknamed the "elephant hat", was first issued to the 1st Marine Division for its 1941 deployment to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The pith helmet has been retained as the mark of the marksmanship range coach.[56]
Although the International Hat sun helmet was designed and introduced before the M1 steel helmet, the International Hat sun helmet continued to be used in the military for many decades, including the Korean War and Vietnam War.[53][52] By the Gulf War, only certain personnel in the US Navy had the pressed fiber sun helmet as serviceable gear.[53]
Military logistics records preserve the stock number, product type, military service date, and quantity produced for military use. Each service branch of the military kept separate quartermaster records until 1947. In particular, the US Army is known to have commissioned 38,423 International Hat helmets for World War II and its aftermath.[10]

Legal issues[edit]




Manufacturing code hearing (1934) Washington, D.C. with International Hat Company representatives seated at the bottom of left table. International Hat was an early participant in the establishment of industry standards, product certification, and claimant issues arising from patent infringement cases within the hat segment of the U.S. apparel industry.


International Hat has had several labor issues settled in the US legal system. The company also participated in ways to avoid legal issues. In 1934, Frank P. Pellegrino represented the company in Washington D.C. at the US Hat Manufacturing Code hearing, to update manufacturing and labor practices within the industry, as the industry attempted to mitigate the need for government regulation during the New Deal era. International Hat's labor issues were generally with the National Labor Relations Board and the issue of unionization. Over the decades, the employees of the company never unionized, although unsuccessful attempts at unionization were made in joining the United Hatters, Cap, and Millinery Workers International, an AFL-CIO affiliate of 20,000 hat workers.[25][57]
Unionization never proved popular with the employees or the culture of the company.[57] In 1976, the Oran factory voted to unionize with the Retail Clerks Union but the motion failed.[58] In 1985, the National Labor Relations Board ruled against International Hat Company for allegedly violating elements of the National Labor Relations Act.[57] The company was claimed to have infringed upon the right of Tex Barnes, a cutter at the International Hat factory in Piedmont, Missouri to organize a union.[57] Barnes led the efforts for certification in April 1980 and was also a member the union's negotiating committee.[57] However, as in previous instances, the union lost the election when put to an employee vote.[57] The union was formally decertified on March 4, 1982.[57] Barnes filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company nine months later.[57] Although the National Labor Relations Board ruled in Barnes' favor, the United States Court of Appeals Eighth Circuit vacated and remanded the earlier decision.[57]
Philanthropy[edit]
Main articles: Tilles Memorial City Park and Maria Pellegrino Park
International Hat engaged in various philanthropic activities. Most notably, was the establishment of two municipal parks under President and Chairman Pellegrino. Following the death of his business associate and the former president, Pellegrino donated land and money for the construction of a municipal park in Oran, the George Tilles Jr. Memorial Park.[32] In 1968, Pellegrino commissioned a new park in Marble Hill, MO.[59] Maria Pellegrino Park was dedicated in memory of Pellegrino's mother and opened to the public on June 2, 1972.[60] During the dedication ceremonies, the Mayor declared the event to be remembered as "Pellegrino Appreciation Day."[61] International Hat directly donated money to building the large pavilion at Pellegrino Park.[60]
Another philanthropic activity of the company was the donation of hats to certain American volunteer organizations. In 1981, International Hat donated 4,764 hats to the national convention of the Girls Scouts of America.[62] In 1989, the company produced 200 specially made women's spring hats for the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GWFC) convention delegates in Marble Hill.[63]
Legacy[edit]
In the subsequent decades of World War II, International Hat military fiber sun helmets, produced at the original factory in St. Louis, have become collector's items for military helmet and World War II collectors of American military uniform apparel. This is particularly true of the International Hat Marine helmets, which bear the USMC insignia on the front of the helmet.[53]
Facilities[edit]
Main article: International Hat Company warehouse




The International Hat Company warehouse, in the historic district of the Soulard neighborhood in St. Louis, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 20, 1980.[1]

International Hat had multiple domestic and international facilities. At the height of its expansion, International Hat operated seven domestic factories, several warehouses, several international buying offices, and a sales office in New York.[4] Among all its facilities, the International Hat Company warehouse in the Soulard neighborhood of St. Louis is of particular historic note. On October 20, 1980, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1] Built in 1904, by renowned architect Albert B. Groves, the building was originally a factory for the Brown Shoe Company.[1] In 1954, the factory was subsequently converted into a warehouse by the International Hat Company, which owned and operated the site until 1976.[1] The site has been recognized as a testament to Grove's architectural expertise in early 20th century industrial design.
In 1917, the original International Hat headquarters was located at 711 Lucas Avenue.[6] From 1917 to 1928, the factory manufactured straw harvest hats.[6] By the 1920s, the company was the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world from this facility.[6] In 1928, the company purchased 2528 Texas Avenue from Koken Barbers' Supply Company and sold the original factory at 711 Lucas to Koken as part of the deal.[6] The Texas location would continue manufacturing straw harvest hats, as well as all military sun helmets produced during and after World War II.[4] This five-story building included 87,000 square feet, or approximately two acres.[64][65] In 2016, this facility was purchased by two non-profit organizations, DeSales Community Development and St. Louis Makes to form a new joint private non-profit organization called Brick City Makes.[66][67] The Brick City Makes hub is noted as being the first non-profit organization in the United States to renovate an industrial building in order to provide rent space and development, as a business incubator, for entrepreneurial manufacturers.[65][66] The Brick City Makes business incubator, at the former International Hat factory, is the first model in the US to focus on business support services that grow the expertise and profitability of manufacturers and inventors until their organizations are large enough to exit the incubator and launch independently elsewhere.[66][68]
Six factories were located in Missouri and the seventh operated in Texas. The majority of warehouses were located with the factories onsite. From 1928 to the 1960s, the largest International Hat factory also served as the headquarters of the company, which was located in St. Louis, Missouri.[6] The other factories in Missouri were located in Chaffee, Dexter, Marble Hill, Piedmont, and Oran.[11][69][70] The Oran factory was constructed in 1946.[71] The factory was expanded in 1948 and 1968.[72] It eventually closed in 1984.[73] The Chaffee plant was closed in 1981 after opening in the summer of 1980 with 100 employees.[74][75][76] The Chaffee factory was operated by Florsheim Shoe Company, another subsidiary of Interco.[77] The Marble Hill factory was expanded in 1972.[78] The facility employed approximately 300 workers.[79] The Dexter facility was opened in 1959 and operated for 30 years under International Hat, eventually closing permanently in 1989.[3]

International Hat Company, formerly named the International Harvest Hat Company, was a St. Louis, Missouri-based manufacturer of commercial hats and military helmets.[9] The company was one of the largest hat manufacturers in the United States and, at one time, the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world.[6] It is best remembered for its design and mass production of tropical shaped, pressed fiber military sun helmets for soldiers of the United States Army, Marines, and Navy during and after World War II. Additionally, the American owned company was a major producer of harvest hats, straw hats, fiber sun hats, enameled dress hats, baseball caps, and earmuffs throughout most of the 20th century. However, it is the International Hat military sun helmets that have become the most notable collector's items.
Established in 1917 as a private corporation, the company began with a single product line of harvest straw hats.[4] By the late 1930s, the company had expanded into fiber pressed sun hats and leather harvest hats.[4] During World War II, International Hat developed and produced several models of military sun helmets, including a model with rudimentary ventilation.[10] After the war, the company became interested in plastic molding injection, moving increasingly away from pressed fiber. In the 1950s, General Fibre Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, changed its name to General Moulding Company to reflect these production changes in basic materials. By the 1960s, International Hat was mostly producing baseball caps, straw hats, earmuffs, plastic helmets, and plastic sun hats. During this era of expansion, the company had a proclivity for building its factories in small rural cities, often becoming the largest employer and economic backbone of those communities.[11][12] On several occasions, International Hat donated land or facility equipment for the creation of municipal parks located adjacent to one of its factories, namely for the purpose of benefiting employees, their families, and the local community.[13]
After sixty-one years of business, the company was sold in 1978 to Interco, Inc., where it continued operating as a subsidiary.[14][15] In 1988, Interco was the target of a hostile takeover bid. Consequently, International Hat was divested the following year to Paramount Cap Company, as part of a debt restructuring plan instituted by the parent company.[3] However, Interco subsequently went bankrupt in 1991, after selling 16 of its 20 subsidiaries.[16] Although International Hat was liquidated, several of its original factories are still in operation by other hat companies in Southeastern Missouri.[3][17] Additionally, one of International Hat's warehouses in the historic district of Soulard, Missouri has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1][18] International Hat operated the historical building from 1954 to 1976.[2] It is presently used as a senior and disabled living facility.[1]

History[edit]
First location and early company history[edit]




International Hat Company's second headquarters at 2528 Texas Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri.[9] The company's second factory, acquired in 1928 from Koken Barbers' Supply Company, produced all World War II era military helmets manufactured by the company.[6]


The company was founded by Isaac Apple on August 17, 1917 as International Harvest Hat Company.[4] The prominent St. Louis families of Apple and Tilles incorporated International Harvest Hat during the turbulence of World War I.[5] The Apple family had previously founded the Apple Hat Company, which was based in Fort Smith, Arkansas.[19][20] Among the co-founders of International Harvest Hat was George Tilles, Sr., whose sister Hannah, was married to Isaac Apple.[20] However, the elderly Tilles left operational management of the company to his brother-in-law Isaac Apple.[21] The other original minority shareholders at the time of incorporation included Alexander E. Rosenthal, Harry J. Talbot, and John C. Talbot.[22] Rosenthal, who had previously been at the Apple Hat Company, was appointed as the first general manager of International Harvest Hat.[23] However, in 1918, he was arrested in Galveston, Texas on charges of embezzlement for the unauthorized sale of nineteen bales of harvest straw hats.[23]
The original business model of the company was commercial hat production of harvest straw hats.[4] On the micro-economic level, St. Louis had become a center of hat manufacturing during the Second Industrial Revolution.[24] In 1900, 129 businesses in St. Louis were producing custom hats for women, with approximately 600 employees in the industry.[24] Within the decade, St. Louis was the fifth largest producer of fur felt hats.[24] International Harvest Hat proposed to do the same thing for straw harvest hats, by ramping up production capacity and challenging the manufacturing centers in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey.[24] The timing of market entry was favorable to the company's goals, as the organization was established at the peak decade of the commercial hat apparel market. In 1910, over 42 million hats were produced in the United States, an all-time record for domestic production.[25][26]
On the macroeconomic level, the company was founded at a time of ascendance for the United States. In 1916, the United States economic output, for the first time in history, was greater than that of the British Empire, establishing the United States as the world's largest economic superpower.[27] From World War I to the beginnings of the Great Depression, it was under these economic environmental conditions that the company originally produced a product line of harvest hats. Such hats of the period were a staple of farmers and field hands across the US.[21] By the 1920s, St. Louis replaced New England as the world's dominant manufacturing center for harvest hats.[28] International Harvest Hat was a major contributor to this regional shift in industrialization. By the early 1920s, the company had become the largest industrial producer of harvest hats in the world.[6] In 1928, the company produced over 36,000 per day and approximately 9.4 million harvest hats per year.[29]
With the rise of the automobile, fashions began to change by the 1930s. In 1931, the company expanded into men's straw dress hats to adopt to evolving fashion trends.[4] In 1938, the company name was changed to International Hat Company to better reflect the growing diversity of its product lines.[4] In 1940, the product lines were further expanded when International Hat began production of military sun helmets for the US military.[10] The war effort led to a realignment of production geared towards military apparel.[10]
With the death of Isaac Apple in 1935, his nephew George Tilles, Jr., was promoted to president of the company. Tilles served as president until his retirement in 1956 and as chairman of the board until his death in 1958.[21] Through the depression of the 1930s, Tilles managed the expansion of the company's facilities from a modest 5,000 square foot factory to a modernized 150,000 square foot factory.[30] Under Tilles, International Hat saw increasing growth during World War II. By 1942, the company's operations had grown to include its main factory facility, several warehouses, two buying offices in Mexico, and a sales office in New York City.[4] The company was also importing goods from a dozen countries.[4]
New markets and expansion[edit]




Frank Pellegrino, President and Chairman (1956–1975), built five factories, created two municipal parks, and expanded the post-WWII product lines of the company into plastic helmets and baseball caps.


Following World War II, the International Hat Company entered an expansionist period with new markets, facilities, product lines, and basic materials. Frank Pellegrino served as vice president under George Tilles, Jr., becoming president of International Hat from 1956 until 1971 and chairman until his death in 1975.[21][31] Tilles placed Pellegrino in charge of opening a second factory.[13] In 1946, a new facility was constructed and operational in Oran, Missouri, becoming the largest employer in the city.[32]
Pellegrino managed International Hat into a company of over 1,500 employees with six domestic factories. During the 1950s and 1960s, International Hat expanded from its factory in St. Louis to include five other factories located in Southeast Missouri. A number of these locations became one factory towns. Additionally, a sixth plant was opened in Texas.[15] Reflecting this period of expansion into foreign markets, the company headquarters was also moved from St. Louis to New York City.[15] During this era, the company continued producing military helmets and straw hats. However, the company expanded its products lines into plastic hats and helmets, as an early entrant into this new consumer market. As press fiber waned, plastic allowed for more automated production and lighter materials, without the ventilation issues of pressed fiber trapping heat. Throughout the 1960s, the company began shifting into the baseball cap market.[11] In 1967, International Hat began its first consumer focused advertising campaign, to expand its reach in the retail sector, with advertising agency Stemmler, Bartram, Fisher & Payne.[33] In the 1970s, the company expanded into the winter apparel market, selling earmuffs manufactured by VIP Industries.[34]
Under Pellegrino, this would later prove as the height of the expansion of the company in terms of size, productivity, and financial success.[35]
Sale, decline, and liquidation[edit]
Jean S. Goodson became president of International Hat in 1971, following Pellegrino's retirement.[31] That same year Pellegrino was elected chairman of the board, which he retained until his death in 1975. Goodson began cutting down on the company's imports from the New York office and limiting the production of dress hats to focus on other product lines.[35] Unsatisfied with his performance, the board of directors requested Frank G. Pellegrino, Sr., minority shareholder and son of Frank P. Pellegrino, represent International Hat in pursuing the sale of the company.[36] At that time, Pellegrino was president of General Moulding Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, in the production of plastic molds for the parent company's hats and helmets. In 1977, Pellegrino initiated the sale of the company to Interco, Incorporated, a conglomerate of furniture, apparel, and shoe companies (now known as Furniture Brands International). On March 31, 1978, a special meeting of the stockholders was held to consider the terms by which Interco offered International Hat.[35] The stockholders accepted the deal and International Hat was officially sold to Interco by the end of the day.[15] The original shareholders were bought out and Jean Goodson continued on as a member of the Interco board of directors from 1978 until his retirement in 1985.[15][37] The company was purchased for 166,667 shares of Interco common stock.[38]
As a subsidiary, International Hat continued operation until June 14, 1989.[39][40] The domestic hat apparel market had undergone a steady increase in global competition since the 1970s during a time of record sales of hats in the US.[41] The company was pressured by changing market conditions, particularly the US loss of market share from cheaper imports coming in from Brazil, Spain, Taiwan, and China.[42] In 1984, China alone exported 2.98 million dozens of hats to the United States.[3] By 1989, 6.5 million dozens of hats were being imported from China, representing 31 percent of the total market share of the hat apparel industry.[3] Demand for hats actually increased during this period, whereas the US market share of hats decreased from 27.1 percent to 22.2 percent from 1984 to 1989.[3]
However, the mortal blow to the company derived from Interco's response to a hostile takeover bid. In 1988, Steven and Mitchell Rales, of the Cardinal Acquisition Corporation, offered $2.5 billion for the company.[43] In response to the offer, Interco's board authorized $1.95 billion in additional debt to buyback stock.[16] Senior management hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to restructure the company, including a plan to sell 16 of Interco's 20 companies.[44][45] While this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover, the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years.[46] From 1989 to 1991, Interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions in an attempt to remain solvent.[47] While the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation, the full value of these assets was never realized by Interco, as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds.[48] The combination of selling the majority of its companies, while being saddled by over $2 billion in debt, created unsustainable negative cash flow, resulting in Inteco's bankruptcy in 1991.[46] Thus in spite of being a profitable subsidiary, International Hat was liquidated in 1989 in a fire sale to Paramount Cap Company.[3]
Successors[edit]
The factories in Dexter, Marble Hill, and Oran were re-opened in May 1989, after being sold in the liquidation to Paramount Cap Company.[3][17] The Dexter plant was shuttered in 2000 before being sold to Venture Products, Inc. and re-opened in 2001.[49] The factory in Oran was sold to Carr Textile Corporation, which was subsequently sold to Venture Products, Inc.[50] At present, the Oran hat plant is operational in the production of straw hats.

International Hat produced a variety of products over eighty-three years of operations. However, it is most well known for its production of several different models of fiber pressed military sun helmets provided to the US armed services during World War II. From World War II to the Gulf War, the pressed fiber sun helmet is noted for the historic length of its military usage in the United States, outlasting the M1 steel helmet by approximately ten years.[52] This makes the pressed fiber sun helmet one of the longest used helmets in service by the United States military.[52] Throughout World War II, International Hat was one of two major government contracted manufacturers of the pressed fiber sun helmets for US military personnel.[53][52] Hawley Products Company was the other major government contractor.[53][54] Between Hawley Products Company and International Hat Company, over 100,000 sun helmets were produced for military use in the European and Pacific theaters.[51]
The United States Marine Corps used the International Hat sun helmet both as combat gear and as part of the Marine Corps training uniform.[53][55] The pith helmet, nicknamed the "elephant hat", was first issued to the 1st Marine Division for its 1941 deployment to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The pith helmet has been retained as the mark of the marksmanship range coach.[56]
Although the International Hat sun helmet was designed and introduced before the M1 steel helmet, the International Hat sun helmet continued to be used in the military for many decades, including the Korean War and Vietnam War.[53][52] By the Gulf War, only certain personnel in the US Navy had the pressed fiber sun helmet as serviceable gear.[53]
Military logistics records preserve the stock number, product type, military service date, and quantity produced for military use. Each service branch of the military kept separate quartermaster records until 1947. In particular, the US Army is known to have commissioned 38,423 International Hat helmets for World War II and its aftermath.[10]

Legal issues[edit]




Manufacturing code hearing (1934) Washington, D.C. with International Hat Company representatives seated at the bottom of left table. International Hat was an early participant in the establishment of industry standards, product certification, and claimant issues arising from patent infringement cases within the hat segment of the U.S. apparel industry.


International Hat has had several labor issues settled in the US legal system. The company also participated in ways to avoid legal issues. In 1934, Frank P. Pellegrino represented the company in Washington D.C. at the US Hat Manufacturing Code hearing, to update manufacturing and labor practices within the industry, as the industry attempted to mitigate the need for government regulation during the New Deal era. International Hat's labor issues were generally with the National Labor Relations Board and the issue of unionization. Over the decades, the employees of the company never unionized, although unsuccessful attempts at unionization were made in joining the United Hatters, Cap, and Millinery Workers International, an AFL-CIO affiliate of 20,000 hat workers.[25][57]
Unionization never proved popular with the employees or the culture of the company.[57] In 1976, the Oran factory voted to unionize with the Retail Clerks Union but the motion failed.[58] In 1985, the National Labor Relations Board ruled against International Hat Company for allegedly violating elements of the National Labor Relations Act.[57] The company was claimed to have infringed upon the right of Tex Barnes, a cutter at the International Hat factory in Piedmont, Missouri to organize a union.[57] Barnes led the efforts for certification in April 1980 and was also a member the union's negotiating committee.[57] However, as in previous instances, the union lost the election when put to an employee vote.[57] The union was formally decertified on March 4, 1982.[57] Barnes filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company nine months later.[57] Although the National Labor Relations Board ruled in Barnes' favor, the United States Court of Appeals Eighth Circuit vacated and remanded the earlier decision.[57]
Philanthropy[edit]
Main articles: Tilles Memorial City Park and Maria Pellegrino Park
International Hat engaged in various philanthropic activities. Most notably, was the establishment of two municipal parks under President and Chairman Pellegrino. Following the death of his business associate and the former president, Pellegrino donated land and money for the construction of a municipal park in Oran, the George Tilles Jr. Memorial Park.[32] In 1968, Pellegrino commissioned a new park in Marble Hill, MO.[59] Maria Pellegrino Park was dedicated in memory of Pellegrino's mother and opened to the public on June 2, 1972.[60] During the dedication ceremonies, the Mayor declared the event to be remembered as "Pellegrino Appreciation Day."[61] International Hat directly donated money to building the large pavilion at Pellegrino Park.[60]
Another philanthropic activity of the company was the donation of hats to certain American volunteer organizations. In 1981, International Hat donated 4,764 hats to the national convention of the Girls Scouts of America.[62] In 1989, the company produced 200 specially made women's spring hats for the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GWFC) convention delegates in Marble Hill.[63]
Legacy[edit]
In the subsequent decades of World War II, International Hat military fiber sun helmets, produced at the original factory in St. Louis, have become collector's items for military helmet and World War II collectors of American military uniform apparel. This is particularly true of the International Hat Marine helmets, which bear the USMC insignia on the front of the helmet.[53]
Facilities[edit]
Main article: International Hat Company warehouse




The International Hat Company warehouse, in the historic district of the Soulard neighborhood in St. Louis, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 20, 1980.[1]

International Hat had multiple domestic and international facilities. At the height of its expansion, International Hat operated seven domestic factories, several warehouses, several international buying offices, and a sales office in New York.[4] Among all its facilities, the International Hat Company warehouse in the Soulard neighborhood of St. Louis is of particular historic note. On October 20, 1980, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1] Built in 1904, by renowned architect Albert B. Groves, the building was originally a factory for the Brown Shoe Company.[1] In 1954, the factory was subsequently converted into a warehouse by the International Hat Company, which owned and operated the site until 1976.[1] The site has been recognized as a testament to Grove's architectural expertise in early 20th century industrial design.
In 1917, the original International Hat headquarters was located at 711 Lucas Avenue.[6] From 1917 to 1928, the factory manufactured straw harvest hats.[6] By the 1920s, the company was the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world from this facility.[6] In 1928, the company purchased 2528 Texas Avenue from Koken Barbers' Supply Company and sold the original factory at 711 Lucas to Koken as part of the deal.[6] The Texas location would continue manufacturing straw harvest hats, as well as all military sun helmets produced during and after World War II.[4] This five-story building included 87,000 square feet, or approximately two acres.[64][65] In 2016, this facility was purchased by two non-profit organizations, DeSales Community Development and St. Louis Makes to form a new joint private non-profit organization called Brick City Makes.[66][67] The Brick City Makes hub is noted as being the first non-profit organization in the United States to renovate an industrial building in order to provide rent space and development, as a business incubator, for entrepreneurial manufacturers.[65][66] The Brick City Makes business incubator, at the former International Hat factory, is the first model in the US to focus on business support services that grow the expertise and profitability of manufacturers and inventors until their organizations are large enough to exit the incubator and launch independently elsewhere.[66][68]
Six factories were located in Missouri and the seventh operated in Texas. The majority of warehouses were located with the factories onsite. From 1928 to the 1960s, the largest International Hat factory also served as the headquarters of the company, which was located in St. Louis, Missouri.[6] The other factories in Missouri were located in Chaffee, Dexter, Marble Hill, Piedmont, and Oran.[11][69][70] The Oran factory was constructed in 1946.[71] The factory was expanded in 1948 and 1968.[72] It eventually closed in 1984.[73] The Chaffee plant was closed in 1981 after opening in the summer of 1980 with 100 employees.[74][75][76] The Chaffee factory was operated by Florsheim Shoe Company, another subsidiary of Interco.[77] The Marble Hill factory was expanded in 1972.[78] The facility employed approximately 300 workers.[79] The Dexter facility was opened in 1959 and operated for 30 years under International Hat, eventually closing permanently in 1989.[3]

Occupation


Former President of General Fibre Company
Inventor




Frank G. Pellegrino (1923 – 2008) was an American engineer, inventor, and industrialist. He served as president of the General Fibre Company. During his tenure, General Fibre became the largest manufacturer of duck decoy models in the United States, producing over a million per year in the 1950s.[1][2] Pellegrino also negotiated the sale of the International Hat Company to Interco, Inc.[3] Additionally, he created a variety of inventions related to the plastic molding industry. Most notably, Pellegrino invented automated assembly line machines in the formation of plastic objects.[4] These machines were used by General Fibre in the production of a variety of plastic models, duck decoys, and Michelob paraphernalia throughout the 1960s to 1980s.

Pellegrino was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He was an electrical engineering graduate of Iowa State University.[5] He was the son of Ida Kropp and Frank Pellegrino, the philanthropist and president of the International Hat Company.[6][7] He served as an American naval officer, in the Pacific theater, during World War II.[5] After World War II, Pellegrino was stationed in Japan as part of the US occupation and rebuilding effort.[5] In 1948, he returned to St. Louis and married into the high society, old money Henry family; marrying Virginia Anne Henry, daughter of Harry W. Henry, president of the Graham Paper Company.[8] That same year, Pellegrino was hired as vice president of General Fibre by President George Tilles, Jr.
In the mid-1950s, Pellegrino became president of General Fiber, following the retirement of Lewis Tilles Apple. The company had manufactured the original M1 fiber helmet liner in 1941 before moving into the production of fiber components for the military pressed fiber sun helmets used by American soldiers during World War II. After the war ended, the company required a production transition back to civilian orders. In 1946, General Fibre switched into the duck, goose, and swan decoy model market.[2] The models were used by hunters to attract prey.[2] During his management of the company, General Fiber reached its peak production of these models in the late 1950s and early 1960s. However, it was during this time that Pellegrino began shifting the company's business model out of the production of wood fiber pulp products into the emerging plastics and plastic molding industry.[1]
In the early 1960s, he designed and engineered new automated machines in the manufacturing of plastic goods. These included plastic models, construction helmets, and various products for the Anheuser-Busch company.
Pellegrino died in 2008.[5] He is buried in Sunset Memorial Park in St. Louis.[5]

Most notably, he established and funded municipal parks in Southeastern Missouri. His donations resulted in the founding of both George Tilles, Jr. Park and Maria Pellegrino Park.[4][5]Contents1 Early life2 Career3 Philanthropy4 See also5 References6 Bibliography7 External linksEarly lifePellegrino was the third of eight children and the only child not born in St. Louis. His father and mother emigrated from Italy in 1891 from Cerisano in Calabria, Italy. His father, Ferdinando Pellegrino, was a soldier in the Royal Italian Army in the late 19th century. He received American citizenship in 1896 after renouncing fealty to King Umberto I of Italy. With the death of Ferdinando's father in 1900, the family returned to Italy to sell the Cerisano farm. At this time, Italy was in the midst of a depression. While waiting the sale of the property, Pellegrino was born in 1901. It took several years to sell the property before the family permanently returned to the United States.As a teenager, Pellegrino began working for the International Hat Company in 1920, as a hat rack assembly lineman.[2] Several years later, his sister Sarah and Josephine would join him as seamstresses for the company.[6] At the age of 19, he married Ida Kropp, a fellow employee and German immigrant that worked as a seamstress at the plant.CareerMain article: International Hat CompanyBy the 1930s, Pellegrino served as Vice President of International Hat under George Tilles, Jr., the nephew of horse racing magnate Cap Tilles.[2][7] During World War II, Pellegrino became Chairman and CEO, serving until his death in 1975. He was a driving force for the production of military pith helmets for the United States Army, Navy, and Marines during World War II. Under his management, the company expanded to incorporate factories, warehouses, and sales offices throughout Missouri, Texas, New York, and Mexico.[8]PhilanthropyIn 1962, Pellegrino donated land and money to establish the first municipal park in the history of Oran, Missouri.[4] The park was dedicated as the George Tilles, Jr. Park in honor of Pellegrino's business associate and close friend.[4] The site of Oran was chosen due to the International Hat factory Tilles and Pellegrino built there together. As a condition for founding the park, Pellegrino petitioned the city that future funding of the new recreational facilities and park upkeep be managed through municipal taxation. The measure was placed on the voting ballot and passed with 93 percent of voters approving.[4] In 1969, Pellegrino donated land to Marble Hill, Missouri to form a new municipal park.[5][9] Maria Pellegrino Park was named in honor of his mother.[10] The site was officially dedicated by the Director of Missouri State Parks Joseph Jaegar, Marble Hill Mayor Leon Sander, and Lutesville Mayor Orvile Liley.[9][11] At the park dedication ceremony, the local officials formally declared the event as "Pellegrino Appreciation Day".[9][12] In 1972, the Missouri State House of Representatives passed a special motion to honor Pellegrino's lifetime of philanthropy towards improving the state.[9] On behalf of the State House, a special award was also presented to him.[9]See alsoBiography portalMaria Pellegrino ParkTilles Memorial City ParkInternational Hat CompanyList of People from St. LouisList of Italian-American Business PeopleReferences^ "Frank P.

Meet Our Family


Frank Pellegrino Jr. – Rao's Restaurant Group Author: Rao's On the Grill
 Being a restaurateur, let alone a successful one, has never been easy, even when you've got a legendary restaurant such as Rao's in New York in your arsenal. Frank Pellegrino, Jr., co-owner of the original Rao's in Harlem, Rao's at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and Rao's in Hollywood, however knows that a successful restaurant is made by making guests feel like they're part of the family.
 "Frankie" as he is known to Rao's regulars, grew up helping his father and family at the restaurant – waiting tables, cooking, managing the restaurant – basically learning the family business, even though his father, Frank Sr. attempted to talk him out of it.
 The fourth generation owner of Rao's, Pellegrino attended Connecticut State University on a wrestling scholarship; where he studied graphic design and eventually went on to open his own advertising agency in New York. The restaurant business never left his blood, as he continued to work at the restaurant nights. Frank, however, knew that this was his legacy and where he belonged, ultimately returning to work at Rao's full-time.
 In 2000 he opened Baldoria in New York's tony Theater District, a 200 seat restaurant that managed to still carry off the intimate ambience, and stellar Italian cuisine of Rao's, except at Baldoria, people eventually would be able to get a reservation. Pellegrino then decided to bring his talents to Las Vegas to open the second outpost of Rao's, and eventually Los Angeles to open the third.
 Pellegrino moved to out west to open Rao's at Caesars Palace in 2006 and Rao's in Hollywood in 2013, and has since brought the same Southern Italian fare and sense of family and camaraderie that one used to only be able to get if they had their standing reservation at the original Rao's. He can be found not only greeting guests, but floating from table to table, ensuring that the Las Vegas and Hollywood experience is the same warm, familiar and inviting one they'd feel in New York.
 In 2012, Pellegrino released Rao's On the Grill (St. Martin's Press), which is full of signature Rao's dishes and new creations from "Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken," to pastas, salads and even desserts, this book is a must-have for anyone with a passion for cooking or dining al fresco.
 



Ron Straci
 Ron Straci is one of the founders and co-owners of Rao's Specialty Foods, Inc. A graduate of Fordham College & Law School, he is now of Counsel to Pitta & Giblin, LLP specializing in Labor Relations. Among other clients, they represent the Bakery and Confectionery Local Union 3. Rao's Specialty Foods, Inc. was started in 1992 to bring to the consumers' home the signature marinara sauce of the legendary Rao's Restaurant. A loyal Fancy Food Show exhibitor, for almost twenty years, Rao's Specialty Foods, Inc. has grown its product line to include a variety of flavors of pasta sauces – not to mention imported pastas, olive oils, vinegars, roasted peppers and dressings – with both domestic and international distribution to traditional gourmet stores and supermarkets.
 



Frank Pellegrino
 Proprietor and nightly host at the famous Rao's Restaurant in New York, Frank Pellegrino was born and raised in East Harlem, surrounded by a wonderful family including many good cooks!  Frank welcomes his guests to the restaurant and in part the East Harlem neighborhood, in the most hospitable and generous way.  After Frank's warm welcome, you are treated to the best southern Italian cooking in New York City, and now on the west coast at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.
 To that end, Frank is constantly consulting with his Executive Chef Dino Gatto at Rao's New York, vigilantly ensuring the consistency of the food served at Rao's.  He does the same with Rao's Las Vegas Executive Chef Nicole Grimes.  They review the recipes regularly, discussing ingredients, preparation, and working on new dishes to serve while preserving the traditional foods of our ancestors.
 In 1992, Frank founded Rao's Specialty Foods to produce and sell the highest quality gourmet products.  In 1998, he wrote the Rao's Cookbook (Random House) providing a wonderful look back at family and neighborhood history, as well as sharing Italian recipes from  the  restaurant, giving everyone the opportunity and  the basics to prepare the simple recipes. The main theme of the cookbook is gathering family and friends around the dining table, sharing food and sharing lives.
 In 2004, Frank followed up with a second cookbook, Rao's Recipes From the Neighborhood (St. Martins Press) focusing on and giving credit to the many wonderful cooks who came from East Harlem. In each of the recipes, a bit of heritage and pride comes across; "food from the heart"; again also encouraging cooking at home, with family and friends around.
 Frank is a man of many talents; singer, actor, writer, producer, restaurateur and philanthropist.  He has a warm and gracious personality, which shines through at Rao's every night.

Show moreFood You want to feed your family healthy food, but making the best choices can be difficult, especially if you're on a budget or short on time   or if you or any members of your family have special dietary needs. Fortunately, Walmart makes it easy to plan meals and stock up on delicious and nutritious food that is also affordable. Barbecue essentials Anytime is a great time to fire up the barbecue. Grab some hot dogs, hamburgers, steaks, chops, corn on the cob and whatever else you like to grill and get ready for a fun food fest. Of course, barbecue essentials don't necessarily need to be cooked on a grill. Don't forget the: Chips and snacks, like pistachios and mixed nuts, almonds and snack crackers Dips and spreads, including salsa, guacamole and black bean dip Side dishes of rice, mac and cheese and pasta salad beans and chili Condiments, like ketchup, mustard, mayo and more You'll also find Walmart's lowest prices on picnic items like paper plates, napkins, plastic cups, plasticware and more, should you want to take your meal to the great outdoors. Beverages From water and juice to coffee, beer and wine, you'll find a wide variety of delicious and refreshing beverages at Walmart, all at Every Day Low Prices. Explore the varied selection of juices, where you'll find common favorites like apple, orange and cranberry juice as well as mixed fruit and vegetable juices and much more. Browse the soft drinks: colas, root beer, cream soda, fruit sodas and more in both standard and sugar-free varieties, including options from popular brands such as Coca Cola, Pepsi and A&W. If you've been exercising, try sports drinks, like Gatorade, to keep yourself hydrated and maybe a caffeinated energy drink to keep yourself going throughout the day. There is also a large selection of hot beverages, including coffee, tea and hot cocoa, plus adult beverages, including beer, wine and spirits. To turn an ordinary glass of water into a more appealing beverage, consider powdered drink mixes and drink enhancers, which come in a wide range of flavors and include diet and fortified options featuring vitamins and electrolytes. Healthy options Are you confused by all the nutritional information that's available? Walmart's Great For You products feature a simple icon that lets you know you're choosing a healthy item. That includes lots of the foods nutritionists say people should get more of, including fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds and lean meats. It's also easy to find foods that meet special requirements. Simply filter your grocery searches by dietary need and you'll find products that are: Gluten free Sugar free Sodium free Fat free Nut free Dairy free There are also natural, organic, vegetarian, kosher and halal options. Walmart makes it easier to find the foods you want while simultaneously meeting your dietary requirements. No matter what type of special diet you are looking for, there are options that will help you make the right food choices day in and day out. Organic foods If you prefer to feed your family with natural or organic foods, enjoy Walmart's inventory of organic delights, which are made without artificial ingredients; they're grown without synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers. A food is labeled as organic by the way farmers grow and process their agricultural products, like different meats, fruits, vegetables, grains and dairy products. Organic farming practices are created to promote soil and water conservation and also to reduce pollution. The farmers who grow organic produce don't use what would be considered conventional methods to fertilize and control weeds. For example, organic farming practices would include the use of natural fertilizers to feed the soil and plants, while using crop rotation or mulch to manage the weeds. So what makes a product organic for certain? The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) established a certification program that requires all organic-labeled foods to meet strict government standards first. These standards regulate how such foods are grown, handled and processed. Thus, any product labeled as organic must be USDA certified. You could look through a variety of foods and check for the organic label on each one, but it s a much easier shopping process when everything can be found together, in one convenient location. Whatever your dietary goals or requirements are, you can easily find foods that meet your needs at Walmart. Just filter your search by dietary need and you'll find a large selection of delicious foods. Save Money.

Occupation


Former President of General Fibre Company
Inventor




Frank G. Pellegrino (1923 – 2008) was an American engineer, inventor, and industrialist. He served as president of the General Fibre Company. During his tenure, General Fibre became the largest manufacturer of duck decoy models in the United States, producing over a million per year in the 1950s.[1][2] Pellegrino also negotiated the sale of the International Hat Company to Interco, Inc.[3] Additionally, he created a variety of inventions related to the plastic molding industry. Most notably, Pellegrino invented automated assembly line machines in the formation of plastic objects.[4] These machines were used by General Fibre in the production of a variety of plastic models, duck decoys, and Michelob paraphernalia throughout the 1960s to 1980s.

Pellegrino was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He was an electrical engineering graduate of Iowa State University.[5] He was the son of Ida Kropp and Frank Pellegrino, the philanthropist and president of the International Hat Company.[6][7] He served as an American naval officer, in the Pacific theater, during World War II.[5] After World War II, Pellegrino was stationed in Japan as part of the US occupation and rebuilding effort.[5] In 1948, he returned to St. Louis and married into the high society, old money Henry family; marrying Virginia Anne Henry, daughter of Harry W. Henry, president of the Graham Paper Company.[8] That same year, Pellegrino was hired as vice president of General Fibre by President George Tilles, Jr.
In the mid-1950s, Pellegrino became president of General Fiber, following the retirement of Lewis Tilles Apple. The company had manufactured the original M1 fiber helmet liner in 1941 before moving into the production of fiber components for the military pressed fiber sun helmets used by American soldiers during World War II. After the war ended, the company required a production transition back to civilian orders. In 1946, General Fibre switched into the duck, goose, and swan decoy model market.[2] The models were used by hunters to attract prey.[2] During his management of the company, General Fiber reached its peak production of these models in the late 1950s and early 1960s. However, it was during this time that Pellegrino began shifting the company's business model out of the production of wood fiber pulp products into the emerging plastics and plastic molding industry.[1]
In the early 1960s, he designed and engineered new automated machines in the manufacturing of plastic goods. These included plastic models, construction helmets, and various products for the Anheuser-Busch company.
Pellegrino died in 2008.[5] He is buried in Sunset Memorial Park in St. Louis.[5]

During his tenure, General Fibre became the largest manufacturer of duck decoy models in the United States, producing over a million per year in the 1950s.[1][2] Pellegrino also negotiated the sale of the International Hat Company to Interco, Inc.[3] Additionally, he created a variety of inventions related to the plastic molding industry. Most notably, Pellegrino invented automated assembly line machines in the formation of plastic objects.[4] These machines were used by General Fibre in the production of a variety of plastic models, duck decoys, and Michelob paraphernalia throughout the 1960s to 1980s.

Pellegrino was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He was an electrical engineering graduate of Iowa State University.[5] He was the son of Ida Kropp and Frank Pellegrino, the philanthropist and president of the International Hat Company.[6][7] He served as an American naval officer, in the Pacific theater, during World War II.[5] After World War II, Pellegrino was stationed in Japan as part of the US occupation and rebuilding effort.[5] In 1948, he returned to St. Louis and married into the high society, old money Henry family; marrying Virginia Anne Henry, daughter of Harry W. Henry, president of the Graham Paper Company.[8] That same year, Pellegrino was hired as vice president of General Fibre by President George Tilles, Jr.
In the mid-1950s, Pellegrino became president of General Fiber, following the retirement of Lewis Tilles Apple. The company had manufactured the original M1 fiber helmet liner in 1941 before moving into the production of fiber components for the military pressed fiber sun helmets used by American soldiers during World War II. After the war ended, the company required a production transition back to civilian orders. In 1946, General Fibre switched into the duck, goose, and swan decoy model market.[2] The models were used by hunters to attract prey.[2] During his management of the company, General Fiber reached its peak production of these models in the late 1950s and early 1960s. However, it was during this time that Pellegrino began shifting the company's business model out of the production of wood fiber pulp products into the emerging plastics and plastic molding industry.[1]
In the early 1960s, he designed and engineered new automated machines in the manufacturing of plastic goods. These included plastic models, construction helmets, and various products for the Anheuser-Busch company.
Pellegrino died in 2008.[5] He is buried in Sunset Memorial Park in St. Louis.[5]
