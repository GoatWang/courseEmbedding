      Fitch Rates Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-6
    





April 30, 2013 10:41 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to Sequoia Mortgage Trust 
      2013-6, mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2013-6 (SEMT 2013-6):
    

      --$130,000,000 class A-1 certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$130,000,000 class A-IO1 notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$267,343,000 class A-2 certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$397,343,000 class A-IO2 notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$7,649,000 class B-1 certificate 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$7,012,000 class B-2 certificate 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$6,374,000 class B-3 certificate 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$2,125,000 non-offered class B-4 certificate 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The 'AAAsf' rating on the senior certificates reflects the 6.50% 
      subordination provided by the 1.80% class B-1, 1.65% class B-2, 1.50% 
      class B-3, 0.50% non-offered class B-4 and 1.05% non-offered class B-5. 
      The $4,463,577 non-offered class B-5 certificates will not be rated by 
      Fitch.
    

      Fitch's ratings reflect the high quality of the underlying collateral, 
      the clear capital structure and the high percentage of loans reviewed by 
      third party underwriters. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. will act 
      as the master servicer and Christiana Trust will act as the Trustee for 
      the transaction. For federal income tax purposes, elections will be made 
      to treat the trust as one or more real estate mortgage investment 
      conduits (REMICs).
    

      SEMT 2013-6 will be Redwood Residential Acquisition Corporation's sixth 
      transaction of prime residential mortgages in 2013. The certificates are 
      supported by a pool of prime fixed rate mortgage loans. The loans are 
      all fully amortizing. The aggregate pool included loans originated by 
      United Shore Financial Services (USFS, 7.7%), Cole Taylor Bank (CTB, 
      7.6%), PrimeLending (PL, 6.7%), and WJ Bradley Mortgage Capital (WJB, 
      5.2%). The remainder of the mortgage loans was originated by various 
      mortgage lending institutions, each of which contributed less than 5% to 
      the transaction.
    

      As of the cut-off date, the aggregate pool consisted of 545 loans with a 
      total balance of $424,966,578; an average balance of $779,755; a 
      weighted average original combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 65.8%, 
      and a weighted average coupon (WAC) of 3.8%. Rate/Term and cash out 
      refinances account for 67.0% and 7.7% of the loans, respectively. The 
      weighted average original FICO credit score of the pool is 771. 
      Owner-occupied properties comprise 96.8% of the loans. The states that 
      represent the largest geographic concentration are California (37.1%), 
      Massachusetts (10.2%) and Texas (6.8%).
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High-Quality Mortgage Pool: The collateral pool consists primarily of 
      30-year fixed-rate fully documented loans to borrowers with strong 
      credit profiles, low leverage, and substantial liquid reserves. All of 
      the loans are fully amortizing. Third-party loan-level due diligence was 
      conducted on 100% of the overall pool, and Fitch believes the results of 
      the review generally indicate strong underwriting controls.
    

      Originators with Limited Performance History: The entire pool was 
      originated by lenders with limited non-agency performance history. While 
      the significant contribution of loans from these originators is a 
      concern, Fitch believes the lack of performance history is partially 
      mitigated by the 100% third-party diligence conducted on these loans 
      that resulted in immaterial findings. Fitch also considers the credit 
      enhancement (CE) on this transaction sufficient to mitigate the 
      originator risk.
    

      Geographically Diverse Pool: The collateral pool is geographically 
      diverse. The percentage in the top three metropolitan statistical areas 
      (MSA) is 19.3%, the lowest concentration to date. Concentration in 
      California (37.1%) is also the lowest to date compared to prior SEMT 
      transactions. The agency did not apply a default penalty to the pool due 
      to the low geographic concentration risk.
    

      Transaction Provisions Enhance Performance: As in other recent SEMT 
      transactions rated by Fitch, SEMT 2013-6 contains binding arbitration 
      provisions that may serve to provide timely resolution to representation 
      and warranty disputes. In addition, all loans that become 120 days or 
      more delinquent will be reviewed for breaches of representations and 
      warranties.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch's analysis incorporates sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how 
      the ratings would react to steeper market value declines (MVDs) than 
      assumed at both the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and national 
      levels. The implied rating sensitivities are only an indication of some 
      of the potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors that 
      the transaction may become exposed to or be considered in the 
      surveillance of the transaction.
    

      Fitch conducted sensitivity analysis on areas where the model projected 
      lower home price declines than that of the overall collateral pool. The 
      model currently projects sustainable MVDs (sMVDs) at the MSA level. For 
      one of the top 10 regions, Fitch's SHP model does not project declines 
      in home prices and for three others, the projected decline is less than 
      10%. These regions are Seattle-Bellevue-Everett in Washington (5.5%), 
      Cambridge-Newton-Framingham, MA (5.0%), Boston-Quincy in Massachusetts 
      (4.3%), and Chicago-Joliet-Naperville in Illinois (3.7%). Fitch 
      conducted sensitivity analysis assuming sMVDs of 10%, 15%, and 20% 
      compared with those projected by Fitch's SHP model for these regions. 
      The sensitivity analysis indicated no impact on ratings for all bonds in 
      each scenario.
    

      Another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings 
      would react to steeper MVDs at the national level. The analysis assumes 
      MVDs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, in addition to the model projected 13% for 
      this pool. The analysis indicates there is some potential rating 
      migration with higher MVDs, compared with the model projection.
    

      Additional detail on the transaction is described in the new issue 
      report 'Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-6'.

Exhibit 33.4 
MANAGEMENT’S ASSERTION OF COMPLIANCE 
Management of the Agency and Trust division of Citibank, N.A. (or “Company”) is responsible for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria set
forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Management has determined that the servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB are applicable in regard to the servicing platform as of and for the period as follows: 
Platform: Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended) and certain privately-issued (i.e., for which transaction-level reporting is required pursuant to contractual obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006, as listed in Appendix A, for
which the Company provides the following servicing functions:   


 
•
 
paying agent, securities administration and trustee; or   


 
•
 
securities administration and paying agent; or   


 
•
 
paying agent and trustee; or   


 
•
 
paying agent  The Platform also includes certain transactions listed in Appendix B for which
the Company is not a party to the transaction agreements, but for which securities administration servicing functions have been outsourced to the Company by a party to the transaction agreements.

Applicable Servicing Criteria: All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d), to the extent required by Item 1122(d)
servicing criteria in regards to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform as to any transaction, except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(1)(iii)-1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-1122(d)(4)(ii)
and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-1122(d)(4)(xiv), which management has determined are not applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform (the “Applicable Servicing Criteria”). Servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is
applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform only as it relates to the Company’s obligation to report additions, removals or substitutions on reports to investors in accordance with the transaction agreements.
With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(ii), there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to
perform such activities.  Period: Twelve months ended December 31, 2014 (the “Period”). 
With respect to the Platform as of and for the Period, the Company’s management provides the following assertion of compliance with respect to the
Applicable Servicing Criteria:   


 
•
 
The Company’s management is responsible for assessing the Company’s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.   


 
•
 
The Company’s management has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph
(d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB.   


 
•
 
Based on such assessment, the Company has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to Management’s assertion of compliance with
the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the Period.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
