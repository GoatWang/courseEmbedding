About Joel Klein, CPBC.
With more than ten years of experience as a business coach and marketing pioneer, renowned 
and leading expert Joel Klein, CPBC, offers time-tested principles and practices to help us rise to 
challenges presented to us in day-to-day business life. Klein gives the tools needed to be successful 
in any position in business - and furthermore, to enjoy every minute of the journey. Joel Klein has 
coached and established countless start-offs, has successfully moved well-established businesses 
forward and is the author of several best-seller books on business and marketing. His client base 
includes, but is not limited to, businesses across the U.S., Canada, London, Antwerp and Israel.

"Every person has visions. To actualize them he needs to work. During my career as a business coach, I've met many people with visions. Trust me; all of them are working hard. Very hard. So why are they seeking 
my guidance? It's simple - their vision is all but a vision. Sometimes, we work and work and we're obliviously 
going around in circles; not reaching a destination. We concentrate on the bulk and lose focus of the little 
details so crucial to success. However, it is the successful businessman that will grasp the impact of every 
little detail along the road to success. Because success is about every little detail that was done right. I'll quote 
the age-old words of a wise man: "To live through an impossible situation, you don't need the reflexes of a 
Grand Prix driver, the muscles of a Hercules, the mind of an Einstein. You simply need to know what to do."

Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: June 29, 2007

 Reviews the work of the New York City School Chancellor Joel Klein and his attempt to create a Leadership Academy in order to better train principals to lead New York City public schools. Assesses what leadership skills and strategies are necessary for Klein to create a new cohort of effective site-based leaders for New York City Public Schools and further, what methodology Klein and the Leadership Academy establish to accomplish this task. The key question involves Klein's attempt to assess whether an institution dedicated to training better administrators can serve as the key component of a larger effort to improve the performance of the New York City public school system; on a more micro basis is the question of whether the Leadership Academy itself and its program to train principals has been effective in the context of the larger problems the school system faces. If so, will the principals trained be able to be successfully integrated and effectively utilized as organizational elements capable of leading site efforts necessary to improve New York City public school system performance?

Joel Irwin Klein (born October 25, 1946) is an American lawyer and school superintendent. He was the Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education, the largest public school system in the United States, serving more than 1.1 million students in more than 1,600 schools. He was succeeded by Cathie Black in January 2011.
New York magazine ranked Klein as one of the most influential people in public education.[1] Klein had never obtained the common formal credentials that one would have to take a leadership role in a public school system, and Klein had a short duration of teaching experience.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
Klein grew up in New York City and attended public schools, graduating from William Cullen Bryant High School in Queens in 1963. He attended Columbia University, graduating magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa.[citation needed] He received his law degree from Harvard Law School, again graduating magna cum laude, in 1971. He then clerked for Chief Judge David Bazelon on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1973 until 1974, before then clerking for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell.[3]
Career[edit]
In 1975, Klein joined the legal team of the Washington, D.C., non-profit Mental Health Law Project. The MHLP was an independent non-profit organization that brought class-action suits to establish rights for mentally and developmentally disabled clients. In that capacity, Klein developed a specialty in health care and constitutional matters.[4] After working there for a year, he went into private practice, working for five years before founding his own law firm with several partners. In the 1990s Klein served in the White House Counsel's office under President Bill Clinton before being appointed to the United States Department of Justice. There he served as United States Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division. In this capacity, he was the lead prosecutor in the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft. Prior to his appointment to Chancellor in 2002[5] by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Klein was Counsel to Bertelsmann, an international media group.
Klein was rumored to be one of Barack Obama's candidates for Secretary of Education.[6] Ultimately, the position went to the Chief Executive Officer of the Chicago Public Schools, Arne Duncan, then to John King Jr..
New York City School Chancellor[edit]
In 1998, before Klein became Chancellor, the New York City Board of Education transferred responsibility for school safety to the New York City Police Department.[7] Klein has been criticized for not seeking to alter this arrangement or to curb the conduct of the Police Department's school safety agents in the face of allegations of abuse.[7][8] Klein has praised the work of the school safety agents in contributing to a decrease in crime in the public schools.[9]
Despite their opposing positions in the Justice Department antitrust case against Microsoft, Klein was able to work with the Gates Foundation to fund the creation of smaller schools in New York City. At the 43 small high schools funded by the Gates Foundation graduation rates are 73% compared to 53% at the schools they replaced.[10][11] The researchers only examined schools selectively; for example 33 small schools were omitted from the analysis. [12] According to Bob Herbert, Bill Gates later admitted that the idea of breaking up schools was a failure.[13]
In 2005, Klein fired Columbia University professor Rashid Khalidi from the teacher training program, reportedly because of Khalidi's political views. After the controversial decision, Columbia University president Lee Bollinger spoke out on Khalidi's behalf, writing: "The department's decision to dismiss Professor Khalidi from the program was wrong and violates First Amendment principles.... The decision was based solely on his purported political views and was made without any consultation and apparently without any review of the facts."[14] The program's creator Mark Willner stated that (Khalidi) "spoke on geography and demography," and that "There was nothing controversial, nothing political."[14]
In 2007, Klein installed a computer system called The Achievement Reporting and Innovation System (ARIS), at a cost of $95 million, with records on 1 million current and former students. Teachers and parents were able to track student progress with the system. After Klein left his job as chancellor to work at the News Corp., a company owned by the News Corp. got a contract for nearly $10 million to manage the system in 2012. Subsequent News Corp. contracts were worth millions more. Klein denied a conflict of interest. Finally, in 2014, the Education Department decided to abandon the system, due to its high cost, limited functionality, and little use by parents and staff. [15][16]
News Corporation[edit]
On November 9, 2010, Bloomberg announced that Klein would resign as chancellor and would take a position as an executive vice president for News Corporation. Klein's date of departure was not immediately clear but it was later announced that he would be gone at the end of the year.[17] He was replaced by Cathie Black, chairman of Hearst Magazines and former president of USA Today, on January 3, 2011.[18]
On July 6, 2011, Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation[19] and the company's CEO, announced that Joel Klein would "provide important oversight and guidance" in the internal investigation of phone hacking at News of the World.[20] Klein took over the investigation, with fellow director Viet D. Dinh, from News International UK Chief Executive, Rebekah Brooks, whose own involvement in the phone hacking scandal made her unable to continue as an impartial investigator.[21]
Since joining News Corp, Klein has recruited at least two other executives from the New York City Department of Education. In February 2011 New York City Department of Education's Communications Director, Natalie Ravitz, announced that she would be joining News Corp as Klein's chief of staff. According to GothamSchools.org, a nonprofit non partisan news website that reports on the New York City Schools, "Ravitz is following a well-worn path from the department to NewsCorp: Ex-schools chief Joel Klein, who was chancellor when Ravitz was hired, now heads the company’s growing education division. Last summer, Klein picked Kristen Kane, the department’s former chief operating officer, to become the division’s COO. He also acquired Wireless Generation, the technology company that developed and managed ARIS, the city’s school data warehouse."[22]
Personal life[edit]
Klein is married to Nicole Seligman, General Counsel to Howard Stringer of Sony Corp. Seligman was on the legal team of then-President Bill Clinton during impeachment proceedings in the United States Senate.

Joel Irwin Klein (born October 25, 1946) is an American lawyer and school superintendent. He was the Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education, the largest public school system in the United States, serving more than 1.1 million students in more than 1,600 schools. He was succeeded by Cathie Black in January 2011.
New York magazine ranked Klein as one of the most influential people in public education.[1] Klein had never obtained the common formal credentials that one would have to take a leadership role in a public school system, and Klein had a short duration of teaching experience.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
Klein grew up in New York City and attended public schools, graduating from William Cullen Bryant High School in Queens in 1963. He attended Columbia University, graduating magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa.[citation needed] He received his law degree from Harvard Law School, again graduating magna cum laude, in 1971. He then clerked for Chief Judge David Bazelon on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1973 until 1974, before then clerking for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell.[3]
Career[edit]
In 1975, Klein joined the legal team of the Washington, D.C., non-profit Mental Health Law Project. The MHLP was an independent non-profit organization that brought class-action suits to establish rights for mentally and developmentally disabled clients. In that capacity, Klein developed a specialty in health care and constitutional matters.[4] After working there for a year, he went into private practice, working for five years before founding his own law firm with several partners. In the 1990s Klein served in the White House Counsel's office under President Bill Clinton before being appointed to the United States Department of Justice. There he served as United States Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division. In this capacity, he was the lead prosecutor in the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft. Prior to his appointment to Chancellor in 2002[5] by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Klein was Counsel to Bertelsmann, an international media group.
Klein was rumored to be one of Barack Obama's candidates for Secretary of Education.[6] Ultimately, the position went to the Chief Executive Officer of the Chicago Public Schools, Arne Duncan, then to John King Jr..
New York City School Chancellor[edit]
In 1998, before Klein became Chancellor, the New York City Board of Education transferred responsibility for school safety to the New York City Police Department.[7] Klein has been criticized for not seeking to alter this arrangement or to curb the conduct of the Police Department's school safety agents in the face of allegations of abuse.[7][8] Klein has praised the work of the school safety agents in contributing to a decrease in crime in the public schools.[9]
Despite their opposing positions in the Justice Department antitrust case against Microsoft, Klein was able to work with the Gates Foundation to fund the creation of smaller schools in New York City. At the 43 small high schools funded by the Gates Foundation graduation rates are 73% compared to 53% at the schools they replaced.[10][11] The researchers only examined schools selectively; for example 33 small schools were omitted from the analysis. [12] According to Bob Herbert, Bill Gates later admitted that the idea of breaking up schools was a failure.[13]
In 2005, Klein fired Columbia University professor Rashid Khalidi from the teacher training program, reportedly because of Khalidi's political views. After the controversial decision, Columbia University president Lee Bollinger spoke out on Khalidi's behalf, writing: "The department's decision to dismiss Professor Khalidi from the program was wrong and violates First Amendment principles.... The decision was based solely on his purported political views and was made without any consultation and apparently without any review of the facts."[14] The program's creator Mark Willner stated that (Khalidi) "spoke on geography and demography," and that "There was nothing controversial, nothing political."[14]
In 2007, Klein installed a computer system called The Achievement Reporting and Innovation System (ARIS), at a cost of $95 million, with records on 1 million current and former students. Teachers and parents were able to track student progress with the system. After Klein left his job as chancellor to work at the News Corp., a company owned by the News Corp. got a contract for nearly $10 million to manage the system in 2012. Subsequent News Corp. contracts were worth millions more. Klein denied a conflict of interest. Finally, in 2014, the Education Department decided to abandon the system, due to its high cost, limited functionality, and little use by parents and staff. [15][16]
News Corporation[edit]
On November 9, 2010, Bloomberg announced that Klein would resign as chancellor and would take a position as an executive vice president for News Corporation. Klein's date of departure was not immediately clear but it was later announced that he would be gone at the end of the year.[17] He was replaced by Cathie Black, chairman of Hearst Magazines and former president of USA Today, on January 3, 2011.[18]
On July 6, 2011, Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation[19] and the company's CEO, announced that Joel Klein would "provide important oversight and guidance" in the internal investigation of phone hacking at News of the World.[20] Klein took over the investigation, with fellow director Viet D. Dinh, from News International UK Chief Executive, Rebekah Brooks, whose own involvement in the phone hacking scandal made her unable to continue as an impartial investigator.[21]
Since joining News Corp, Klein has recruited at least two other executives from the New York City Department of Education. In February 2011 New York City Department of Education's Communications Director, Natalie Ravitz, announced that she would be joining News Corp as Klein's chief of staff. According to GothamSchools.org, a nonprofit non partisan news website that reports on the New York City Schools, "Ravitz is following a well-worn path from the department to NewsCorp: Ex-schools chief Joel Klein, who was chancellor when Ravitz was hired, now heads the company’s growing education division. Last summer, Klein picked Kristen Kane, the department’s former chief operating officer, to become the division’s COO. He also acquired Wireless Generation, the technology company that developed and managed ARIS, the city’s school data warehouse."[22]
Personal life[edit]
Klein is married to Nicole Seligman, General Counsel to Howard Stringer of Sony Corp. Seligman was on the legal team of then-President Bill Clinton during impeachment proceedings in the United States Senate.

On July 6, 2011, Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation[19] and the company's CEO, announced that Joel Klein would "provide important oversight and guidance" in the internal investigation of phone hacking at News of the World.[20] Klein took over the investigation, with fellow director Viet D. Dinh, from News International UK Chief Executive, Rebekah Brooks, whose own involvement in the phone hacking scandal made her unable to continue as an impartial investigator.[21]
Since joining News Corp, Klein has recruited at least two other executives from the New York City Department of Education. In February 2011 New York City Department of Education's Communications Director, Natalie Ravitz, announced that she would be joining News Corp as Klein's chief of staff. According to GothamSchools.org, a nonprofit non partisan news website that reports on the New York City Schools, "Ravitz is following a well-worn path from the department to NewsCorp: Ex-schools chief Joel Klein, who was chancellor when Ravitz was hired, now heads the company’s growing education division. Last summer, Klein picked Kristen Kane, the department’s former chief operating officer, to become the division’s COO. He also acquired Wireless Generation, the technology company that developed and managed ARIS, the city’s school data warehouse."[22]
Personal life[edit]
Klein is married to Nicole Seligman, General Counsel to Howard Stringer of Sony Corp. Seligman was on the legal team of then-President Bill Clinton during impeachment proceedings in the United States Senate.

Joel Irwin Klein (born October 25, 1946) is an American lawyer and school superintendent. He was the Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education, the largest public school system in the United States, serving more than 1.1 million students in more than 1,600 schools. He was succeeded by Cathie Black in January 2011.
New York magazine ranked Klein as one of the most influential people in public education.[1] Klein had never obtained the common formal credentials that one would have to take a leadership role in a public school system, and Klein had a short duration of teaching experience.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
Klein grew up in New York City and attended public schools, graduating from William Cullen Bryant High School in Queens in 1963. He attended Columbia University, graduating magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa.[citation needed] He received his law degree from Harvard Law School, again graduating magna cum laude, in 1971. He then clerked for Chief Judge David Bazelon on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1973 until 1974, before then clerking for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell.[3]
Career[edit]
In 1975, Klein joined the legal team of the Washington, D.C., non-profit Mental Health Law Project. The MHLP was an independent non-profit organization that brought class-action suits to establish rights for mentally and developmentally disabled clients. In that capacity, Klein developed a specialty in health care and constitutional matters.[4] After working there for a year, he went into private practice, working for five years before founding his own law firm with several partners. In the 1990s Klein served in the White House Counsel's office under President Bill Clinton before being appointed to the United States Department of Justice. There he served as United States Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division. In this capacity, he was the lead prosecutor in the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft. Prior to his appointment to Chancellor in 2002[5] by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Klein was Counsel to Bertelsmann, an international media group.
Klein was rumored to be one of Barack Obama's candidates for Secretary of Education.[6] Ultimately, the position went to the Chief Executive Officer of the Chicago Public Schools, Arne Duncan, then to John King Jr..
New York City School Chancellor[edit]
In 1998, before Klein became Chancellor, the New York City Board of Education transferred responsibility for school safety to the New York City Police Department.[7] Klein has been criticized for not seeking to alter this arrangement or to curb the conduct of the Police Department's school safety agents in the face of allegations of abuse.[7][8] Klein has praised the work of the school safety agents in contributing to a decrease in crime in the public schools.[9]
Despite their opposing positions in the Justice Department antitrust case against Microsoft, Klein was able to work with the Gates Foundation to fund the creation of smaller schools in New York City. At the 43 small high schools funded by the Gates Foundation graduation rates are 73% compared to 53% at the schools they replaced.[10][11] The researchers only examined schools selectively; for example 33 small schools were omitted from the analysis. [12] According to Bob Herbert, Bill Gates later admitted that the idea of breaking up schools was a failure.[13]
In 2005, Klein fired Columbia University professor Rashid Khalidi from the teacher training program, reportedly because of Khalidi's political views. After the controversial decision, Columbia University president Lee Bollinger spoke out on Khalidi's behalf, writing: "The department's decision to dismiss Professor Khalidi from the program was wrong and violates First Amendment principles.... The decision was based solely on his purported political views and was made without any consultation and apparently without any review of the facts."[14] The program's creator Mark Willner stated that (Khalidi) "spoke on geography and demography," and that "There was nothing controversial, nothing political."[14]
In 2007, Klein installed a computer system called The Achievement Reporting and Innovation System (ARIS), at a cost of $95 million, with records on 1 million current and former students. Teachers and parents were able to track student progress with the system. After Klein left his job as chancellor to work at the News Corp., a company owned by the News Corp. got a contract for nearly $10 million to manage the system in 2012. Subsequent News Corp. contracts were worth millions more. Klein denied a conflict of interest. Finally, in 2014, the Education Department decided to abandon the system, due to its high cost, limited functionality, and little use by parents and staff. [15][16]
News Corporation[edit]
On November 9, 2010, Bloomberg announced that Klein would resign as chancellor and would take a position as an executive vice president for News Corporation. Klein's date of departure was not immediately clear but it was later announced that he would be gone at the end of the year.[17] He was replaced by Cathie Black, chairman of Hearst Magazines and former president of USA Today, on January 3, 2011.[18]
On July 6, 2011, Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation[19] and the company's CEO, announced that Joel Klein would "provide important oversight and guidance" in the internal investigation of phone hacking at News of the World.[20] Klein took over the investigation, with fellow director Viet D. Dinh, from News International UK Chief Executive, Rebekah Brooks, whose own involvement in the phone hacking scandal made her unable to continue as an impartial investigator.[21]
Since joining News Corp, Klein has recruited at least two other executives from the New York City Department of Education. In February 2011 New York City Department of Education's Communications Director, Natalie Ravitz, announced that she would be joining News Corp as Klein's chief of staff. According to GothamSchools.org, a nonprofit non partisan news website that reports on the New York City Schools, "Ravitz is following a well-worn path from the department to NewsCorp: Ex-schools chief Joel Klein, who was chancellor when Ravitz was hired, now heads the company’s growing education division. Last summer, Klein picked Kristen Kane, the department’s former chief operating officer, to become the division’s COO. He also acquired Wireless Generation, the technology company that developed and managed ARIS, the city’s school data warehouse."[22]
Personal life[edit]
Klein is married to Nicole Seligman, General Counsel to Howard Stringer of Sony Corp. Seligman was on the legal team of then-President Bill Clinton during impeachment proceedings in the United States Senate.

One Amplify: Joel Klein’s Plan to Unify News Corp.’s Education Business | EdSurge News 
Exclusive | Edtech Business One Amplify: Joel Klein’s Plan to Unify News Corp.’s Education BusinessBy Tony Wan     Apr 29, 2015 Flickr user Learning Leaders NYCTweetShareEmail
	Amplify is one of the most scrutinized companies in education technology—only partly because its parent company is News Corporation. When News Corp. acquired Wireless Generation for $390 million in 2010—a deal that became the cornerstone for Amplify—it boldly promised to usher in a digital revolution in school. It came equipped with a powerful financial war chest—$1 billion, by some estimates—to support that mission.
	But turning that vision into real technology has proven to be complex, complicated by politics, missteps and an ambitious plan to deliver a wide range of different products and services. Now Amplify faces the single biggest challenge in its life: Can it weave together a collection of independent efforts—and win customers along the way?
	Concerns about Amplify ring loud and clear: Of News Corp.’s five divisions, only Amplify has posted annual losses. During its past two fiscal years (which end June 30), it posted losses of $193 million and $141 million, respectively. Losses slowed during the last three months of 2014 but Amplify’s quarterly revenue stayed flat at $22 million. News Corp.’s top boss, Rupert Murdoch commented in 2012 he would be “thrilled” if Amplify made up 10 percent of the company’s overall business revenues over the following five years. In fiscal 2014, Amplify accounted for $88 million--or roughly one percent.
	A shakeup is underway. This past January, Amplify CEO Joel Klein sent an internal memo to his staff: “It’s time to move past thinking about divisions and instead focus on our collective strengths,” he wrote. “That’s why I’ve decided to begin the process of fully integrating Amplify.”How Many Amplifys?
	The watchword within the company is “One Amplify,” Klein’s code name for a reorganization effort aimed at uniting a company that once listed 12 “C-level” executives and three presidents across five divisions. Today, seven chief officers remain—and no presidents.
	“Over the past year, I’ve met with a majority of you in person to talk about where we are as a company and where we need to go,” Klein wrote in his January note. “What rang out loud and clear was your strong desire to see us all work more closely together.”
	Amplify has had plenty of parts, including tablets, assessments, curricula, professional development, games, and consulting services. The one product often associated with Amplify is the orange tablet, unveiled in March 2013 with fanfare—only to be chastised a few months later after a messy rollout involving cracked screens and a melted charger. It was a big stumble out of the gate, and despite the company’s punctual efforts to patch up the issues, many questioned Amplify’s ability to deliver.


	The tablets overshadowed a much more established business inherited from Wireless Generation: assessments. Amplify currently offers literacy and math assessments that have won statewide contracts in North Carolina and Colorado, and scored a $12.5 million deal with Smarter Balanced to create a library of instructional resources aligned to the Common Core standards. Amplify also has a division responsible for a potpourri of print and digital curricula, the latter of which is used by approximately 30,000 students.
	The tablet, assessment and curriculum products made up Amplify’s Access, Insight and Learning divisions, respectively. Nestled within them have been teams in charge of other digital products like “Professional Learning Maps,” which helps teachers understand data, and a suite of 30 educational games, developed by 13 independent studios contracted by Amplify.
	The explosion of Amplify’s product lines was intentional. The executive team purposefully set up the three divisions to operate independently. Building and selling tablets, assessments, curriculum, games and professional development each required their own unique set of product development and sales expertise, went one version of the logic. The decision was reflected on the company’s leadership page, where each division has a distinct executive team.
	Creating autonomous teams seemed like a sound idea for a company with a staff of more than 1,000. But former employees say it was sometimes difficult to know who was in charge. Further complicating matters was the fact that different product teams and divisions used different development tools—some used Stash, others used Github, for instance—which made collaboration across groups very challenging.
	There were also technical legacy issues inherited from Wireless Generation: Attempting to share data and code across projects built on different architectures, and at different times, proved problematic.From Many to One
	Klein wondered, in a February memo sent to the company, whether Amplify’s curriculum and assessment tools could be integrated. “We have several groundbreaking products in early literacy instruction, assessment and intervention….How much more transformative could it be if they all worked together?”
	In that note, he spelled out the goal for One Amplify: “Amplify will be configured as one company, with a united mission and vision: to reimagine the way teachers teach and students learn.” Critical to its success will be ensuring that “our products will be built with common technologies. We will embrace open architectures and will integrate with diverse technologies relevant to our customers.” In addition, “key resources and support services common to our business needs will be shared across the company.”
	One of the first moves was to streamline technical leadership. Klein named Josh Hartmann, previously Chief Technology Officer at Amplify Access, to that role for the entire company and pledged Hartmann would “collaborate with leadership across the company as we work to build an integrated product development team.”
	Klein also announced the formation of a cross-division working group to explore how to integrate the company’s curricula and assessments. Two other groups mentioned in the note will explore how to streamline sales efforts for professional development products, and build prototypes to make its digital content more readily available on “several emergent digital platforms.”
	Conspicuously absent in Klein’s two memos is any mention of the orange tablet, which the company has put into the hands of 30,000 students. Coincidentally, Stephen Smyth, who joined Amplify in October 2012 and served as the Access division’s president and chief executive, is no longer listed on the company’s leadership page. (His LinkedIn profile is ambiguous about whether he is still at Amplify. Neither he nor the company responded to questions about his status.)Up, Up or Away?
	Klein has often likened Amplify to a startup. And, despite commanding financial resources that any company would envy, he may be right: like many young edtech entrepreneurs, Amplify has been trying to find a sustainable product-market fit. Far from resembling a coherent package, the company’s tools, and the teams building them, look like siloed efforts.
	Amplify’s games have enjoyed strong reviews, a sign that the the company has the talent and resources to create engaging products. But the path toward One Amplify’s vision—“to reimagine the way teachers teach and students learn”—remains hazy. Product integration is one step. Will the company continue to compete in the tablet and curriculum markets against the likes of Apple, Google and Pearson? Will it rely on digital assessments to carry the company? Will it try to sell off pieces that don’t fit?
	"We’ve helped more than 200,000 educators and 3 million students in all 50 states begin their digital transition,” said an Amplify spokesperson, who added the company remains “...committed to a process of continual improvement…”
	Klein said in his February memo that the company is “in the early innings of our integration effort,” but for some the reorganization can’t come soon enough. One employee, writing on Amplify’s Glassdoor page, advised management to “complete the One Amplify initiative quickly and quit dithering. Streamline the C level to reduce redundancy.”CommentsExclusive | Edtech Business One Amplify: Joel Klein’s Plan to Unify News Corp.’s Education BusinessBy Tony Wan     Apr 29, 2015 Flickr user Learning Leaders NYCTweetShareEmail

About the Book 



New York Times Bestseller (Education)The Economist Best Books of the Year SelectionIn this revealing and provocative memoir, the former chancellor of the New York City schools offers the behind-the-scenes story of the city’s dramatic campaign to improve public education and an inspiring blueprint for national reform.In 2002 New York City’s newly elected mayor, Michael Bloomberg, made a historic announcement: his administration had won control of the city’s school system in a first step toward reversing its precipitous decline. In a controversial move, he appointed Joel Klein, an accomplished lawyer from outside the education establishment, to lead this ambitious campaign.Lessons of Hope is Klein’s inside account of his eight-year mission of improvement: demanding accountability, eliminating political favoritism, and battling a powerful teachers union that seemed determined to protect a status quo that didn’t work for kids. Klein’s initiatives resulted in more school choice, higher graduation rates, and improved test scores. The New York City model is now seen as a national standard for meaningful school reform. But the journey was not easy. Klein faced resistance and conflict at every turn.Lessons of Hope lays bare the problems plaguing public education and shows how they can be solved. At its core lies Klein’s personal story: his humble upbringing in Brooklyn and Queens, and the key role that outstanding public school teachers played in nurturing his success. Engaging and illuminating, Lessons of Hope is essential reading for anyone concerned about the future of American public education.

Critical Praise
Lessons of Hope is part memoir, part blueprint for reviving public education, as Joel Klein takes us inside the dramatic struggle to turn around the New York City school system. — Arianna Huffington
“Joel Klein’s grasp of how critically linked a child’s education is to his or her success in life, and what that means for the future of America, make this book a great and important read.” — former Florida Governor Jeb Bush
Joel Klein has emerged from the bureaucracy to tell in personal, vivid detail what happened when he and his colleagues attempted to transform the country’s largest school system. — Amanda Ripley, bestselling author of The Smartest Kids in the World
A book that is inspiring as it is informative about the state of modern education. I hope every parent and teacher in the U.S. reads it. — Stephen J. Dubner, co-author of the "Freakonomics" series and host of Freakonomics Radio
Lessons of Hope is a bracing reminder of the need to improve America’s schools so we can deliver on the promise of a great education for everyone. — Bill Gates
This important book is of great value for families making decisions about schools and for policymakers and advocates who are determined to improve our nation’s systems of schools. — Senator Cory A. Booker
“Lessons of Hope is often a compelling account of how determined leadership can remove obstacles to change, and Klein offers a strong defense of his work as an effective leader of reform.” — Daily Beast
“Anyone interested in improving public school systems and learning about the Orwellian nature of contemporary political discourse should read Joel Klein’s Lessons of Hope. — Center on Reinventing Public Education
“Lessons of Hope is unique in the education reform genre, joined perhaps only by Steve Brill’s Class Warfare.The education space is full of policy wonks, but it’s rare to get such insight from the inner trenches of the political battles fought to implement that policy.” — Huffington Post
