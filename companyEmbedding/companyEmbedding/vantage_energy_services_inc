The net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting underwriter 
discounts and commissions and our estimated offering expenses, are estimated 
to be approximately $             million ($             million if the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full). We intend to use 
the proceeds from this offering, as well as the proceeds from the proposed 
Aquamarine Driller financing, to finance the final construction payment for 
the Aquamarine Driller , and use the remainder for general corporate purposes 
and working capital.


The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with contracts 
traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. The technical capabilities, 
availability and pricing of a drilling unit are often the primary factors in 
determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Other key factors 
include a contractor’s reputation for service, safety record, environmental 
record, technical and engineering support and long-term relationships with 
national and international oil and natural gas companies. Our competitors in 
the offshore contract drilling industry generally have larger, more diverse 
fleets, longer operating histories that have established safety and 
environmental records over a measurable period of time, experienced in-house 
technical and engineering support departments and long-term relationships 
with customers. This provides our competitors with competitive advantages that
may adversely affect our efforts to contract the drilling units on favorable 
terms, if at all, and correspondingly negatively impact our financial position
and results of operations. 

The offshore contract drilling industry, historically, has been very cyclical
with periods of high demand, limited supply and high dayrates alternating 
with periods of low demand, excess supply and low dayrates. Periods of low 
demand and excess supply intensify competition in the industry and often 
result in some drilling units becoming idle for long periods of time. Our lack
of operating history may put us at a competitive disadvantage and result in 
our drilling units being idle. Prolonged periods of low utilization and 
dayrates, or extended idle time, could result in the recognition of impairment
charges on our drilling units if cash flow estimates, based upon information 
available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of the 
drilling units may not be recoverable.


Company Description
Our primary business is to contract drilling units, related equipment and work
crews primarily on a dayrate basis to drill oil and natural gas wells. We also
provide construction supervision services for, and will operate and manage, 
drilling units owned by others. Through our fleet of nine owned


 and managed 
drilling units, we are a provider of offshore contract drilling services 
globally to major, national and large independent oil and natural gas 
companies. 

As of the date of this prospectus supplement, our fleet includes four 
ultra-premium jackup rigs, of which one is currently operating in Southeast 
Asia under a two year contract, another is mobilizing to West Africa to 
commence work later this month under a four month contract, one that is 
currently undergoing commissioning which we expect will be ready to commence 
operations in October 2009, and one that is currently under construction with 
scheduled delivery in December 2009. We are purchasing a 45% ownership 
interest in an entity which owns an ultra-deepwater drillship that is expected
to be delivered in November 2010. We also provide construction supervision for
this drillship and expect to manage it upon delivery. Additionally, we have 
entered into construction supervision and operating management agreements for
two other ultra-deepwater drillships. We also supervise the construction, and
upon delivery, expect to manage the operation, of two ultra-deepwater 
semisubmersibles. These drillships are scheduled for delivery in July 2011 and
June 2012, with the semisubmersibles scheduled for delivery in December 2010 
and July 2011.

CANONSBURG, Pa., Sept. 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Rice Energy Inc. (NYSE:    RICE) ("Rice Energy") today announced it has entered into a purchase and sale agreement ("PSA") to acquire Vantage Energy, LLC and Vantage Energy II, LLC (collectively, "Vantage Energy") for approximately $2.7 billion, including the assumption of debt. In connection with the acquisition, Rice Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:    RMP) ("RMP") will purchase the acquired midstream assets from Rice Energy for $600 million. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions. 










 









 

 
 



The E&P assets to be acquired by Rice Energy include approximately 85,000 net core Marcellus acres(1) in Greene County, Pennsylvania, with rights to the deeper Utica Shale on approximately 52,000 net acres and 37,000 net acres in the Barnett Shale. Second quarter 2016 net production of the acquired assets was 399 MMcfe/d (approximately 65% Appalachia, 35% Barnett). The core midstream assets to be acquired by RMP include 30 miles of dry gas gathering and compression assets. As part of the transaction, Rice Energy will dedicate the acquired Pennsylvania acreage to RMP to provide gas gathering, compression and water services.
Transaction Highlights

Core acquisition with organic upside potential 
Expands high return inventory of drilling locations by 66% 
Leasehold is approximately 50% held or owned in fee 
Extends RMP's 20% distribution growth target through 2023 
Immediately accretive and credit enhancing to both E&P and RMP 
Positions Rice Energy as the premier dry gas Appalachia company with 231,000 net acres, approximately 70% 2017 estimated production growth and 2017 estimated leverage of less than 2.5x
Following this transaction, Rice Energy will control approximately 231,000 net acres in the Marcellus and Ohio Utica cores with an inventory of 1,164 drilling locations that generate average single well returns of approximately 95% at strip pricing. Similarly, Rice Midstream Partners will control one of the largest and most concentrated core dry gas acreage dedications in the Marcellus Shale, covering approximately 199,000 acres in Washington and Greene Counties.
Daniel J. Rice IV, Chief Executive Officer, commented, "This deal represents the largest core dry gas Marcellus acquisition to date, one that is truly transformational for Rice Energy, Rice Midstream Partners and our respective shareholders. This acquisition adheres to our proven strategy of pursuing core shale gas acreage, leveraging our industry-leading technical shale team to deliver best-in-class well results and capturing a greater share of the value chain through our premier midstream services business. Our transaction financings are meant to strengthen Rice Energy's balance sheet even further, including positioning us to capture an additional 20,000 – 40,000 acres of leasehold adjacent to our existing position. Our proven success developing the Marcellus Shale in Greene County gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to generate meaningful growth and create substantial value on the acquired assets for both Rice Energy and Rice Midstream Partners, and we look forward to seamlessly integrating the acquired assets into our leading-edge shale development in Appalachia."
Roger Biemans, CEO of Vantage Energy, said "Vantage, together with its three sponsors – Quantum, Riverstone, and Lime Rock – has assembled one of the largest and most attractive core dry gas positions in the Marcellus Shale.  We believe the combination of Rice and Vantage creates the premier natural gas company in the country. Rice will have a multi-decade inventory of the most economic dry gas in North America, a tremendous growth story for its midstream business, and a management team that has proven its ability to execute on its strategy."  



 1.    Includes approximately 5,000 net royalty acres, the majority of which are leased to Rice Energy.

Transaction Terms and Financing
Pursuant to the PSA, Rice Energy Appalachia LLC ("REA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rice Energy, will acquire from Vantage Energy Investment LLC and Vantage Energy Investment II LLC (collectively, the "Vantage Sellers") their ownership interests in Vantage Energy for aggregate consideration at closing of approximately $2.7 billion. Total consideration consists of approximately $1.02 billion in cash, the assumption and retirement of assumed net debt of approximately $700 million and the issuance of membership interests in REA that are immediately exchangeable into approximately 39.1 million shares of common stock of Rice Energy, valued at approximately $980 million. The issuance of membership interests in REA will allow for tax deferral of the equity portion of the consideration paid to the Vantage Sellers. 
Concurrent with Rice Energy's acquisition of Vantage Energy, Rice Energy entered into a purchase and sale agreement with RMP, pursuant to which RMP will purchase the midstream assets associated with the Vantage acquisition from Rice Energy for aggregate consideration of $600 million. RMP intends to fund the midstream asset acquisition through borrowings under its revolving credit facility and potential equity and debt financings prior to closing, or the issuance to Rice Energy of up to $250 million of RMP common units representing limited partner interests. 
These acquisitions are expected to close concurrently in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.
Evercore acted as financial advisor to Rice Energy's Board of Directors. Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. provided committed financing to Rice Energy and RMP's upsized revolving credit facilities. Latham & Watkins LLP served as legal counsel to Rice Energy. Simmons & Company International | Energy Specialists of Piper Jaffray served as exclusive financial advisor to the conflicts committee of RMP and provided a fairness opinion for the midstream asset acquisition by RMP. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP served as legal counsel to the conflicts committee of RMP. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to the Vantage Sellers. Vinson & Elkins LLP served as legal counsel to the Vantage Sellers.
Guidance
Rice Energy has updated its 2016 capital budget and guidance pro forma for the anticipated fourth quarter 2016 transaction closing. Our Marcellus drilling and completion capital investments increased by $40 million to reflect ongoing activity on the acquired acreage. Our land capital budget increased by $35 million, as a result of anticipated successful organic leasing and leasehold costs associated with the acquired acreage

Furthermore, we expect 2017 net production to be within a range of 1,280 – 1,355 MMcfe/d, which is approximately 70% above our increased 2016 estimated net production, based on the mid-point of guidance.

(1)A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee,  NASD
filing fee, AMEX filing fee, has been paid from the $275,000 loan from our 
officers and directors, as further described below. These funds will be repaid 
out of the net proceeds of this offering not being deposited in the trust 
account upon consummation of this offering.

(2)Consists of an underwriting discount of 7% of the gross proceeds of this
offering (including any units sold to cover over-allotments) including 3%, or 
$7,200,000 to be held in trust ($8,280,000 if the underwriter's over-allotment 
option is exercised in full) until consummation of a business combination. Upon 
the consummation of a business combination, such deferred discount shall be 
released to the underwriters out of the gross proceeds of this offering held in
a trust account at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, maintained by 
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The underwriters
will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred discount.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $250,000
 even if the over-allotment is exercised. We currently estimate that we would 
require up to $15,000 should our corporate existence cease to exist  on May 24,
2009 to liquidate the company in the event we do not consummate a business 
combination. We will be permitted to seek disbursements from the trust account 
of interest income, net of taxes payable on all interest income earned on the 
trust account, up to an aggregate of $2,250,000 for working capital purposes.

Of the net proceeds of this offering, $222,200,000 (or $255,680,000 if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full) plus $6,000,000 from the purchase of
founder securities, for an aggregate of $228,200,000 (or $261,680,000 if the
over-allotment is exercised in full) will be placed in a trust account at
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. Additionally, $7,200,000 (or
$8,280,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
the proceeds attributable to the underwriters' discount will be deposited into
such trustee account for a total amount in trust of $235,400,000 (or
$269,960,000 if the over-allotment is exercised in full). The proceeds will not
be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or as part of any liquidation of our trust account. To the
extent the trust account earns interest or we are deemed to have earned income
in connection therewith, we will be permitted to seek disbursements from the
trust account to pay any federal, state or local tax obligations related thereto
or any franchise tax obligations. The proceeds held in the trust account may be
used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target acquisition with which we
complete a business combination (excluding the amount held in the trust account
representing a portion of the underwriters' discount). Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business will be used to finance our
operations, which may include the target business(es) we acquired on the
consummation of the business combination, to effect other acquisitions, or for
working capital, as determined by our board of directors at that time. All
amounts held in the trust account that are not converted to cash or released to
us as interest income, net of income taxes, will be released on closing of our
initial business combination with a target acquisition having a fair market
value of at least 80% of our net assets (excluding the amount held in the trust
account representing a portion of the underwriter's discount) at the time of
such business combination, subject to a majority of our public stockholders
voting in favor of the business combination and less than 30% of the public
stockholders voting against the business combination and electing their
conversion rights. The 30% threshold is 20% in most similar entities. 

We have agreed to pay a monthly fee of approximately $8,000 for office space
located in the Houston metropolitan area. The lease term is for 38 months and
the lessor is unaffiliated with the Company. The landlord for the lease is
Gateway Ridgecrest, Inc. As part of the negotiation, the landlord required a
38 month lease term if we were to secure the lease for the space. In the event
that a business combination is not approved within 24 months, Paul Bragg has
agreed to assume personally the responsibility for the balance of the lease
payments for the remaining fourteen months.

We intend to use the $250,000 of net proceeds not held in trust for due
diligence, legal, accounting, fees and expenses of the acquisition including
investment banking fees, and other expenses, including structuring and
negotiating business combination, as well as a possible down payment, reverse
break up fees (a provision in a merger agreement which requires a payment to the
target company if the financing for an acquisition is not obtained), lock-up or
"no-shop" provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target
acquisitions from "shopping" around for transactions with other companies on
terms more favorable to such target acquisitions), if necessary, to bear the
costs of liquidation if in the event we are unable to effect a business
combination by May 24, 2009. While we do not have any current intention to use
these funds as a down payment or to fund a "no-shop" provision with respect to a
particular proposed business combination, if we were to enter into such a letter
of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target
acquisition, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a
"no-shop" provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific
business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our
forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could
result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or
conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target acquisitions. In
addition to the use of funds described above, we could also use a portion of
these funds to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target
acquisition. We believe that the interest income will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses.

To the extent that our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or
in part as consideration to effect a business combination, or in the event that
indebtedness from third parties is used, in whole or in part, as consideration
to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which
are not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the
combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be
used as working capital to finance our operations. In the event that third party
indebtedness is used as consideration, our officers and directors would not be
personally liable for the repayment of such indebtedness.

We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a business 
combination, either because the consideration for the business combination is 
less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of the 
consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In such event,
the proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance our operations, which may include the target
business(es) that we acquire on the business combination, to effect other
acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined by our board of directors at
that time. We may use these funds, among other things, for director and officer
compensation, change-in-control payments or payments to affiliates, to finance
the operations of the target acquisition, to make other acquisitions and to
pursue our growth strategy.

In the event that third party indebtedness is used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering, our officers and directors would be personally liable
for the repayment of such indebtedness. Our officers and directors have advanced
to us a total of $275,000, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of
this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fees, NASD
registration fees, AMEX application and listing fees, blue sky filing fees and
legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on
the earlier of January 31, 2008, or the consummation of this offering. The loan
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not held in trust.

The proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trust agent only in United
States "government securities" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 with a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940. Although the rate of interest to be earned on 
the trust account will fluctuate through the duration of the trust account, and
although we are unable to state the exact amount of time it will take to 
complete a business combination, we anticipate the interest that will accrue on
the trust account, even at an interest rate of 4% (up to $2,250,000 interest 
income, net of taxes payable on all interest income earned on the trust 
account), during the time it will take to identify a target and complete an 
acquisition will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. While 
we cannot assure you the trust account will yield this rate, we believe such 
rate is representative of that which we may receive. By restricting the 
investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed
an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Notwithstanding our belief that we are not required to comply with the 
requirements of such act, we will not liquidate and distribute the trust account 
to holders of our common stock sold in this offering until after our existence 
terminates by operation of law on May 24, 2009 and, consequently, we may be 
deemed to be an investment company and thus required to comply with such act. 
The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this 
period that is not otherwise returned to public stockholders who vote against a 
business combination will be used to defray our general and administrative 
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and 
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business 
combination is completed. We do not believe that the fees and expenses for due 
diligence, legal, accounting, acquisition, down payment, lock-up or other 
activities related to this offering or our business combination will exceed 
$2,500,000 in the aggregate, comprised of $250,000 of net proceeds not held in 
trust plus up to $2,250,000 of net interest income. Based upon the experience of
the members of our board and consultation with them regarding a reasonable 
budget for consummating a transaction of this kind and nature, and a review of 
budgets publicly disclosed by blank-check companies, we determined that this was
an appropriate approximation of the expenses. If costs are higher than expected
we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due 
diligence with respect to, any potential target acquisitions. In such case, we 
would need to obtain additional funds from our initial stockholders or another 
source to continue operations. We believe that, upon consummation of this 
offering, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the 
next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during 
that time.

Commencing April 9, 2007 and for 38 months thereafter, we will pay a monthly
fee of approximately $8,000 for office space in the Houston metropolitan area.
The landlord for the lease is Gateway Ridgecrest, Inc. As part of the
negotiation, the landlord required a 38 month lease term if we were to secure
the lease for the space. In the event that a business combination is not
approved within 24 months, Paul Bragg has agreed to assume personally the
responsibility for the balance of the lease payments for the remaining fourteen
months. We will also seek to obtain administrative services including
secretarial support from unaffiliated third parties at prevailing market rates.
We have no arrangement with Vanderbilt Interests, LLC and we do not currently
anticipate any requirement for its services. The only obligation for space as of
the date of prospectus is with Gateway Ridgecrest, Inc. No compensation of any
kind (including finders, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any
of our existing officers, directors or stockholders, or any of their affiliates,
prior to, or for any services that they render in order to effectuate, or in
connection with the consummation of the business combination. However, such
persons will receive reimbursement, subject to board approval, for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target acquisitions, performing business
due diligence on suitable target acquisitions and business combinations, as well
as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target acquisitions to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses
will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated in
the above table to "Legal, accounting and other expenses," "Due diligence of 
prospective target acquisitions" and "Working capital." Since the role of 
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a 
business combination.

A public stockholder (but not our founding stockholders with respect to any
shares of our common stock owned by them immediately before this offering or
purchased in the private placement) will be entitled to receive funds from the
trust account (including interest earned on such stockholder's portion of the
trust account, net of taxes payable and amounts disbursed for working capital
purposes) only in the event of our liquidation of the trust account as part of
our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combination, or if such
public stockholder converts his shares of common stock into cash in connection
with a business combination that the public stockholder voted against and which
we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Founding
stockholders, directors and officers are not entitled to convert any of their
shares of common stock acquired prior to this offering, in this offering, after
this offering or in the private placement into a pro rata share of the trust
account.

Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters' discount held in trust excluding any accrued interest thereon. In
the event that we are unable to consummate a business combination and the
trustee is forced to liquidate the trust account, the underwriters have agreed
that: (i) they will forfeit any rights or claims to such proceeds and any
accrued interest thereon; and (ii) the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters' discount will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the public
stockholders along with any accrued interest thereon.


We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies and
other entities, domestic and international, competing for the type of businesses
that we may intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well
established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly
or indirectly, acquisitions of energy related and oilfield services businesses.
Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources,
or more local industry knowledge, than we do and our financial resources will be
relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Our
ability to compete with respect to large acquisitions will be limited by our
available financial resources, giving a competitive advantage to other acquirers
with greater resources.

    Our competitors may adopt transaction structures similar to ours, which
would decrease our competitive advantage in offering flexible transaction terms.
In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for
suitable investment properties, assets and entities may increase, resulting in
increased demand and increased prices paid for such investments. If we pay
higher prices for a target business, our profitability may decrease and we may
experience a lower return on our investments. Increased competition may also
preclude us from acquiring those properties, assets and entities that would
generate the most attractive returns to us.

    Further, the following may not be viewed favorably by certain target
acquisitions:

         •our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination
          or obtain the necessary financial information to be included in the
          proxy statement to be sent to stockholders in connection with such
          business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a
          transaction;

         •our obligation to convert into cash shares of common stock held by our
          public stockholders in certain instances may reduce the resources
          available to us for a business combination;

         •the requirement to acquire assets or an operating business that has a
          fair market value equal to at least 80% of our net assets held in
          trust (net of taxes and excluding the amount held in the trust account
          representing a portion of the underwriters' discount) at the time of
          the acquisition could require us to acquire several assets or closely
          related operating businesses at the same time, all of which sales
          would be contingent on the closings of the other sales, which could
          make it more difficult to consummate the business combination; and

         •our outstanding warrants and unit purchase option, and the potential
          future dilution they represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain
          target businesses.

    If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all
likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target acquisition. We
cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the
resources or ability to compete effectively.


Company Description
We are a blank check company organized under the laws of the State of
Delaware on September 8, 2006. We were formed to acquire, through a merger,
capital stock exchange, asset or stock acquisition, exchangeable share
transaction, joint venture or other similar business combination, one or


 more
businesses in the oilfield services industry. To date, our efforts have been
limited to organizational activities. We do not have any specific business
combination under consideration, nor have we had any discussions with any target
business regarding a possible business combination.

    Our executive officers and directors have extensive experience in the energy
industry as managers, principals or directors of worldwide energy companies. In
addition, they collectively comprise a formidable pool of expertise covering the
key areas of the energy industry, with experience in negotiating and structuring
transactions in the areas in which we will attempt to compete. Our officers and
directors have extensive experiencing in identifying, negotiating with and
conducting due diligence on companies targeted for acquisition in the energy
industry. For example, during their employment at Pride International, Inc. from
1993 through 2005, Messrs. Bragg, O'Leary, Estrada and Guiscardo were involved
in the acquisition of approximately 30 oilfield services companies. Transactions
ranged in size from several million dollars to greater than $750 million.
Additionally these individuals negotiated for and managed the construction of
new assets at an aggregate cost of approximately $2 billion during their
employment at Pride International, Inc. Prior to the consummation of a business
combination, we intend to leverage the industry experience of our executive
officers, including their extensive contacts, relationships and access to
acquisition opportunities, by focusing our efforts on identifying a prospective
target business or businesses in the oilfield services industry and negotiating
the terms of such transaction. We will not consider or seek business
opportunities in industries other than in the oilfield services industry.

    Subsequent to the consummation of a business combination, we believe that
the strengths of our management team, particularly their extensive operations
experience in the energy industry, will be valuable with respect to operating
any business we may acquire.

    According to the Energy Information Administration, demand for energy in the
global economy will increase from 421 Quadrillion Btu in 2003 to 665 Quadrillion
Btu in 2025. According to Spears & Associates, worldwide spending in the
oilfield services sector is scheduled to increase from $198 billion in 2006 to
$236 billion in 2007. Since our plan is to identify and acquire businesses in
this sector, opportunities for growth will be key factors in the ultimate
execution of our business plan. Our targeted businesses may include one or more
companies that are engaged in:

         •Oil and gas contract drilling services. This includes companies that
          provide conventional and horizontal contract drilling services to
          exploration and production companies to include land-based and
          offshore drilling rigs in both U.S. and international markets, rig
          management services to include technical drilling assistance and
          personnel and rig repair and maintenance services.

         •Other well services. This includes drilling and completion fluids,
          well logging and other wireline services, measurement-while-drilling
          and logging-while-drilling services, well stimulation, casing
          services, coiled tubing services, well engineering and project
          management and well testing services.

         •Manufacturing, selling and distributing oilfield services and
          products. This includes companies that manufacture, sell and
          distribute products and perform services that are used in the drilling
          and completion of new oil and gas wells and the maintenance of 
          existing wells.

         •Seismic acquisition and reservoir imaging. This includes companies
          that acquire, process, interpret and market geophysical information
          that provides 2D and 3D images of the subsurface as well as 4D surveys
          on a contract basis to a single client or on a multi-client basis
          where the data is licensed to multiple clients.

         •Marine transportation and supply. This includes companies that employ
          offshore support vessels to transport materials, supplies and
          personnel and to position drilling structures.

         •Oil and gas exploration. This includes companies engaged in the
          exploration for new oil and gas wells, as well as drilling and
          completion activities in mature fields.

    We do not have any specific business combination under consideration and we
have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target
acquisition or had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to such a
transaction. From the period prior to our formation through the date of this
prospectus, there have been no communications or discussions between any of our
officers and directors and any of their potential contacts or relationships
regarding a potential business combination. Additionally, we have not, nor has
anyone on our behalf, taken any measure, directly or indirectly, to identify or
locate any suitable acquisition candidate, nor have we engaged or retained any
agent or other representative to identify or locate any such acquisition
candidate. If we are unable to consummate a business combination within the
allotted time periods set forth in this prospectus and in our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation, we will liquidate our trust account and
any other assets to our public stockholders. While we may seek to effect
business transactions with more than one target acquisition, our business
combination must be with a target acquisition (or acquisitions) whose fair
market value is at least equal to 80% of our net assets held in trust (net of
taxes and amounts disbursed for working capital purposes and excluding the
amount held in the trust account representing a portion of the underwriters'
discount) at the time of such acquisition. Consequently, initially we may have
the ability to complete only a single business combination, although this may
entail our acquisition of one or more individual assets, properties or entities.

    In the event we ultimately determine to simultaneously acquire several
assets or properties and such assets or properties are owned by different
sellers, we may need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase is
contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may
make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business
combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks,
including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple
negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers)
and the additional risks associated with the subsequent integration of the
multiple assets or properties into a single operating entity.

    Our business combination may take the form of a joint venture wherein we
acquire less than a 100% ownership interest in certain properties, assets or
entities. In such case, the remaining ownership interest may be held by third
parties who may or may not have been involved with the properties, assets or
entities prior to our acquisition of such ownership interest. With a joint
venture, we will face additional risks, including the additional costs and time
required to investigate and otherwise conduct due diligence on potential joint
venture partners and to negotiate joint venture agreements. Moreover, the
subsequent management and control of a joint venture will entail risks
associated with multiple owners and decision makers. We may further seek to
acquire a target acquisition that has a fair market value significantly in
excess of 80% of our net assets held in trust (net of taxes and amounts
disbursed for working capital purposes and excluding the amount held in the
trust account representing a portion of the underwriters' discount). In order to
do so, we may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt
or equity securities, and the Company may effect a business combination using
the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust
account. In the case of a business combination funded with assets other than the
trust assets, the proxy materials disclosing the business combination for which
we would seek stockholder approval would disclose the terms of the financing as
well and, if required by law or by regulation of the American Stock Exchange, we
would seek stockholder approval of such financing. In the absence of a
requirement by law or a regulation of the American Stock Exchange (for example,
if such financing involves the issuance of common stock or securities
convertible into common stock which could result in an increase in our
outstanding common stock of 20% or more), we would not seek separate stockholder
approval of such financing inasmuch as the financing portion of any business
combination would be disclosed in the proxy materials and would be a
consideration of the stockholder approval process for the business combination
under consideration. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds
privately or through loans that would allow us to acquire a company with a fair
market value in an amount greater than 80% of our net assets held in trust at
the time of the acquisition. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement
or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional
funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
