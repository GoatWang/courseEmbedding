Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

	 to company executives and removing various materials from the premises.
	 A spokesperson for the FBI said that the agents were conducting “law
	 enforcement activity” but declined further comment. No charges have
	 yet been filed.

News of the FBI raid sent shares of UDF’s largest fund, United Development
	 Funding IV, plummeting 54%.
Potential Problems Revealed

	Just two days before the FBI raid,
	The Wall Street Journal published an article highlighting potential problems with UDF IV’s
	 concentrated lending practices. According to the article, although UDF
	 operates in North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida, 99% of the UDF
	 IV fund’s portfolio consists of loans made to borrowers in Texas.
	 The article further states that 67% of the balance of UDF IV loans was
	 made to a single borrower, Texas-based Centurion American Development,
	 or Centurion’s affiliates.

In December 2015, a Dallas hedge fund publicly raised questions about UDF
	 on an Internet site. Among the allegations raised by the hedge fund was
	 that UDF had used new investor money to repay investors in UDF’s
	 earlier investment vehicles “consistent with a Ponzi scheme.”
What To Do Next
The lawyers at Meyer Wilson have represented approximately 1,000 investors
	 over the last 15 years and have recovered tens of millions of dollars
	 on their behalf. If you invested money in United Development Funding through
	 the recommendation of a brokerage firm and lost money in those investments,
	 contact the lawyers at Meyer Wilson to discuss your potential recovery
	 options. You might be able to recover your losses against the brokerage
	 firm that sold you the investments. Initial consultations are free and
	 all of our cases are handled on a contingency fee basis.

I had spoken to a local attorney about my investment losses and he didn't know how to help me, so he referred me to David Meyer. David and his staff were not only professional, but they were also really congenial and pleasant to speak with. Any time I had a question they were always responsive and made sure I understood each step in the process of recovering my losses. My overall experience was positive and I would encourage anyone who even thinks they have been a victim of stockbroker misconduct to call David.

					- S.T.,Canton, Ohio
				

Meyer Wilson represented me in a suit brought last year against my brokerage firm, securing a very fair and equitable settlement for me. I was impressed with the professional manner in which they handled our relationship and kept me aware of developments in the case. I highly recommend them.

					- R.G., M.D.,Cincinnati, Ohio
				





I rolled over my retirement account to my stockbroker when I retired and trusted him to provide me an investment plan that would cover my living expenses and protect my life savings. He sold me a variable annuity and controlled how my retirement was invested in the stock market. I relied on him totally as the expert and I ended up losing a big portion of my savings. I was referred to Meyer Wilson to file my arbitration claim against the brokerage firm. Mr. Meyer and his associates and staff were great to work with. They explained everything to me, walked me through each stage of the arbitration, worked hard to prepare my case, and I am very happy with the outcome.

					- L.B.,Tennessee
				

I really appreciate all of the efforts of the legal team at Meyer & Associates. They were very prompt in responding to me and answering my questions, often the same day. I am happy I received the highest settlement that I think was possible. Thanks for a job exceptionally well done!

					- J.H.,Indiana
				





When the financial advisor we trusted with our life savings lost all of it in the stock market we did not know where to go for help. Fortunately, we found the law firm of Meyer & Associates. They aggressively pursued the brokerage firm responsible and we were delighted with the outcome. We don't know what we would have done without the lawyers and staff at Meyer & Associates - we will always be thankful for what they did for us.

					- Mr. and Mrs. H.,Ohio
				

I am thankful I had the opportunity to work with you and get to know you. Our family cannot thank you enough for the outstanding work you and your firm did to win our case. Your passion, commitment and compassion to win this case for our family were simply amazing. After going to several other attorneys who would not even take the case I was so fortunate to have found you to take the case. Right from the start you had the passion and desire to win this case for us. I have never worked with an attorney or firm as compassionate as yours. I would highly recommend your firm to anyone.

					- G.A.
				





My husband and I needed a law firm with expertise in financial investment fraud, and Meyer Wilson handled everything for us. We were very glad to find Meyer Wilson. Their entire staff made us fill that we were part of the Meyer Wilson Family.

					- A.H.
				

When our broker lost a large portion of our retirement savings, we didn't know where to turn and thought we would just have to accept that we were left with nothing.
We saw an article about Attorney David Meyer and called his office. We were not used to dealing with attorneys and didn't know what to expect, but Mr. Meyer and his staff were kind and kept us well informed about our rights. We were very satisfied with the results they were able to get for us and the short length of time it took to have some of our losses returned. Having the money reinvested has definitely made life easier for us.

					- A.W.,Ohio
				





I was a business litigation attorney for approximately 30 years and practiced law with one of largest law firms in the nation. I have been involved in many large, complex cases, and I believe I have a reasonable understanding of how lawyers and law firms should go about their work.
Everything that David P. Meyer and Associates did for me in connection with my securities arbitration claim was done in a first class manner, much as I would expect from the best large law firms. It has been my pleasure to have dealt with David Meyer and I strongly recommend his firm to anyone who has a potential investment misconduct claim.

					- R.S., Esq.,California
				

At a time in our life when we thought life would be easier because we had worked hard and carefully planned and saved for our "Golden Years", we discovered our stockbroker had lost our entire life's savings. We thought there was no hope of recovering any of it. That's when we were referred to David Meyer and Associates. Mr. Meyer and his staff explained the arbitration process and gave us hope. Thanks to their hard work, the arbitration and settlement process put us back on track. They were a Godsend when we needed them most.

					- S.W.,Kentucky
				





I accepted an early retirement from my large employer after more than 30 years, based on the recommendation of my stockbroker that I had plenty of money to live on. I put every dollar I had into my stockbroker's hand and trusted him and his brokerage firm. As the months went by, I was losing money at a alarming rate and I soon found out that many of my co-workers were losing their retirement savings with the same brokerage firm. I do not remember how I heard about David Meyer & Associates but they came to be my knight in shining armor. Hiring Mr. Meyer's law firm was probably the smartest thing I've done in my life. Dozens of my co-workers hired them too. It took some time to get through the process but David and his firm did a great job for all of us. I can honestly say that I would probably be back to working 40 hours a week again, if not for David's success with our claims.
There's an old saying, "You can't take on City Hall"; well, David did better than that - he took on this large brokerage firm......and won! I have nothing but the highest praise for David Meyer and his staff of very qualified people.

					- R.H.,Ohio
				

"We had never participated in any type of lawsuit before, but after our stockbroker mishandled our investments and nearly lost all of the money it took us over thirty years to save, we felt we needed to do something. We hired Mr. Meyer and he went to bat for us against the brokerage firm. The staff at David Meyer and Associates communicated with us regularly as they led us through the process of recovering our losses. They were always helpful and we felt well served by them. Not knowing what to expect, we were pleased with how fast we were able to obtain a recovery. Hiring Mr. Meyer to help us recover our losses has made retirement easier for us."

					- J.R.,Kentucky
				





I, and many of my coworkers, retired after 30+ years of employment and rolled over our lump-sum retirement to a national brokerage firm. The broker we entrusted with our life savings failed to protect our nest egg and we lost a big portion of our retirement. A group of us all hired David Meyer & Associates to hold the brokerage firm accountable for not investing our retirement properly. Mr. Meyer and his firm got a great result for us and we are now able to enjoy our retirement.

					- B.H.,Texas
				

My husband and I hired a financial planner to ensure the safety of our retirement nest egg, but he lost most of that money through a series of investments that were inappropriate for people at our stage in life. After my husband passed, I didn't know where to turn and had even spoken to a local attorney that did not think there was anything I could even do. I felt like the situation was my fault for trusting the broker. I heard about David Meyer & Associates and he and his staff let me know what my rights were and that there was hope through the arbitration process. They took care of everything and I was surprised at how easy they made it for me to pursue a claim. Mr. Meyer and his staff was always professional and responsive to my calls and they really took their time with me to review paperwork and mad sure that I remained well informed throughout the process. I feel like Mr. Meyer not only helped me to recover my investment losses, but he also helped me to get justice for my late husband.

					- J.S.,Ohio
				





Mr. Meyer was able to help me recover losses from my retirement account that occurred when my stockbroker failed to invest my IRA properly for someone at my stage in life. As they handled my case, Mr. Meyer and his staff were always available to answer my questions and they were responsive to my needs. I felt as if they really cared about me and my situation and I was impressed with their professionalism.

					- L. M.,Florida
				

I trusted my brokerage firm that I have been with for years with money that my father had intended to be invested in safe, secure investments to provide for my mother's living expenses after his passing as well as for his family members. The brokerage firm recommended an investment that was later found to be invested in securities different than had been represented. I was very pleased with the results that Meyer and Associates were able to obtain for me and my family.

					- J.F.,Indiana
				





I was angry when my retirement savings were mismanaged by my stockbroker. I knew I had lost most of my hard-earned money, but I was unsure of what, if anything, I could do about it. My daughter-in-law had heard of Mr. Meyer's law firm so I gave them a call. They supplied me with the information I needed to know about my rights as an investor and why I had a claim to recover some of my losses from the brokerage firm. I was very much impressed with the way they handled my claim and pleased with the result they were able to get for me. It was well worth the call.

					- G.C.,Tennessee
				

I was very pleased with Mr. Meyer’s handing of my arbitration claim. Throughout the process, I felt that I was treated with respect and I always appreciated the extra effort David Meyer and his staff put forth to recover the money my stockbroker had lost. I never felt my relationship with David was limited to an attorney-client relationship. I always thought it was more like a friend helping another friend. They did a tremendous job and when it was over, David was able to get back a lot more money for me than I ever expected. I have kept the firm’s number handy and would tell anyone that has been a victim of stockbroker misconduct to contact Meyer and Associates.

					- C.F.,Ohio
				





We were devastated when our long-time stockbroker inexcusably caused our company's pension plan and profit sharing plans to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in unsuitable investments in just 3 short years with two different brokerage firms. Thankfully, our accountant had heard of Meyer & Associates and referred us to Mr. Meyer for help. Mr. Meyer understood that our employees were the real victims, and he dedicated himself to making the brokerage firms put as much money back into our coffers as possible. I urge anyone who thinks they have been wronged by their stockbroker or brokerage firm to seek the advice of Meyer & Associates - I am so thankful that I did.

					- M.F.,Ohio
				

Our brokerage firm recommended that we mortgage our paid-off home and then convinced us to invest the loan proceeds into unsuitable annuities. The results were devastating. We never imagined that we would be retired, with limited income, and find ourselves faced with a new mortgage payment and large investment losses. Thankfully, we hired Meyer Wilson - they skillfully guided us through the NASD (now FINRA) arbitration process and achieved an outstanding recovery for us. We do not know what we would have done without their help.

					- Mr. and Mrs. R.,Springfield, Ohio
				





From my first call to the firm to the final communication with them was a remarkable experience. The staff listened to my situation with care and concern through our entire journey. I entered with the dark shadow of fear of the unknown and Meyer Wilson walked me through my doubt and fears back into the light of reality and satisfaction. I cannot put into words the sense of security I felt while dealing with my case. The firm exemplifies professionalism in every phase of my journey through the legal system. Thank you Meyer Wilson for your council and support.

					- K.P.,Idaho
				

My wife and I became victims in a ponzi scheme set up by our financial adviser, one we had worked with for many years. He was working with a legitimate investment firm and we had no reason to believe we were being taken. He also covered his tracks very well and even his company was unaware of what he was doing. We tried to recover our losses for over a year but were unsuccessful and every road was a dead end. We heard about Meyer Wilson and contacted them for help. They worked with us extensively over the next months and they were able to recover a large amount of our lost investment. They were in contact with us throughout the whole process and kept us informed of where we stood and what we needed to do. I can't stress enough how much we appreciate all that they have done for us and what a blessing it was to find them. They come highly recommended and you would do well to contact them for assistance.

					- M.L.
				





Meyer & Associates pursued my securities arbitration case with great care and attention. They covered every detail and I am ecstatic about the results. As a lawyer myself, I can appreciate how hard they worked on my behalf. I recommend Meyer & Associates highly and without any reservation.

					- C. Hostler, Esq.,West Virginia
				

I think this is the first time I have used a law firm to resolve issues
 with regard to what I felt was a serious breach of trust and negative
 performance from a financial manager. From the moment I contacted MeyerWilson,
 I was always treated with what felt like genuine respect and real interest
 in my situation. I had some changes of personnel during it all, but the
 new people were equally respectful and competent which made everything
 feel seamless. Being my first time to work with a law firm on this type
 of issue I was constantly surprises at both the competence, skills, respect,
 thoroughness, and the pleasant ease the experience was. I highly recommend
 both the firm and their unusually qualified and helpful people working there.

					- D.G.,Salt Lake City, UT
				





The case I brought to Meyer Wilson involved more of an ethical injustice
	 and had many legal hurdles. Despite this, Mr. Chad Kohler, Esq., explained
	 thoroughly all aspects of my case, advised me using his expertise, and
	 guided me through a mediation process resulting in a satisfactory settlement.
	 Had it not been for the representation of Meyer Wilson, and in particular,
	 Mr. Kohler, I would have never had a resolution.

					- V.B.
				

My experience with Meyer Wilson proved to be a very professional, as well
	 as, personal interaction. Chad Kohler represented my case with the caring
	 and realistic guidance needed to attain a satisfactory resolution during
	 mediation. I appreciate the personal interest and legal expertise he and
	 his staff offered me during a difficult time. I was able to make an informed
	 decision and feel that with the help of Meyer Wilson my case was resolved
	 with the best possible outcome.

	 attorneys and our passionate commitment to clients' needs are evident
	 in every successful resolution we've obtained, and we are intent on
	 building upon our record of success.





Disclaimer: Results are specific to the facts and legal circumstances of each client's
	 case and should not be used to form an expectation that the same results
	 could be obtained for clients in similar matters without reference to
	 the specific factual and legal circumstances of each client's case.







$30,000,000 Recovered in Confidential Settlement for 100-Year-Old-Widow
David Meyer, founding partner at Meyer Wilson, represented a 100-year-old
 widow in an investment fraud case against multiple large financial institutions.
 The case resulted in $30,000,000 recovered in a confidential settlement
 on behalf of the widow. This covers 100% of the widow's losses.

Retirees Recover in Excess of $10,000,000 of Retirement Losses
Meyer Wilson represented more than 75 Midwest retirees against their brokerage
	 firm who lost a substantial portion of the retirees' life savings.
	 The clients collectively received more than $10,000,000 in a settlement.





$6,500,000 Recovered for a Large Group of Individual Investors
Recovery against a major national brokerage firm for a group of over 100
	 individual investors throughout the country in FINRA arbitrations alleging
	 losses stemming from mortgage backed securities.

$5,000,000 Recovered for Group of Midwest Clients
Meyer Wilson represented more than 50 families in the Midwest who suffered
	 dramatic losses in their investment accounts and recovered in excess of
	 $5,000,000 from the brokerage firm in a settlement prior to the FINRA
	 arbitration hearings.





Meyer Wilson Recovers More than $3,800,000 for Elderly Victim in Ponzi Scheme Case
Meyer Wilson recovered more than $3,800,000 for an elderly victim of a
	 Ponzi scheme in case involving claims that the financial institution ignored
	 many red flags.

$3,200,000 of Losses Recovered by Meyer Wilson for More Than 50 Families of Ponzi Scheme in California
Victims of a large-scale Ponzi Scheme in Northern California recovered
	 $3,200,000 of their investment losses through a settlement of several
	 FINRA arbitration cases pursued by Meyer Wilson. The case was filed against
	 the brokerage firm that was responsible for supervising the broker who
	 committed the fraud.





$3,200,000+ Recovered for Elderly Ponzi Scheme Victim
Meyer Wilson recovered more than $3.2 million for an elderly victim of
 a Ponzi scheme in a case involving claims that the financial institution
 ignored many red flags.

$3,100,000 Recovered for 35 Families in Northeast Ohio

	 notes" sold by a broker registered with the brokerage firm.





Twenty Retirees Recover $3,000,000 in Losses
Meyer Wilson represented 20 Midwest families who lost more than 90% of
	 their investments and recovered $3,000,000 from the brokerage firm responsible.

Retired Physician Recovers $2,500,000 Against Major Wall Street Firm Prior to Filing FINRA Arbitration
Meyer Wilson was successful in negotiating a investment fraud recovery
	 of $2,500,000 for a retired physician after his financial advisor falsified
	 documents and traded in the investment accounts without authorization.
	 The settlement obtained by Meyer Wilson against the brokerage firm represented
	 an amount in excess of the client's actual investment losses and the
	 case was resolved on a "pre-filing" basis, meaning the settlement
	 was reached before filing a FINRA arbitration.





Nine Families in Florida Recover $1,800,000
Nine families in Florida hired Meyer & Associates to pursue losses
	 against a large brokerage firm involving unlicensed securities sold by
	 a registered stockbroker.

Ponzi Scheme Recovery of $650,000
A Colorado-based brokerage firm agreed to pay $650,000 to two Meyer Wilson
	 clients (a California doctor and his daughter) who invested in what turned
	 out to be a longstanding Ponzi scheme operated by their broker. The clients
	 believed that they were investing in secured note funds. In reality, the
	 note funds were a sham, and the broker used the clients’ money to
	 fund a lavish lifestyle that included airplanes, a boat, and various cars
	 and motorcycles. The broker ultimately pleaded guilty to various federal
	 charges and was sentenced to 6.5 years in prison. The brokerage firm agreed
	 to settle the claims even though it alleged that it was unaware of the
	 broker’s misconduct and despite the fact that the daughter did not
	 open a brokerage account with the firm.





Retired Widow Recovers $530,000 of Life Savings after Unapproved Securities Sales
A 78-year-old retired woman recovered $530,000 of her lost retirement money
	 after the securities fraud attorneys at Meyer Wilson filed claims against
	 two independent broker-dealers who sold the unapproved securities.

68-year-old Retired Physician Recovers $500,000 Against Brokerage Firm in Ponzi Scheme
After suffering devastating investment losses in a Ponzi scheme, the California
	 retiree hired Meyer Wilson to pursue claims against the brokerage firm
	 that was responsible for supervision its financial advisor who ran the
	 scheme. Meyer Wilson negotiated a settlement for the investor in the amount
	 of $500,000.





Meyer Wilson Recovers $425,000 on Behalf of Michigan Ponzi Scheme Victims
Meyer Wilson negotiated settlements on behalf of two separate clients who
	 were victimized by a Ponzi scheme perpetuated by their former stockbroker.
	 The scheme involved the sale of sham investments and the improper wiring

Meyer Wilson successfully settled claims against a brokerage firm for $345,000
	 that were brought on behalf of an elderly Michigan couple relating to

	 forged transfer forms, generated phony investment certificates, and transferred
	 money directly from the clients’ investment accounts to third-party
	 bank accounts that the broker owned or controlled. The settlement amount
	 paid by the brokerage firm reflected over 98% of the money that was directly
	 withdrawn from the clients’ brokerage accounts by the broker.

$245,000 Recovered for 89-year-old Woman
An 89-year-old woman recovered nearly a quarter million of lost retirement
	 money after Meyer Wilson filed a claim on her behalf against her brokerage
	 firm. The firm's registered representative fraudulently sold her a
	 whole life insurance policy as part of an overall investment scheme that
	 caused her significant losses and was wholly unsuitable. The money recovered
	 was a significant portion of the investments she made into the insurance
	 policy. The attorneys at Meyer Wilson were able to successfully defeat
	 the brokerage firm's motion to dismiss, which argued that claims were
	 not appropriate since the life insurance policy was not a security. The
	 arbitration panel agreed with Meyer Wilson, which argued that the life
	 insurance policy was part of an overall investment strategy recommended
	 to the claimant by her financial adviser.

Ponzi Scheme Losses Returned to California Victims
Meyer Wilson represented a group of individuals who were victims of a Ponzi
	 scheme operated by a financial adviser in California. The broker was affiliated
	 with a large independent broker-dealer during the time he sold numerous

	 in real property. Many brokerage firms sell TICs to their customers as
	 a way to purportedly invest in commercial real estate ventures like shopping
	 malls. Meyer Wilson's claims focused on the brokerage firm's failure
	 to conduct proper due diligence and misrepresentations made by the brokerage
	 firm's registered representatives downplaying the substantial risks
	 that TICs involve.

Retired Cincinnati Couple Recovers $180,000 in Churning Case
Meyer Wilson successfully settled claims on behalf of a husband and wife
	 who were the victims of a long-time churning scheme perpetuated by their
	 stockbroker involving unit investment trusts (UITs). UITs are similar
	 to mutual funds and intended to be long-term investments, but the broker
	 in this case frequently purchased and held UITs in the customers'
	 accounts customers for only a few months at a time before selling and
	 purchasing different UITs, generating a commission on each purchase and
	 sale. The final settlement negotiated by Meyer Wilson represented a substantial
	 portion of the clients' overall losses.

Meyer Wilson Wins FINRA Arbitration - Brokerage Firm Hilliard Lyons Ordered to Pay $180,000

	 including non-traded real estate investment trusts (REITs). A REIT is
	 a company that owns or finances income-producing real estate. A non-traded

	 firm failed to properly supervise the investment recommendations made
	 by its brokers.

Despite the customer's age and financial situation, the brokerage firm recommended and facilitated the customer investing a substantial portion of his life savings into eight different, highly risky, completely illiquid private placements. Each private placement ultimately failed and suffered substantial losses. In addition to being unsuitable for this particular customer, Meyer Wilson also argued that documents produced by the brokerage firm during the arbitration proved that the brokerage firm and the control person responsible for performing due diligence failed to conduct any meaningful analysis and investigation of the private placements before allowing them to be sold to the brokerage firm's customers.

$650,000 Recovered for Retired Ohio Couple Relating to Whole Life Insurance Policies Sold by Their Financial Advisor
An Ohio financial advisor convinced a retired Ohio couple, both of whom
	 were in their early 70s at the time and completely free of any debt, that
	 to achieve their estate planning goals they needed to take out a $1.2
	 million mortgage on property that they owned to fund three whole life
	 insurance policies. The policies came with combined monthly premiums exceeding
	 $38,500 (or $462,000 per year). The financial advisor assured the couple
	 that the policies would ultimately pay for themselves. About three years
	 later, however, it was apparent that the policies would never work as
	 promised. By that time, the mortgage proceeds were entirely depleted,
	 and the dividends from the policies were still not nearly enough to cover
	 the hefty monthly premiums. Meyer Wilson filed claims on behalf of the
	 couple against the financial advisor’s supervising brokerage firm.
	 The brokerage firm filed a motion to dismiss arguing that it did not have
	 any duty to supervise the sale of whole life insurance. The arbitration
	 panel denied the brokerage firm’s motion. Meyer Wilson ultimately
	 negotiated a settlement recovering nearly all of the couple’s actual losses.





$650,000 Recovered for Investor in Ponzi Scheme
The victim of a large-scale Ponzi scheme in the Midwest recovered $650,000
	 of his investment losses from the brokerage firm responsible for supervising
	 the broker who sold the fraudulent securities. Meyer Wilson filed a FINRA
	 arbitration on behalf of the victim and then negotiated the settlement
	 through the process of mediation by emphasizing all the red flags of the
	 broker’s misconduct that the firm missed in its supervisory responsibilities.

Meyer Wilson successfully settled claims against a law firm and its attorney
	 that were brought in court on behalf of two retirees for the legal malpractice
	 of an attorney attempting to represent them in an investment misconduct
	 case. The attorney had no experience representing investors against brokerage
	 firms and failed to timely file an appropriate action on their behalf.
	 The two retirees then hired Meyer Wilson to represent them. The attorneys
	 at Meyer Wilson were able to successfully argue that the clients’
	 underlying investment misconduct case was straightforward and had significant
	 value. The settlement for these clients reflects what should have happened
	 in the underlying case had the attorney properly and timely brought their
	 claims before a FINRA arbitration panel.





Over $500,000 for Texas Investors
Meyer Wilson successfully negotiated individual settlements on behalf of
	 a group of Texas investors who were each sold unsuitable investments by
	 the same stockbroker. Each investor’s portfolio was heavily concentrated
	 in oil-related stocks and sustained significant losses when the energy
	 markets declined in 2015. Many of the investors were retirees who saw
	 their portfolios decline by 50 percent or more. The brokerage firm agreed
	 to settle all of the investors’ claims within less than six months
	 after the claims were filed by Meyer Wilson.

$450,000 Recovered in Broker Theft Case Involving Large National Brokerage Firm
Meyer Wilson recovered $450,000 on behalf of a developmentally impaired
	 individual who was the victim of theft by her stockbroker. The broker
	 – who was later sentenced to five years in prison for his crimes
	 – orchestrated dozens of money transfers directly from the victim’s
	 brokerage accounts to outside third-party bank accounts that were set
	 up in the victim’s name and over which the broker controlled. From
	 there, the broker stole the victim’s money. Although the victim’s
	 brokerage accounts were entirely depleted within a short three-month timeframe,
	 documents obtained by Meyer Wilson during the course of the case showed
	 that the brokerage firm never made a single compliance inquiry into any
	 of the withdrawals. The brokerage firm agreed to settle the victim’s
	 claims for an amount in excess of the victim’s total losses.





Brokerage Firm Pays $262,500 Relating to Improper Sales of Alternative Investments
A large independent brokerage firm settled with Meyer Wilson clients relating
	 to its improper sale of several private placements and real estate investment
	 trusts. The claims on behalf of these investors focused on the lack of
	 due diligence performed on the recommended products, as well as misrepresentations
	 of the risks (or lack thereof) involved. The couple’s entire life
	 savings was decimated after they agreed to the investment proposal on
	 the belief that it was suitable for them.

A 74-year-old’s savings was wiped out as a result of a highly inappropriate
	 investment plan implemented by his broker in a non-traded equipment leasing
	 fund and a non-traded real estate investment trust. His advisor continued
	 for years to misrepresent the nature and value of the investments, up
	 until the broker was fired from the firm. Meyer Wilson successfully defeated
	 a motion to dismiss by the brokerage firm and negotiated a settlement
	 of $172,500.





Meyer Wilson Settles Case Against Brokerage Firm 30 days After Filing FINRA Arbitration
An investor who suffered a 98% loss of his account while following an investment
	 recommendation to trade on margin recovered $79,000 from the brokerage
	 firm and its owner. The settlement was made within 30 days of filing the
	 FINRA arbitration. The investor had no prior experience investing on margin,
	 nor any knowledge about the risks he was recommended to take.

		Recovering Losses
		Caused By Investment Misconduct





Contingency Fee Basis
No Fee Unless We Win Your Case

	At Meyer Wilson, our
	securities fraud lawyers only work cases on a contingency fee basis, meaning that there is no fee
	 unless a positive recovery is obtained in your case. If and when our legal
	 team is able to win your case and secure financial compensation, attorney
	 fees will be based on an agreed upon percentage or sum. We do not charge
	 a retainer fee or consultation fee and there is no cost for the investigative
	 work we do prior to offering you representation. To put it simply;
	if we don't win, you don't pay.

Why contingent fees?
We choose to work cases on a conditional fee agreement for several reasons,
	 all of which are intended to ultimately benefit the people we serve. As
	 evident by our numerous successful case resolutions and positive client
	 testimonials, our use of contingent fees is another prominent aspect in
	 our firm's ability to satisfy our clients and obtain the results they need.

Focusing on Your Experience 
 We value the trust our clients place in our firm and attorneys, and we
	 reciprocate by doing everything in our power to make their experience
	 with us as smooth and comfortable as possible. We know that when individual
	 and institutional investors come to use after having been bilked by stockbrokers,
	 brokerage firms, and other entities, times can be chaotic. We understand
	 that, in many cases, our clients' livelihoods, professional careers
	 and businesses, and financial futures may be at stake. With these high
	 stakes in mind, we focus on doing our part to alleviate their worries
	 and concerns. At Meyer Wilson, we want you make your legal experience
	 and time with us and rewarding as the results you obtain. Eschewing up-front
	 fees is only one of the ways in which we accomplish this goal.


Leveling the Playing Field 
 From a logistical viewpoint, working your case on a contingency fee basis
	 allows our firm to level the playing field with some of the largest, most
	 financially powerful institutions in the country. Often, our clients'
	 claims involve immensely powerful legal opponents who have access to seemingly
	 limitless resources and powerful legal teams. By pursuing various legal
	 avenues on our own funds, we are not limited by what you are able to pursue
	 had you been required to foot the bill - these powerful entities cannot
	 force you into submission when you have our firm by your side.


Confidence in Our Abilities 
 While we view contingent fees as the ethically and logistically correct
	 avenue to take, we know that they also serve another purpose. They show
	 prospective clients that we are confident in our abilities to
	obtain successful resolutions, recover losses, and win cases. We want our clients to feel that they have the best at work for them
	 and their case, and we believe that our use of contingent fees exemplifies
	 this idea. We put our money where our mouth is and we don't shy away
	 from a challenge.
