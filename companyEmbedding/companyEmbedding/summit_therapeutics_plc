				C. difficile Infection			

Clostridium difficile infection (‘CDI’) is a major healthcare issue in hospitals, long-term care homes, and increasingly in the wider community. It is a serious illness caused by infection of the colon by the bacteria, C. difficile, which produces toxins that cause inflammation, severe diarrhoea and can in the most serious of cases be fatal.

				Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy			

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (‘DMD’) is a fatal, genetic disease that predominantly affects boys. It has a population of around 50,000 in the developed world and is classified as a rare or orphan disease. DMD is caused by the absence of a protein called dystrophin which is essential in maintaining the healthy function of muscles in the body.
Currently there is no disease modifying treatment for all patients with DMD.

Summit Therapeutics plc : 1st Quarter Results




















June 14, 2017 07:01 ET

 | Source: Summit Therapeutics PLC





 Summit Therapeutics plc('Summit', the 'Company' or the 'Group') SUMMIT THERAPEUTICS REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER ENDED 30 APRIL 2017 AND OPERATIONAL PROGRESS Oxford, UK, 14 June 2017 - Summit Therapeutics plc (AIM: SUMM, NASDAQ: SMMT), the drug discovery and development company advancing therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy ('DMD') and C. difficile infection ('CDI'), today reports its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended 30 April 2017. Mr Glyn Edwards, Chief Executive Officer of Summit, commented: "Over the past quarter and in recent months, we have made meaningful advances in both our DMD and CDI programmes to bring these programmes closer to the patients in need. We continue to progress our PhaseOut DMD clinical trial of our lead utrophin modulator, ezutromid, in the treatment of DMD. We achieved a major milestone in the programme with the completion of enrolment into PhaseOut DMD, triggering a $22 million payment from Sarepta. In addition, we have made provisions for patients in the trial to remain on ezutromid beyond the initial 48-weeks of the trial, which will allow us to monitor safety and efficacy data related to longer-term dosing. We look forward to reporting 24-week biopsy, MRI and functional data in the first quarter of 2018 for what could be the first disease modifying treatment for all patients with DMD. "As we continue to prepare our other lead product candidate, ridinilazole, for Phase 3 clinical development, a recent Lancet Infectious Diseases publication highlighted the novel antibiotic's differentiation and promise as a potential treatment for CDI, as evidenced by the Phase 2 CoDIFy clinical data. We believe the robust design of the Phase 3 clinical programme, which has received input from the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, has the potential to underpin ridinilazole as a potential front-line treatment for CDI." Utrophin Modulation Programme for DMD Ezutromid Highlights Completed enrolment into PhaseOut DMD in May 2017. PhaseOut DMD is a 48-week, open label Phase 2 clinical trial that has enrolled 40 patients at sites in the UK and US. The trial aims to establish proof of concept of ezutromid and is evaluating a range of muscle structure, muscle health and functional endpoints.Expecting to report full 24-week data analysis from PhaseOut DMD in Q1 2018. This data set will include 24-week biopsy data from all patients who provide a 24-week biopsy sample (approximately 20). In addition, Summit expects to report 24-week MRI and functional data from all 40 patients in the trial. Top-line data from the complete 48-week clinical trial are expected in Q3 2018. Received support from an Independent Data Monitoring Committee for the extension of PhaseOut DMD following its interim review of safety and tolerability data. The extension phase will allow Summit to continue to gather long-term safety and efficacy data and is expected to last until ezutromid either receives marketing approval in relevant countries or its development is discontinued. In May 2017, Summit received the necessary regulatory approvals for the extension phase. CDI Programme Ridinilazole Highlights Outlined Phase 3 development programme for the novel antibiotic ridinilazole following input from the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency. The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 trials is expected to test for superiority in sustained clinical response compared to vancomycin as the Company seeks to further differentiate ridinilazole from currently marketed CDI treatments and those in late-stage development. Preparation for the Phase 3 clinical trials is ongoing with the trials planned to start H1 2018.Continuing to explore various funding options for the Phase 3 development programme as the Company seeks to maximize the value of ridinilazole. Options include potentially entering into a collaboration with a third party or securing meaningful non-dilutive funding from government entities and philanthropic, non-government and not for profit organisations.Published Phase 2 CoDIFy clinical trial results in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. CoDIFy evaluated ridinilazole against the standard of care antibiotic, vancomycin, for the treatment of CDI. The results showed ridinilazole demonstrated substantial clinical benefit over vancomycin. This included ridinilazole achieving statistical superiority over vancomycin in sustained clinical response, a composite endpoint of cure at the end of treatment and no recurrence 30 days after treatment, a result which was driven by a large numerical reduction in recurrent disease.Planning to report data from an exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating ridinilazole against the antibiotic fidaxomicin later this year. A key objective of the trial is to determine the relative impact on the patients' microbiomes of treatment with ridinilazole compared to fidaxomicin. Operational Strengthened R&D team with Chief Operating Officer Dr David Roblin expanding his role to include serving as Chief Medical Officer and appointments of Dr Anne Heatherington as Head of Clinical Development and Quantitative Sciences and Dr Dave Powell as Head of Research. These appointments, announced in May 2017, will help ensure the Company has the leadership, depth of knowledge and expertise needed to support its clinical and preclinical pipeline. Financial Highlights Cash and cash equivalents at 30 April 2017 of £19.4 million compared to £28.1 million at 31 January 2017.$22 million milestone payment to Summit triggered in May 2017, post the period under review, under the terms of the licence and collaboration agreement with Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. ('Sarepta').Loss for the three months ended 30 April 2017 of £4.8 million compared to a loss of £5.4 million for the three months ended 30 April 2016.

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: the uncertainties inherent in the initiation of future clinical trials, availability and timing of data from ongoing and future clinical trials and the results of such trials, whether preliminary results from a clinical trial will be predictive of the final results of that trial or whether results of early clinical trials will be indicative of the results of later clinical trials, expectations for regulatory approvals, availability of funding sufficient for our foreseeable and unforeseeable operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements and other factors discussed in the "Risk Factors" section of filings that we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended 31 January 2017. In addition, any forward-looking statements included in this press release represent our views only as of the date of this release and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements included in this press release. FINANCIAL REVIEW  Revenue Revenue was £1.7 million for the three months ended 30 April 2017 compared to £nil for the three months ended 30 April 2016. This increase resulted from the exclusive licence and collaboration agreement entered into with Sarepta in October 2016, from which the Company received an upfront payment of £32.8 million ($40 million). Of this amount £4.0 million in the aggregate has been recognised to date. The remaining £28.8 million of the upfront payment is classified as deferred revenue and will continue to be recognised as revenue over the development period.  Other Operating Income There were no sources of other operating income during the three months ended 30 April 2017 compared to £0.06 million recognised during the three months ended 30 April 2016. The decrease is due to the Company's withdrawal from the Innovate UK funding agreement in September 2016 in order to enable the Company to take advantage of more tax efficient opportunities related to research and development expenditure. Operating Expenses Research and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses increased by £0.2 million to £5.0 million for the three months ended 30 April 2017 from £4.8 million for the three months ended 30 April 2016. The increase is driven by an overall increase in investment in the DMD programme of £0.7 million and an increase of £0.1 million in research and development related staffing costs offset by a decrease in CDI clinical programme related activities of £0.6 million. General and Administration ExpensesGeneral and administration expenses increased by £1.0 million to £2.4 million for the three months ended 30 April 2017 from £1.4 million for the three months ended 30 April 2016. This increase was primarily due to a net negative movement of £0.5 million in exchange rate variance, an increase of £0.3 million in staff related costs and an increase of £0.2 million in legal and professional fees. Finance CostsFollowing an International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee agenda decision in May 2016 on the application of International Accounting Standards 20 'Government Grants,' the Company has changed its accounting policy regarding charitable funding arrangements from the Wellcome Trust and US not for profit organisations for the year ended 31 January 2017. See Note 1 - 'Change in accounting policy' below. This change in accounting policy has been reflected retrospectively in the comparative financial statements for the three months ended 30 April 2016. Finance costs relate to the subsequent re-measurement of the financial liability recognised in respect of income arrangements and the unwinding of the discounts associated with the liabilities. Finance costs remained consistent at £0.2 million for the three months ended 30 April 2017 and for the three months ended 30 April 2016 (adjusted).  Cash Flows Operating ActivitiesNet cash used in operating activities for the three months ended 30 April 2017 was £8.0 million compared to £6.4 million for the three months ended 30 April 2016. This movement of £1.6 million was driven by an increase in research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses during the three months ended 30 April 2017. Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities for the three months ended 30 April 2017 was £0.3 million compared to £4,000 for the three months ended 30 April 2016. This includes the net amount of bank interest received on cash deposits less amounts paid to acquire property, plant and equipment. During the three months ended 30 April 2017, the Group relocated its UK offices. Financing ActivitiesNet cash inflow from financing activities for the three months ended 30 April 2017 of £0.01 million relates to proceeds from the exercise of warrants and the exercise of share options. For the three months ended 30 April 2016, the Company received proceeds of £0.1 million from the exercise of warrants.  Financial position As at 30 April 2017, total cash and cash equivalents were £19.4 million compared to £28.1 million at 31 January 2017. Due to the recognition of deferred revenue associated with the Sarepta agreement and the recognition of a financial liability on funding arrangements resulting from a change in accounting policy, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position continues to be in a net liability position.

Basis of accounting The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of Summit and its subsidiaries (the 'Group') for the three months ended 30 April 2017 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ('IFRIC') interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS including those applicable to accounting periods ending 31 January 2018 and the accounting policies set out in Summit's consolidated financial statements. They do not include all the statements required for full annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Group as at 31 January 2017 (the '2017 Accounts'). The 2017 Accounts, on which the Company's auditors delivered an unqualified audit report, will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies following the 2017 Annual General Meeting.  The interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention. Whilst the financial information included in this announcement has been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and adopted for use in the European Union, this announcement does not itself contain sufficient information to comply with IFRSs. The Group expects it will need to raise additional funding in the future in order to support research and development efforts, potential commercialisation related activities if any of its product candidates receive marketing approval, as well as to support activities associated with operating as a public company in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Management expects to finance its cash needs through a combination of some, or all, of the following: equity offerings, collaborations, strategic alliances, grants and clinical trial support from government entities, philanthropic, non-government and not for profit organisations and patient advocacy groups, debt financings, and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. After review of the future operating costs of the business in conjunction with the cash held at 30 April 2017 and the $22 million development milestone now due as detailed in Note 4, 'Subsequent events,' management is confident about the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and accordingly the interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.  The financial information for the three month periods ended 30 April 2017 and 2016 are unaudited. Solely for the convenience of the reader, unless otherwise indicated, all pound sterling amounts stated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 30 April 2017, in the Consolidated Income Statement and in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the three months ended 30 April 2017 have been translated into US dollars at the rate on 28 April 2017 of $1.2938 to £1.00. These translations should not be considered representations that any such amounts have been, could have been or could be converted into US dollars at that or any other exchange rate as at that or any other date. The Board of Directors of the Company approved this statement on 14 June 2017. Change in accounting policyFollowing an IFRS IC agenda decision in May 2016 on the application of International Accounting Standard 20 'Government Grants,' the Company changed its accounting policy regarding charitable funding arrangements from the Wellcome Trust and US not for profit organisations during the year ended 31 January 2017.  In exchange for the funding provided, these arrangements require the Company to pay royalties on potential future revenues generated from these projects and also give the counterparties certain rights over the intellectual property if the compound is not exploited. The IFRIC decision has clarified that such arrangements result in a financial liability. The estimate of the financial liability is initially recognised at fair value using a discounted cash flow model with the difference between the fair value of the liability and the cash received considered to represent a charitable grant.   When determining the fair value on initial recognition, the significant assumptions in the model include the estimation of the timing and the probability of successful development leading to commercialisation of the project related results and related estimates of future cash flows. Estimated future cash flows include expected sources of revenue (including commercial sales and upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties from potential licensing arrangements) and are calculated using estimated geographical market share and associated pricing.  The financial liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using a discounted cash flow model, which calculates the risk adjusted present values of estimated potential future cash flows for the respective projects related to the Wellcome Trust and US not for profit organisations. The financial liability is re-measured when there is a specific significant event that provides evidence of a significant change in the probability of successful development such as the completion of a phase of research or changes in use or market for a product. The model will be updated for changes in the clinical probability of success and other associated assumptions with the discount rate remaining consistent within the model.   Re-measurements of the financial liability are recognised in the income statement as finance costs. Grant income is recognised as other operating income in accordance with International Accounting Standard 20, 'Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance,' at the same time as the underlying expenditure is incurred, provided that there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions.   This change in accounting policy has been reflected retrospectively in the comparative financial statements for the three months ended 30 April 2016. The opening position as at 1 February 2016 is in line with comparative amounts disclosed in the financial statements for the year ended 31 January 2017.  The impact of this change in accounting policy on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements is a reduction in other income historically recognised, a change in the level of accrued income accounted for as grant income and the recognition of a financial liability and finance costs associated with the unwinding of the discount.

Loss per share calculation The loss per Ordinary Share has been calculated by dividing the loss for the period by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the three months ended 30 April 2017: 61,883,701 (for the three months ended 30 April 2016: 61,324,182). Since the Group has reported a net loss, diluted loss per Ordinary Share is equal to basic loss per Ordinary Share. 3. Issue of share capital On 22 February 2017, 50,000 Ordinary Shares were issued following the exercise of warrants at an exercise price of 20 pence per share. The issue of shares raised net proceeds of £10,000.  On 10 April 2017, 16,667 Ordinary Shares were issued following the exercise of options. The exercise of options raised net proceeds of £3,000. Following the exercise of the above warrants and share options, the number of Ordinary Shares in issue was 61,908,233.  All new Ordinary Shares rank pari passu with existing Ordinary Shares. 4. Subsequent events In May 2017, the Group announced the first dosing of the last patient in its ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of ezutromid which triggered a $22 million milestone payment due to Summit as part of the Group's licence and collaboration agreement with Sarepta. This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation 596/2014 (MAR). -END-

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $28.0
million, based on an offering price of $9.90 per ADS, or approximately $32.8 
million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional
ADSs to cover over-allotments, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

As of October 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately £15.0
million ($24.0 million). We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds
from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as
follows:

. approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million to fund our ongoing Phase 1b 
  modified diet clinical trial of SMT C1100 and, if successful, initiate our 
  Phase 2 open label clinical trial and our Phase 2 placebo controlled clinical 
  trial of SMT C1100;  

. approximately $5.0 million to fund our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of 
  SMT19969 and our ongoing exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial of SMT19969 
  compared to fidaxomicin;  

. approximately $5.0 million to advance our second generation utrophin 
  modulators, future generation utrophin modulators, potential diet independent 
  formulations of SMT C1100 and our biomarker development program; and  

. the remainder for working capital and for general corporate purposes. 

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from
clinical trials of our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a
result, our management retains broad discretion over the allocation of the net
proceeds from this offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering, we estimate
that such funds, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be
sufficient to enable us to complete and report top line data from our ongoing
Phase 1b modified diet clinical trial of SMT C1100, report top line data from
our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of SMT19969, report top line data from our
ongoing exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial of SMT19969 compared to fidaxomicin
and report initial data from our Phase 2 open label clinical trial of SMT C1100.
We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we
could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. While
we anticipate that the net proceeds of this offering will allow us to initiate
our Phase 2 open label clinical trial and our Phase 2 placebo controlled
clinical trial of SMT C1100, we do not expect the net proceeds will be
sufficient to allow us to fund either of these clinical trials to completion.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including term
deposits, and short-term, investment-grade, and interest-bearing instruments.


The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly
advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary
products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and
scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential
competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, 
specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, 
government agencies and private and public research institutions. Any product 
candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with 
existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 

Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and
expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing,
conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing
approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and
establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials,
as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our
programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant
competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and
established companies.

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors
develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or
less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any
products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain marketing
approvals for their products more rapidly than we obtain approval for ours. In
addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in some cases insurers
or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. This
may have the effect of making branded products less attractive, from a cost
perspective, to buyers.

The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates are
likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of
coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.

The competition for SMT C1100 and SMT19969 includes the following:

SMT C1100

There is currently no approved therapy for the treatment of DMD applicable to
all DMD patients that seeks to alter the progression of the disease.
Corticosteroids, such as prednisolone and deflazacort, are the current standard
of care for DMD patients, although these are symptomatic treatments that do not
address the underlying cause of DMD, and their use can be associated with severe
side effects and concerns over weight gain. Other companies are developing
alternative therapeutic approaches to the treatment of DMD, a number of which
are outlined below.

Nonsense mutations. PTC Therapeutics, Inc., or PTC, is developing Translarna
(ataluren). The European Commission has granted conditional approval for
Translarna in Europe, and PTC is preparing to commercialize Translarna in
several European countries. PTC has also commenced a rolling NDA submission to
the FDA for Translarna. PTC is currently enrolling patients into a Phase 3
confirmatory clinical trial of Translarna. Translarna is a small molecule that
enables formation of functional dystrophin in DMD patients with nonsense
mutations. DMD caused by nonsense mutations affects approximately 13% of all DMD
patients.

Exon Skipping. Prosensa Holding N.V., or Prosensa, and Sarepta Therapeutics,
Inc., or Sarepta, are developing treatments for DMD based on exon-skipping
approaches. Exons are organic molecules known as nucleotides within the DNA
strand that the cellular machinery translates to make full-length, functional
protein. In a sub-population of DMD patients, synthesis of the dystrophin
protein is disrupted because of mutations that may be due, among other things,
to deleted exons. Exon-skipping technology seeks to allow the production of a
shorter but still functional dystrophin protein. Prosensa’s most advanced
exon-skipping drug is drisapersen. Prosensa has submitted an NDA for drisapersen
with the FDA seeking accelerated approval and has stated that it expects the FDA
to complete its review in the first quarter of 2015. Prosensa has further stated
that it plans to seek conditional approval of drisapersen in the European Union
in early 2015. Drisapersen targets exon 51 and would be applicable to
approximately 13% of all DMD patients. Prosensa was recently acquired by
BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. Sarepta’s most advanced product candidate is
eteplirsen. Sarepta has indicated it will file an NDA for eteplirsen with the 
FDA by mid-2015. Eteplirsen also targets exon 51 and would therefore be 
applicable to approximately 13% of all DMD patients. Prosensa and Sarepta are 
also developing other exon skipping therapies to treat other genetic mutations. 
These companies have product candidates in clinical trials that are targeting 
exon 44, which is applicable to 6% of all DMD patients, exon 45, which is 
applicable to 8% of all DMD patients, and exon 53, which is applicable to 6% 
of all DMD patients. According to an article published in 2009 in the peer 
reviewed journal Human Mutation, skipping of the ten most common exons would 
treat in the aggregate approximately 41% of all DMD patients. We believe that 
there are exon-skipping therapies currently in clinical development to address 
four of these exons and that skipping of these exons would treat in the 
aggregate less than one-third of all DMD patients. 

Other DMD approaches. A number of other companies are pursuing alternative
therapeutic approaches for the treatment of DMD. Tivorsan Pharmaceuticals is
developing a recombinant form of Biglycan, a protein that is naturally produced
in the body and regulates production of utrophin in developing muscle, which is
currently in preclinical development. Askelepios Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. is
developing biostrophin, a gene therapy approach that is currently in Phase 1
clinical development. Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer, is pursuing an approach based on
muscle tissue growth through myostatin inhibition. Pfizer completed a Phase 1
healthy volunteer clinical trial of its product candidate, myostatin antibody
PF-06252616, in 2014, and recently announced the initiation of a Phase 2
clinical trial in patients with DMD. Santhera Pharmaceuticals completed a Phase
3 clinical trial of its product candidate, idebenone, in 2014 and reported that
idebenone delayed deterioration in respiratory function. Akashi Therapeutics is
developing HT-100, an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic small molecule that
aims to reduce fibrosis and inflammation. Akashi Therapeutics is currently
conducting a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of HT-100.

SMT19969

Several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have established themselves
in the market for the treatment of CDI, and several additional companies are
developing products for the treatment of CDI. We expect that these products will
compete with SMT19969.

Antibiotics. The current standard of care for CDI is treatment with the broad
spectrum antibiotics vancomycin and metronidazole, both of which are available
in generic form in the United States. Generic antibiotic therapies typically are
sold at lower prices than branded antibiotics and generally are preferred by
managed care providers of health services. The antibiotic fidaxomicin was
recently approved for the treatment of CDI in the United States and the European
Union. Fidaxomicin was originally developed by Optimer Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
which was later acquired by Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Cubist. Cubist was
recently acquired by Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck. Other antibiotics in
late-stage clinical trials for treatment of CDI include surotomycin, which is
being developed by Cubist and is currently in Phase 3 clinical development, and
cadazolid, which is being developed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. and is
currently in a Phase 3 clinical development.

Other CDI approaches. A number of other approaches for the treatment of CDI are
in development. Merck is developing the monoclonal antibodies actoxumab and
bezlotoxumab, both of which are in Phase 3 clinical trials. These antibodies
neutralize certain toxins that are produced by C. difficile bacteria and would
be an adjunctive therapy to antibiotics. Sanofi Pasteur is developing the
vaccine ACAM-CDIFF for primary prevention of CDI. ACAM-CDIFF is likely to be
used only in high-risk patients given the difficulty of administering a vaccine
to a broad population. Fecal biotherapy aims to recolonize the bacteria that
comprise the natural gut flora and would also be adjunctive therapy to
antibiotics. Fecal biotherapy approaches in development include SER-109, which
is being developed by Seres Health, Inc. and recently completed a Phase 1/2 open
label clinical trial, and RBX2660, which is being developed by Rebiotix, Inc.
and has completed a Phase 2 open label clinical trial.


Company Description
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and 
commercialization of novel medicines for indications for which there are no 
existing or only inadequate therapies. We are conducting clinical programs 
focused on the genetic disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD,


 and the 
infectious disease Clostridium difficile infection, or CDI. Our DMD program is 
based on utrophin modulation, an approach to treating DMD that is independent of
the underlying mutations in the dystrophin gene that cause the disease. We are a
leader in the field of utrophin modulation, an approach that we believe has the 
potential to address the entire population of DMD patients. Other DMD 
approaches, such as exon-skipping and suppression of nonsense mutations, only 
address subsets of this population. Our lead DMD product candidate is SMT C1100,
an orally administered small molecule. We expect to report top line results from
our second Phase 1b clinical trial of SMT C1100 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Our lead CDI product candidate is SMT19969, an orally administered small 
molecule antibiotic. SMT19969 is designed to selectively target Clostridium 
difficile bacteria without causing collateral damage to the gut flora and 
thereby reduce CDI recurrence rates, which is the key clinical issue in this 
disease. We expect to report top line results from our ongoing Phase 2 clinical 
trial of SMT19969 in the second half of 2015.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, has granted orphan drug 
designation to SMT C1100 for the treatment of DMD, and the European Medicines 
Agency, or the EMA, has designated SMT C1100 as an orphan medicinal product. In 
recent public statements, the FDA has stated that it recognizes the unmet 
medical need in DMD, the devastating nature of the disease for patients and 
their families and the urgency to make new treatments available. The FDA has 
designated SMT19969 as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP. In 2013,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services, or CDC, highlighted CDI as one of three pathogens that pose 
an immediate public health threat and require urgent and aggressive action. We 
hold exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to all of our product 
candidates for all indications.

We are also developing an earlier stage pipeline of second and future 
generation utrophin modulators for the treatment of DMD.
