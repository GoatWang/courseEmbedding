Artist David Shepherd – All art work available, originals, signed limited edition prints and sculptures.
David Shepherd – “to start with, my life was a series of disasters”. Growing up in the 1930’s, his one ambition was to be a game warden in Kenya and so, on leaving school, he went to Kenya and was promptly told by the National Parks people that he was not wanted. On returning to England, David was faced with two choices. One was ‘to drive a bus for a living’ and the other was to pursue the only other possibility: painting.
However, he admits that he had very little interest in art and certainly no talent; for he was promptly rejected by the Slade School of Fine Art as ‘untrainable’.
By chance, he met Robin Goodwin, a professional artist, who took him under his wing, David believes ‘as a challenge’! After three years with Robin Goodwin, he started his artistic career pursuing his first two loves, steam engines and aviation. It was the latter that led him to the Royal Air Force who began to fly him around the world as their guest and it was a trip to Aden in 1960 which changed his life. It seemed that almost everyone wanted a painting, but, more important still, the Royal Air Force flew him down to Kenya where he was commissioned by them to paint his very first wildlife painting and his career never looked back from that moment. It was on that same visit that he became a conservationist after finding 255 dead zebra around a poisoned water hole.
On returning to London, he had his first one-man show of wildlife paintings. The exhibition sold out in the first twenty minutes and he has not looked back since! Apart from the tremendous demand for his originals, a number of which he donates to wildlife through The David Shepherd Conservation Foundation, to pay back what, in his own words, is my enormous debt to the animals I paint, his published work is avidly sought after.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.1.0 out of 5 starsNot good- Even the dog is a bad actorBySF Guyon May 31, 2015Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseWe search far and wide for anything that will entertain my 7 year old (and his dad if we're lucky).  This movie has the potential: storyline and a dog.  But the writing is just terrible and so the acting is bad (not the actors themselves).  The editing is bad, too.  So instead of watching a clever dog, my son is subjected to line after line of bad banter between the two bad guys.  he got bored quickly.Don't waste your time.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Esquivelon August 15, 2015Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseTwo stars for effort. I think it was a sweet movie, but the ideas of the film needed to be developed more. Some of the actors need to study the art of acting some more. There were gaps in the story line. I think a re-vamp would help. The stoner people need to cut from the film. The dog was well trained.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.1.0 out of 5 starsHe brought a puppy in and made her the bad guy if she didn't agree to keep itByJanice Daloiaon January 26, 2017Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseThis movie was not well done or well acted.  We watched it with our kids and the main thing we had a problem with is that the husband/dad completely disrespected his wife.  He brought a puppy in and made her the bad guy if she didn't agree to keep it.  We kept expecting him to realize that he wasn't treating his wife as an equal, but he never did.  We felt we had to point out to our children that moms and dads should not treat each other this way.0Comment|

Going Down, Friend by David James$13.99

“‘Don’t read my poems,’ says one of the poems in David James’ new collection. But don’t listen to it!  If you didn’t read these poems, you’d miss all the delicious ‘lies, dreams, wishes’ that are found here. And you’d miss a wise man recognizing that the birds are ‘a little harder to hear’ and the moon is ‘inching closer.’  Yes, a wise man who, as he ages, understands ‘how softly the light shines/in the window, how every desire sails away in the wind.’  Everyone who doesn’t read these poems will miss that moon!  I feel sorry for them.”
–Keith Taylor, author of sixteen books including The Bird-while
 
“With a clear voice and a heart full of awe, David James brings us a world where falling leaves might ‘call your name as they hit the ground’ and where ‘the heart wanders free in the rain.’ Our guide to these poems takes a hard look at love, death, aging and nature and offers the reader not comfort, but astonishment.  This is a book of powerfully human poems, resilience and wonder.”
–Matthew Olzmann, author of Mezzanines and Contradictions in the Design
