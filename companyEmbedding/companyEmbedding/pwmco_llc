Online Security Information




Log In

PWMCO, LLC will never ask you for any personal information other than your Customer ID/Number and password when 
       logging into PWMCO.com. Occasionally, you may be prompted to provide an answer to a previously enrolled security 
       question at log in.

 
E-mail

We will never ask you to send us personal information through e-mail. If you receive an e-mail appearing or claiming 
     to be from PWMCO, LLC that asks for personal information, please do not respond to the message.
If you suspect that you are the victim of identity theft or fraud, or you receive a fraudulent e-mail that looks like it is from 
     PWMCO, LLC, please call us immediately at 312-341-9727.

 


How You Can Help Prevent Unauthorized Account Access
Update your computer: 
      Check and install the latest updates available for your computer's operating system, 
      browsers and other software. Out-of-date software may be more vulnerable to attack. 
      Most operating systems and browsers can be configured to receive updates automatically.
Install anti-virus software: 
      One common reason for failures in or issues with computers is the lack of anti-virus
      software, or expired anti-virus software. Make sure your computer's anti-virus
      software is working and is up-to-date. 

How You Can Help Safeguard Your Information
Using Public Computers:
      When using a public computer, it is important to safeguard personal information.
      Click the "Customer Logout" button on PWMCO.com before leaving a public computer. 
      Simply closing the browser is not enough to prevent others from gaining access to 
      your account. Do not allow the browser to store any account information.
Using “Smart” Passwords:
      Protect yourself online by using "smart" passwords. Do not use obvious 
      passwords such as your spouse's name or date of birth. The best password 
      has a combination of numbers, letters, punctuation, and special characters. 
      Also, change your password regularly, and do not share your password.

Business Continuity and Contingency Planning





PWMCO's Business Continuity Plan ("BCP") has been designed and tested 
    to ensure that we are able to conduct our normal business operations in
    the event of an emergency or a significant business disruption. The plan
    has procedures addressing the following areas of concern: 

Data Back-up and recovery
All mission critical systems
Financial and operational concerns
Alternate communications between PWMCO and its employees, clients, regulators, and all other necessary contacts

All PWMCO employees are required to carry wallet cards that contain 
    contact information. Designated PWMCO principals will contact the employees 
    with instructions on how the firm will proceed in the event of an emergency 
    or significant disruption. All employees also are required to keep a copy 
    of the BCP at a location outside of our office.
PWMCO has a remote facility that will provide access to the critical 
    systems and services needed to perform its duties as a broker dealer and 
    investment advisor.
Our plan outlines the action PWMCO will take in the event of a building 
    or city-wide incident, including relocating technical and operational 
    personnel to a pre-assigned alternate facility.
The PWMCO Business Continuity Plan summary will be mailed to customers 
    upon request.
