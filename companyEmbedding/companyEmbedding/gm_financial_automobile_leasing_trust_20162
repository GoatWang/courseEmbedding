      Fitch Rates GM Financial Automobile Leasing Trust 2016-2
    





May 18, 2016 01:16 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the 
      notes issued by GM Financial Automobile Leasing Trust 2016-2:
    

      --$138,000,000 class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$220,000,000 class A-2-A asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$160,000,000 class A-2-B asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$375,620,000 class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$90,000,000 class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$46,120,000 class B asset-backed notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$42,530,000 class C asset-backed notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$32,950,000 class D asset-backed notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: 2016-2 has a strong weighted average (WA) 
      non-zero obligor FICO score of 751, a relatively diverse mix of vehicles 
      and a higher concentration of shorter-term contracts compared to prior 
      GMALT transactions.
    

      Lease Platform's Limited History: GMF began originating auto leases in 
      December 2010. Therefore, empirical data is limited. Fitch supplemented 
      the GMF data with proxy data from comparable origination platforms to 
      derive a credit loss expectation, while RV performance data for GM 
      vehicles were used to derive a residual loss expectation. Fitch's credit 
      and RV loss proxies for 2016-2 are 1.15% and 13.40%, respectively.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement Structure: Initial hard credit enhancement 
      (CE) totals 18.40%, 14.55%, 11.00%, and 8.25% for class A, B, C, and D 
      notes, respectively. Based on a 1.15% credit loss proxy stressed for 
      each rating category and the stressed RV loss expectations of 
      31.6%-17.9% for 'AAAsf' down to 'BBBsf', available CE is sufficient to 
      support each expected rating.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from rising 
      production levels will lead to decreased lower residual realizations 
      during the life of the transaction.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates GMF 'BBB-'/Outlook Stable. Fitch 
      believes GMF to be a capable originator, underwriter, and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical performance of its managed portfolio.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of GMF would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      would likely result in declines of CE and loss coverage levels available 
      to the notes. Decreased CE may make certain note ratings susceptible to 
      potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the 
      decline in coverage. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by 
      increasing a transaction's initial base case RV and credit loss 
      assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of 
      issued notes. The increases to the base case losses are applied such 
      that they represent moderate and severe stresses, respectively, and are 
      intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to 
      unexpected deterioration of a trust's performance.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence information was 
      provided in Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to 200 sample 
      leases. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the 
      findings did not have an impact on the agency's analysis. A copy of the 
      ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link at the end of this rating 
      action commentary.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
