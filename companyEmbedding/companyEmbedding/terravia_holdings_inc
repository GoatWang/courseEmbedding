      with an Exceptionally Mild Flavor that Enhances Food's True Taste

 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      TerraVia™ (NASDAQ: TVIA), a next generation food, nutrition and

      specialty ingredients company, has developed a unique portfolio of algae

      oils, and reported that its Thrive® Culinary Algae Oil, the

      first consumer food product incubated by the Company, has successfully

      completed a retail market test and will be expanding its roll-out.

    


      During the market test at Gelson's in Southern California, Thrive®

      Algae Oil has already achieved velocity and sales leadership with the

      top performing SKUs in the oil category and is now a permanent offering.

      Thrive® Algae Oil is currently beginning its roll out to

      other West Coast retailers and is available nationally on Amazon.com and

      at thrivealgae.com.

    


      "We are often at the forefront of introducing new products and have been

      impressed by the success of Thrive® Algae Oil," said Chris

      Fromm, Gelson's Senior Director of Grocery Purchasing. "Within a few

      months, Thrive has become one of the top performing oil SKUs on our

      shelves, in the top 25th percentile of oil sales. We're confident that

      we'll see continued growth."

    


      Thrive® Algae Oil derives from a unique portfolio of algae

      oils developed by TerraVia that leverage its innovative algae platform

      culinary and sustainability benefits. With the highest level of

      monounsaturated fats (the good fats) and just 0.5 grams of saturated fat

      per serving, a light neutral taste, a high smoke point up to 485°, and

      an unparalleled sustainability footprint, Thrive® Algae Oil

      "Algae oil is one of the most exciting innovations I've seen in the oil

      category," said Jack Davis, former CEO of Ventura Foods, the largest

      maker of vegetable oil-based products in the U.S. "By cooking with an

      oil that has a better fat profile, culinary performance and

      sustainability footprint, consumers and manufacturers alike will be able

      to take some big steps on achieving a better (and healthier) food

      system."

    


      "Thrive® Algae Oil is a hit! This product's test market

      performance reflects its appeal to consumers on many levels: great

      taste, a healthier profile and a more sustainable product. It is a game

      changer in the market and provides retailers with an offering that meets

      consumer demand head on," said Phil Lempert, the Supermarket Guru®,
an expert on consumer behavior and the changing retail landscape.

    


      Reviews of Thrive® Algae Oil by consumers, nutritionists and

      chefs have been overwhelmingly positive. With over 130 reviews posted

      between Amazon.com and the Thrive® Algae Oil website,

      consumers rate the oil 4.8 stars out of 5. Nutritionists praise Thrive®

      Algae Oil as well, citing its favorable fat profile, while chefs are

      enamored by its light and delicate taste, high smoke point, and ability

      to work well in a wide variety of culinary applications.

    

Marisa Churchill, Celebrity Chef and Nutritionist noted, "I have been

      most impressed by algae oil's versatility in the kitchen. Its light and

      subtle flavor works amazingly in desserts, and with its high smoke

      point, I can get a beautiful sear on fish. With more monounsaturated

      fats per tablespoon than any other oil and the fact it's made

      sustainably, algae oil is a superfood that's headed for stardom."

    


      "Since introducing Thrive® and creating that first taste

      moment, we've seen remarkably strong acceptance and are really pleased

      with the response we're getting from other retailers. It's still very

      early in Thrive's roll-out, but it's exciting to note that this product

      is just the first in our pipeline of innovative algae food oils," said

      Mark Brooks, SVP of Food & Ingredients of TerraVia.

      this press release, the words "will", "expects", "intends" and other

      factors, many of which are beyond the control of TerraVia, that could

      cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those

      a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential risks and uncertainties

      include, among others: TerraVia's limited operating history; TerraVia's

      limited history in launching, commercializing and rolling-out products;

      commercial risk in deploying new products; its ability to successfully

      develop and commercialize new products; its ability to sell products at

      a profit and through retailers and other channels; its ability to

      successfully maintain relationships with partners; successful product

      trials by customers and market acceptance and adoption of products by

      customers and consumers; the ability to obtain requisite regulatory

      approvals for products; and its access, on favorable terms, to any

      required financing. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that any of

      the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire

      or occur, or if any of them do so, what impact they will have on the

      results of operations or financial condition of TerraVia.

Company History[edit]
Founding[edit]




Founder and CEO Jonathan S. Wolfson


Solazyme, Inc., was founded on 31 March 2003, with the mission of utilizing microalgae to create a renewable source of energy and transportation fuels. Founders Jonathan S. Wolfson and Harrison Dillon, who met while attending Emory University, started the company in Wolfson's garage. About their partnership, Dillon said: "Neither of us wanted to go work for some giant organization where we were a tiny cog in a huge wheel. We wanted to make a difference and create something that had never existed before.”[2]
In 2013 Dillon announced his decision to step down from his full time position as CEO and member of Board of Directors of Solazyme and shift to a long-term consulting role focused on further developing the breadth of the technology platform and advising on intellectual property strategy.[3]
Wolfson continued on as Chairman and CEO of Solazyme until August 2016 when he stepped down and assumed the role of Executive Chairman of the Board.
TerraVia appointed Apu Mody, former President of Mars Food America, as new CEO and a member of the Board of Directors, in August 2016. Mody brings over 25 years of experience and a strong record of financial success and innovation in the CPG, Retail and Restaurant sectors. Mody stated about his appointment, “With TerraVia’s unique portfolio of ingredients that provide better nutrition and sustainability with outstanding taste, the Company is on the verge of great things. I look forward to leading the team and realizing our mission of making a difference for both people and the planet.”[4]
Initial Focus[edit]
In 2004 and 2005, Solazyme began development of an algal molecular biology platform, and identified and initiated a platform for microalgae-based oil production. The company then expanded focus on skin and personal care products.
Solazyme continued development of the algal molecular biology platform in 2006. Key microalgae strains were identified to produce oil that could be easily converted into fuels and chemicals. Through this process, Solazyme coincidentally discovered an extract from algae that demonstrated an ability to increase cell regeneration and to reduce inflammation, while protecting from UV light damage, and thereby creating alguronic acid. The company later expanded its focus to include nutrition.

In September 2007, Solazyme received a $2 million grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, signed a joint development agreement with Chevron through its division Chevron Technology Ventures, began operating in commercially sized standard industrial fermentation equipment (75,000-liter scale), worked with a third party refiner to demonstrate the compatibility of the oil with standard refining equipment, and produced over 400 liters of microalgae-based oils.
In January 2008, Solazyme was featured in Fields of Fuel, which was played at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. At the event, it presented a Mercedes Benz C320 fueled with its Soladiesel brand of algal fuel.[5]
Also in January 2008, the company announced a partnership with Chevron Technology Ventures to explore the commercialization of algal fuel.[6] Later that year, the company stated that it had produced the world's first jet fuel derived from an algal source.
In 2009, Solazyme was awarded approximately $22 million from the United States Department of Energy for the construction of an integrated biorefinery project. It also formed a contract with the United States Department of Defense to deliver microalgae-based marine (renewable F-76) diesel fuel to the United States Navy.[7]
In 2011, the company announced it had produced over 283,000 liters of military-spec diesel (HRF-76) for the United States Navy. The initial fuel production for phase 1 of a 550,000 liter contract was completed ahead of schedule.
Initial public offering[edit]
In May 2011, Solazyme set terms for its initial public offering. The company planned to raise $160 million by offering 10 million shares at a price range of $15 to $17 and ended up selling 7,901,800 shares for $20 each in its first day of trading.[8]
Investment banking and securities firm Goldman Sachs reported in July 2011 that with the commercialization of new oil products, Solazyme stock had become less risky.[9] The bank initiated coverage with a top rating and $31 target. In a note to clients, it said Solazyme (NASDAQ: TVIA) stood to boost sales and become more stable now that it had partnered with major agribusinesses like Bunge Limited.[10]
Joint Venture with Bunge Limited[edit]
On August 8, 2011, Solazyme announced a joint venture with agribusiness company Bunge Limited to develop renewable oils in Brazil using Solazyme's algae-based sugar-to-oil technology.
In April 2012, Solazyme and Bunge announced a plan to construct a shared commercial-scale production facility in Brazil.[11] As one of the world's largest vegetable oil distributors, Bunge would supply the facility with sugarcane feedstock from its sugarcane processor in Brazil for use in Solazyme's algae oil production process.
Construction of the new facility began in June 2012 and in May 2014, the joint venture plant began oil production.[12]
In late 2015, Solazyme and Bunge announced an expansion of their joint venture, which included an agreement to have Bunge market the food oils produced through the joint venture.[13]
The production of AlgaPrime DHA was announced in May 2016 and is the first product under the joint venture of TerraVia and Bunge. AlgaPrime DHA is a new algae-based specialty feed ingredient designed to reduce the aquaculture industry's dependence on wild fish populations.[14][15]
TerraVia[edit]
Solazyme officially changed its name to TerraVia Holdings Inc. in March 2016 with a redefined focus on food, nutrition, and personal care. As part of the change, the company stated that its previous fuel and industrial oil products and workings would operate under Solazyme Industrials.[16]
Technology[edit]
TerraVia uses an innovative approach to grow microalgae, which allows the production process to be extremely efficient in terms of cost, scale, time, and sustainability. In contrast to common open pond and photo bioreactor approaches, TerraVia grows microalgae in the dark, inside huge stainless-steel containers. These enclosed fermentation tanks offer control, purity, and consistency for the fermentation process, as well as provide the opportunity for microalgae to be produced in a diversity of geographies and seasons. The algae can be fed a wide variety of renewable plant-based sugars, also known as feedstock flexible, and the potential feedstocks include sugarcane-based sucrose, corn-based dextrose, sugar beets, and green waste. The algae then convert the sugar into oils, lipids, and proteins, which can be used in a variety of applications, such as food ingredients and cosmetics.
The majority of TerraVia's products are produced at the joint venture facility with Bunge in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This facility utilizes Bonsucro certified sugarcane as a feedstock, which is grown on-site by Bunge. At the facility, the sugarcane byproducts- known as bagasse- are used to generate power to run the entire plant. Excess power is sent to the local grid. This makes the algae production process extremely efficient, with very little energy going to waste.
Products and Brands[edit]
Food[edit]
In 2010, Solazyme launched its first products, the Golden Chlorella line of dietary supplements, as part of a market development initiative. Products incorporating Golden Chlorella can be found at retailers including Whole Foods Market and General Nutrition Centers.
Alongside its efforts in the fuels and cosmetics industries, Solazyme began development of a food ingredient line known as AlgaVia. AlgaVia was launched in 2014 and received GRAS certification the same year.[17] With the company change in March 2016, TerraVia acquired AlgaVia as well as AlgaWise, another food ingredient brand.
The AlgaVia brand provides food manufacturers with two whole algae powders that offer sustainable, non-allergenic, vegan protein and lipids. As the name suggests, the whole algae powders use the entire algae cell, which is ground up into a fine powder. AlgaVia's Lipid-Rich Whole Algae powder is intended to add texture and reduce the need for dairy, eggs, and oils in recipes. The Protein-Rich Whole Algae powder is intended to offer an allergen and gluten-free source of vegan protein.
The AlgaWise brand sells algae-based food oils. AlgaWise features two different oils optimized for monounsaturated fat content or stability. AlgaWise Ultra Omega-9 Algae Oil offers over 90 percent monounsaturated fat and less than 4 percent saturated fat. TerraVia boasts that the oil has an extremely high smoke point and a neutral taste, making it good for frying and searing. AlgaWise High Stability Algae Oil is intended to resist oxidation and reduce the need for preservatives and extra stabilizing ingredients.
AlgaVia and AlgaWise supply algae-based ingredients to food manufacturers, such as South Coast Baking Company, Follow Your Heart, and So Delicious Dairy Free.
TerraVia is also responsible for the Thrive Algae Oil brand. Thrive is marketed as "The Best Oil For Your Heart" due to its high levels of monounsaturated fats, which are known to decrease bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Thrive has been praised by food industry professionals for its neutral taste, versatility, and high smoke point.
The Gelson's grocery chain began supplying Thrive to the Los Angeles area in 2015. Due to its success in this market, TerraVia announced it would expand the distribution of Thrive throughout the West Coast in May 2016.[18]
Aquaculture[edit]
As part of its joint venture with Bunge Limited, TerraVia supplies aquaculture feed producer BioMar with an algae-based feed ingredient known as AlgaPrime DHA.[19] AlgaPrime DHA is a source of DHA omega-3 fatty acid. which is intended to reduce the aquaculture industry's dependence on wild fish as a source of DHA. AlgaPrime DHA therefore has the potential to boost the sustainability of aquaculture and allow the aquaculture industry to grow in spite of the world's fixed supply of ocean-based DHA.[20]
Personal Care[edit]
TerraVia currently manufactures the Algenist brand for the luxury skin care market through marketing and distribution arrangements with Sephora and QVC. It is sold in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. The idea of using algae for a skincare line came from Arthur Grossman, the Chief of Genetics at Solazyme and Staff Scientist at the Carnegie Institution.[21] Grossman is an expert in algal photosynthesis and has studied how algae protect themselves from harsh environments and reasoned they could be used to protect human skin.[22]
TerraVia also markets its AlgaPūr Algae Oil brand to personal care producers. Unilever, a leading consumer goods company, is one of TerraVia's biggest partners. In 2010, Solazyme and Unilever started its partnership to develop renewable algae oils for use in soaps and other personal care products.[23] In 2011, Unilever funded TerraVia's research and development efforts, which ended in Unilever agreeing to the terms of a multi-year supply agreement.[24] In September 2013 Unilever agreed to purchase 3 million gallons of algae oil.[25] In March 2016 the companies signed a multi-year supply agreement, where Unilever has agreed to purchase over $200 million worth of a broad portfolio of renewable algae oils.[26]
Solazyme Industrials[edit]
The company has formerly engaged in development activities with Chevron, Dow Chemical, Ecopetrol, Qantas, and Unilever. Additionally, Solazyme started a brand of industrial drilling lubricant known as Encapso. Scientists were able to harness the prolific oil-producing capabilities of microalgae to create a first-of-its kind product, microencapsulated oil cells that burst only under sufficient pressure, friction, and shear.[27]
As part of the change in focus, TerraVia stated that its fuels, industrial oils, and Encapso business would be grouped together under Solazyme Industrials starting in March 2016. Furthermore, "The company will be pursuing strategic alternatives over the next 12-18 months to unlock the value created [in Solazyme Industrials]. Solazyme's objective is to identify partners who have the operational capabilities needed to realize the potential of those businesses."[28]
Sustainability Principles and Commitments[edit]
Principles and Sustainability[edit]
TerraVia sets a goal of providing replacements for unsustainable products like palm and soybean oil. The brand's food ingredients seek to provide a healthy alternative to animal-based lipids and proteins.
According to its sustainability report, TerraVia states that "transparency is central to all of our sustainability principles."[29] TerraVia supports this goal with a number of commitments, which include engaging with and asking for stakeholders' inputs, publishing product data in peer-reviewed journals, and openly communicating about the production of its products.
As part of this transparency, TerraVia has made information regarding the environmental impacts of its products publicly available.
Life Cycle Analyses[edit]
TerraVia had the third party organization Thinkstep conduct life cycle analyses on its products in order to assess their environmental impacts in comparison to other oils. The results show that algae oil production often has significantly lower environmental impacts in comparison to traditional oil sources.[29]
A life cycle analysis conducted in 2016 compared the sugarcane-fed algae oil produced at the Solazyme Bunge joint venture facility in Brazil against soybean, tallow, palm kernel, olive, palm, canola, and sunflower oil in terms of its carbon emissions and water consumption. Thinkstep found that the algae oil was on par with sunflower oil in terms of global warming potential per kilogram of oil produced. All other oils compared had higher carbon emissions. Algae oil also had the second lowest impact in water consumption, second to canola oil.[29]
The company also analyzed the land impact of its algae oil compared to traditional oils. It found that the algae oil is comparitive to palm oil in land use efficiency, with both algae and palm yielding more than six times the amount of oil per hectare than any other oil producing crop.[29]
The Thinkstep life cycle analysis highlights the advantages of producing algae oil over traditional oil sources in regards to the environmental impacts of oil production.

Company History[edit]
Founding[edit]




Founder and CEO Jonathan S. Wolfson


Solazyme, Inc., was founded on 31 March 2003, with the mission of utilizing microalgae to create a renewable source of energy and transportation fuels. Founders Jonathan S. Wolfson and Harrison Dillon, who met while attending Emory University, started the company in Wolfson's garage. About their partnership, Dillon said: "Neither of us wanted to go work for some giant organization where we were a tiny cog in a huge wheel. We wanted to make a difference and create something that had never existed before.”[2]
In 2013 Dillon announced his decision to step down from his full time position as CEO and member of Board of Directors of Solazyme and shift to a long-term consulting role focused on further developing the breadth of the technology platform and advising on intellectual property strategy.[3]
Wolfson continued on as Chairman and CEO of Solazyme until August 2016 when he stepped down and assumed the role of Executive Chairman of the Board.
TerraVia appointed Apu Mody, former President of Mars Food America, as new CEO and a member of the Board of Directors, in August 2016. Mody brings over 25 years of experience and a strong record of financial success and innovation in the CPG, Retail and Restaurant sectors. Mody stated about his appointment, “With TerraVia’s unique portfolio of ingredients that provide better nutrition and sustainability with outstanding taste, the Company is on the verge of great things. I look forward to leading the team and realizing our mission of making a difference for both people and the planet.”[4]
Initial Focus[edit]
In 2004 and 2005, Solazyme began development of an algal molecular biology platform, and identified and initiated a platform for microalgae-based oil production. The company then expanded focus on skin and personal care products.
Solazyme continued development of the algal molecular biology platform in 2006. Key microalgae strains were identified to produce oil that could be easily converted into fuels and chemicals. Through this process, Solazyme coincidentally discovered an extract from algae that demonstrated an ability to increase cell regeneration and to reduce inflammation, while protecting from UV light damage, and thereby creating alguronic acid. The company later expanded its focus to include nutrition.

In September 2007, Solazyme received a $2 million grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, signed a joint development agreement with Chevron through its division Chevron Technology Ventures, began operating in commercially sized standard industrial fermentation equipment (75,000-liter scale), worked with a third party refiner to demonstrate the compatibility of the oil with standard refining equipment, and produced over 400 liters of microalgae-based oils.
In January 2008, Solazyme was featured in Fields of Fuel, which was played at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. At the event, it presented a Mercedes Benz C320 fueled with its Soladiesel brand of algal fuel.[5]
Also in January 2008, the company announced a partnership with Chevron Technology Ventures to explore the commercialization of algal fuel.[6] Later that year, the company stated that it had produced the world's first jet fuel derived from an algal source.
In 2009, Solazyme was awarded approximately $22 million from the United States Department of Energy for the construction of an integrated biorefinery project. It also formed a contract with the United States Department of Defense to deliver microalgae-based marine (renewable F-76) diesel fuel to the United States Navy.[7]
In 2011, the company announced it had produced over 283,000 liters of military-spec diesel (HRF-76) for the United States Navy. The initial fuel production for phase 1 of a 550,000 liter contract was completed ahead of schedule.
Initial public offering[edit]
In May 2011, Solazyme set terms for its initial public offering. The company planned to raise $160 million by offering 10 million shares at a price range of $15 to $17 and ended up selling 7,901,800 shares for $20 each in its first day of trading.[8]
Investment banking and securities firm Goldman Sachs reported in July 2011 that with the commercialization of new oil products, Solazyme stock had become less risky.[9] The bank initiated coverage with a top rating and $31 target. In a note to clients, it said Solazyme (NASDAQ: TVIA) stood to boost sales and become more stable now that it had partnered with major agribusinesses like Bunge Limited.[10]
Joint Venture with Bunge Limited[edit]
On August 8, 2011, Solazyme announced a joint venture with agribusiness company Bunge Limited to develop renewable oils in Brazil using Solazyme's algae-based sugar-to-oil technology.
In April 2012, Solazyme and Bunge announced a plan to construct a shared commercial-scale production facility in Brazil.[11] As one of the world's largest vegetable oil distributors, Bunge would supply the facility with sugarcane feedstock from its sugarcane processor in Brazil for use in Solazyme's algae oil production process.
Construction of the new facility began in June 2012 and in May 2014, the joint venture plant began oil production.[12]
In late 2015, Solazyme and Bunge announced an expansion of their joint venture, which included an agreement to have Bunge market the food oils produced through the joint venture.[13]
The production of AlgaPrime DHA was announced in May 2016 and is the first product under the joint venture of TerraVia and Bunge. AlgaPrime DHA is a new algae-based specialty feed ingredient designed to reduce the aquaculture industry's dependence on wild fish populations.[14][15]
TerraVia[edit]
Solazyme officially changed its name to TerraVia Holdings Inc. in March 2016 with a redefined focus on food, nutrition, and personal care. As part of the change, the company stated that its previous fuel and industrial oil products and workings would operate under Solazyme Industrials.[16]
Technology[edit]
TerraVia uses an innovative approach to grow microalgae, which allows the production process to be extremely efficient in terms of cost, scale, time, and sustainability. In contrast to common open pond and photo bioreactor approaches, TerraVia grows microalgae in the dark, inside huge stainless-steel containers. These enclosed fermentation tanks offer control, purity, and consistency for the fermentation process, as well as provide the opportunity for microalgae to be produced in a diversity of geographies and seasons. The algae can be fed a wide variety of renewable plant-based sugars, also known as feedstock flexible, and the potential feedstocks include sugarcane-based sucrose, corn-based dextrose, sugar beets, and green waste. The algae then convert the sugar into oils, lipids, and proteins, which can be used in a variety of applications, such as food ingredients and cosmetics.
The majority of TerraVia's products are produced at the joint venture facility with Bunge in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This facility utilizes Bonsucro certified sugarcane as a feedstock, which is grown on-site by Bunge. At the facility, the sugarcane byproducts- known as bagasse- are used to generate power to run the entire plant. Excess power is sent to the local grid. This makes the algae production process extremely efficient, with very little energy going to waste.
Products and Brands[edit]
Food[edit]
In 2010, Solazyme launched its first products, the Golden Chlorella line of dietary supplements, as part of a market development initiative. Products incorporating Golden Chlorella can be found at retailers including Whole Foods Market and General Nutrition Centers.
Alongside its efforts in the fuels and cosmetics industries, Solazyme began development of a food ingredient line known as AlgaVia. AlgaVia was launched in 2014 and received GRAS certification the same year.[17] With the company change in March 2016, TerraVia acquired AlgaVia as well as AlgaWise, another food ingredient brand.
The AlgaVia brand provides food manufacturers with two whole algae powders that offer sustainable, non-allergenic, vegan protein and lipids. As the name suggests, the whole algae powders use the entire algae cell, which is ground up into a fine powder. AlgaVia's Lipid-Rich Whole Algae powder is intended to add texture and reduce the need for dairy, eggs, and oils in recipes. The Protein-Rich Whole Algae powder is intended to offer an allergen and gluten-free source of vegan protein.
The AlgaWise brand sells algae-based food oils. AlgaWise features two different oils optimized for monounsaturated fat content or stability. AlgaWise Ultra Omega-9 Algae Oil offers over 90 percent monounsaturated fat and less than 4 percent saturated fat. TerraVia boasts that the oil has an extremely high smoke point and a neutral taste, making it good for frying and searing. AlgaWise High Stability Algae Oil is intended to resist oxidation and reduce the need for preservatives and extra stabilizing ingredients.
AlgaVia and AlgaWise supply algae-based ingredients to food manufacturers, such as South Coast Baking Company, Follow Your Heart, and So Delicious Dairy Free.
TerraVia is also responsible for the Thrive Algae Oil brand. Thrive is marketed as "The Best Oil For Your Heart" due to its high levels of monounsaturated fats, which are known to decrease bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Thrive has been praised by food industry professionals for its neutral taste, versatility, and high smoke point.
The Gelson's grocery chain began supplying Thrive to the Los Angeles area in 2015. Due to its success in this market, TerraVia announced it would expand the distribution of Thrive throughout the West Coast in May 2016.[18]
Aquaculture[edit]
As part of its joint venture with Bunge Limited, TerraVia supplies aquaculture feed producer BioMar with an algae-based feed ingredient known as AlgaPrime DHA.[19] AlgaPrime DHA is a source of DHA omega-3 fatty acid. which is intended to reduce the aquaculture industry's dependence on wild fish as a source of DHA. AlgaPrime DHA therefore has the potential to boost the sustainability of aquaculture and allow the aquaculture industry to grow in spite of the world's fixed supply of ocean-based DHA.[20]
Personal Care[edit]
TerraVia currently manufactures the Algenist brand for the luxury skin care market through marketing and distribution arrangements with Sephora and QVC. It is sold in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. The idea of using algae for a skincare line came from Arthur Grossman, the Chief of Genetics at Solazyme and Staff Scientist at the Carnegie Institution.[21] Grossman is an expert in algal photosynthesis and has studied how algae protect themselves from harsh environments and reasoned they could be used to protect human skin.[22]
TerraVia also markets its AlgaPūr Algae Oil brand to personal care producers. Unilever, a leading consumer goods company, is one of TerraVia's biggest partners. In 2010, Solazyme and Unilever started its partnership to develop renewable algae oils for use in soaps and other personal care products.[23] In 2011, Unilever funded TerraVia's research and development efforts, which ended in Unilever agreeing to the terms of a multi-year supply agreement.[24] In September 2013 Unilever agreed to purchase 3 million gallons of algae oil.[25] In March 2016 the companies signed a multi-year supply agreement, where Unilever has agreed to purchase over $200 million worth of a broad portfolio of renewable algae oils.[26]
Solazyme Industrials[edit]
The company has formerly engaged in development activities with Chevron, Dow Chemical, Ecopetrol, Qantas, and Unilever. Additionally, Solazyme started a brand of industrial drilling lubricant known as Encapso. Scientists were able to harness the prolific oil-producing capabilities of microalgae to create a first-of-its kind product, microencapsulated oil cells that burst only under sufficient pressure, friction, and shear.[27]
As part of the change in focus, TerraVia stated that its fuels, industrial oils, and Encapso business would be grouped together under Solazyme Industrials starting in March 2016. Furthermore, "The company will be pursuing strategic alternatives over the next 12-18 months to unlock the value created [in Solazyme Industrials]. Solazyme's objective is to identify partners who have the operational capabilities needed to realize the potential of those businesses."[28]
Sustainability Principles and Commitments[edit]
Principles and Sustainability[edit]
TerraVia sets a goal of providing replacements for unsustainable products like palm and soybean oil. The brand's food ingredients seek to provide a healthy alternative to animal-based lipids and proteins.
According to its sustainability report, TerraVia states that "transparency is central to all of our sustainability principles."[29] TerraVia supports this goal with a number of commitments, which include engaging with and asking for stakeholders' inputs, publishing product data in peer-reviewed journals, and openly communicating about the production of its products.
As part of this transparency, TerraVia has made information regarding the environmental impacts of its products publicly available.
Life Cycle Analyses[edit]
TerraVia had the third party organization Thinkstep conduct life cycle analyses on its products in order to assess their environmental impacts in comparison to other oils. The results show that algae oil production often has significantly lower environmental impacts in comparison to traditional oil sources.[29]
A life cycle analysis conducted in 2016 compared the sugarcane-fed algae oil produced at the Solazyme Bunge joint venture facility in Brazil against soybean, tallow, palm kernel, olive, palm, canola, and sunflower oil in terms of its carbon emissions and water consumption. Thinkstep found that the algae oil was on par with sunflower oil in terms of global warming potential per kilogram of oil produced. All other oils compared had higher carbon emissions. Algae oil also had the second lowest impact in water consumption, second to canola oil.[29]
The company also analyzed the land impact of its algae oil compared to traditional oils. It found that the algae oil is comparitive to palm oil in land use efficiency, with both algae and palm yielding more than six times the amount of oil per hectare than any other oil producing crop.[29]
The Thinkstep life cycle analysis highlights the advantages of producing algae oil over traditional oil sources in regards to the environmental impacts of oil production.
Awards[edit]

In 2016, Thrive Culinary Algae Oil won the Gama Innovation Award.[30]
Solazyme won the 2014 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award.[31]
Solazyme's Algenist skincare brand won the 2014 Marie Claire Prix d'Excellence de la Beaute in France.[32]

In May 2011, Solazyme set terms for its initial public offering. The company planned to raise $160 million by offering 10 million shares at a price range of $15 to $17 and ended up selling 7,901,800 shares for $20 each in its first day of trading.[8]
Investment banking and securities firm Goldman Sachs reported in July 2011 that with the commercialization of new oil products, Solazyme stock had become less risky.[9] The bank initiated coverage with a top rating and $31 target. In a note to clients, it said Solazyme (NASDAQ: TVIA) stood to boost sales and become more stable now that it had partnered with major agribusinesses like Bunge Limited.[10]
Joint Venture with Bunge Limited[edit]
On August 8, 2011, Solazyme announced a joint venture with agribusiness company Bunge Limited to develop renewable oils in Brazil using Solazyme's algae-based sugar-to-oil technology.
In April 2012, Solazyme and Bunge announced a plan to construct a shared commercial-scale production facility in Brazil.[11] As one of the world's largest vegetable oil distributors, Bunge would supply the facility with sugarcane feedstock from its sugarcane processor in Brazil for use in Solazyme's algae oil production process.
Construction of the new facility began in June 2012 and in May 2014, the joint venture plant began oil production.[12]
In late 2015, Solazyme and Bunge announced an expansion of their joint venture, which included an agreement to have Bunge market the food oils produced through the joint venture.[13]
The production of AlgaPrime DHA was announced in May 2016 and is the first product under the joint venture of TerraVia and Bunge. AlgaPrime DHA is a new algae-based specialty feed ingredient designed to reduce the aquaculture industry's dependence on wild fish populations.[14][15]
TerraVia[edit]
Solazyme officially changed its name to TerraVia Holdings Inc. in March 2016 with a redefined focus on food, nutrition, and personal care. As part of the change, the company stated that its previous fuel and industrial oil products and workings would operate under Solazyme Industrials.[16]
Technology[edit]
TerraVia uses an innovative approach to grow microalgae, which allows the production process to be extremely efficient in terms of cost, scale, time, and sustainability. In contrast to common open pond and photo bioreactor approaches, TerraVia grows microalgae in the dark, inside huge stainless-steel containers. These enclosed fermentation tanks offer control, purity, and consistency for the fermentation process, as well as provide the opportunity for microalgae to be produced in a diversity of geographies and seasons. The algae can be fed a wide variety of renewable plant-based sugars, also known as feedstock flexible, and the potential feedstocks include sugarcane-based sucrose, corn-based dextrose, sugar beets, and green waste. The algae then convert the sugar into oils, lipids, and proteins, which can be used in a variety of applications, such as food ingredients and cosmetics.
The majority of TerraVia's products are produced at the joint venture facility with Bunge in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This facility utilizes Bonsucro certified sugarcane as a feedstock, which is grown on-site by Bunge. At the facility, the sugarcane byproducts- known as bagasse- are used to generate power to run the entire plant. Excess power is sent to the local grid. This makes the algae production process extremely efficient, with very little energy going to waste.
Products and Brands[edit]
Food[edit]
In 2010, Solazyme launched its first products, the Golden Chlorella line of dietary supplements, as part of a market development initiative. Products incorporating Golden Chlorella can be found at retailers including Whole Foods Market and General Nutrition Centers.
Alongside its efforts in the fuels and cosmetics industries, Solazyme began development of a food ingredient line known as AlgaVia. AlgaVia was launched in 2014 and received GRAS certification the same year.[17] With the company change in March 2016, TerraVia acquired AlgaVia as well as AlgaWise, another food ingredient brand.
The AlgaVia brand provides food manufacturers with two whole algae powders that offer sustainable, non-allergenic, vegan protein and lipids. As the name suggests, the whole algae powders use the entire algae cell, which is ground up into a fine powder. AlgaVia's Lipid-Rich Whole Algae powder is intended to add texture and reduce the need for dairy, eggs, and oils in recipes. The Protein-Rich Whole Algae powder is intended to offer an allergen and gluten-free source of vegan protein.
The AlgaWise brand sells algae-based food oils. AlgaWise features two different oils optimized for monounsaturated fat content or stability. AlgaWise Ultra Omega-9 Algae Oil offers over 90 percent monounsaturated fat and less than 4 percent saturated fat. TerraVia boasts that the oil has an extremely high smoke point and a neutral taste, making it good for frying and searing. AlgaWise High Stability Algae Oil is intended to resist oxidation and reduce the need for preservatives and extra stabilizing ingredients.
AlgaVia and AlgaWise supply algae-based ingredients to food manufacturers, such as South Coast Baking Company, Follow Your Heart, and So Delicious Dairy Free.
TerraVia is also responsible for the Thrive Algae Oil brand. Thrive is marketed as "The Best Oil For Your Heart" due to its high levels of monounsaturated fats, which are known to decrease bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Thrive has been praised by food industry professionals for its neutral taste, versatility, and high smoke point.
The Gelson's grocery chain began supplying Thrive to the Los Angeles area in 2015. Due to its success in this market, TerraVia announced it would expand the distribution of Thrive throughout the West Coast in May 2016.[18]
Aquaculture[edit]
As part of its joint venture with Bunge Limited, TerraVia supplies aquaculture feed producer BioMar with an algae-based feed ingredient known as AlgaPrime DHA.[19] AlgaPrime DHA is a source of DHA omega-3 fatty acid. which is intended to reduce the aquaculture industry's dependence on wild fish as a source of DHA. AlgaPrime DHA therefore has the potential to boost the sustainability of aquaculture and allow the aquaculture industry to grow in spite of the world's fixed supply of ocean-based DHA.[20]
Personal Care[edit]
TerraVia currently manufactures the Algenist brand for the luxury skin care market through marketing and distribution arrangements with Sephora and QVC. It is sold in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. The idea of using algae for a skincare line came from Arthur Grossman, the Chief of Genetics at Solazyme and Staff Scientist at the Carnegie Institution.[21] Grossman is an expert in algal photosynthesis and has studied how algae protect themselves from harsh environments and reasoned they could be used to protect human skin.[22]
TerraVia also markets its AlgaPūr Algae Oil brand to personal care producers. Unilever, a leading consumer goods company, is one of TerraVia's biggest partners. In 2010, Solazyme and Unilever started its partnership to develop renewable algae oils for use in soaps and other personal care products.[23] In 2011, Unilever funded TerraVia's research and development efforts, which ended in Unilever agreeing to the terms of a multi-year supply agreement.[24] In September 2013 Unilever agreed to purchase 3 million gallons of algae oil.[25] In March 2016 the companies signed a multi-year supply agreement, where Unilever has agreed to purchase over $200 million worth of a broad portfolio of renewable algae oils.[26]
Solazyme Industrials[edit]
The company has formerly engaged in development activities with Chevron, Dow Chemical, Ecopetrol, Qantas, and Unilever. Additionally, Solazyme started a brand of industrial drilling lubricant known as Encapso. Scientists were able to harness the prolific oil-producing capabilities of microalgae to create a first-of-its kind product, microencapsulated oil cells that burst only under sufficient pressure, friction, and shear.[27]
As part of the change in focus, TerraVia stated that its fuels, industrial oils, and Encapso business would be grouped together under Solazyme Industrials starting in March 2016. Furthermore, "The company will be pursuing strategic alternatives over the next 12-18 months to unlock the value created [in Solazyme Industrials]. Solazyme's objective is to identify partners who have the operational capabilities needed to realize the potential of those businesses."[28]
Sustainability Principles and Commitments[edit]
Principles and Sustainability[edit]
TerraVia sets a goal of providing replacements for unsustainable products like palm and soybean oil. The brand's food ingredients seek to provide a healthy alternative to animal-based lipids and proteins.
According to its sustainability report, TerraVia states that "transparency is central to all of our sustainability principles."[29] TerraVia supports this goal with a number of commitments, which include engaging with and asking for stakeholders' inputs, publishing product data in peer-reviewed journals, and openly communicating about the production of its products.
As part of this transparency, TerraVia has made information regarding the environmental impacts of its products publicly available.
Life Cycle Analyses[edit]
TerraVia had the third party organization Thinkstep conduct life cycle analyses on its products in order to assess their environmental impacts in comparison to other oils. The results show that algae oil production often has significantly lower environmental impacts in comparison to traditional oil sources.[29]
A life cycle analysis conducted in 2016 compared the sugarcane-fed algae oil produced at the Solazyme Bunge joint venture facility in Brazil against soybean, tallow, palm kernel, olive, palm, canola, and sunflower oil in terms of its carbon emissions and water consumption. Thinkstep found that the algae oil was on par with sunflower oil in terms of global warming potential per kilogram of oil produced. All other oils compared had higher carbon emissions. Algae oil also had the second lowest impact in water consumption, second to canola oil.[29]
The company also analyzed the land impact of its algae oil compared to traditional oils. It found that the algae oil is comparitive to palm oil in land use efficiency, with both algae and palm yielding more than six times the amount of oil per hectare than any other oil producing crop.[29]
The Thinkstep life cycle analysis highlights the advantages of producing algae oil over traditional oil sources in regards to the environmental impacts of oil production.
Awards[edit]

In 2016, Thrive Culinary Algae Oil won the Gama Innovation Award.[30]
Solazyme won the 2014 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award.[31]
Solazyme's Algenist skincare brand won the 2014 Marie Claire Prix d'Excellence de la Beaute in France.[32]

Company History[edit]
Founding[edit]




Founder and CEO Jonathan S. Wolfson


Solazyme, Inc., was founded on 31 March 2003, with the mission of utilizing microalgae to create a renewable source of energy and transportation fuels. Founders Jonathan S. Wolfson and Harrison Dillon, who met while attending Emory University, started the company in Wolfson's garage. About their partnership, Dillon said: "Neither of us wanted to go work for some giant organization where we were a tiny cog in a huge wheel. We wanted to make a difference and create something that had never existed before.”[2]
In 2013 Dillon announced his decision to step down from his full time position as CEO and member of Board of Directors of Solazyme and shift to a long-term consulting role focused on further developing the breadth of the technology platform and advising on intellectual property strategy.[3]
Wolfson continued on as Chairman and CEO of Solazyme until August 2016 when he stepped down and assumed the role of Executive Chairman of the Board.
TerraVia appointed Apu Mody, former President of Mars Food America, as new CEO and a member of the Board of Directors, in August 2016. Mody brings over 25 years of experience and a strong record of financial success and innovation in the CPG, Retail and Restaurant sectors. Mody stated about his appointment, “With TerraVia’s unique portfolio of ingredients that provide better nutrition and sustainability with outstanding taste, the Company is on the verge of great things. I look forward to leading the team and realizing our mission of making a difference for both people and the planet.”[4]
Initial Focus[edit]
In 2004 and 2005, Solazyme began development of an algal molecular biology platform, and identified and initiated a platform for microalgae-based oil production. The company then expanded focus on skin and personal care products.
Solazyme continued development of the algal molecular biology platform in 2006. Key microalgae strains were identified to produce oil that could be easily converted into fuels and chemicals. Through this process, Solazyme coincidentally discovered an extract from algae that demonstrated an ability to increase cell regeneration and to reduce inflammation, while protecting from UV light damage, and thereby creating alguronic acid. The company later expanded its focus to include nutrition.

In September 2007, Solazyme received a $2 million grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, signed a joint development agreement with Chevron through its division Chevron Technology Ventures, began operating in commercially sized standard industrial fermentation equipment (75,000-liter scale), worked with a third party refiner to demonstrate the compatibility of the oil with standard refining equipment, and produced over 400 liters of microalgae-based oils.
In January 2008, Solazyme was featured in Fields of Fuel, which was played at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. At the event, it presented a Mercedes Benz C320 fueled with its Soladiesel brand of algal fuel.[5]
Also in January 2008, the company announced a partnership with Chevron Technology Ventures to explore the commercialization of algal fuel.[6] Later that year, the company stated that it had produced the world's first jet fuel derived from an algal source.
In 2009, Solazyme was awarded approximately $22 million from the United States Department of Energy for the construction of an integrated biorefinery project. It also formed a contract with the United States Department of Defense to deliver microalgae-based marine (renewable F-76) diesel fuel to the United States Navy.[7]
In 2011, the company announced it had produced over 283,000 liters of military-spec diesel (HRF-76) for the United States Navy. The initial fuel production for phase 1 of a 550,000 liter contract was completed ahead of schedule.
Initial public offering[edit]
In May 2011, Solazyme set terms for its initial public offering. The company planned to raise $160 million by offering 10 million shares at a price range of $15 to $17 and ended up selling 7,901,800 shares for $20 each in its first day of trading.[8]
Investment banking and securities firm Goldman Sachs reported in July 2011 that with the commercialization of new oil products, Solazyme stock had become less risky.[9] The bank initiated coverage with a top rating and $31 target. In a note to clients, it said Solazyme (NASDAQ: TVIA) stood to boost sales and become more stable now that it had partnered with major agribusinesses like Bunge Limited.[10]

Scientists were able to harness the prolific oil-producing capabilities of microalgae to create a first-of-its kind product, microencapsulated oil cells that burst only under sufficient pressure, friction, and shear.[27]
As part of the change in focus, TerraVia stated that its fuels, industrial oils, and Encapso business would be grouped together under Solazyme Industrials starting in March 2016. Furthermore, "The company will be pursuing strategic alternatives over the next 12-18 months to unlock the value created [in Solazyme Industrials]. Solazyme's objective is to identify partners who have the operational capabilities needed to realize the potential of those businesses."[28]
Sustainability Principles and Commitments[edit]
Principles and Sustainability[edit]
TerraVia sets a goal of providing replacements for unsustainable products like palm and soybean oil. The brand's food ingredients seek to provide a healthy alternative to animal-based lipids and proteins.
According to its sustainability report, TerraVia states that "transparency is central to all of our sustainability principles."[29] TerraVia supports this goal with a number of commitments, which include engaging with and asking for stakeholders' inputs, publishing product data in peer-reviewed journals, and openly communicating about the production of its products.
As part of this transparency, TerraVia has made information regarding the environmental impacts of its products publicly available.
Life Cycle Analyses[edit]
TerraVia had the third party organization Thinkstep conduct life cycle analyses on its products in order to assess their environmental impacts in comparison to other oils. The results show that algae oil production often has significantly lower environmental impacts in comparison to traditional oil sources.[29]
A life cycle analysis conducted in 2016 compared the sugarcane-fed algae oil produced at the Solazyme Bunge joint venture facility in Brazil against soybean, tallow, palm kernel, olive, palm, canola, and sunflower oil in terms of its carbon emissions and water consumption. Thinkstep found that the algae oil was on par with sunflower oil in terms of global warming potential per kilogram of oil produced. All other oils compared had higher carbon emissions. Algae oil also had the second lowest impact in water consumption, second to canola oil.[29]
The company also analyzed the land impact of its algae oil compared to traditional oils. It found that the algae oil is comparitive to palm oil in land use efficiency, with both algae and palm yielding more than six times the amount of oil per hectare than any other oil producing crop.[29]
The Thinkstep life cycle analysis highlights the advantages of producing algae oil over traditional oil sources in regards to the environmental impacts of oil production.

Company History[edit]
Founding[edit]




Founder and CEO Jonathan S. Wolfson


Solazyme, Inc., was founded on 31 March 2003, with the mission of utilizing microalgae to create a renewable source of energy and transportation fuels. Founders Jonathan S. Wolfson and Harrison Dillon, who met while attending Emory University, started the company in Wolfson's garage. About their partnership, Dillon said: "Neither of us wanted to go work for some giant organization where we were a tiny cog in a huge wheel. We wanted to make a difference and create something that had never existed before.”[2]
In 2013 Dillon announced his decision to step down from his full time position as CEO and member of Board of Directors of Solazyme and shift to a long-term consulting role focused on further developing the breadth of the technology platform and advising on intellectual property strategy.[3]
Wolfson continued on as Chairman and CEO of Solazyme until August 2016 when he stepped down and assumed the role of Executive Chairman of the Board.
TerraVia appointed Apu Mody, former President of Mars Food America, as new CEO and a member of the Board of Directors, in August 2016. Mody brings over 25 years of experience and a strong record of financial success and innovation in the CPG, Retail and Restaurant sectors. Mody stated about his appointment, “With TerraVia’s unique portfolio of ingredients that provide better nutrition and sustainability with outstanding taste, the Company is on the verge of great things. I look forward to leading the team and realizing our mission of making a difference for both people and the planet.”[4]
Initial Focus[edit]
In 2004 and 2005, Solazyme began development of an algal molecular biology platform, and identified and initiated a platform for microalgae-based oil production. The company then expanded focus on skin and personal care products.
Solazyme continued development of the algal molecular biology platform in 2006. Key microalgae strains were identified to produce oil that could be easily converted into fuels and chemicals. Through this process, Solazyme coincidentally discovered an extract from algae that demonstrated an ability to increase cell regeneration and to reduce inflammation, while protecting from UV light damage, and thereby creating alguronic acid. The company later expanded its focus to include nutrition.

In September 2007, Solazyme received a $2 million grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, signed a joint development agreement with Chevron through its division Chevron Technology Ventures, began operating in commercially sized standard industrial fermentation equipment (75,000-liter scale), worked with a third party refiner to demonstrate the compatibility of the oil with standard refining equipment, and produced over 400 liters of microalgae-based oils.
In January 2008, Solazyme was featured in Fields of Fuel, which was played at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. At the event, it presented a Mercedes Benz C320 fueled with its Soladiesel brand of algal fuel.[5]
Also in January 2008, the company announced a partnership with Chevron Technology Ventures to explore the commercialization of algal fuel.[6] Later that year, the company stated that it had produced the world's first jet fuel derived from an algal source.
In 2009, Solazyme was awarded approximately $22 million from the United States Department of Energy for the construction of an integrated biorefinery project. It also formed a contract with the United States Department of Defense to deliver microalgae-based marine (renewable F-76) diesel fuel to the United States Navy.[7]
In 2011, the company announced it had produced over 283,000 liters of military-spec diesel (HRF-76) for the United States Navy. The initial fuel production for phase 1 of a 550,000 liter contract was completed ahead of schedule.
Initial public offering[edit]
In May 2011, Solazyme set terms for its initial public offering. The company planned to raise $160 million by offering 10 million shares at a price range of $15 to $17 and ended up selling 7,901,800 shares for $20 each in its first day of trading.[8]
Investment banking and securities firm Goldman Sachs reported in July 2011 that with the commercialization of new oil products, Solazyme stock had become less risky.[9] The bank initiated coverage with a top rating and $31 target. In a note to clients, it said Solazyme (NASDAQ: TVIA) stood to boost sales and become more stable now that it had partnered with major agribusinesses like Bunge Limited.[10]
Joint Venture with Bunge Limited[edit]
On August 8, 2011, Solazyme announced a joint venture with agribusiness company Bunge Limited to develop renewable oils in Brazil using Solazyme's algae-based sugar-to-oil technology.
In April 2012, Solazyme and Bunge announced a plan to construct a shared commercial-scale production facility in Brazil.[11] As one of the world's largest vegetable oil distributors, Bunge would supply the facility with sugarcane feedstock from its sugarcane processor in Brazil for use in Solazyme's algae oil production process.
Construction of the new facility began in June 2012 and in May 2014, the joint venture plant began oil production.[12]
In late 2015, Solazyme and Bunge announced an expansion of their joint venture, which included an agreement to have Bunge market the food oils produced through the joint venture.[13]
The production of AlgaPrime DHA was announced in May 2016 and is the first product under the joint venture of TerraVia and Bunge. AlgaPrime DHA is a new algae-based specialty feed ingredient designed to reduce the aquaculture industry's dependence on wild fish populations.[14][15]
TerraVia[edit]
Solazyme officially changed its name to TerraVia Holdings Inc. in March 2016 with a redefined focus on food, nutrition, and personal care. As part of the change, the company stated that its previous fuel and industrial oil products and workings would operate under Solazyme Industrials.[16]
Technology[edit]
TerraVia uses an innovative approach to grow microalgae, which allows the production process to be extremely efficient in terms of cost, scale, time, and sustainability. In contrast to common open pond and photo bioreactor approaches, TerraVia grows microalgae in the dark, inside huge stainless-steel containers. These enclosed fermentation tanks offer control, purity, and consistency for the fermentation process, as well as provide the opportunity for microalgae to be produced in a diversity of geographies and seasons. The algae can be fed a wide variety of renewable plant-based sugars, also known as feedstock flexible, and the potential feedstocks include sugarcane-based sucrose, corn-based dextrose, sugar beets, and green waste. The algae then convert the sugar into oils, lipids, and proteins, which can be used in a variety of applications, such as food ingredients and cosmetics.
The majority of TerraVia's products are produced at the joint venture facility with Bunge in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This facility utilizes Bonsucro certified sugarcane as a feedstock, which is grown on-site by Bunge. At the facility, the sugarcane byproducts- known as bagasse- are used to generate power to run the entire plant. Excess power is sent to the local grid. This makes the algae production process extremely efficient, with very little energy going to waste.
Products and Brands[edit]
Food[edit]
In 2010, Solazyme launched its first products, the Golden Chlorella line of dietary supplements, as part of a market development initiative. Products incorporating Golden Chlorella can be found at retailers including Whole Foods Market and General Nutrition Centers.
Alongside its efforts in the fuels and cosmetics industries, Solazyme began development of a food ingredient line known as AlgaVia. AlgaVia was launched in 2014 and received GRAS certification the same year.[17] With the company change in March 2016, TerraVia acquired AlgaVia as well as AlgaWise, another food ingredient brand.
The AlgaVia brand provides food manufacturers with two whole algae powders that offer sustainable, non-allergenic, vegan protein and lipids. As the name suggests, the whole algae powders use the entire algae cell, which is ground up into a fine powder. AlgaVia's Lipid-Rich Whole Algae powder is intended to add texture and reduce the need for dairy, eggs, and oils in recipes. The Protein-Rich Whole Algae powder is intended to offer an allergen and gluten-free source of vegan protein.
The AlgaWise brand sells algae-based food oils. AlgaWise features two different oils optimized for monounsaturated fat content or stability. AlgaWise Ultra Omega-9 Algae Oil offers over 90 percent monounsaturated fat and less than 4 percent saturated fat. TerraVia boasts that the oil has an extremely high smoke point and a neutral taste, making it good for frying and searing. AlgaWise High Stability Algae Oil is intended to resist oxidation and reduce the need for preservatives and extra stabilizing ingredients.
AlgaVia and AlgaWise supply algae-based ingredients to food manufacturers, such as South Coast Baking Company, Follow Your Heart, and So Delicious Dairy Free.
TerraVia is also responsible for the Thrive Algae Oil brand. Thrive is marketed as "The Best Oil For Your Heart" due to its high levels of monounsaturated fats, which are known to decrease bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Thrive has been praised by food industry professionals for its neutral taste, versatility, and high smoke point.
The Gelson's grocery chain began supplying Thrive to the Los Angeles area in 2015. Due to its success in this market, TerraVia announced it would expand the distribution of Thrive throughout the West Coast in May 2016.[18]
Aquaculture[edit]
As part of its joint venture with Bunge Limited, TerraVia supplies aquaculture feed producer BioMar with an algae-based feed ingredient known as AlgaPrime DHA.[19] AlgaPrime DHA is a source of DHA omega-3 fatty acid. which is intended to reduce the aquaculture industry's dependence on wild fish as a source of DHA. AlgaPrime DHA therefore has the potential to boost the sustainability of aquaculture and allow the aquaculture industry to grow in spite of the world's fixed supply of ocean-based DHA.[20]
Personal Care[edit]
TerraVia currently manufactures the Algenist brand for the luxury skin care market through marketing and distribution arrangements with Sephora and QVC. It is sold in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. The idea of using algae for a skincare line came from Arthur Grossman, the Chief of Genetics at Solazyme and Staff Scientist at the Carnegie Institution.[21] Grossman is an expert in algal photosynthesis and has studied how algae protect themselves from harsh environments and reasoned they could be used to protect human skin.[22]
TerraVia also markets its AlgaPūr Algae Oil brand to personal care producers. Unilever, a leading consumer goods company, is one of TerraVia's biggest partners. In 2010, Solazyme and Unilever started its partnership to develop renewable algae oils for use in soaps and other personal care products.[23] In 2011, Unilever funded TerraVia's research and development efforts, which ended in Unilever agreeing to the terms of a multi-year supply agreement.[24] In September 2013 Unilever agreed to purchase 3 million gallons of algae oil.[25] In March 2016 the companies signed a multi-year supply agreement, where Unilever has agreed to purchase over $200 million worth of a broad portfolio of renewable algae oils.[26]
Solazyme Industrials[edit]
The company has formerly engaged in development activities with Chevron, Dow Chemical, Ecopetrol, Qantas, and Unilever. Additionally, Solazyme started a brand of industrial drilling lubricant known as Encapso. Scientists were able to harness the prolific oil-producing capabilities of microalgae to create a first-of-its kind product, microencapsulated oil cells that burst only under sufficient pressure, friction, and shear.[27]
As part of the change in focus, TerraVia stated that its fuels, industrial oils, and Encapso business would be grouped together under Solazyme Industrials starting in March 2016. Furthermore, "The company will be pursuing strategic alternatives over the next 12-18 months to unlock the value created [in Solazyme Industrials]. Solazyme's objective is to identify partners who have the operational capabilities needed to realize the potential of those businesses."[28]

Company History[edit]
Founding[edit]




Founder and CEO Jonathan S. Wolfson


Solazyme, Inc., was founded on 31 March 2003, with the mission of utilizing microalgae to create a renewable source of energy and transportation fuels. Founders Jonathan S. Wolfson and Harrison Dillon, who met while attending Emory University, started the company in Wolfson's garage. About their partnership, Dillon said: "Neither of us wanted to go work for some giant organization where we were a tiny cog in a huge wheel. We wanted to make a difference and create something that had never existed before.”[2]
In 2013 Dillon announced his decision to step down from his full time position as CEO and member of Board of Directors of Solazyme and shift to a long-term consulting role focused on further developing the breadth of the technology platform and advising on intellectual property strategy.[3]
Wolfson continued on as Chairman and CEO of Solazyme until August 2016 when he stepped down and assumed the role of Executive Chairman of the Board.
TerraVia appointed Apu Mody, former President of Mars Food America, as new CEO and a member of the Board of Directors, in August 2016. Mody brings over 25 years of experience and a strong record of financial success and innovation in the CPG, Retail and Restaurant sectors. Mody stated about his appointment, “With TerraVia’s unique portfolio of ingredients that provide better nutrition and sustainability with outstanding taste, the Company is on the verge of great things. I look forward to leading the team and realizing our mission of making a difference for both people and the planet.”[4]
Initial Focus[edit]
In 2004 and 2005, Solazyme began development of an algal molecular biology platform, and identified and initiated a platform for microalgae-based oil production. The company then expanded focus on skin and personal care products.
Solazyme continued development of the algal molecular biology platform in 2006. Key microalgae strains were identified to produce oil that could be easily converted into fuels and chemicals. Through this process, Solazyme coincidentally discovered an extract from algae that demonstrated an ability to increase cell regeneration and to reduce inflammation, while protecting from UV light damage, and thereby creating alguronic acid. The company later expanded its focus to include nutrition.

In September 2007, Solazyme received a $2 million grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, signed a joint development agreement with Chevron through its division Chevron Technology Ventures, began operating in commercially sized standard industrial fermentation equipment (75,000-liter scale), worked with a third party refiner to demonstrate the compatibility of the oil with standard refining equipment, and produced over 400 liters of microalgae-based oils.
In January 2008, Solazyme was featured in Fields of Fuel, which was played at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. At the event, it presented a Mercedes Benz C320 fueled with its Soladiesel brand of algal fuel.[5]
Also in January 2008, the company announced a partnership with Chevron Technology Ventures to explore the commercialization of algal fuel.[6] Later that year, the company stated that it had produced the world's first jet fuel derived from an algal source.
In 2009, Solazyme was awarded approximately $22 million from the United States Department of Energy for the construction of an integrated biorefinery project. It also formed a contract with the United States Department of Defense to deliver microalgae-based marine (renewable F-76) diesel fuel to the United States Navy.[7]
In 2011, the company announced it had produced over 283,000 liters of military-spec diesel (HRF-76) for the United States Navy. The initial fuel production for phase 1 of a 550,000 liter contract was completed ahead of schedule.
Initial public offering[edit]
In May 2011, Solazyme set terms for its initial public offering. The company planned to raise $160 million by offering 10 million shares at a price range of $15 to $17 and ended up selling 7,901,800 shares for $20 each in its first day of trading.[8]
Investment banking and securities firm Goldman Sachs reported in July 2011 that with the commercialization of new oil products, Solazyme stock had become less risky.[9] The bank initiated coverage with a top rating and $31 target. In a note to clients, it said Solazyme (NASDAQ: TVIA) stood to boost sales and become more stable now that it had partnered with major agribusinesses like Bunge Limited.[10]
Joint Venture with Bunge Limited[edit]
On August 8, 2011, Solazyme announced a joint venture with agribusiness company Bunge Limited to develop renewable oils in Brazil using Solazyme's algae-based sugar-to-oil technology.
In April 2012, Solazyme and Bunge announced a plan to construct a shared commercial-scale production facility in Brazil.[11] As one of the world's largest vegetable oil distributors, Bunge would supply the facility with sugarcane feedstock from its sugarcane processor in Brazil for use in Solazyme's algae oil production process.
Construction of the new facility began in June 2012 and in May 2014, the joint venture plant began oil production.[12]
In late 2015, Solazyme and Bunge announced an expansion of their joint venture, which included an agreement to have Bunge market the food oils produced through the joint venture.[13]
The production of AlgaPrime DHA was announced in May 2016 and is the first product under the joint venture of TerraVia and Bunge. AlgaPrime DHA is a new algae-based specialty feed ingredient designed to reduce the aquaculture industry's dependence on wild fish populations.[14][15]
TerraVia[edit]
Solazyme officially changed its name to TerraVia Holdings Inc. in March 2016 with a redefined focus on food, nutrition, and personal care. As part of the change, the company stated that its previous fuel and industrial oil products and workings would operate under Solazyme Industrials.[16]
Technology[edit]
TerraVia uses an innovative approach to grow microalgae, which allows the production process to be extremely efficient in terms of cost, scale, time, and sustainability. In contrast to common open pond and photo bioreactor approaches, TerraVia grows microalgae in the dark, inside huge stainless-steel containers. These enclosed fermentation tanks offer control, purity, and consistency for the fermentation process, as well as provide the opportunity for microalgae to be produced in a diversity of geographies and seasons. The algae can be fed a wide variety of renewable plant-based sugars, also known as feedstock flexible, and the potential feedstocks include sugarcane-based sucrose, corn-based dextrose, sugar beets, and green waste. The algae then convert the sugar into oils, lipids, and proteins, which can be used in a variety of applications, such as food ingredients and cosmetics.
The majority of TerraVia's products are produced at the joint venture facility with Bunge in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This facility utilizes Bonsucro certified sugarcane as a feedstock, which is grown on-site by Bunge. At the facility, the sugarcane byproducts- known as bagasse- are used to generate power to run the entire plant. Excess power is sent to the local grid. This makes the algae production process extremely efficient, with very little energy going to waste.
Products and Brands[edit]
Food[edit]
In 2010, Solazyme launched its first products, the Golden Chlorella line of dietary supplements, as part of a market development initiative. Products incorporating Golden Chlorella can be found at retailers including Whole Foods Market and General Nutrition Centers.
Alongside its efforts in the fuels and cosmetics industries, Solazyme began development of a food ingredient line known as AlgaVia. AlgaVia was launched in 2014 and received GRAS certification the same year.[17] With the company change in March 2016, TerraVia acquired AlgaVia as well as AlgaWise, another food ingredient brand.
The AlgaVia brand provides food manufacturers with two whole algae powders that offer sustainable, non-allergenic, vegan protein and lipids. As the name suggests, the whole algae powders use the entire algae cell, which is ground up into a fine powder. AlgaVia's Lipid-Rich Whole Algae powder is intended to add texture and reduce the need for dairy, eggs, and oils in recipes. The Protein-Rich Whole Algae powder is intended to offer an allergen and gluten-free source of vegan protein.
The AlgaWise brand sells algae-based food oils. AlgaWise features two different oils optimized for monounsaturated fat content or stability. AlgaWise Ultra Omega-9 Algae Oil offers over 90 percent monounsaturated fat and less than 4 percent saturated fat. TerraVia boasts that the oil has an extremely high smoke point and a neutral taste, making it good for frying and searing. AlgaWise High Stability Algae Oil is intended to resist oxidation and reduce the need for preservatives and extra stabilizing ingredients.
AlgaVia and AlgaWise supply algae-based ingredients to food manufacturers, such as South Coast Baking Company, Follow Your Heart, and So Delicious Dairy Free.
TerraVia is also responsible for the Thrive Algae Oil brand. Thrive is marketed as "The Best Oil For Your Heart" due to its high levels of monounsaturated fats, which are known to decrease bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Thrive has been praised by food industry professionals for its neutral taste, versatility, and high smoke point.
The Gelson's grocery chain began supplying Thrive to the Los Angeles area in 2015. Due to its success in this market, TerraVia announced it would expand the distribution of Thrive throughout the West Coast in May 2016.[18]
Aquaculture[edit]
As part of its joint venture with Bunge Limited, TerraVia supplies aquaculture feed producer BioMar with an algae-based feed ingredient known as AlgaPrime DHA.[19] AlgaPrime DHA is a source of DHA omega-3 fatty acid. which is intended to reduce the aquaculture industry's dependence on wild fish as a source of DHA. AlgaPrime DHA therefore has the potential to boost the sustainability of aquaculture and allow the aquaculture industry to grow in spite of the world's fixed supply of ocean-based DHA.[20]
Personal Care[edit]
TerraVia currently manufactures the Algenist brand for the luxury skin care market through marketing and distribution arrangements with Sephora and QVC. It is sold in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. The idea of using algae for a skincare line came from Arthur Grossman, the Chief of Genetics at Solazyme and Staff Scientist at the Carnegie Institution.[21] Grossman is an expert in algal photosynthesis and has studied how algae protect themselves from harsh environments and reasoned they could be used to protect human skin.[22]
TerraVia also markets its AlgaPūr Algae Oil brand to personal care producers. Unilever, a leading consumer goods company, is one of TerraVia's biggest partners. In 2010, Solazyme and Unilever started its partnership to develop renewable algae oils for use in soaps and other personal care products.[23] In 2011, Unilever funded TerraVia's research and development efforts, which ended in Unilever agreeing to the terms of a multi-year supply agreement.[24] In September 2013 Unilever agreed to purchase 3 million gallons of algae oil.[25] In March 2016 the companies signed a multi-year supply agreement, where Unilever has agreed to purchase over $200 million worth of a broad portfolio of renewable algae oils.[26]
Solazyme Industrials[edit]
The company has formerly engaged in development activities with Chevron, Dow Chemical, Ecopetrol, Qantas, and Unilever. Additionally, Solazyme started a brand of industrial drilling lubricant known as Encapso. Scientists were able to harness the prolific oil-producing capabilities of microalgae to create a first-of-its kind product, microencapsulated oil cells that burst only under sufficient pressure, friction, and shear.[27]
As part of the change in focus, TerraVia stated that its fuels, industrial oils, and Encapso business would be grouped together under Solazyme Industrials starting in March 2016. Furthermore, "The company will be pursuing strategic alternatives over the next 12-18 months to unlock the value created [in Solazyme Industrials]. Solazyme's objective is to identify partners who have the operational capabilities needed to realize the potential of those businesses."[28]
Sustainability Principles and Commitments[edit]
Principles and Sustainability[edit]
TerraVia sets a goal of providing replacements for unsustainable products like palm and soybean oil. The brand's food ingredients seek to provide a healthy alternative to animal-based lipids and proteins.
According to its sustainability report, TerraVia states that "transparency is central to all of our sustainability principles."[29] TerraVia supports this goal with a number of commitments, which include engaging with and asking for stakeholders' inputs, publishing product data in peer-reviewed journals, and openly communicating about the production of its products.
As part of this transparency, TerraVia has made information regarding the environmental impacts of its products publicly available.
Life Cycle Analyses[edit]
TerraVia had the third party organization Thinkstep conduct life cycle analyses on its products in order to assess their environmental impacts in comparison to other oils. The results show that algae oil production often has significantly lower environmental impacts in comparison to traditional oil sources.[29]
A life cycle analysis conducted in 2016 compared the sugarcane-fed algae oil produced at the Solazyme Bunge joint venture facility in Brazil against soybean, tallow, palm kernel, olive, palm, canola, and sunflower oil in terms of its carbon emissions and water consumption. Thinkstep found that the algae oil was on par with sunflower oil in terms of global warming potential per kilogram of oil produced. All other oils compared had higher carbon emissions. Algae oil also had the second lowest impact in water consumption, second to canola oil.[29]
The company also analyzed the land impact of its algae oil compared to traditional oils. It found that the algae oil is comparitive to palm oil in land use efficiency, with both algae and palm yielding more than six times the amount of oil per hectare than any other oil producing crop.[29]
The Thinkstep life cycle analysis highlights the advantages of producing algae oil over traditional oil sources in regards to the environmental impacts of oil production.

TerraVia Goes On The Offensive To Protect Its Ingredients - TerraVia Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:TVIA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»TerraVia Goes On The Offensive To Protect Its IngredientsDec.22.16 | About: TerraVia Holdings, (TVIA) Kevin Quon Insider ownership, small-cap, long-term horizon, dividend investingInvesting in the Lives of OthersSummaryTerraVia has suspended its supply of ingredients to the maker of Soylent.The customer had not provided any evidence of a meaningful investigation to support throwing TerraVia under the bus for its latest troubles.TerraVia has also successfully defended the intellectual property for these ingredients through an appeal process pursued by former joint venture partner Roquette Freres SA.To say that microalgae ingredients specialist TerraVia Holdings (TVIA) has seen its unfair share of roadblocks remains an understatement worthy of reflection many years from now. Yet, for today, the leading provider of algae ingredients and tailored algal oils has once again managed to defend its leading product platform from opponents on multiple sides. As the company looks forward to ramp up the production of its many ingredients, it has also taken the bold step of protecting its reputation by going on the offensive and dropping a troublesome customer. At the same time, the company has received a favorable ruling regarding the exclusive ownership of its intellectual property. In the present, TerraVia appears to be a struggling company that is worthy of long-term speculation, but surrounded by near-term uncertainties. In the past few days, TerraVia has released two press releases referring to two separate issues that the company has surely wished had never occurred in the first place. These press releases can be found here and here. While the court decision was a strong victory for TerraVia, the loss of Soylent as a partner was bittersweet. By publicly shaming Soylent, TerraVia was effectively throwing down the gauntlet. In an admirable maneuver to defend some of its key ingredients, TerraVia needed to go on the offensive in order to clear its ingredient's reputation after a poorly handled deflection by Soylent. Soylent was publicly accusing algae flour to be the source of its problems. By effectively blaming TerraVia's flagship ingredient made by the only producer of that product, Soylent was also knowingly attacking TerraVia. As such, TerraVia has now responded by cutting its supply chain to Soylent. This also included cutting off ingredients that were not cited to be problematic (i.e. algal oil) and which are vital to some of Soylent's other products.
 Let us quickly recap on these current difficulties. On the one hand, TerraVia's former joint venture partner Roquette has continued to pursue legal action in an attempt to escape its guilty verdict for trying to steal TerraVia's intellectual property used to create algae ingredients. On the other hand, one of TerraVia's most attention-grabbing customers was quick to publicly blame algae flour when significantly less than 0.1% of its customers began to assert that particular product caused adverse reactions. Therefore, with a touch of irony, while one of TerraVia's opponents has aggressively attempted to grab the value found in TerraVia's ingredients, another has publicly suggested that these ingredients have no value in order to deflect its current woes over some unexplained nausea experienced by a fraction of its customers. The Soylent Problem To understand why TerraVia felt it was necessary to suspend its supply of ingredients to Rosa Labs, the producer of Soylent, it's important to first understand some context. As a brand, Soylent has thrived on the notoriety of its name, which shares an iconic reference to a future food made from dead people. It was in its success to convert that negative connotation into a sticky awareness for its brand as a novel food supplement that has made Rosa Labs the target it is today. (Image Source)

 By branding its product the way it did, popular media was only all too happy to share their doubts for the bold product, and the majority of opinions provided skepticism waiting for that "I-told-you-so" moment in which a misstep by Soylent would spiral into its imminent failure. As such, Soylent was derided when problems arose and its popularity grew regardless, as public interest remained intrigued and expectations remained low. As long as editorial opinions remained just opinions, negative publicity actually grew the brand.
 Yet, when Rosa Labs reacted to a perceived problem found in its new food bars and powder, it directed a negative light on itself in a way that it was unable to spin away. Simply put, the public began to believe that Soylent as a brand was causing people to get sick. More so, the rapid response to pull down the food bars and powder in order to reformulate them heightened the fear that this was a real significant problem and that the company was unable to control it. Negative publicity was now affecting sales. (Image Source)

 Rosa Labs has rapidly grown and its future success continues to rest on its ability to capitalize on its ongoing sales momentum. The company only recently became profitable, and its ability to grow and survive is determined by its ability to rapidly scale. For example, Rosa Labs posted on its blog how it was able to price Soylent's unit cost the way it has based on its sales projections. Therefore, any extended disruption to the sales momentum could have a meaningful impact on the direction of the company overall and to the viability of its products. It was in this context that the Rosa Labs needed to find something to blame as soon as possible in order to prevent lengthy disruptions. Only a few new ingredients were added into its new food bars, so it would be believable that removing one or some of these ingredients would address the problem. There is little doubt that the idea of algae as a food ingredient also shared some negative connotations of its own. The ability to divert all of Soylent's negative attention onto algae may have seemed to be an easy course of action. Was Algae Really The Issue? While TerraVia has strongly protested that it has been wrongly accused for the adverse food reactions that caused some of Soylent's consumers to have gastrointestinal issues, popular media had already begun to accept this theory as truth. The damage it was now causing to the brand of TerraVia's ingredients forced TerraVia's hand to go on the offensive. In its press release, TerraVia quoted a food industry expert who clearly stated there simply was no evidence for Rosa Labs to single out a particular ingredient in light of its complex mixture. The inability for Rosa Labs to provide data to support its accusations to TerraVia also provides some skepticism. It also suggested that Rosa Labs had indeed failed to conduct a thorough investigation.
 An even more intriguing look into the discussion board post that prompted this public spat also suggests that food sensitivities to one particular ingredient aren't even the issue at all. This is an argument that would go against what Rosa Labs is publicly accusing. A compilation of the complaints can be found in the discussion board post found here. Of the 58 documented reports, it is key to note that the majority of the claims have also reported having no problems eating the Soylent food bars in prior experiences. This stands as a rather stark red flag when one evaluates whether a particular food ingredient is the root cause of a food sensitivity or allergic reaction. It makes little sense for a person that is sensitive to a particular food ingredient to go through numerous instances of a product without issues, but later find one particular experience to suddenly be troubling. This is more indicative of some form of contamination or a poor formulation of a particular batch. Some of these responses can be found in the graphic below. (Image based on comments found here)

 Regardless of Soylent's logic to blame TerraVia's ingredients, investors of TerraVia now find themselves burdened by the hassle of a disrupted reputation. It has even caused at least one contributor writer to predict that this fiasco could be the end of the company itself. While this claim seems rather premature in my own opinion, there is no denying that it has put TerraVia in a less than ideal position. Soylent was one of the fastest adopters of algae flour and undoubtedly served as one of its most high-profile clients revealed thus far. While simple math based on volumes would suggest that the company wasn't a meaningful contributor of revenue to TerraVia, the brand served as a first impression for those who may have never heard of algae ingredients before. In the end, the need for Rosa Labs to blame shift may have caused meaningful damage to the reputation of one or several of TerraVia's flagship products.
 The real question investors should now be asking is if this experience has severely disrupted the future products that more reputable companies have been in the process of developing. As noted in this Food Navigator article found here, larger companies put in far more development time than Rosa Labs did in order to prevent the very issues that arose in the company's food bars. On average, the development cycle takes two to three years. With the majority of TerraVia's partners now undergoing this development process to incorporate the company's food ingredients, investors may simply never know how many have been set back because of these accusations by Soylent. The Third Time's The Charm Concerning the issue revolving around Roquette Freres S.A., TerraVia has now undergone several years of litigation in order to protect its intellectual property from this former partner. Roquette has now argued before an arbitration panel and failed. It had subsequently pursued a favorable lower court decision and failed. Roquette then subsequently filed an appeal and has now officially failed. The opinion of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit can be found here. With Roquette's legal options now dwindling, investors in TerraVia should be much more assured that the company is on a solid foundation for protecting its monopoly over these unique algae ingredients. In the outcome of this appeals process, TerraVia will now strengthen its intellectual property. The company is to gain all of the patent applications filed on behalf of Solazyme Roquette Nutritionals. It will also gain all of the "know-how" developed by SRN for high lipid algae flour and high protein algae protein. In addition, the company will receive all of Roquette's patent applications filed since November 2010 regarding microalgae food and food ingredients. Last of all, the original arbitration panel judgment required that Roquette pay TerraVia $2.3 million in legal costs and fees, and this was upheld in the court's decision.
 While the results of this case may seem miniscule at first, the longer-term implications are much more important. Investors should bear in mind that TerraVia has developed a unique set of algae ingredients that are highly differentiated because of their favorable taste, color, functionality, profile, etc. One of the primary reasons that microalgae has not been fully explored as a food ingredient has been because of these underlying barriers. Whereas traditional Chlorella (a type of common algae used in supplements) would taste fishy and have a green color, TerraVia's production process allows a much greater degree of flexibility. The company can grow algae in a fermentation process to increase the amount of fat or protein and it can mask some of the issues found in color and taste. In doing so, TerraVia's process enables a more versatile and functional ingredient that can be incorporated without detection by the average consumer. Protected by its intellectual property shield, the company has been able to control an effective monopoly as the sole supplier of these ingredients. A loss to Roquette would have led to an unnecessary duopoly. This is important as algae is only now beginning to permeate throughout the shopping aisles of grocery stores. It is widely believed that brands are just beginning to realize the favorable properties of microalgae as a new food ingredient. A Look At TerraVia Now TerraVia now trades with a market capitalization of $103 million based on its last share price of $1.15 as of December 21. TerraVia has been in an extended decline as the company continues to accrue losses in light of limited production to date. Much of the company's revenue is still derived from research and development and its limited product revenue has actually declined from $2.25 million in Q3 2015 to $0.71 million in Q3 2016. 


 TerraVia's net loss has also declined in a more meaningful fashion this past year as the company sought to tighten its expenses. This can be seen in the graphic above. While losses are expected to continue for some time, the company has been effective at extending the life of its cash reserves. At the end of 2015, TerraVia had $97.98 million in cash and marketable securities. By the end of September 2016, the company had $87.80 million in cash and marketable securities remaining. The partial divestment of Algenist over the past year has helped to limit the loss in cash. While actual product sales have been slow to date due to manufacturing issues and lengthy development cycles, sales are expected to increase over the coming year as the company advances several of its product lines at its joint venture plant in Brazil. Investors should bear in mind that the majority of the company's sales at this primary facility will not likely revolve around the ingredients mentioned over the past two press releases. Based on the company's Q3 2016 earnings call it appears that a greater emphasis will be placed upon larger campaigns prioritized by AlgaPur and AlgaPrime DHA instead. As such, personal care oils and ingredients for animal nutrition will be the primary emphasis for the company in the near term. Ongoing introductions for AlgaVia algae powders will continue to be a longer-term ambition as lengthy product development cycles and adoption cycles limit a near-term contribution from this segment. Final Thoughts Despite the company's new found focus on food ingredients and specialty personal care ingredients, the near-term ramifications of a damaged reputation to AlgaVia should have a limited impact on TerraVia. For now, investors should consider TerraVia to be a personal care ingredient provider and a supplier of animal nutrition products. Even the company's successful food oil brand of Thrive is unlikely to make a significant difference in comparison to what AlgaPrime and AlgaPur are expected to accomplish through Moema in the short term. Because the production facility in Brazil maintains a manufacturing capacity nearly 50 times that of the company's smaller facility dedicated to food ingredients, the corresponding economic impact for food ingredients is likely to remain relatively small for some time.
 There is little doubt that shareholder interest in the company has significantly dwindled over the past year as marked by the declining share price. The continued problems that arise have done little to remind investors of the unique position that TerraVia actually finds itself in. Despite being a monopolistic producer of unique and novel ingredients that can be utilized throughout many industries, concerns over the company's ability to become profitable based on past performance have significantly affected the company's current share price. All the same, investors should remember that such judgment is being passed before the company has even begun to truly commercialize its primary products, which it expects to do over the coming year. As an investor in TerraVia, I myself plan to continue holding my position for the extended long-term. I am reminded that over a dozen years have been put into the development of the company's platform, and the hurdles that management now face appear to be far from as challenging as those in the past. As an investor, I do not doubt that additional capital may be needed in the future which may dilute my position. This is a risk that every investor should evaluate on the basis of their own tolerance. The value in TerraVia remains in the long-term future of its current product portfolio. The company has the ability to play a meaningful role in the progressive change to a food system that is looking to be healthier, more natural and more sustainable. What makes TerraVia stand out is that it has the solution to accomplish each of these without making the sacrifice to critical properties like favorable taste and functionality. While the journey to the present has been difficult for investors to bear, I find it easy to not lose sight of the future, having tried and tasted the company's products out myself. For what it is worth, it is also worth mentioning that I did not get sick.

Production Begins To Rapidly Ramp At TerraVia's Joint Venture - TerraVia Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:TVIA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Production Begins To Rapidly Ramp At TerraVia's Joint VentureMar.11.17 | About: TerraVia Holdings, (TVIA) Kevin Quon Insider ownership, small-cap, long-term horizon, dividend investingInvesting in the Lives of OthersSummaryTerraVia revealed an ongoing ramp of production at its joint venture facility in Brazil.The company will see slowing reported revenue due to a heavy focus on its joint venture where revenue is experiencing triple-digit growth.TerraVia expects to see positive EBITDA at the joint venture in early 2018.Animal nutrition and personal care ingredients remain the key target markets for the near future.TerraVia Holdings (TVIA) remains a long-term speculative investment, but not one without near-term uncertainty. In the present, the company continues to walk a fine line through the balancing act of scaling production at its joint venture facility in Brazil and limiting its ongoing cash burn. In the near future, the company expects to profitably produce product at its 50%-owned joint venture facility in Brazil through revenue expected to range from $200 to $300 million annually. By year-end, this plant is expected to produce $25-30 million, up from $9.8 million in 2016. At the same time, the company's much smaller plant in Illinois will continue to incubate the long-term ambitions of its promising pipeline found in food ingredients. (Image Source) 

 Yet today, with cash balances continuing to decline amidst losses that are slowly improving, TerraVia is making difficult choices in its quest to make do with less. At the core of the issue is how to balance the most profitable product lines in order to achieve the greatest scale efficiencies with the least amount of cash. While market commercialization times for the company's new products continue to prove frustrating for investors, practical scaling is ultimately proving it necessary for TerraVia to limit its focus onto two key product lines. This remains ideal in order to maximize efficiencies in scale to lower costs and optimize production. As a result, investors should place their greatest attention on TerraVia's first product lines of AlgaPur and AlgaPrime, which will make up the largest volume coming out of the joint venture facility in the immediate future.
 On Wednesday, TerraVia announced its earnings results for 2016, shedding further light with an update on the progress now underway in Brazil. Most positively, it appears that the joint venture facility is well on its way to scaling commercial production higher after several years of stalled performance due to construction woes and pre-ramp modifications. The company reported that the SB Oils joint venture tripled revenue to $9.8 million in 2016 from a light base figure of $3.1 million in 2015. The company is forecasting that revenue will maintain this rapid growth rate to a range of $25 million to $30 million in 2017. (Image Source) 

 Yet with a simultaneous focus on fiscal discipline, company-reported revenues outside of the joint venture will continue to shrink to $10 to $15 million in 2017 from $18.5 million in 2016. The sale of Algenist, along with the refocus away from industrial oils, will continue to put company-reported sales in decline. This has the less than ideal circumstance in which revenue is growing in one business area and declining in the other. Yet aware of its fiscal situation, TerraVia remains focused on reducing operating expenses in the company-owned operations while also sustaining at a minimum a channel for developing its promising pipeline of food ingredients. Given the amount of attention that has been given to the company's whole algae ingredients, culinary oil, and algae butter, it's important for investors to remember that commercial production has been quite limited to date and will be for some time. This is particularly the case considering that such production is coming out of the small facility in Illinois. Nevertheless, these products should continue to be viewed as playing a critical role for the company in the future as TerraVia further entrenches itself in a multi-billion dollar market for healthy and sustainable food ingredients.
 Indeed, recent developments prove that TerraVia is continuing to make enviable progress in its path towards market penetration for its pipeline. In late January, TerraVia announced progress with its culinary oil product selling under the brand of Thrive. The company announced that Bon Appetit Management Company would designate the product as its preferred oil, thereby spurring on its adoption across the nation in its many high-end locations. Bon Appetit operates more than 650 cafes across 33 states and serves high-quality meals in specialty venues, including Google, University of Pennsylvania, and the Getty Center. Yet, more importantly in this new relationship is the fact that Bon Appetit operates as a subsidiary of Compass Group (CMPGY), the world's largest food service provider. Partnering with another well-entrenched industry titan, TerraVia continues to slowly expand its reach to the highest-volume consumers of its target markets. In one of the most promising developments that was simultaneously announced, it was noted that TerraVia and Compass Group also entered into a supply agreement via Foodbuy, the specialty purchasing division of Compass Group. As such, the company is likely to begin selling increasing volumes of its product. Indeed, Thrive Algae was elsewhere seen being distributed in large 5-gallon containers, which further supports the thesis that higher volumes are finally beginning to ship. (Image Source) 

 Yet, despite the excitement behind the company's food ingredient pipeline for human consumption, by and large the real attention must inherently be given to the animal nutrition markets in the near future. As noted by the company, AlgaPrime DHA in particular is expected to be being heavily weighted in terms of production mix at the company's joint venture facility in Brazil. The product is expected to help drive the joint venture to profitability, and market penetration remains key. After all, by no means is TerraVia alone in commercializing algae-derived omega-3 oils for the fish nutrition market. However, armed with the largest facilities capable of the highest economies of scale and equipped with a superior product capable of higher DHA yields, TerraVia is well positioned to make a meaningful impact in this developing market for algae oil. The company recently released a promotional video for AlgaPrime DHA found here.

 Wednesday's announcement of an expanded partnership with BioMar further reinforces the direction the company has taken towards addressing this market. The relationship with the industry heavyweight continues to prove the increased demand for a new market that can effectively break a reliance on fish-based DHA. For TerraVia, this budding market appears to hit the ideal sweet spot. Small fish used for the extraction of omega-3 oils have long hit their supply ceiling, and the rising demand for fish reliant on these small fish (such as salmon) has been steadily growing as aquaculture continues to expand. (Image Source) 

 TerraVia now trades with a market capitalization of $76.5 million based on the intraday share price of $0.84 as of March 10. As of December 2016, the company had on its books total assets of $135.7 million, of which total liabilities amounted to $192.3 million. Shareholder's deficit increased from $46.5 million to $82.2 million over the past year. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities decreased from $98 million in 2015 to $64 million in 2016. It is worth reminding that the company sold a majority stake in Algenist this past year, however, which helped to increase the amount of cash available over 2016. For TerraVia, 2017 will be an important year to further reduce operating expenses on the company-owned side while simultaneously allowing its joint venture to ramp up at its rapid pace. It will be a tough challenge for CEO Apu Mody, but one that shouldn't be viewed as improbable or impossible. Access to capital will be an important part of 2017, however, and the ability to divest off non-core assets will be something to watch over the coming year.
 There is no denying that TerraVia has seen better days, but at the same time, it is also clear that the company sits on a large mound of untapped value. The intellectual property of TerraVia alone makes the company an attractive buyout target should the situation further deteriorate. While this would be a slap in the face to the most dedicated of long-term investors, myself included, this fact alone continues to warrant an ongoing investment in the company at these levels. With multiple commercialized and late-stage development products capable of penetrating multi-billion dollar industries, I personally find that the company should be able to fetch a valuation in excess of $100 million. For those who have followed the company's dramatic saga over the past few years, there are few companies that seemed to have had so much going for it and yet fallen so short after half a decade as a public company. Like watching a dark comedy filled with improbable circumstances, TerraVia has had to endure much hardship. A collapsing industry window for financing, a partner who turned into a thief, multiple shifts in market dynamics, new construction failures, and relentless activism filled with hypocrisy have all played their part in chipping away at the company once fortified with a strong cash war chest and a revolutionary technology platform. The story remains to be told if TerraVia will be able to fully develop its promising pipeline in the manner in which it truly deserves. Yet for now, growth that has eluded the company for years is finally beginning to take shape. The joint venture is on pace for triple-digit revenue growth rates leading to EBITDA profitability in early 2018. However, the focus of this year will surely be on shoring up the company's balance sheet as well. I expect asset sales and a bridge loan in the near future. While market skepticism continues to guide share prices lower, I personally find myself willing to buy as long as the company's market capitalization remains under $100 million simply based on its long-term potential. This is predicated on company's asset values, the quality of the company's partnerships, the promising pipeline and products now being commercialized, and the over half billion dollars that has already been invested into the company's platform since its inception. Expectations of positive EBITDA for SB Oils in 2018 remains the key target announced by management for investors to place their ambitions on.
 Long-term investors should also dwell on the idea that TerraVia owns multiple key ingredients now being commercialized or which exist in late stage development. Each of these products can individually address multi-billion dollar markets on their own. While production and market penetration remain current bottlenecks at present in light of falling cash reserves, a long-term view on such speculation leaves me willing to stay invested. Ongoing debt reduction and a potential bridge loan would greatly aid the company in light of its currently restrained growth. I expect that we will see some measure to address the issue of capital in the coming year. Naturally, the speculative risk that I personally take is balanced according to my own portfolio's stability. At present, TerraVia makes up 2.48% of my current portfolio, designating it as my 11th largest holding. It is a position I am willing to further accumulate in over time, but not one that I would want to grow to over 3% of my portfolio until it proves capable of steady profitability.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
