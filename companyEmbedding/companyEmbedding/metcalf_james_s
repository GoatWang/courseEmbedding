James Metcalf Wants to Make USG Less Cyclical

							The USG chief executive discusses the wallboard maker’s future strategy, how he makes tough decisions and his father’s influence on him.

The night before USG Corp. CEO James Metcalf met Warren
    Buffett for the first time, he couldnt sleep. I was
    scared to death, says Metcalf, who was then president of
    the wallboard maker. Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway had
    bought $300 million worth of convertible notes from USG in
    2008, when the company was reeling from the housing crisis. But
    Metcalf says the Berkshire chairman and CEO immediately put him
    at ease, offering up great ideas and asking spot-on
    questions.
These days Metcalf still cant sleep before he sees
    Buffett, who is USGs largest shareholder, with a stake of
    approximately 30 percent. But now its because of
    excitement. You always get an invaluable nugget from
    him, says Metcalf, 56. He admires Buffetts
    accessibility  the legendary investor always takes
    Metcalfs calls. He was shocked when Buffett once offered
    to drive him to the airport in Omaha, Nebraska, but he realized
    that the investor makes sure he gets out in the world and
    learns as much as he can from people.
Metcalf prides himself on his ability to field ideas from
    all over USG and from its customers, avoiding the isolation
    many CEOs face. Even with the recent unrest in Thailand,
    where we now have operations, I went directly to the general
    manager, and he gave the perspective of whats happening
    on the streets on the other side of the world, Metcalf
    explains. I wanted to hear it directly.
The USG chief executive has spent his entire career at the
    Chicago-based company. After graduating from Ohio State
    University in 1980 with a BA in criminal justice, Metcalf
     who grew up in Toronto, Ohio, the son of a steelworker
     drove from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles to try to persuade
    a USG manager to hire him as a sales trainee. Even though the
    opening had been filled, Metcalf was determined, checking in
    every few weeks. After several months one of the trainees quit,
    and Metcalf got his offer.
He rose through USGs ranks, holding positions in
    sales, marketing and strategy. In 1999, Metcalf became chief
    operating officer of L&W Supply Corp., USGs
    distribution company; he became L&Ws CEO a year
    later. He was named president of USGs building systems
    unit in 2004. Two years later he became president of the
    company. He says hes never asked anybody to do anything
    he hasnt done himself. Some of the big changes
    weve made over the past five years, weve embraced
    in part because people knew I didnt come parachuting in
    from a consulting firm with crazy ideas, he explains.
    I can shoot e-mails out to the field or to customers to
    see whats really going on. 
New ideas have been essential for USG (whose initials stand
    for United States Gypsum), a 112-year-old company that is one
    of the largest makers of gypsum wallboard in North America and
    the U.S.s biggest distributor of drywall and building
    products. That distinction put it at the center of the
    decades-long fight over asbestos, a fire-prevention material
    that was a minor ingredient in its wallboard but later proved
    to cause certain types of cancer. USG sought bankruptcy
    protection from asbestos litigation in 2002. It emerged from
    Chapter 11 in 2006, paying $4 billion to the plaintiffs
    bar to settle all future claims. But the massive payment came
    18 months before the worst housing crisis since the Great
    Depression. In 2008, USG sold $400 million worth of notes to investors,
    including Buffetts Berkshire, to help keep itself afloat.
    The notes have since been converted to stock.
Metcalf took over as CEO on January 1, 2011, succeeding
    William Foote, who had run the company for 20 years and managed
    through the recession by cutting costs and closing less
    efficient plants. The company was suffering, with revenues in
    all three segments  housing, repair and remodel, and
    commercial construction  down by about half. When Metcalf
    took the top job, he had to think through the companys
    core businesses, shed what wasnt central and evaluate
    viable options for expanding and diversifying its revenue base.
    I really appreciate the heritage of the company, but I
    knew I had to do something different so we could be more
    agile, he says. By the first quarter of 2013, the company
    was profitable again; at a recent price of $31, its shares have
    nearly doubled since Metcalf became chief executive. Senior
    Writer Julie Segal recently met with the CEO at
    Institutional Investors offices. Metcalf talked
    about USGs future strategy, how he makes tough decisions
    and his fathers influence on him.
Institutional Investor: USG has been through some
    tough times. What was it like during the depths of the housing
    pullback?
Metcalf: I was president in the middle of
    this small D depression. Im really big on
    strategy and thinking a thousand days out. We put together a
    strategy team to say, What do we need to do to
    differentiate ourselves? What is core? We identified our
    North American manufacturing and distribution as core 
    that was the cash cow. But they were under attack because of
    the depression. So we idled high-cost plants and delayered the
    organization. Its like going in and getting a physical,
    but then you have to put yourself through a plan.
What wasnt core?
I first looked at Europe. We had a business there, but it
    didnt have critical mass or a full product line. And we
    didnt have the balance sheet to make a big acquisition.
    Lafarge, the cement company, was divesting its wallboard
    business, but the timing was bad for us. At the same time,
    Europe is aging quickly, and the 
    macroeconomics didnt excite me; were driven by
    household formation and the like. We decided we couldnt
    win and sold our European assets in 2012. We took those
    resources and reinvested in the Middle East, Asia and
    Australia. Weed and feed, I call it. In that fast-growing part
    of the world, we could win. I wanted to think big, start out
    incremental and move fast. I still didnt have a lot of
    resources. So we invested in Oman and started putting a
    footprint in India.
Youve taken a unique approach to emerging
    markets by establishing joint ventures, including one with
    Australian building-materials maker Boral. Why?
These markets are very fragmented  great for
    diversifying our earnings but hard to get a foothold in. We
    just entered into a 50-50 joint venture with Boral, which gives
    us a 40 percent market share in 12 countries. Every
    countrys economy is a little different. Indonesia is
    extremely busy. Australia is flat. South Korea is a little bit
    like the U.S., up somewhat. Vietnam is emerging. China is
    China. But people ask how an American company can win there.
    What do we know about Vietnam? Well, now we have partners that
    have been there for 40 years, and they wanted us for our
    technology and our innovation.
Technology innovation isnt the first thing
    that springs to mind when I think of USG.
Well, we are an innovator. Absolutely. We introduced a
    product here in the midst of the recession that took a third
    out of the weight of the product. If you look at plasterboard,
    its two sheets of paper with plaster of paris in the
    middle. We figured out a way to take out a third of the weight
    while keeping its strength intact. In the Far East, where
    its very humid, everything sags. Our partners wanted this
    innovation and paid us for it. In fact, the JV was kicked off
    when the CEO of Boral called me to ask how he could get
    UltraLight, as its called. UltraLight really strengthened
    our North American business. In New York City, where drywall
    hangers make $105 an hour, its also huge, as workers can
    do more in less time.
How does your company foster innovation and new
    ideas?
We have approximately 100 people in our research
    center. We also partner with universities, tapping into
    their Ph.D. programs. Its called open innovation. We
    copied start-ups operating in Silicon Valley. We wanted new and
    different ideas. And from a financial standpoint, it
    variablized a fixed cost. If business gets better, we get more
    interns from the Ph.D. program. Business slows up, we get
    fewer. We did this through the recession because we had to
    create our own recovery. Our shareholders shouldnt say,
    Jims job is to wait for the recovery. We
    wanted to create it.
So you want to make USG less cyclical?
Yes, otherwise shareholders say, Whats
    management doing? We diversified our earnings, adding 12
    countries. Were focusing on innovation and coming out
    with a new mousetrap, like UltraLight. The third area is
    were using technology to tie together our entire network.
    Our business is very regional; Texas might be busier than the
    Pacific Northwest. We run a network, so were always
    delivering at the lowest manufacturing and delivery cost. Now
    think of this. You take out a third of the weight; you get a
    third more on a truck. Our distributors need a third less
    equipment. UltraLight saves you fuel, is more sustainable and
    has a smaller carbon footprint. Everyone thought wallboard was
    a commodity, but we changed the rules.

    knew I had to do something different so we could be more
    agile, he says. By the first quarter of 2013, the company
    was profitable again; at a recent price of $31, its shares have
    nearly doubled since Metcalf became chief executive. Senior
    Writer Julie Segal recently met with the CEO at
    Institutional Investors offices. Metcalf talked
    about USGs future strategy, how he makes tough decisions
    and his fathers influence on him.
Institutional Investor: USG has been through some
    tough times. What was it like during the depths of the housing
    pullback?
Metcalf: I was president in the middle of
    this small D depression. Im really big on
    strategy and thinking a thousand days out. We put together a
    strategy team to say, What do we need to do to
    differentiate ourselves? What is core? We identified our
    North American manufacturing and distribution as core 
    that was the cash cow. But they were under attack because of
    the depression. So we idled high-cost plants and delayered the
    organization. Its like going in and getting a physical,
    but then you have to put yourself through a plan.
What wasnt core?
I first looked at Europe. We had a business there, but it
    didnt have critical mass or a full product line. And we
    didnt have the balance sheet to make a big acquisition.
    Lafarge, the cement company, was divesting its wallboard
    business, but the timing was bad for us. At the same time,
    Europe is aging quickly, and the 
    macroeconomics didnt excite me; were driven by
    household formation and the like. We decided we couldnt
    win and sold our European assets in 2012. We took those
    resources and reinvested in the Middle East, Asia and
    Australia. Weed and feed, I call it. In that fast-growing part
    of the world, we could win. I wanted to think big, start out
    incremental and move fast. I still didnt have a lot of
    resources. So we invested in Oman and started putting a
    footprint in India.
Youve taken a unique approach to emerging
    markets by establishing joint ventures, including one with
    Australian building-materials maker Boral. Why?
These markets are very fragmented  great for
    diversifying our earnings but hard to get a foothold in. We
    just entered into a 50-50 joint venture with Boral, which gives
    us a 40 percent market share in 12 countries. Every
    countrys economy is a little different. Indonesia is
    extremely busy. Australia is flat. South Korea is a little bit
    like the U.S., up somewhat. Vietnam is emerging. China is
    China. But people ask how an American company can win there.
    What do we know about Vietnam? Well, now we have partners that
    have been there for 40 years, and they wanted us for our
    technology and our innovation.
Technology innovation isnt the first thing
    that springs to mind when I think of USG.
Well, we are an innovator. Absolutely. We introduced a
    product here in the midst of the recession that took a third
    out of the weight of the product. If you look at plasterboard,
    its two sheets of paper with plaster of paris in the
    middle. We figured out a way to take out a third of the weight
    while keeping its strength intact. In the Far East, where
    its very humid, everything sags. Our partners wanted this
    innovation and paid us for it. In fact, the JV was kicked off
    when the CEO of Boral called me to ask how he could get
    UltraLight, as its called. UltraLight really strengthened
    our North American business. In New York City, where drywall
    hangers make $105 an hour, its also huge, as workers can
    do more in less time.
How does your company foster innovation and new
    ideas?
We have approximately 100 people in our research
    center. We also partner with universities, tapping into
    their Ph.D. programs. Its called open innovation. We
    copied start-ups operating in Silicon Valley. We wanted new and
    different ideas. And from a financial standpoint, it
    variablized a fixed cost. If business gets better, we get more
    interns from the Ph.D. program. Business slows up, we get
    fewer. We did this through the recession because we had to
    create our own recovery. Our shareholders shouldnt say,
    Jims job is to wait for the recovery. We
    wanted to create it.
So you want to make USG less cyclical?
Yes, otherwise shareholders say, Whats
    management doing? We diversified our earnings, adding 12
    countries. Were focusing on innovation and coming out
    with a new mousetrap, like UltraLight. The third area is
    were using technology to tie together our entire network.
    Our business is very regional; Texas might be busier than the
    Pacific Northwest. We run a network, so were always
    delivering at the lowest manufacturing and delivery cost. Now
    think of this. You take out a third of the weight; you get a
    third more on a truck. Our distributors need a third less
    equipment. UltraLight saves you fuel, is more sustainable and
    has a smaller carbon footprint. Everyone thought wallboard was
    a commodity, but we changed the rules.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Flanagan. You may begin.
Ryan Flanagan - Senior Director-Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning and welcome to USG Corporation's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call and live webcast. We will be using a slide presentation in conjunction with our call today. It is available by going to the Investor Information section of our website, www.usg.com, and clicking on the link to the webcast.
Before we proceed, let me remind you that certain statements in this conference call may be forward-looking statements under Securities Laws. These statements are made on the basis of management's current views and assumption of our business, market and other conditions, and management undertakes no obligation to update these statements.
These statements are also subject to a number of factors, including those listed at the end of the press release, and actual results may be different from our current expectations. In addition, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation slides for disclosures and reconciliations on non-GAAP measures used when discussing our results and outlook.
With me today to discuss the second quarter are Jim Metcalf, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Hilzinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Jim will provide a general overview of the quarter, plus additional insight into businesses. Matt will then review the financial results for the corporation and the business segments. We'll then open the call for questions and conclude with a few comments from Jim. We'd like to ensure everyone has an opportunity to ask questions, so as always, when we get to the Q&A session, callers are asked to limit themselves to one question. Jim?
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Ryan, and good morning. Let me start by saying, we had a very strong quarter, and half way through the year, we're really seeing momentum build in all of our businesses. We had the best adjusted net income since the fourth quarter of 2006. The fourth quarter of 2006, think of that, that's when they were over 1.6 million homes being built. We had growth and expanded our margins in all of our businesses, and our USG Boral joint venture continues to grow. I'm looking forward to reviewing these wonderful results and taking your questions, but first, I'd like to take a minute and touch on our strategy.
USG has a history of leading the building products industry. Our Gypsum, Ceilings and Distribution businesses now coupled with USG Boral in Asia and Australasia are successfully building on our history by executing our plan to win. By strengthening the core of our North American manufacturing and distribution businesses, diversifying our earnings base through USG Boral and differentiating through world-class innovation. We at USG are building a stronger and leaner company.

The story on USG today in 2015 is both positive and I'd like to say straightforward. We expect demand improvement coupled with expanding operating margins, which you're going to see in the current results. And going forward, we will generate the levels of free cash flow to support our debt paydown strategy and continue to reinvest and grow our business.
Now let's turn to some details of the quarter. In our Gypsum segment, all three of our businesses, wallboard, surfaces and substrates contributed to achieving the best adjusted operating margin since 2006. In wallboard, increased volume, lower nat gas costs and cost reductions through our Lean Six Sigma programs drove margin expansion in $14 million of improved profitability.
Surfaces and substrates, which are critical components of our Gypsum segment, these are products like our leading market share joint treatment and our growth product commercial roof board, they provide a full portfolio of products for our customers. These important products and sales of these brands drove $9 million of incremental profit, and the volume of our Securock commercial roof board hit record levels during the quarter.
Moving to Ceilings. We saw margin expansion improving to just over 19%. Ceilings earned $25 million in adjusted operating profit; improvements came from pricing and cost for ceiling tile that drove performance over a very strong 2014 comp second quarter.
Now to L&W Supply. We continue to see improving trends with operating margins more than doubling in the quarter. Comp store sales increased 5% and wallboard volume was up 7%. Adjusted operating profit of $9 million is the highest in over seven years. While I'm very pleased that we're moving in the right direction at L&W, we still aren't to our expected ROIC targets, and we still have some work ahead of us, but we're making progress.
USG Boral turned in another strong quarter with adjusted operating margin breaking to 13%. We continue to see conversion of our standard plasterboard to our UltraLight or in that part of the world NextGen board during the quarter. Adjacent product volume grew, led by joint treatment, with Australia being the strongest market growing at 10% per adjacent products.
Realizing synergies in our combined business has been a major focus and we are tracking ahead of schedule, and I'm very pleased with those results. In fact 16 months into the joint venture, we now estimate that USG Boral has realized 20% of the targeted $50 million that we've talked about in past calls.
Before Matt takes a detailed look into our second quarter results, I'd like to update you on our plan to win. Last quarter, if you recall, I reviewed our advancements in part of our plan to win on strengthening our core, as we continue to make progress in North American manufacturing and distribution, and you see those in the results.
Today, I'd like to review how we differentiate through innovation and specifically come back to our substrates business. While wallboard and surfaces primarily are installed in the interior of either a residential or commercial building, many of our substrates products are used in the exterior envelope of a commercial building.
Last month, we partnered with Tremco, which is part of RPM International out of Ohio, and we announced a new exterior air and water barrier system with the product that we call Securock ExoAir 430. This innovation answers the challenges that our customers have been having with existing systems and bringing them a better solution. With this new product, the air barrier system is pre-applied during the manufacturing process compared to being sprayed on the job site. This makes it easier to install with less material waste and provides a better system for our customer and the owner of the building.

As you've seen in our UltraLight portfolio products, ease of installation is key for our customers, particularly commercial construction where labor rates are extremely high, and USG premium products help reduce those labor costs. We're in an introduction phase of this system but the customer response has been great, and I'm very excited about rolling this product out throughout the country. Product innovations in growth businesses like substrates give us a larger share of wallet in that commercial business that helps diversify our earnings.
Before I turn it over to Matt to talk more about the details, I want to cover one of additional topic. There was a hearing last week to approve the settlement of our antitrust class actions and given that no one came to the hearing to object, we are very optimistic that the settlement will be approved. In addition, we've become aware that a federal grand jury is investigating domestic wallboard manufacturers, including U.S. Gypsum, over what appears to be the same issues raised in these class actions.
We're fully cooperating, obviously, with this investigation. And as we've said in the past, and this is very important, we establish our pricing and selling practices independently and are in full compliance with the law. We do not expect this investigation to have a significant incremental impact on our financial results.
So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Matt, who will dig into the financial results for the quarter and I'll come back with some comments before Q&A. Matt?
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I'll kick things off by walking through our consolidated results for the second quarter. Our GAAP net sales were up 2% to $970 million and our GAAP net income was $79 million with diluted earnings per share of $0.54.
Before discussing our adjusted results, I'll offer a brief reminder that beginning with this quarter, our current and prior period results exclude the results from GTL, our shipping operation that we exited in April earlier this year.
In addition, we do not expect any continuing financial impact of GTL going forward. So in order to compare our sales and earnings on an apples-to-apples basis in this quarter and all quarters going forward, our adjusted sales and earnings numbers exclude all GTL activity.
So with that said, adjusted sales for the second quarter improved over 4% and we saw margins expand across all of our businesses. Our adjusted operating profit improved by almost 40%, and our adjusted net income of $78 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.53 were up 80% over the prior year. And we generated $169 million in adjusted EBITDA, our highest since the fourth quarter of 2006 and almost 25% higher than the second quarter of last year.
So let's move to our segment discussions and I'll start with Gypsum. During the second quarter, we saw a significant margin expansion and operating leverage with $20 million of improved adjusted operating profit to $97 million. Adjusted operating margins improved by 270 basis points over last year to 15.7% due to a combination of improved volumes, higher prices, and lower costs, plus, we're seeing very solid growth in our non-wallboard surfaces and substrate divisions, which I'll discuss in a moment.
Let me give you a little bit more detail regarding our U.S. operations. In our U.S. wallboard division, volumes for the second quarter were up 5%, slightly above the industry, and price was stable from our first quarter of this year. We also continue to see lower costs, which contributed $7 million in improved operating profit in the quarter. Lower natural gas represented about half of that favorability, with the other piece coming from a combination of our operational efficiency efforts or raw material costs, including waste paper.

I'm very pleased to note that our surfaces and substrate divisions added $9 million of operating profit over last year across a broad platform of new and existing products, including increased volumes and pricing in Fiberock and Securock roofing products, plus improved volumes of joint compound coupled with better pricing and lower costs due to efficiencies.
I'd also like to highlight that we're providing new incremental disclosures on our surfaces and substrates division starting this quarter, so you can better see the value that these businesses drive. Specifically, we will now quantify their sales volumes and their relative EBITDA contributions.
As you can see in our slide presentation, surfaces and substrates is a substantial part of our portfolio with about 47% of U.S. Gypsum's revenues. They had strong top line growth of 8% to generate $207 million in sales during the quarter, and they represent approximately 30% of the EBITDA generated by the U.S. Gypsum company, or about $35 million. The margins on surfaces and substrates are a bit lower than wallboard, but they are really fairly stable over the cycle. So I'm pleased with how these businesses are performing and their potential for the future.
Moving to Ceilings. Our operating margins for the second quarter expanded by 60 basis points to over 19%, generating $25 million of adjusted operating profit. During the quarter, we continued to see some mix shift to higher margin products, with premium tile products now representing roughly a third of our tile portfolio. Improved pricing was led by our tile products, with the majority of the increase driven by mix shift. And as we just saw in the Gypsum segment, lower natural gas cost combined with our continuing Lean Six Sigma efforts drove costs lower and expanded our margins.
Turning to Distribution, L&W earned $9 million in adjusted operating profit, a $5 million improvement over the second quarter of last year. We saw increased volumes in wallboard and our other core products, and we were able to capitalize on those increased volumes this quarter. Same-store sales were up 5%, led by wallboard volumes of 7%, and delivery costs on a percentage of sales basis were flat. And as Jim said, we certainly have more work to do, but real progress is being made.
Moving to our last business segment, our USG Boral JV, adjusted operating profit for the total JV was $35 million, up $12 million from a year ago with operating margins expanding to about 13.3%. Please note that the 510 basis point improvement and operating margin is really closer to 290 basis points when you adjust for the roughly $6 million in facility damage costs incurred in last year's second quarter. Even so, that's really terrific growth.
USG's share of the JV's net income amounted to $13 million in the second quarter of this year, a $7 million improvement. Almost all of which was driven by the JV's strong operational improvements that Jim mentioned earlier.
Regarding dividends from the JV, we did receive our first dividend from the JV in May amounting to $18 million. This is the first of many dividends that we expect to get, as we are targeting to pay out at least 50% of the JV's earnings going forward. As I said in the past, the JV is expected to be completely self funding, including capital needs and the potential earn-out payments to Boral. So as of now, the dividends are being held overseas to fund the expected earn-out payments to Boral.
I'll shift gears and now, share a few thoughts on our financial outlook for the year. On the SG&A front, last quarter, I said that we were scaling back our SG&A spending for 2015 by at least $20 million to $325 million for the full year. This quarter, I can reiterate that we are fully committed to meeting or beating the $325 million target for the year. Regarding the second quarter, total SG&A spend was in line with our expectations at $79 million.

As I mentioned on our last call, the spending pattern for this year is expected to be different than last year with slightly higher spend in the second and third quarters, with significantly less spend in the fourth quarter.
Regarding taxes, I want to reiterate that based on our forecasted profitability in the U.S., we are still projecting that we will release nearly all our portion of our $1 billion domestic valuation allowance by the end of 2015. And in fact, we may see a portion of that release coming as early as next quarter. Again, this is actually very good news as it's based on positive earnings growth.
As a reminder, when we release all or a portion of our valuation allowance, we'll realize a massive non-cash income tax benefit connected with the reversal of the reserves. And then, beginning in 2016, we'll start to record income tax expense on the P&L for substantially all of our U.S. earnings. But what's really important here is that we will not, let me repeat, we will not pay cash taxes until we fully utilize our $1.9 billion of net operating losses and other carryover benefits. So simply put, this does not impact cash, only the P&L.
From an income tax expense standpoint, we anticipate our annual global effective tax rate will be between 29% and 31%. There will also be no impact to the results of USG Boral, which are recorded net of tax. And there is no new impact to Canada and Mexico as we already record tax expense on those countries. For the remainder of 2015 and until we release the valuation allowance, expect that our tax expense to amount to roughly $2 million a quarter.
Let me address foreign exchange exposure as well. Across the whole USG portfolio including USG Boral, FX headwinds amounted to about $7 million for the quarter and about $12 million on a year-to-date basis. About half of the $12 million is for Canada and the remaining half is split equally between Mexico and the JV.
Looking at the back half or the second half of this year, we think there is additional exposure of about $3 million to $5 million assuming rates stay stable for the balance of the year and taking into consideration the hedges that we already have in place.
A final point on outlook, we are absolutely committed to organically delevering our balance sheet. We have some upcoming debt payments and in particular our $500 million bullet that is due in November of next year, which is clearly in our sites. We have additional debt that we will also pay down as we march towards our leverage target of 1.5 times to 2 times debt to EBITDA at the mid-cycle.
And with that, I'll turn things back to Jim.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Matt. Before we go into Q&A, I'd like to briefly discuss what we see in our end markets and share some of our insights of what we expect for the balance of this year and going forward.
Let me start out with new residential, and probably a lot of this isn't new news to you, I think we're looking at the same numbers. But our forecast is for the year 1.1 million starts. As you know, some of the low seasonally adjusted starts earlier in the year were skewed by weather, but we do see positive signs. We see demand increasing for first-time homebuyers, which has been really a key area with first-time homebuyers increasing to over 30%, 32% of sales and that's up from 27% a year ago. We're also seeing strong job growth, which has helped return homebuilder confidence to the highest levels in nearly a decade.
Now, in new commercial, we're expecting mid to single digit growth for 2015 with USG's primary sectors of growth would be education, which is the largest sector under the commercial umbrella, followed by office and retail. Another encouraging sign that we saw yesterday and many of you probably did is the ABI reading that hit its highest level since mid-2007, which is another encouraging sign that commercial is starting to show some life. We're well below historical levels in commercial, but we feel that we're in the early stages of recovery and this is very important sector in our business.

Repair and remodel, which to remind you is about 50% of USG's business, and we see continued growth in 2015 and beyond. Existing home sales drives R&R spending as buyers typically remodel their homes of first 12 months to 24 months after a purchase, and our products typically are involved in that remodel project.
In addition, commercial repair and remodel, employment levels continue to improve, as you've all seen. And one really important thing that we're starting to see is office vacancy rates have dropped to 13.5%, which is actually the lowest level since 2008. So all in both residential and commercial repair and remodel, we expect low to mid single digit growth in 2015.
With USG Boral – and Matt touched on the great progress we're making there, and we're very enthusiastic about that partnership. We're forecasting mid to high single digit growth, and we expect continued margin expansion. As I mentioned earlier, the value proposition of our NextGen plasterboard relative to standard board has been a key part of this growth and improving our margins, but also level setting all those manufacturing plants with the USG manufacturing way has really helped USG Boral lower manufacturing costs as well.
As commercial buildings in that part of the world are being designed more and more with western construction practices, the demand for USG Boral products including the adjacent products that are very, very important, ceiling tile grid and Fiberock, are going to add to that growth. So all in all, we're very optimistic about the year. I think we've had a really good quarter. We're excited about the opportunities that we've shared with you today.
And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions.

Thank you. Our first question comes from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone. And congratulations on a very strong quarter.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Bob.
Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC
I just wanted to ask you, I haven't heard you this enthusiastic, I don't remember. And thanks for the color on the end market demand, that's really helpful. Can you help me understand how you see among your three businesses the recovery like engaging each of those businesses. And I'm just trying to understand from your perspective, what are you most excited about right now in the portfolio? And how do you think the recovery unfolds? Does the Gypsum business engage first followed by L&W? How should we thinking about the trajectory of that? Thanks very much.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Okay, Bob. Thank you. Yes, actually I'm very excited. You look at the quarter we had, it's the best quarter since 2006, which we basically had 1.6 million housing starts and that was a whole different environment. I think one of the keys has been lowering the breakeven and all the cost reduction and hard work that this organization has done over the last few years, that just shows the amount of leverage we have.
Actually what I'm most excited about is seeing commercial coming back. We've taken the term choppy out. We've used that term choppy. Commercial is very, very important for L&W Supply. We've repositioned L&W; as I said we aren't where we need to be, but we're making progress. It's very important for our Ceilings business, and quite frankly, it's important for our Gypsum wallboard business. So that's been the lagging factor.
If you look at commercial, I talked about ABI, consumer confidence is up 17% year-on-year and vacancy rates, which I think are very, very important. One other thing we're seeing in commercial, if you look around the high-rise construction, a lot of the high-rise construction today falls in the residential numbers, but they're mostly rentals or high-rise rentals which L&W plays a key part in with steel studs, commercial insulation, and commercial products.

Now, on the other side of that, there's not ceilings in those high-rise rentals. So you have to kind of look at those high-rise residential units almost like a commercial unit. So all-in-all, I'm really excited about seeing some life in commercial. It has a big impact on our businesses. And we think residential is going to continue to grow. So we're going to continue to take costs out, introduce new products, and hopefully, deliver the results that we've done this quarter as we go forward.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Ng from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. Congrats on the strong quarter. Based on the hedges you guys have in place, do you expect to see a comparable amount of benefit from lower natural gas? And with waste paper prices rising, do you expect incrementals you've seen in Gypsum in 2Q to be sustainable in the back half?
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Hey, Phil. It's Matt Hilzinger. Why don't I take that. As Jim said, we continue to do everything we can to lower the breakeven. And we saw some good cost momentum in the first quarter. I think in the Gypsum business, we saved like $2 million year-over-year and now, in this quarter, it's about $7 million. And I would split half of that in natural gas.
I'd put a little bit in – some benefits that we've gotten around raw materials and then I think we're getting the efficiencies. If you think about 20% fixed cost and 15% conversion, we're going to leverage somewhere between 30% and 35% as volume goes through and all the cost efficiencies that were going. So in the second half of the year, what I would think is, look, we're going to continue to get some leverage on the fixed costs and get our improvements.
I think we're going to have some tailwinds on natural gas, not as big as we saw in the first half. This quarter in particular, we benefited from kind of a very low spot rate. So 25% of our natural gas was unhedged. We took advantage of a very low spot rate. That's moved up from about $2.30 to about $2.80 to $2.90. I think we'll still get a little bit of a tailwind in the second half, but we're still seeing some inflation. We're seeing inflation in synthetic gypsum, we're seeing inflation in labor. We've had that, and we're seeing some inflation in some of our special ingredients.
So all in all, what I would think about, as you think about the second half, is I think you'd probably see costs maybe go up a little bit in the second half compared to last year, maybe flat best case. But I think there are some good tailwinds, and look, we're doing everything we possibly can in this company to manage costs. And so that's what we're trying to do.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC
Very helpful. Can you just provide some color on how the hedges are set up in the back half and going into next year?
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. Very similar to the way they were set up in the first half. Se we're about 75% hedged. So our all-in hedged price right now is around $3.80. If we continue to have spot prices of, call it, $2.80, $2.90, I think that will translate into maybe $1 million to $2 million a quarter on natural gas benefit. So not quite as much as we saw this quarter, but I think we'll get a little bit of a benefit.
Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Thanks a lot. Very helpful.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yep.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Garik Shmois from Longbow. Please go ahead.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC
Hi, thanks. Congratulations. Just a question on surfaces and substrates and you're offering bit more disclosure on that and we appreciate it. It looks like you did 60% incremental margins in that business this quarter. Recognized that over the course of the cycle, it's less volatile from a margin standpoint relative to wallboard, but that 60% figure is pretty impressive, you called out a couple of items that contributed to the profit growth. But I'm just wondering as we're starting to see that business inflect, is there any sort of additional guidance you could point us towards incremental margins in that business?

James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
We really appreciate the – looking at the U.S. Gypsum business in a different way and that's one reason, Garik, that we wanted to unpack that a little bit for you. And one of the key areas is we have competitive situations that we want to keep proprietary. These are industry leading products. We have loyalty from our applicators. We have a very strong market share. Most of those products have a market share that's 2x over wallboard and, as you say, less volatile margins.
So we're going to crawl before we walk there. We wanted to open up the envelope a little bit so you can understand the Gypsum margins. I think sometimes U.S. Gypsum gets compared to other companies that don't have these products. And I think the key here is you have strong market share, loyal brands and the volatility of the margins. If you go back to three years or four years ago, they were rock stars in the portfolio, because Gypsum margins were lower.
So you can go back 15 years or 20 years, and those margins really stay relatively in a small span. So we want to give you this first round and we just want to make sure that things that we provide aren't proprietary – that we want to keep proprietary that give us a competitive advantage in the market.
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. There's nothing in that business that would suggest a breakout form the kind of the historical margin standard deviation though?
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No. The surfaces business is – that is joint treatment, that's the green lid – we're continuing to expand. We've probably introduced more new products in surfaces and substrates in the last year, which we really don't talk about. A lot of line extensions. It's really taking costs out. These are very – for example, joint treatment are very regional products. So if you're in the desert, you have to have a different formula than if you're along the coast. So we're always expanding the formula. Breakout products, and really the area that I'm most excited about is substrates. It's a growth business. The commercial roof deck business, our market share is fairly low, but we've been growing at double-digit rates.
And when you look at the amount of commercial roofs that need to be repaired and replaced, the average age of a commercial building is 40 years old. So if you say breakout, I mean, that substrates group is really an exciting group of – when we talk about surfaces and substrates, that we're continuing to introduce new products. The one that I talked about it with Tremco is very early. We don't know how big that's going to be, but that could be something that gets attention. So joint treatment very stable growth, leading market share is continuing new products, but substrates is a part of it that – I don't know if I'm going to call it breakout, but it's a very exciting growth initiative in the U.S. Gypsum segment.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And Jim, let me add. This is Matt. If you look at the $9 million that came through on surfaces and substrates, about half of that was volume, and the other half was split equally between kind of price increases that we've gotten and efficiency, so we've reduced costs. So we've expanded margins in that business, but we're also getting very good volume. As I said, we've gotten about 8% top-line growth. So...
Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC
Great. Thanks for that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs from Baird. Please go ahead.
Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yeah. Hey guys. Nice job on the cost side.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Tim.
Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
I guess just a question on Gypsum volumes. Some other people in the industry have talked about a little bit of impact on the commercial construction side that may have delayed some construction activity timelines. I'm just curious if that's something that you guys saw in any sort of regions across the country?
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Obviously, Texas, Houston got a ton of rain and that's slowed up a lot of commercial buildings in that Texas, Oklahoma areas, so absolutely.
Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And I guess is there any way to think about – does that kind of help in as you get into the back half of the year? Is that kind of something that winds up kind of shifting demand a little bit in the 2016?
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Our projections for the year really haven't changed. I think it's just – it may be a quarter shift here and there, but things get delayed and it will be just a little bit of catch-up in the quarter.
Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. On L&W, you cited the flat delivery cost as percentage of sales, I'm just wondering if you can comment on what you could do further and improve that margin profile and whether or not there has been any products folded into that segment recently to help accelerate the growth.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Mike, this is Jim. From your question on the products, L&W, we really focus on seven core products. We aren't really big in lumber. That's why, we don't play in the resi side. Steel studs, commercial insulation, largest distributor of ceiling tile and grid in the country. So we want to be the best at the seven core products. So no, nothing gets folded in, I mean, fasteners and things of that nature, but the seven core products are something we want to stay very focused on.
On delivery, that is a real focus area for us. We have really three areas; we're looking at logistics, we're looking at inventory, and we're looking at branch rationalization. So on the logistics, it's things like truck turnaround, loading trucks faster, safer. So that's all the key to how long it takes us to – can we get an extra turn-in. If you get an extra turn-in at a branch, that really helps the profitability. So we are all over that. We have a Lean Six Sigma team that's focused on that and that's really key to the profitability of how efficient and safely that you can deliver products.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Matt A. Bouley - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Hi. This is actually Matt Bouley on for Mike. Thank you for taking my question. Just going back to the non-res environment, just given some of that improving data and thinking about your $325 million SG&A target for the year, what would happen to SG&A if you did see an acceleration in volumes in the second half? And how would you think about potentially adding shifts or capacity in that environment? Thanks.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
We're very focused on SG&A, and as Matt said, we expect to hit that $325 million regardless of where volume comes. That's the key, that's why we have leverage and we're delivering the same earnings that we did in 2006, and any type of volume increase, we do not expect SG&A. I'll turn over to Matt, he can talk about our philosophy on shifts.

Matthew F. Hilzinger - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. Matt. Any shifts that we might add, actually go through cost of the sales. They aren't going to run through SG&A, and quite frankly, we've got very strong – we've got a lot of capacity right now. Our effective capacity is running around 79%, almost 80%, a little stronger in some parts of the country, little less in others. We typically will run that up to over 90% and then maybe add a shift. And one of the things that we're very focused on is through Lean Six Sigma, what we're doing in the manufacturing environment is when we bring a shift back, one, we know that it's durable demand but, two, we're doing things to drive efficiency.
So we just – we don't want to bring a lot of people on and then at some point have to maybe let them go if demand is not there. So on the SG&A target, as Jim said, we are laser-focused on our costs, and in the plants, we've got plenty of capacity to meet demand, should something spike up in the second half or either next year. So I feel very good about where we are in costs.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
And just to follow up on the adding a shift, just so everyone – we are adding some capacity in Southern California. And this is high-end specialty products that we had to ship from Texas. So this is a something that it's our glass-mat product, it's something that product that is high margin, high demand in that part of the world, and we took a very focused approach about putting a specialty product in that part of the world. So if you hear about that, that is what we are doing in our Plaster City, California plant.
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And just add on to that, that glass-mat panel is the green stuff, it's the green panels that you see when you're driving around, not the yellow stuff, yellow is bad, green is good.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks very much, guys. Yeah, I guess, first question I just wanted to sort of clean up on the nat gas and the hedging. Obviously, you've sort of laid out what you thought it might be for the next couple of quarters, but if I'm not mistaken, I mean if nat gas sort of stays where we are, I mean would it be your expectation that you'd see a pretty meaningful benefit in 2016?
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Stephen, how are you?
Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Doing great. Thanks.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good. Look, we have not provided guidance on 2016, but I think directionally, you're correct. I mean I think if prices stay low, we would end up with some kind of tailwind in 2016. I think it's too early to get into exactly what that would be, but clearly, I think there is some opportunity to get some tailwind there, but we're also seeing some inflation, right? So that would help offset whatever inflation we might see on the labor on the synthetic Gypsum side.
Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Got it. Great. And then, secondly with respect to the 2Q...
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Stephen, excuse me. This...

Thank you. Our next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Dennis P. McGill - Zelman & Associates
Hi. Good morning. Thanks, guys. Matt, I guess just one question I had with respect to how to interpret the same-store sales trends within the Distribution business. It sounds like that the data you guys were seeing on the non-res, you're comfortable that that's accelerating, and I know that's got a tilt towards non-res, but your same-store sales went from 10% last quarter to 5% this quarter. Is there something unique in the comparisons or anything that you're seeing in the business that would kind of explain that variance and then maybe if you see some acceleration coming in the second half of the year there?
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
No. The way I would think about it and I hate to drag 2014 into the conservation, but I think you got to go back to 2014. In 2014, the first quarter was really pretty light, right. So we had – if you fast forward to the first quarter of this year, wallboard volumes were up close to 10%. And I think part of that, I think if you go back, what we said was part of that volume increase that we saw in the first quarter was in part due to the weather and the polar vortex that we saw in 2014. So I think when you think about going from 10% to 5% on wallboard volumes and you think about the comp store sales, I think they kind of flow together. And so I think part of this is weaker first quarter, last year against this year, stronger second quarter against our second quarter this year.
And so I go back to what Jim said in terms of the guidance for the balance of the year, housing starts up between 1 million and 1.2 million. I think we're in the midpoint there about 1.1 million, mid single on commercial and low to mid on residential. I think if you blend all that together, you're kind of in the mid-single digit on volume growth. And I think L&W is getting a benefit from the high-rise resi that Jim called out, right? I mean, if you take a look at the housing starts, almost all of that is coming from high-rise resi. So we're encouraged about what we see going on out there and we're encouraged about where L&W is, but we don't see any anomaly that we think would shift the trend from what we've seen in L&W for the second quarter.

Our next question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens. Please go ahead.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Trey. Good morning.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.
Jim, I think on the last call, you mentioned and you were talking about kind of the timing of the pricing around wallboard and I think that you said that the current pricing put in place in January this year is good through October, which was a change. Is that still the expectation there on kind of your thoughts around the timing? And any kind of thoughts you can give us behind that change would be great.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yes, Trey. That's exactly what we're talking about. We did move our price for this year, our 2015 wallboard price, it's not to exceed, is effective through October 31, so the end of October. And as we get – so to answer your question, we have not changed our philosophy on that. As we get closer, we're going to look at demand and inflation and everything we typically have done for actually the last five years to determine whether or not to exceed price will be for November 1. So those are the factors that influence our pricing decision. So we're still on that course.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And just kind of the thoughts behind that change from going from October to, I guess, November 1 – excuse me, January to November?

James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
One of the big changes is the pre-buys caused a lot of angst with our customers. And in our conversations with our customers, we floated the idea of moving the price into an area where it's the busier time in the season and it would minimize if not eliminate some of the pre-buys that our customers really either participated in or it had a negative impact on their business, so that was the main reason of our discussion with our customers on pre-buy.
Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.
I see. Makes sense. Thanks a lot, Jim. Good luck.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions today. Pulling the string a little bit more on the non-res cycle, for your U.S. interiors business, the ceilings business, what were volumes contribution to the top line in the quarter? And then, shifting a little bit, to look at your L&W division, could you give some clarity for what were sales volumes for steel studs specifically? Thank you.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
The tile volume? Kathryn, could you repeat the question on the tile volume, I wasn't – your connection wasn't really good, sorry.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC
Yeah. Sorry about that. What were volumes for your ceiling tiles for your U.S. interiors business in the quarter? And then, similarly for your L&W division, are you able to break out what your steel studs sales volumes were in that division or at least what your overall revenue growth was for steel studs and for L&W?
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Okay. On the ceiling tile for the quarter, we were up over the second quarter of last year; volumes were up. If you take out the second quarter of 2014, it was the strongest quarter we've had since the third quarter of 2013. So it was a – from a ceiling tile, we don't break that out, Kathryn, the number, but the volume was up. On steel studs for L&W, we do not break that out, we don't disclose that, but the volume was up with steel studs at L&W.
In fact, if you look at complementary products, I talked about the seven core products. Most of those products are trending the right way. And steel studs, and I think, you're heading in the direction on non-resi. Steel studs are a leading indicator of what's happening with non-res or the multi-family high rise, and we really watch that steel stud number, but we don't break that out.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC
But you wouldn't – it's our assumption that you wouldn't perform materially different than what industry checks that we may have?
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I'm not sure what your industry checks would say.
Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC
Okay. Great. We're seeing mid to high single digit volumes, but understand that you can't be specific about volumes. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thank you. It's good to hear your ceilings volume's up. To the last question, sales in total were really only up like $1 million and grid and tile volume has showed it's not a contributor to operating profits. Can you help me kind of reconcile, maybe give us a feel of how much the ceiling tiles were up?
Matthew F. Hilzinger - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. As Jim said, we don't give specific – this is Matt Hilzinger. So we don't give specific information on ceiling tiles, but they were up and grid was down a little bit, that's how I would think about it. So I think part of this is, we've seen – Jim talked a little bit about the repair and remodel side doing pretty well. So we don't give specifics on that, but I think if you stand back, we feel very good about how the ceilings business performed in the second quarter.

Volumes were up on tiles, grid was down a little bit. We did get a little bit of price improvement, but we've also been able to see – and this is a continued theme that we've had in the business is a mix shift to the higher end tiles. And I think we're seeing more and more of that with lead certification points and noise reduction requirements in commercial buildings. We're continuing to see that mix move to the higher-end products. So overall, we feel very good about where the ceilings business is.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thanks.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Just to follow up on Matt's, on the high-end premium, if you look at our overall ceiling tile volume, that – those high end premium products continue to grow as a percentage of sales, and they're now over a third of our tile volume, which is these high-end tiles that Matt's indicating. So we're seeing a growing trend and when you're getting to a product that's one-third of your line, that's a really positive impact for the business.
Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Thank you. One thing that's been obviously happening is multi-family has been stronger than single-family, and recent indications are that that might continue. I'm curious as you look through your products, how does that affect you? And are there any competitive differences for instance in the Gypsum business, or maybe you're stronger in multi-family relative to competition than you would be in single-family or vice versa? Any color that these trends in the strengthen in multi-family might be having vis-à-vis your performance? That'd be helpful.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Mark, I'm really glad you asked that question, because that falls right into our wheelhouse. Multi-family, when you think of multi-family now, it's not the apartment complex in the suburbs, as I said earlier, it's the 25-storey to 40-storey high-rise rental, typically rental not a condo, and I think condos sales just came out, starting to show some life. So these are high-rise rental units that are really commercial products.
These are commercial distributors stocking them, i.e., L&W. They have steel studs, which we distribute. You have to have high-end products like USG UltraLight, because labor rates – in a multi-family construction, commercial contractors are installing that. So the labor rates, for example in Chicago, can be anywhere between $70 an hour and $75 an hour; New York City, it's $100. So our products with having UltraLight being lighter and easier to install fall right into that wheelhouse.
On ceiling tiles, ceiling tile doesn't have a big impact there, because you don't have a lot of acoustical drop ceilings in rental units, maybe in the lobby. But this multi-family is really positive for L&W Supply, because a competitive advantage is this, there are very few competitors of distribution that can safely put products in high-rise buildings, where if you're doing a single-family home, you may have 15 competitors or 20 competitors. When you're doing a high rise, you may have five competitors.
And so you really have to have a unique value proposition. So this falls right into our strengths, as I mentioned, our new product with Tremco, which focuses on the exterior of a commercial multi-family or a commercial office building. So that brings a bigger share of wallet for us. Our Securock roof deck, as I said earlier, that would be on the roof. So if you think about USG Corporation, we're not only in the interior, now we're in the exterior of hat high-rise and by the way, we deliver the products that get it there safely.

Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
And are you able to track if you've been able to maintain this competitive edge or are you finding that other competitors seeing the trends are going after the more multi-flash commercial opportunities more aggressively?
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Mark, we don't have a competitor that has the full value from manufacturing to the job site. So if you think about the value proposition we have in – when we make the product, we introduce new products. We've introduced over 22 new products in the last year, some of those we don't talk a lot about, but our innovation is second to none. We are the only manufacturer that also has distribution and I know there's been a lot of questions about L&W, but you can see the trends are getting better, we aren't there yet. So yeah, we track it a lot. Competition is very fierce out there. There's a lot of different ways to get to these jobs, but we feel from innovation all the way to invoice, we put it in the job safely. So I like to say we have a unique value proposition that our investors like.

Hi. Jim, one of your initial initiatives as the CEO was to go into the Boral joint venture. That seems to be working out very, very well. Can you tell us whether in the event down the road in the future, Boral was to exit – wish to exit their half of the joint venture, where the USG has the right of first refusal? And could you tell us if that's true, broadly what the terms might be?
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yes, that's true and I'd love to have that opportunity. All right...
Jim R. Barrett - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Is there a set formula?
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No, there is not.
Jim R. Barrett - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
And Jim, we appreciate your support over the years.
Jim R. Barrett - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
Ryan Flanagan - Senior Director-Investor Relations
We have time for one other question.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from James Armstrong from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on the wallboard. You talked more about the specialty products opening. How much of the portfolio in wallboard is now from those specialty products? And could you talk a little bit about margin and growth prospects in the specialty business?
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
If you look at UltraLight and that's a – we wouldn't view that as a specialty product, but that's a new product. For half-inch, it is now almost two-thirds of the volume. The customers view the value proposition of UltraLight, so we do get a price premium on that, so the margin is better. Securock is continuing to grow, margins are very strong, but what's great about Securock is the growth. The growth is 2x of what you're seeing in regular wallboard growth and that's why it's really important for us to put products in the market, as Matt said that are green.
And that will continue to add to the profitability. But we don't break that out. We're going to continue to break out surfaces and substrates as a whole, but your are getting growth at higher margin, similar what you're seeing on the Ceilings side with the high end premium product. So that's why, it's still important we have the innovation to come out with these higher performance products that have higher growth, but more importantly have higher margins.

James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you.
James S. Metcalf - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you. I really appreciate all the questions. And as you can probably hear from Matt and myself, we're really pleased with the quarter, but more importantly, we're very excited about the rest of the year and the future. As you said, we saw that in the second quarter, we expanded margins in all of our businesses. We introduced some new products that help our customers grow, and the USG Boral continues to help us win in a growth area in Asia and Australasia.
But I want to let everyone know, we aren't content just to ride the wave of demand getting better. And as we've said over the years, we want to continue to create our own recovery, which is – and we talked a little bit about it today is focused on cost reductions and we're doing that through Lean Six Sigma and advanced manufacturing. With product innovation, we're going to continue to deliver product extensions. I said we introduced 15 new products to 20 new products, but we also have some big ideas that we have in the pipeline that we hope to share with you soon, but most importantly, having our customers top of mind every single day.
We're very focused on customer satisfaction and really delighting our customers. So we're going to continue to strengthen, diversify and differentiate. And we really appreciate your interest in USG today, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you very much.

CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--USG Corporation (NYSE:USG), a leading building products company, today 
      announced that James S. Metcalf will retire as chairman of the board, 
      president and chief executive officer (CEO), effective Oct. 31, 2016. 
      Mr. Metcalf has served as president and chief executive officer since 
      January 2011 and as chairman since December 2011.
    


      Jennifer F. Scanlon, executive vice president, president, International 
      and president, L&W Supply Corporation, will succeed Mr. Metcalf as 
      president and CEO upon his retirement and has been appointed a director 
      of the company, effective immediately. Ms. Scanlon will serve as 
      executive vice president and CEO-elect until Nov. 1, 2016. As part of 
      the leadership transition, Steven F. Leer, lead director, will become 
      non-executive chairman of the board, effective Nov. 1, 2016.
    

      “After more than 35 years with the company and more than a decade in 
      senior leadership roles, including almost six years as president and 
      chief executive officer, I believe that it is the right time for me to 
      move on to the next phase of my professional life and for Jenny to guide 
      USG into its next chapter,” said Mr. Metcalf.
    

      Mr. Metcalf continued, “Together we have executed Our Plan to Win, 
      strengthening and growing our core businesses, diversifying our earnings 
      and differentiating our products and services through innovation. With 
      the announced sale of L&W Supply, a strong balance sheet and a deep, 
      experienced team in place, the company is well prepared for this 
      leadership transition. I have full confidence that Jenny and our 
      management team will continue to provide dynamic leadership to create 
      even greater success for our customers, shareholders and employees.”
    

      “Jenny’s background, skills, and expertise give the board full 
      confidence that she is the right person to serve as the next leader of 
      USG,” said Mr. Leer. “Having served in a variety of positions at USG for 
      almost 14 years, Jenny knows the business intimately and brings great 
      insight to this role. She played a leadership role in developing and 
      executing the company’s strategy, including the establishment of the USG 
      Boral joint venture and in returning L&W Supply to profitability. 
      Jenny’s promotion is a reflection of the board’s long-standing 
      succession planning, and we are pleased to have an executive as 
      qualified as Jenny take the reins and lead USG as it moves into its next 
      phase of growth and value creation. We thank Jim for his outstanding 
      leadership of USG over the years, taking over during challenging market 
      conditions, restoring the company to profitability and putting it on 
      sound financial footing.”
    

      “I am excited to take on the role of president and CEO at USG, an 
      outstanding company with innovative products, dedicated employees, clear 
      growth prospects and a solid financial foundation,” said Ms. Scanlon. 
      “These strengths give me great confidence that we are prepared for the 
      next phase of the company’s future. I look forward to working closely 
      with USG’s executive team and employees across the company. Together, we 
      will build on our significant momentum and deliver value for our 
      shareholders, customers, partners and employees.”

For other people named James Metcalfe, see James Metcalfe (disambiguation).
James "Jimmy" Metcalf (March 11, 1925 – January 27, 2012) was an American sculptor, artist and educator. Metcalf established and led a community for copper artisans in Santa Clara del Cobre, Michoacán, Mexico, from the 1970s until his death in 2012.[1]
Metcalf was born in New York City.[1] His parents were both stained glass artists, most notably contributing to the windows for the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine.[1] Metcalf took up art and sculpture as a teenager. He enlisted in the 88th Infantry Division of the United States Army, nicknamed the Blue Devils, when he was 18 years old.[1] Metcalf fought in northern Italy during World War II, and lost three of his fingers during combat at Furlo Pass.[1]
Metcalf attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia and then enrolled at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London.[1][2] He was awarded a fellowship to study ancient metallurgy and essentially moved to Deya, Majorca, in 1953.[2] There he befriended and collaborated with writer Robert Graves on his work, Adam's Rib, published in 1955.[3] Metcalf lived in Paris from 1956 to 1965, where he located his studio at the Impasse Ronsin.[1]
By 1965, Metcalf was an accomplished sculptor, with a studio on Spring Street in SoHo.[1] However, he was tired of contemporary art and moved to Mexico, including Mexico City.[1] He became friends with prominent writers and artists, including Carlos Fuentes and Carlos Pellicer, and was the first to introduce Octavio Paz to Marcel Duchamp.[1] Metcalf won the commission to forge the Olympic torch for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.[1] He was married to Mexican actress Pilar Pellicer, his third wife, with whom he had two sons and one daughter.[1][1] Metcalf later married Pilar Pellicar's younger sister, sculptor Ana Pellicer, his fourth wife.[2]
Metcalf opened a studio and forge in 1967, where he taught artists how to create vases with a thick edge called El Borde Greuso.[2] In 1973, Melcalf and Anna Pellicer founded Casa de Artesana and a school. which would become known as the Adolfo Best Maugard School of Arts and Crafts in Santa Clara del Cobre, to promote indigenous artists and pre-Columbian coppersmithing and forging techniques.[1][2] Their work has been credited with preserving the metalworking of the region.[1]
Metcalf died in Santa Clara del Cobre, Michoacan, on January 27, 2012, at the age of 86.[1] He was survived by his wife, Ana Pellicer.[3] He was buried in Santa Clara del Cobre, near several of his sculptures.[1]
