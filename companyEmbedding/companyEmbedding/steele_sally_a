Early life[edit]
Steele was born and raised in Indiana, and took her first interest in rock and roll music as a young child while watching The Beatles Animated Series which aired in the mid 1960s.[2] At age 14, Sally started photographing celebrities and rock bands such as Kiss, Aerosmith and Black Sabbath.[1] At age 16, Sally started singing in local rock bands and after high school, she moved to Japan to play in a Cover band for a brief tour.[3] After one year of select performances, Sally decided to relocate to the vibrant rock scene which was taking place on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, California during the early 1980s.[4]
Career[edit]
While in Hollywood, Sally pursed a career in music and acting. She did several bit parts in movies and television and also starred in several music videos which included "Little Lady" by Duke Jupiter[5] and "Hungry Eyes" by Eric Carmen. She also had her own music video featured on MTV's Basement Tapes in 1988. In the early 1990s, when the glam metal genre was in decline, Sally moved to Nashville for a short while before relocating again to Las Vegas. Steele attempted stand-up comedy, played guitar when she could and worked as a cocktail waitress before becoming a chauffeur.[3]

"I picked up Alice Cooper one day, and I was driving 100 miles an hour, looking in the back seat, asking him 10 million questions about every song he did. It really put the thought in my head, 'Well, I should do something with these questions.' "[3]

Sally was also featured in a prominent part of the Quiet Riot Documentary “Well Now that You’re Here There’s No Way Back” which appeared on the Showtime network.[6]
Vegas Rocks! Magazine[edit]
In 2004, Steele started Vegas Rocks! Magazine with no experience as a publisher and no start-up money. She gathered content for her first issue at the Van's Warped Tour with a camera and a tape recorder she purchased the night before. Steele interviewed the artists, wrote all the articles and took all the photos for the first issue which was released in August 2004 and was a 14-page newspaper originally titled Las Vegas Rock City News. The title was later changed to Vegas Rocks! Magazine in January 2005 when she founded Vegas Rocks Media, LLC.[3] Steele has continued to publish the magazine for over ten years with over 120 consecutive issues. Vegas Rocks! Magazine has grown from a 16-page black and white 'zine to a glossy, full-color, 50-page monthly publication. It features calendars of club dates and concerts, ads for local bands, record labels, recording studios and music venues such as House of Blues and The Hard Rock Cafe[4]
Vegas Rocks! Magazine Awards[edit]
In 2010 Steele hosted, created and produced the 1st Annual Vegas Rocks! Magazine Awards.[3] With help from musicians including Dee Snider, Lita Ford, James Kottak, Lemmy Kilmister, Glenn Hughes and many others, it was the first of her Vegas Rocks! Magazine Awards shows in Las Vegas.[7] The Vegas Rocks! Music Awards is now an annual event[8] which takes place each year in August and simultaneously recognizes the anniversary of Vegas Rocks! Magazine.[9]
The 2nd Annual Vegas Rocks! Magazine Music Awards was held on August 21, 2011 at the Las Vegas Hilton. It honored Vince Neil (Mötley Crüe), Steve Stevens (Billy Idol), John 5 (Rob Zombie/Marilyn Manson), Carmine Appice (Vanilla Fudge), Wayne Static (Static X) and featured Sebastian Bach, Slim Jim Phantom (The Stray Cats), Lemmy Kilmister, Steven Adler (Guns N’ Roses), Matt Sorum (Guns N’ Roses), Gilby Clarke, Little Anthony, Gilbert Gottfried and many others.

Steele was born and raised in Indiana, and took her first interest in rock and roll music as a young child while watching The Beatles Animated Series which aired in the mid 1960s.[2] At age 14, Sally started photographing celebrities and rock bands such as Kiss, Aerosmith and Black Sabbath.[1] At age 16, Sally started singing in local rock bands and after high school, she moved to Japan to play in a Cover band for a brief tour.[3] After one year of select performances, Sally decided to relocate to the vibrant rock scene which was taking place on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, California during the early 1980s.[4]
Career[edit]
While in Hollywood, Sally pursed a career in music and acting. She did several bit parts in movies and television and also starred in several music videos which included "Little Lady" by Duke Jupiter[5] and "Hungry Eyes" by Eric Carmen. She also had her own music video featured on MTV's Basement Tapes in 1988. In the early 1990s, when the glam metal genre was in decline, Sally moved to Nashville for a short while before relocating again to Las Vegas. Steele attempted stand-up comedy, played guitar when she could and worked as a cocktail waitress before becoming a chauffeur.[3]

"I picked up Alice Cooper one day, and I was driving 100 miles an hour, looking in the back seat, asking him 10 million questions about every song he did. It really put the thought in my head, 'Well, I should do something with these questions.' "[3]

Sally was also featured in a prominent part of the Quiet Riot Documentary “Well Now that You’re Here There’s No Way Back” which appeared on the Showtime network.[6]
Vegas Rocks! Magazine[edit]
In 2004, Steele started Vegas Rocks! Magazine with no experience as a publisher and no start-up money. She gathered content for her first issue at the Van's Warped Tour with a camera and a tape recorder she purchased the night before. Steele interviewed the artists, wrote all the articles and took all the photos for the first issue which was released in August 2004 and was a 14-page newspaper originally titled Las Vegas Rock City News. The title was later changed to Vegas Rocks! Magazine in January 2005 when she founded Vegas Rocks Media, LLC.[3] Steele has continued to publish the magazine for over ten years with over 120 consecutive issues. Vegas Rocks! Magazine has grown from a 16-page black and white 'zine to a glossy, full-color, 50-page monthly publication. It features calendars of club dates and concerts, ads for local bands, record labels, recording studios and music venues such as House of Blues and The Hard Rock Cafe[4]
Vegas Rocks! Magazine Awards[edit]
In 2010 Steele hosted, created and produced the 1st Annual Vegas Rocks! Magazine Awards.[3] With help from musicians including Dee Snider, Lita Ford, James Kottak, Lemmy Kilmister, Glenn Hughes and many others, it was the first of her Vegas Rocks! Magazine Awards shows in Las Vegas.[7] The Vegas Rocks! Music Awards is now an annual event[8] which takes place each year in August and simultaneously recognizes the anniversary of Vegas Rocks! Magazine.[9]
The 2nd Annual Vegas Rocks! Magazine Music Awards was held on August 21, 2011 at the Las Vegas Hilton.

Advertising, Sponsorship & Cross-Promotional Opportunities
As a Personal Stylist and Image Consultant I work closely with hundreds of women (& men) who trust my opinion and not only take my guidance on what brands and designers to wear but where to shop whether instore or online.
My clients are educated, high income and highly discerning men and women aged 30 – 60 years old – a demographic that is premium to brands and services.
Also due to my background in the Film, TV and Entertainment industry I have  high profile connections who are always keen for my recommendations on what they should be wearing, reading, buying.
Add to that my followers and readers on my social networks
Followers – (updated Feb 2017 ) 
Instagram – 17k
Facebook – 2.7k
Pinterest – 3.5k
Twitter  – 563
Total Social Following – 23.7k
 
Indeed,  because of my UK background and many years living overseas many of my clients and readers have been introduced to UK, US and European brands, designers, boutiques  and stores, both online and instore through STEELEMyStyle – either in person or on one of my social networks.
Happy to accept enquiries about paid Sponsored Posts if it is considered to be on brand with STEELEMyStyle and connect with my reader /client demographic. This will include a fee + product unless you are a not for profit organisation.
Contact me to request my media kit  or discuss paid collaborations.
 
 
Fashion, Beauty, Film, Travel, Lifestyle Product PRs
With 20 years career in Marketing & Communications, I am a well regarded and have always maintained great relationships of integrity & professionalism with everyone. Happy to speak to anyone involved in Publicity, Marketing & Promotions about promotional opportunities within STEELEMyStyle website, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest & Twitter.
Feel free to get in touch if you are keen to be involved in some way – or offer products, treatments, events or experiences for trial,review or competitions – however obviously I reserve the right not to guarantee it will be written about or reviewed favourably. This will include a fee + product, unless you are a not for profit.
Also always interested to hear about new products, collections, services, events etc so do pop me on your mailing list.
 
Media, Events & Public Speaking
Sally Steele has often been interviewed  by media and asked to be involved in events or speak to organisations, corporations and at conferences.
