	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Unaudited)





	NOTE 1 – NATURE OF BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS





	Organization and Basis of Presentation





	Brisset Beer International, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Florida on May 11, 2010 under the name Benefit Solutions Outsourcing Corp.





	On May 19, 2011 the Board of Directors and the majority shareholder of the Company approved a change to the Company's Articles of Incorporation which affected a 17 for one forward stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock, changed the name of the company to "Buckeye Oil & Gas, Inc.", and changed the business of the Company to oil and gas exploration.  The changes became effective at the close of business on June 1, 2011. The forward stock split was distributed to all shareholders of record on March 31, 2011. No cash was paid or distributed as a result of the forward stock split and no fractional shares were issued. All fractional shares which would otherwise be required to be issued as a result of the stock split were rounded up to the nearest whole share. There was no change in the par value of our common stock.





	On April 4, 2014, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Scenario A, a private Quebec corporation, to purchase all assets relating to the product known as "Broken 7", a craft beer locally brewed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire Broken 7 for $25,000 payable in two installments to Scenario A with $12,500 to be paid at closing and $12,500 to be paid 60 business days after the closing date of April 7, 2014 (second installment payment due date is July 3, 2014).  The Company's principal executive officer, Stephane Pilon, also serves as Scenario A's President.  The Corporation's Secretary and director, Pol Brisset, also serves as Scenario A's Vice-President.  Mr. Pilon and Mr. Brisset are majority owners of Scenario A.  The Company made the first payment of $12,500 on closing.  The Company and Scenario A have amended the original agreement such that the due date of the second payment of $12,500 has been extended an additional 30 business days to August 15, 2014.  On August 14, 2014 the Company made the second payment.





	On May 21, 2014, the Company received a written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders (the "Written Consent") from the holders of 1,561,000 shares of common stock representing, at that time, 73.62% of our issued and outstanding common shares.  The Written Consent adopted resolutions which authorized the Company to act on a proposal to change the Company's state of incorporation from Florida to Nevada by the merger of Buckeye Oil & Gas, Inc. with and into its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brisset Beer International, Inc. Brisset Beer International, Inc., is a Nevada corporation.  As result of the merger, the name of the Company was changed from Buckeye Oil & Gas, Inc. to "Brisset Beer International, Inc." and the jurisdiction was changed from Florida to Nevada.  The changes became effective at the close of business on July 24, 2014.





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States on a going concern basis.





	Nature of Operations





	As a result of the Company's management having experience in the brewing business, the Company has acquired the rights to Broken 7 which is a craft beer brewed in the province of Quebec, Canada.  The Company is engaged principally in the marketing of Broken 7 and is contracting all brewing and distribution activities to a third-party service provider.  We operate in a single segment which is the craft beer market.  Our craft beer consists of single brand known as Broken 7 and is currently brewed, distributed, and marketed solely in Quebec, Canada.

	BRISSET BEER INTERNATIONAL, INC.


	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Unaudited)





	Interim Reporting





	In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments that are necessary to fairly state the financial position of Brisset Beer International. Inc. and the results of its operations for the periods presented.  This report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016.  The Company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context.  Accordingly, footnote disclosure, which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 has been omitted.  The results of operations for the six-month period ended November 30, 2016 are not necessary indicative of results for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2017 or for any future annual or interim period.





	NOTE 2 – ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in US dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  The Company commenced its craft brewing activities in September 2014.  During the six months ended November 30, 2016 the Company has incurred net losses of $79,216 and the Company expects losses to continue until it can achieve profitable operations from its craft beer operations.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	We will be required to expend substantial amounts of working capital in order to brew, distribute and market our Broken 7 brand of craft beer.  Our current operations have been funded entirely from capital raised from our private offering of securities from February 2014 through November 2016. We are entirely dependent on our ability to attract and receive additional funding from either the sale of securities or outside sources such as private investment or a strategic partner. We currently have no firm agreements or arrangements with respect to any such financing and there can be no assurance that any needed funds will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient funding of our operations in the future will restrict our ability to grow and reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. Our failure to raise additional funds will adversely affect our business operations, and may require us to suspend our operations, which in turn may result in a loss to the purchasers of our common stock.  After auditing our May 31, 2016 financial statements, our independent auditor issued a going concern opinion and our ability to continue is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital. If we are unable to obtain necessary financing, we will likely be required to curtail our development plans which could cause us to become dormant. Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders.





	The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to brew, distribute, and market our craft beer and ultimately achieve profitable operations and to generate sufficient cash flow from financing and operations to meet its obligations as they become payable.  Management may seek additional capital through a private placement and public offering of its common stock.  Although there are no assurances that management's plans will be realized, management believes that the Company will be able to continue operations in the future.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Unaudited)





	NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	Management's Estimates and Assumptions





	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and notes. Significant areas requiring the use of estimates relate to accrued liabilities and the impairment of goodwill.  Management believes the estimates utilized in preparing these financial statements are reasonable and prudent and are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ from those estimates.





	Cash and Cash Equivalents





	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes.





	Foreign Currency





	The functional currency of the Company at November 30, 2016 and May 31, 2016 is the Canadian dollar. Transactions that are denominated in a foreign currency are re-measured into the functional currency at the current exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Any foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are subsequently re-measured at current exchange rates, with gains or losses recognized as foreign exchange losses or gains in the statement of operations. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates. Expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Exchange gains and losses are included in statement of operations for the period.





	Adjustments arising from the translation of the Company's financial statements to United States dollars for presentation purposes due to differences between average rates and balance sheet rates are recorded in other comprehensive income.





	Concentration of Credit Risk





	The Company has no off-balance-sheet concentrations of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, options contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements. The Company maintains all of its cash balances with two financial institutions in the form of demand deposits.





	Loss per Share





	Income or loss per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per share does not differ from basic loss per share since the effect of the Company's warrants are anti-dilutive. Diluted income per share is calculated using the treasury stock method which uses the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and also includes the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares from outstanding and warrants. At November 30, 2016 potential common shares of 12,212,500 (2015- 5,515,000) related to outstanding share purchase warrants were excluded from the calculation of net loss per common share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Unaudited)





	NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued





	Comprehensive Income





	In accordance with ASC 220, "Comprehensive Income" ("ASC 220") all components of comprehensive income, including net loss, are reported in the financial statements in the period in which they are recognized. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Net loss and other comprehensive (income) loss, including foreign currency translation adjustments, are reported, net of any related tax effect, to arrive at comprehensive income. No taxes were recorded on items of other comprehensive income.





	Income Taxes


	 


	Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  Deferred tax assets are  reduced by a  valuation  allowance  when,  in the opinion  of  management,  it is more  likely than not  that  some portion or all of the deferred  tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.





	Uncertain Tax Positions





	The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, formerly FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The Company had no material unrecognized income tax assets or liabilities for the year ended May 31, 2016 or for the year ended May 31, 2015. The Company's policy regarding income tax interest and penalties is to expense those items as general and administrative expense but to identify them for tax purposes. During the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, there was no income tax, or related interest and penalty items in the income statement, or liability on the balance sheet. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and Nevada State. 

	Tax years 2011 to present remain open to income tax examination. 

	The Company is not currently involved in any income tax examinations.





	Fair Value of Financial Instruments





	The book values of cash, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value hierarchy under GAAP distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity's own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels: 





	 




	 




	 






	 




	• 





	Level one

	 — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	• 





	Level two

	 — Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	• 





	Level three

	 — Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.








	Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. We evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter.

	NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued





	Goodwill






	Pursuant to its agreement with Scenario A, the Company has acquired all rights to Broken 7, a craft beer brewed in Quebec, Canada.  The assets acquired consist of goodwill as no inventory or other assets were acquired.  The Company accounts for this assets under


	ASC No. 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other


	which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. The Company tests for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. If impairment exists, a write-down to fair value (measured by discounting estimated future cash flows) is recorded.






	Impairment of Long-lived Assets





	In accordance with ASC 360,

	Property, Plant and Equipment,

	long lived assets such as equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.  Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount of fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.  The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.






	In accordance with ASC 350

	Intangibles – Goodwill and Other

	the Company performs a qualitative assessment at the end of each reporting period to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.






	Revenue recognition





	Revenue from the Company's craft beer business is received in the form of commissions.  The Company has contracted out services to a single supplier for brewing, labeling and distribution (note 4).  The Company recognizes commission revenue based on a percentage of sales with fixed margins as negotiated with the contract brewer.  Revenue is recorded at the time of delivery to the customer.





	Any receivables remaining unpaid forty-five days after invoicing by Blue Spike will be charged to the Company.  Blue Spike undertakes to pay the said receivable account to the Company without delay once recovered, less the costs of collection and late penalty fees.





	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption

	NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued





	ASU 2014-09 - Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers






	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which is the new comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. Entities will have the option of using either a full retrospective approach or a modified approach to adopt the guidance in the ASU. The Company does not expect any impact of adopting this guidance.






	ASU 2014-12 - Topic 718 - Compensation - Stock Compensation






	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period." This ASU provides more explicit guidance for treating share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the financial statements.










	ASU 2014-15 - Topic 205-40 - Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern



	 


	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Topic 205-40)", which requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for each annual and interim reporting period. If substantial doubt exists, additional disclosure is required. This new standard will be effective for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this new standard for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014 and the Company will continue to assess the impact on its financial statements.

	On December 2, 2014 the Company entered into a Manufacturing and Distribution Agreement with Breuvages Blue Spike ("Blue Spike"). The agreement sets forth minimum quantities which Blue Spike will manufacture for the Company, manufacturing costs and a gross margin upon which the Company will earn its commission.





	Blue Spike is responsible for brewing, labeling and distributing Broken 7 beer for the Company. The Company, with the approval of Blue Spike, can continue selling products manufactured by Blue Spike in the Company's own distribution network. Products sold within the Company's own distribution network are subject to higher margins for the Company.  The Company is responsible, at its expense, for the marketing and promotion of Broken 7, and has agreed to invest 25% of the gross margin of its products for marketing and advertising.





	The Company granted Blue Spike a right of first refusal if the Company sells or transfers all or a portion of its rights in its brands. If the Company is sold during the term of the agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Blue Spike 2.5% of the purchase price for every $250,000 of product sales, up to $5 million. The agreement also provides for various payment returns to Blue Spike if the Company is sold when the agreement is no longer in effect, depending on when and why the agreement is no longer in effect. The agreement is for an initial term of five years and is automatically renewed for five years unless either party notifies the other of its intention not to renew 180 days prior to the expiration of the term. The Company granted Blue Spike a right of first refusal to manufacture or act as exclusive agent for the distribution and sale of its products in other territories other than Quebec.





	On April 1, 2016, BBII amended the manufacturing and distribution agreement (the "Amendment") with Blue Spike to clarify sections 2.1.6 "BBII Margin", 5.1.4 Limitation, 5.2.1 Price, 6.2 Distribution Network, 6.7 Price of Products, and 6.8 BBII  Sales Network.  The Amendment also lists new Broken7 products under Schedules A and D, and includes the updated BBII Margins for new Broken7 products in Schedule F.





	On November 8, 2016, BBII amended the manufacturing and distribution agreement (the "Addendum) with Blue Spike.  The Addendum states that every three months commencing October 1, 2016, the Company shall issue to Blue Spike that number of shares of common stock of the Company which shall equal (a) 5% of the gross amount of sales of all products of the Company sold by Blue Spike during said three-month period divided by (b) the volume weighted average of the per share price during the 45 trading days prior to the end of the applicable quarter. Within 20 business days after the end of each quarter, the Company shall instruct its transfer agent to issue that number of the restricted shares to Blue Spike, and shall send Blue Spike the calculation evidencing the number of shares being issued.  Also, with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall issue 150,000 shares to Blue Spike (the "Bonus Shares").

	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations






	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of Brisset Beer International, Inc. (the "Company"), which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.  Certain statements contained in this report, including statements regarding the anticipated development and expansion of the Company's business, the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company, its directors or its officers, primarily with respect to the future operating performance of the Company and the products it expects to offer and other statements contained herein regarding matters that are not historical facts, are "forward-looking" statements.  Future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, future press releases and future oral or written statements made by or with the approval of the Company, which are not statements of historical fact, may contain forward-looking statements. Because such statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a more detailed listing of some of the risks and uncertainties facing the Company, please see the Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2016 filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.





	All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they are made.






	Plan of Operations






	Until April 2014 we were engaged in the acquisition and exploration of oil and gas properties.  We are currently engaged in developing our business to brew, distribute, market and sell a single brand of craft beer called Broken 7.





	Our initial plan is to brew, market and sell the craft beer in Quebec, Canada.  We hope in the future to expand the brand into Eastern Canada, with a focus on the province of Ontario and eventually market our product in the U.S., subject to obtaining sufficient funding and resources to develop and expand our business.





	On December 2, 2014 the Company entered into a five-year manufacturing and distribution agreement with Breuvages Blue Spike ("Blue Spike") pursuant to which Blue Spike has the exclusive right to manufacture, distribute and sell BBII's Broken7 beer in certain designated networks in the following Canadian provinces and U.S. states: Newfoundland, Prince- Edward Island, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Washington DC, Delaware, Maryland. The Company granted Blue Spike a right of first refusal to act as exclusive agent for the distribution and sale of its products in other new territories.





	Subject to Blue Spike's  approval of , the Company may  sell products manufactured by Blue Spike in the Company's own distribution network. Products sold within the Company's own distribution network are subject to higher margins for the Company.  The Company is responsible, at its expense, for the marketing and promotion of Broken 7, and has agreed to invest 25% of the gross margin of its products for marketing and advertising.





	The Company granted Blue Spike a right of first refusal if the Company sells or transfers all or a portion of its rights in its brands. If the Company is sold during the term of the agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Blue Spike 2.5% of the purchase price for every $250,000 of product sales, up to $5 million but not to exceed 50% of the sale price. The agreement also provides for various payment returns to Blue Spike if the Company is sold when the agreement is no longer in effect, depending on when and why the agreement is no longer in effect. The agreement will automatically renew for an additional five-year term unless either party notifies the other of its intention not to renew 180 days prior to the expiration of the initial term.





	On April 1, 2016, BBII amended the manufacturing and distribution agreement with Blue Spike to clarify certain of the business terms regarding the margins, pricing and distribution networks.





	On November 8, 2016, BBII issued an addendum to the manufacturing and distribution agreement with Blue Spike to offer shares of the Company in return for services rendered.

	The Company recognized $6,207 of commission revenue, which represented commissions paid to the Company under the Blue Spike manufacturing and distribution agreement, and from sales of craft beer at festivals during the three months ended November 30, 2016 compared to $14,173 for the three months ended November 30, 2015.






	Net Loss






	For the three months ended November 30, 2016 our net loss was $43,445 compared to $16,467 for the three months ended November 30, 2015.





	Operating Expenses





	Total operating expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2016 were $20,336 compared to $17,383 for the three months ended November 30, 2015.  The increase in operating expenses in the three months ended November 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended November 30, 2015 was primarily due to the hiring of a full time marketing employee and an increase to Stephan Pilon's employment agreement.  Operating expenses in the three months ended November 30, 2016 were comprised of advertising and promotion of $2,837 (2015 - $4,196), no commissions (2015 - $289), management fee of $10,175 (2015 - $9,545), travel of $0 (2015 - $777), miscellaneous of $0 (2015 - $2,576) and wages and benefits of $7,323 (2015 - $0).    Office and sundry expenses were $19,093 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 compared to $6,922 for the three months ended November 30, 2015.   The increase in office and sundry was due to the issuance of shares for services rendered. Professional fees were $8,642 in the three months ended November 30, 2016 compared to $4,750 for the three-months ended November 30, 2015.  The Company paid $1,131 in management and director fees during the three months ended November 30, 2016 compared to $1,135 during the same period in 2015





	Six months ended November 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended November 30, 2015






	Revenues






	The Company earned $17,605 of commission revenue from the sale of craft beer during the six months ended November 30, 2015 compared to $33,870 during the three months ended November 30, 2015.  Decrease in commission was due to the amendment of the manufacturing and distribution agreement with Blue Spike.






	Operating Expenses and Net Loss






	For the six months ended November 30, 2015 our net loss was $79,216 compared to $31,458 for the six months ended November 30, 2015.  Expenses have increased in the six months ended November 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended November 30, 2015 primarily due to an increase in the net loss.  Operating expenses increased in the six months ended November 30, 2015 to$51,600 from $36,330 in the six months ended November 30, 2015 due to an increase to Stephane Pilon's employment agreement and the hiring of a full-time marketing employee. Operating expenses comprised of advertising and promotion of $$14,675 (2015 - $13,406), commissions of $0 (2015 - $865), management fee of $20,579 (2015 - $17,697), travel of $1,604 (2014 - $1,694), miscellaneous of $0 (2015 - $2,667) and wages and benefits of $14,742 (2015 - $0).  Professional fees were $15,630 in the six months ended November 30, 2016 compared to $10,925 for the six-months ended November 30, 2015.  The higher professional fees in 2016 were the result of the Company incurring increased legal fees relating to its filing of an S1 Registration Statement.  Office and sundry increased in the six months ended November 30, 2016to $26,404 from $14,859 in the six months ended November 30, 2015.  This increase was due to the Company issuing shares for services rendered. The Company paid $2,287 in management and director fees during the six months ended November 30, 2016 and $2,308 during the same period in 2015.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources






	We had a negative cash balance of $3,499 and a negative working capital of $19,024 at November 30, 2016.  Net cash used in operating activities during the six months ended November 30, 2016 was $55,377 compared to $39,905 during the six months ended November 30, 2015.  A portion of the increase was due to an increase of the net loss for the six months ended November 30, 2016 to $79,216 from $31,458 for the six months ended November 30, 2015.  In addition, in the six months ended November 30, 2016 we had an inflow in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $391 compared to a net outflow of $1,591 from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the six months ended November 30, 2015.  There was a net inflow of $$4,008in related parties in the six months ended November 30, 2016 compared to a net outflow of $3,097 for the same period in 2015.  In the six months ended November 30, 6there was an outflow of $1,531 in changes in accounts receivable compared to an outflow of $3,872 for the same period in 2015.  There were financing activities of $18,750 received from the issuance of units during the six months ended November 30, 2016, compared to $42,000 received from the issuance of shares for the six months ended November 30, 2015.   There were no investing activities for either of the six months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015.





	Between August 2011 and November 2015 the Company has raised a total of $1,116,500 through the issuance of shares of common stock, which shares were offered by the Company pursuant to an exemption from registration under Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The funds received from these financings were used primarily to fund the Company's portion of drill programs under the Farmout Agreement and for general working capital purposes.  However, even with these financings current cash on hand is not sufficient to fund all of the Company's requirements for the next twelve months.





	We believe that we will need approximately $141,000 to fund our operations for the next 12 months.  We may seek to raise additional funding that we require in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock.  However, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our operations.  We currently do not have any agreements or arrangements in place for any future financing.





	Going Concern Consideration





	The Company has realized only limited revenue from its oil and gas operations and has since abandoned those interests and is currently focusing on developing a craft brewing business.    During the six months ended November 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $79,216.  Since inception on May 11, 2010, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $1,541,997 to November 30, 2016.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.





	We will be required to expend substantial amounts of working capital in order to brew, distribute and market our Broken7 brand of craft beer.  Our current operations to date have been funded entirely from capital raised from our private offering of securities from May 2010 through November 2016. We are entirely dependent on our ability to attract and receive additional funding from either the sale of securities or outside sources such as private investment or a strategic partner. We currently have no firm agreements or arrangements with respect to any such financing and there can be no assurance that any needed funds will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient funding of our operations in the future will restrict our ability to grow and reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. Our failure to raise additional funds will adversely affect our business operations, and may require us to suspend our operations, which in turn may result in a loss to the purchasers of our common stock.  After auditing our May 31, 2016 financial statements, our independent auditor issued a going concern opinion and our ability to continue is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital. If we are unable to obtain necessary financing, we will likely be required to curtail our development plans which could cause us to become dormant. Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders.





	The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to brew, distribute, and market craft beer and ultimately achieve profitable operations and to generate sufficient cash flow from financing and operations to meet its obligations as they become payable.






	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of Brisset Beer International, Inc. (the "Company"), which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Certain statements contained in this report, including statements regarding the anticipated development and expansion of the Company's business, the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company, its directors or its officers, primarily with respect to the future operating performance of the Company and the products it expects to offer and other statements contained herein regarding matters that are not historical facts, are "forward-looking" statements. Future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, future press releases and future oral or written statements made by or with the approval of the Company, which are not statements of historical fact, may contain forward-looking statements. Because such statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a more detailed listing of some of the risks and uncertainties facing the Company, please see the Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2016 filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they are made.  Plan of Operations  Until April 2014 we were engaged in the acquisition and exploration of oil and gas properties. We are currently engaged in developing our business to brew, distribute, market and sell a single brand of craft beer called Broken 7.  Our initial plan is to brew, market and sell the craft beer in Quebec, Canada. We hope in the future to expand the brand into Eastern Canada, with a focus on the province of Ontario and eventually market our product in the U.S., subject to obtaining sufficient funding and resources to develop and expand our business.  On December 2, 2014 the Company entered into a five-year manufacturing and distribution agreement with Breuvages Blue Spike ("Blue Spike") pursuant to which Blue Spike has the exclusive right to manufacture, distribute and sell BBII's Broken7 beer in certain designated networks in the following Canadian provinces and U.S. states: Newfoundland, Prince- Edward Island, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Washington DC, Delaware, Maryland. The Company granted Blue Spike a right of first refusal to act as exclusive agent for the distribution and sale of its products in other new territories.  Subject to Blue Spike's approval of , the Company may sell products manufactured by Blue Spike in the Company's own distribution network. Products sold within the Company's own distribution network are subject to higher margins for the Company. The Company is responsible, at its expense, for the marketing and promotion of Broken 7, and has agreed to invest 25% of the gross margin of its products for marketing and advertising.  The Company granted Blue Spike a right of first refusal if the Company sells or transfers all or a portion of its rights in its brands. If the Company is sold during the term of the agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Blue Spike 2.5% of the purchase price for every $250,000 of product sales, up to $5 million but not to exceed 50% of the sale price. The agreement also provides for various payment returns to Blue Spike if the Company is sold when the agreement is no longer in effect, depending on when and why the agreement is no longer in effect. The agreement will automatically renew for an additional five-year term unless either party notifies the other of its intention not to renew 180 days prior to the expiration of the initial term.  On April 1, 2016, BBII amended the manufacturing and distribution agreement with Blue Spike to clarify certain of the business terms regarding the margins, pricing and distribution networks.  On November 8, 2016, BBII issued an addendum to the manufacturing and distribution agreement with Blue Spike to offer shares of the Company in return for services rendered.  Results of Operations  Three months ended November 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended November 30, 2015  Revenues  The Company recognized $6,207 of commission revenue, which represented commissions paid to the Company under the Blue Spike manufacturing and distribution agreement, and from sales of craft beer at festivals during the three months ended November 30, 2016 compared to $14,173 for the three months ended November 30, 2015.  Net Loss  For the three months ended November 30, 2016 our net loss was $43,445 compared to $16,467 for the three months ended November 30, 2015.  Operating Expenses  Total operating expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2016 were $20,336 compared to $17,383 for the three months ended November 30, 2015. The increase in operating expenses in the three months ended November 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended November 30, 2015 was primarily due to the hiring of a full time marketing employee and an increase to Stephan Pilon's employment agreement. Operating expenses in the three months ended November 30, 2016 were comprised of advertising and promotion of $2,837 (2015 - $4,196), no commissions (2015 - $289), management fee of $10,175 (2015 - $9,545), travel of $0 (2015 - $777), miscellaneous of $0 (2015 - $2,576) and wages and benefits of $7,323 (2015 - $0). Office and sundry expenses were $19,093 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 compared to $6,922 for the three months ended November 30, 2015. The increase in office and sundry was due to the issuance of shares for services rendered. Professional fees were $8,642 in the three months ended November 30, 2016 compared to $4,750 for the three-months ended November 30, 2015. The Company paid $1,131 in management and director fees during the three months ended November 30, 2016 compared to $1,135 during the same period in 2015  Six months ended November 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended November 30, 2015  Revenues  The Company earned $17,605 of commission revenue from the sale of craft beer during the six months ended November 30, 2015 compared to $33,870 during the three months ended November 30, 2015. Decrease in commission was due to the amendment of the manufacturing and distribution agreement with Blue Spike.  Operating Expenses and Net Loss  For the six months ended November 30, 2015 our net loss was $79,216 compared to $31,458 for the six months ended November 30, 2015. Expenses have increased in the six months ended November 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended November 30, 2015 primarily due to an increase in the net loss. Operating expenses increased in the six months ended November 30, 2015 to$51,600 from $36,330 in the six months ended November 30, 2015 due to an increase to Stephane Pilon's employment agreement and the hiring of a full-time marketing employee. Operating expenses comprised of advertising and promotion of $$14,675 (2015 - $13,406), commissions of $0 (2015 - $865), management fee of $20,579 (2015 - $17,697), travel of $1,604 (2014 - $1,694), miscellaneous of $0 (2015 - $2,667) and wages and benefits of $14,742 (2015 - $0). Professional fees were $15,630 in the six months ended November 30, 2016 compared to $10,925 for the six-months ended November 30, 2015. The higher professional fees in 2016 were the result of the Company incurring increased legal fees relating to its filing of an S1 Registration Statement. Office and sundry increased in the six months ended November 30, 2016to $26,404 from $14,859 in the six months ended November 30, 2015. This increase was due to the Company issuing shares for services rendered. The Company paid $2,287 in management and director fees during the six months ended November 30, 2016 and $2,308 during the same period in 2015.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We had a negative cash balance of $3,499 and a negative working capital of $19,024 at November 30, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities during the six months ended November 30, 2016 was $55,377 compared to $39,905 during the six months ended November 30, 2015. A portion of the increase was due to an increase of the net loss for the six months ended November 30, 2016 to $79,216 from $31,458 for the six months ended November 30, 2015. In addition, in the six months ended November 30, 2016 we had an inflow in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $391 compared to a net outflow of $1,591 from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the six months ended November 30, 2015. There was a net inflow of $$4,008in related parties in the six months ended November 30, 2016 compared to a net outflow of $3,097 for the same period in 2015. In the six months ended November 30, 6there was an outflow of $1,531 in changes in accounts receivable compared to an outflow of $3,872 for the same period in 2015. There were financing activities of $18,750 received from the issuance of units during the six months ended November 30, 2016, compared to $42,000 received from the issuance of shares for the six months ended November 30, 2015. There were no investing activities for either of the six months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015.  Between August 2011 and November 2015 the Company has raised a total of $1,116,500 through the issuance of shares of common stock, which shares were offered by the Company pursuant to an exemption from registration under Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The funds received from these financings were used primarily to fund the Company's portion of drill programs under the Farmout Agreement and for general working capital purposes. However, even with these financings current cash on hand is not sufficient to fund all of the Company's requirements for the next twelve months.  We believe that we will need approximately $141,000 to fund our operations for the next 12 months. We may seek to raise additional funding that we require in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. However, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our operations. We currently do not have any agreements or arrangements in place for any future financing.  Going Concern Consideration  The Company has realized only limited revenue from its oil and gas operations and has since abandoned those interests and is currently focusing on developing a craft brewing business. During the six months ended November 30, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $79,216. Since inception on May 11, 2010, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $1,541,997 to November 30, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  We will be required to expend substantial amounts of working capital in order to brew, distribute and market our Broken7 brand of craft beer. Our current operations to date have been funded entirely from capital raised from our private offering of securities from May 2010 through November 2016. We are entirely dependent on our ability to attract and receive additional funding from either the sale of securities or outside sources such as private investment or a strategic partner. We currently have no firm agreements or arrangements with respect to any such financing and there can be no assurance that any needed funds will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient funding of our operations in the future will restrict our ability to grow and reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. Our failure to raise additional funds will adversely affect our business operations, and may require us to suspend our operations, which in turn may result in a loss to the purchasers of our common stock. After auditing our May 31, 2016 financial statements, our independent auditor issued a going concern opinion and our ability to continue is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital. If we are unable to obtain necessary financing, we will likely be required to curtail our development plans which could cause us to become dormant. Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders.  The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to brew, distribute, and market craft beer and ultimately achieve profitable operations and to generate sufficient cash flow from financing and operations to meet its obligations as they become payable.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  Mar 03, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Unaudited)





	NOTE 1 – NATURE OF BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS





	Organization and Basis of Presentation





	Brisset Beer International, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Florida on May 11, 2010 under the name Benefit Solutions Outsourcing Corp.





	On May 19, 2011 the Board of Directors and the majority shareholder of the Company approved a change to the Company's Articles of Incorporation which affected a 17 for one forward stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock, changed the name of the company to "Buckeye Oil & Gas, Inc.", and changed the business of the Company to oil and gas exploration.  The changes became effective at the close of business on June 1, 2011. The forward stock split was distributed to all shareholders of record on March 31, 2011. No cash was paid or distributed as a result of the forward stock split and no fractional shares were issued. All fractional shares which would otherwise be required to be issued as a result of the stock split were rounded up to the nearest whole share. There was no change in the par value of our common stock.





	On April 4, 2014, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Scenario A, a private Quebec corporation, to purchase all assets relating to the product known as "Broken 7", a craft beer locally brewed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire Broken 7 for $25,000 payable in two installments to Scenario A with $12,500 to be paid at closing and $12,500 to be paid 60 business days after the closing date of April 7, 2014 (second installment payment due date is July 3, 2014).  The Company's principal executive officer, Stephane Pilon, also serves as Scenario A's President.  The Corporation's Secretary and director, Pol Brisset, also serves as Scenario A's Vice-President.  Mr. Pilon and Mr. Brisset are majority owners of Scenario A.  The Company made the first payment of $12,500 on closing.  The Company and Scenario A have amended the original agreement such that the due date of the second payment of $12,500 has been extended an additional 30 business days to August 15, 2014.  On August 14, 2014 the Company made the second payment.





	On May 21, 2014, the Company received a written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders (the "Written Consent") from the holders of 1,561,000 shares of common stock representing, at that time, 73.62% of our issued and outstanding common shares.  The Written Consent adopted resolutions which authorized the Company to act on a proposal to change the Company's state of incorporation from Florida to Nevada by the merger of Buckeye Oil & Gas, Inc. with and into its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brisset Beer International, Inc. Brisset Beer International, Inc., is a Nevada corporation.  As result of the merger, the name of the Company was changed from Buckeye Oil & Gas, Inc. to "Brisset Beer International, Inc." and the jurisdiction was changed from Florida to Nevada.  The changes became effective at the close of business on July 24, 2014.





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States on a going concern basis.





	Nature of Operations





	As a result of the Company's management having experience in the brewing business, the Company has acquired the rights to Broken 7 which is a craft beer brewed in the province of Quebec, Canada.  The Company is engaged principally in the marketing of Broken 7 and is contracting all brewing and distribution activities to a third-party service provider.  We operate in a single segment which is the craft beer market.  Our craft beer consists of single brand known as Broken 7 and is currently brewed, distributed, and marketed solely in Quebec, Canada.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Unaudited)





	Interim Reporting





	In the opinion of management the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments that are necessary to fairly state the financial position of Brisset Beer International. Inc. and the results of its operations for the periods presented.  This report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016.  The Company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context.  Accordingly, footnote disclosure, which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 has been omitted.  The results of operations for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 are not necessary indicative of results for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2017 or for any future annual or interim period.





	NOTE 2 – ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in US dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.  The Company commenced its craft brewing activities in September 2014.  During the three months ended August 31, 2016 the Company has incurred net losses of $35,771 and the Company expects losses to continue until it can achieve profitable operations from its craft beer operations.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	We will be required to expend substantial amounts of working capital in order to brew, distribute and market our Broken 7 brand of craft beer.  Our current operations have been funded entirely from capital raised from our private offering of securities from February 2014 through August 2016. We are entirely dependent on our ability to attract and receive additional funding from either the sale of securities or outside sources such as private investment or a strategic partner. We currently have no firm agreements or arrangements with respect to any such financing and there can be no assurance that any needed funds will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient funding of our operations in the future will restrict our ability to grow and reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. Our failure to raise additional funds will adversely affect our business operations, and may require us to suspend our operations, which in turn may result in a loss to the purchasers of our common stock.  After auditing our May 31, 2016 financial statements, our independent auditor issued a going concern opinion and our ability to continue is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital. If we are unable to obtain necessary financing, we will likely be required to curtail our development plans which could cause us to become dormant. Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders.





	The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to brew, distribute, and market our craft beer and ultimately achieve profitable operations and to generate sufficient cash flow from financing and operations to meet its obligations as they become payable.  Management may seek additional capital through a private placement and public offering of its common stock.  Although there are no assurances that management's plans will be realized, management believes that the Company will be able to continue operations in the future.

	NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	Management's Estimates and Assumptions





	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and notes. Significant areas requiring the use of estimates relate to accrued liabilities and the impairment of goodwill.  Management believes the estimates utilized in preparing these financial statements are reasonable and prudent and are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ from those estimates.





	Cash and Cash Equivalents





	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes.





	Foreign Currency





	The functional currency of the Company at August 31, 2016 and May 31, 2016 is the Canadian dollar. Transactions that are denominated in a foreign currency are re-measured into the functional currency at the current exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Any foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are subsequently re-measured at current exchange rates, with gains or losses recognized as foreign exchange losses or gains in the statement of operations. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates. Expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Exchange gains and losses are included in statement of operations for the period.





	Adjustments arising from the translation of the Company's financial statements to United States dollars for presentation purposes due to differences between average rates and balance sheet rates are recorded in other comprehensive income.





	Concentration of Credit Risk





	The Company has no off-balance-sheet concentrations of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, options contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements. The Company maintains all of its cash balances with two financial institutions in the form of demand deposits.





	Loss per Share





	Income or loss per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per share does not differ from basic loss per share since the effect of the Company's warrants are anti-dilutive. Diluted income per share is calculated using the treasury stock method which uses the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and also includes the dilutive effect of potentially issuable common shares from outstanding and warrants. At August 31, 2016, potential common shares of 18,317,500 (2015- 5,290,000) related to outstanding share purchase warrants were excluded from the calculation of net loss per common share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

	NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued





	Comprehensive Income





	In accordance with ASC 220, "Comprehensive Income" ("ASC 220") all components of comprehensive income, including net loss, are reported in the financial statements in the period in which they are recognized. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Net loss and other comprehensive (income) loss, including foreign currency translation adjustments, are reported, net of any related tax effect, to arrive at comprehensive income. No taxes were recorded on items of other comprehensive income.





	Income Taxes


	 


	Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  Deferred tax assets are  reduced by a  valuation  allowance  when,  in the opinion  of  management,  it is more  likely than not  that  some portion or all of the deferred  tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.





	Uncertain Tax Positions





	The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, formerly FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The Company had no material unrecognized income tax assets or liabilities for the year ended May 31, 2016 or for the year ended May 31, 2015. The Company's policy regarding income tax interest and penalties is to expense those items as general and administrative expense but to identify them for tax purposes. During the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, there was no income tax, or related interest and penalty items in the income statement, or liability on the balance sheet. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and Nevada State. 

	Tax years 2011 to present remain open to income tax examination. 

	The Company is not currently involved in any income tax examinations.





	Fair Value of Financial Instruments





	The book values of cash, prepaid expenses, and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value hierarchy under GAAP distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entity's own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels: 


	 





	 




	• 





	Level one

	 — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;






	 




	• 





	Level two

	 — Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and






	 




	• 





	Level three

	 — Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.








	Determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. We evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter.

	NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued





	Goodwill






	Pursuant to its agreement with Scenario A, the Company has acquired all rights to Broken 7, a craft beer brewed in Quebec, Canada.  The assets acquired consist of goodwill as no inventory or other assets were acquired.  The Company accounts for this assets under


	ASC No. 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other


	which states that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. The Company tests for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. If impairment exists, a write-down to fair value (measured by discounting estimated future cash flows) is recorded.






	Impairment of Long-lived Assets





	In accordance with ASC 360,

	Property, Plant and Equipment,

	long lived assets such as equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.  Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount of fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.  The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.






	In accordance with ASC 350

	Intangibles – Goodwill and Other

	the Company performs a qualitative assessment at the end of each reporting period to determine if any events or circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry that would indicate that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.






	Revenue recognition





	Revenue from the Company's craft beer business is received in the form of commissions.  The Company has contracted out services to a single supplier for brewing, labeling and distribution (note 4).  The Company recognizes commission revenue based on a percentage of sales with fixed margins as negotiated with the contract brewer.  Revenue is recorded at the time of delivery to the customer.





	Any receivables remaining unpaid forty-five days after invoicing by Blue Spike will be charged to the Company.  Blue Spike undertakes to pay the said receivable account to the Company without delay once recovered, less the costs of collection and late penalty fees.





	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption

	.

	ASU 2014-09 - Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers






	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which is the new comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. Entities will have the option of using either a full retrospective approach or a modified approach to adopt the guidance in the ASU. The Company does not expect any impact of adopting this guidance.






	ASU 2014-12 - Topic 718 - Compensation - Stock Compensation






	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period." This ASU provides more explicit guidance for treating share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the financial statements.










	ASU 2014-15 - Topic 205-40 - Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern



	 


	August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Topic 205-40)", which requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for each annual and interim reporting period. If substantial doubt exists, additional disclosure is required. This new standard will be effective for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this new standard for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014 and the Company will continue to assess the impact on its financial statements.

	NOTE 4 - CONTRACT BREWING AGREEMENT





	On December 2, 2014 the Company entered into a Manufacturing and Distribution Agreement with Breuvages Blue Spike ("Blue Spike"). The agreement sets forth minimum quantities which Blue Spike will manufacture for the Company, manufacturing costs and a gross margin upon which the Company will earn its commission.





	Blue Spike is responsible for brewing, labeling and distributing Broken 7 beer for the Company. The Company, with the approval of Blue Spike, can continue selling products manufactured by Blue Spike in the Company's own distribution network. Products sold within the Company's own distribution network are subject to higher margins for the Company.  The Company is responsible, at its expense, for the marketing and promotion of Broken 7, and has agreed to invest 25% of the gross margin of its products for marketing and advertising.





	The Company granted Blue Spike a right of first refusal if the Company sells or transfers all or a portion of its rights in its brands. If the Company is sold during the term of the agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Blue Spike 2.5% of the purchase price for every $250,000 of product sales, up to $5 million. The agreement also provides for various payment returns to Blue Spike if the Company is sold when the agreement is no longer in effect, depending on when and why the agreement is no longer in effect. The agreement is for an initial term of five years and is automatically renewed for five years unless either party notifies the other of its intention not to renew 180 days prior to the expiration of the term. The Company granted Blue Spike a right of first refusal to manufacture or act as exclusive agent for the distribution and sale of its products in other territories other than Quebec.





	On April 1, 2016, BBII amended the manufacturing and distribution agreement (the "Amendment") with Blue Spike to clarify sections 2.1.6 "BBII Margin", 5.1.4 Limitation, 5.2.1 Price, 6.2 Distribution Network, 6.7 Price of Products, and 6.8 BBII  Sales Network.  The Amendment also lists new Broken7 products under Schedules A and D, and includes the updated BBII Margins for new Broken7 products in Schedule F.





	NOTE 5 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS





	Broken 7





	On April 4, 2014, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Scenario A, a private Quebec corporation, to purchase all assets relating to the product known as "Broken 7", a craft beer locally brewed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire Broken 7 for $25,000 payable in two installments to Scenario A with $12,500 to be paid at closing and $12,500 to be paid 60 business days after the closing date of April 7, 2014 (second installment payment due date is July 3, 2014).  The purchase was of the Broken 7 trademark and recipe. No other assets were acquired.  The Company's principal executive officer and director, Stephane Pilon, also serves as Scenario A's President.  The Corporation's Secretary and director, Pol Brisset, also serves as Scenario A's Vice-President.  Mr. Pilon and Mr. Brisset are majority owners of Scenario A.  The Company made the first payment of $12,500 on closing.  The Company and Scenario A have amended the original agreement such that the due date of the second payment of $12,500 has been extended an additional 30 business days to August 15, 2014.  On August 14, 2014 the Company made the second payment. The fair value of Broken 7 is measured by level three hierarchy of fair value of financial instruments.

	Plan of Operations






	Until April 2014 we were engaged in the acquisition and exploration of oil and gas properties.  We are currently engaged in developing our business to brew, distribute, market and sell a single brand of craft beer called Broken 7.





	Our initial plan is to brew, market and sell the craft beer in Quebec, Canada.  We hope in the future to expand the brand into Eastern Canada, with a focus on the province of Ontario and eventually market our product in the U.S., subject to obtaining sufficient funding and resources to develop and expand our business.





	On December 2, 2014 the Company entered into a five-year manufacturing and distribution agreement with Breuvages Blue Spike ("Blue Spike") pursuant to which Blue Spike has the exclusive right to manufacture, distribute and sell BBII's Broken7 beer in certain designated networks in the following Canadian provinces and U.S. states: Newfoundland, Prince- Edward Island, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Washington DC, Delaware, Maryland. The Company granted Blue Spike a right of first refusal to act as exclusive agent for the distribution and sale of its products in other new territories.





	Subject to Blue Spike's  approval of , the Company may  sell products manufactured by Blue Spike in the Company's own distribution network. Products sold within the Company's own distribution network are subject to higher margins for the Company.  The Company is responsible, at its expense, for the marketing and promotion of Broken 7, and has agreed to invest 25% of the gross margin of its products for marketing and advertising.





	The Company granted Blue Spike a right of first refusal if the Company sells or transfers all or a portion of its rights in its brands. If the Company is sold during the term of the agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Blue Spike 2.5% of the purchase price for every $250,000 of product sales, up to $5 million but not to exceed 50% of the sale price. The agreement also provides for various payment returns to Blue Spike if the Company is sold when the agreement is no longer in effect, depending on when and why the agreement is no longer in effect. The agreement will automatically renew for an additional five-year term unless either party notifies the other of its intention not to renew 180 days prior to the expiration of the initial term.





	On April 1, 2016, BBII amended the manufacturing and distribution agreement with Blue Spike to clarify certain of the business terms regarding the margins, pricing and distribution networks.






	Results of Operations






	Three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015






	Revenues






	The Company recognized $11,398 of commission revenue, which represented commissions paid to the Company under the Blue Spike manufacturing and distribution agreement, and from sales of craft beer at festivals  during the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $19,697 for the three months ended August 31, 2015.



	Net Loss






	For the three months ended August 31, 2016 our net loss was $35,771 compared to $14,991 for the three months ended August 31, 2015.







	17










	Operating Expenses





	Total operating expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2016 were $31,264 compared to $18,947 for the three months ended August 31, 2015.  The increase in operating expenses in the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2015 was primarily due to the hiring of a full time marketing employee and an increase to Stephan Pilon's employment agreement.  Operating expenses in the three months ended August 31, 2016 were comprised of advertising and promotion of $11,818 (2015 - $9,210), no commissions (2015 - $576), management fee of $10,404 (2015 - $7,429), travel of $1,621 (2015 - $918), miscellaneous of $0 (2015 - $91) and wages and benefits of $5,736 (2015 - $723).    Office and sundry expenses were $7,311 for the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $7,937 for the three months ended August 31, 2015.  Professional fees were $6,988 in the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $6,175 for the three-months ended August 31, 2015.  The Company paid $1,156 in management and director fees during the three months ended August 31, 2016 compared to $1,173 during the same period in 2015






	Liquidity and Capital Resources






	We had a cash balance of $6,290 and a negative working capital of $5,993 at August 31, 2016.  Net cash used in operating activities during the three months ended August 31, 2016 was $30,174 compared to $22,006 during the three months ended August 31, 2015.  A portion of the fluctuation was due to an increase of the net loss for the three months ended August 31, 2016 to $35,711 from $14,991 for the three months ended August 31, 2015.  In addition, in the three months ended August 31, 2016 we had an inflow in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $5,155 compared to a net inflow of $3,763 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the three months ended August 31, 2016.  There was a net inflow in related parties in the three months ended August 31, 2016 of $5,970 compared to a net outflow of $1,387 for the same period in 2015.  In the three months ended August 31, 2016 there was an outflow of $10,308 in changes in accounts receivable compared to an outflow of $8,251 for the same period in 2015.  There were no financing activities during the three months ended August 31, 2016 as the proceeds for the issuance of 6,000,000 units of common stock was not received until after August 31, 2016.  In the three months ended August 31, 2015, $19,500 was received from the issuance of 65,000 units of common stock.  There were no investing activities for the three months ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015.





	Between August 2011 and August 2016, the Company has raised a total of $1,100,750 through the issuance of shares of common stock, which shares were offered by the Company pursuant to an exemption from registration under Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  The funds received from these financings were used primarily to fund the Company's portion of drill programs under the Farmout Agreement and for general working capital purposes.  However, even with these financings current cash on hand is not sufficient to fund all of the Company's requirements for the next twelve months.





	We believe that we will need approximately $141,000 to fund our operations for the next 12 months.  We may seek to raise additional funding that we require in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock.  However, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our operations.  We currently do not have any agreements or arrangements in place for any future financing.






	 


	Going Concern Consideration






	The Company has realized only limited revenue from its oil and gas operations and has since abandoned those interests and is currently focusing on developing a craft brewing business.    During the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company incurred a net loss of $35,771.  Since inception on May 11, 2010, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $1,498,552 to August 31, 2016.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.







	18










	We will be required to expend substantial amounts of working capital in order to brew, distribute and market our Broken7 brand of craft beer.  Our current operations to date have been funded entirely from capital raised from our private offering of securities from May 2010 through August 2016. We are entirely dependent on our ability to attract and receive additional funding from either the sale of securities or outside sources such as private investment or a strategic partner. We currently have no firm agreements or arrangements with respect to any such financing and there can be no assurance that any needed funds will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The inability to obtain sufficient funding of our operations in the future will restrict our ability to grow and reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. Our failure to raise additional funds will adversely affect our business operations, and may require us to suspend our operations, which in turn may result in a loss to the purchasers of our common stock.  After auditing our May 31, 2016 financial statements, our independent auditor issued a going concern opinion and our ability to continue is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital. If we are unable to obtain necessary financing, we will likely be required to curtail our development plans which could cause us to become dormant. Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders.





	The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to brew, distribute, and market craft beer and ultimately achieve profitable operations and to generate sufficient cash flow from financing and operations to meet its obligations as they become payable.






	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

	CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING





	There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.












	PART II - OTHER INFORMATION







	Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
