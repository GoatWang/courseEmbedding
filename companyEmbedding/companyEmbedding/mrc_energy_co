A Proud Past and a Solid Future
This slogan was selected from a contest held among McJunkin employees in 1971 when the company was celebrating its 50th year in business. In 1977 Lew Ketchum, a Delaware Indian, turned a dream into reality when he founded Red Man Pipe & Supply Co., the nation’s only full-service, minority-owned oil field supply company. On November 1, 2007 McJunkin Corporation and Red Man Pipe & Supply Company merged to form, what is now, MRC Global. The history of our new company continues to develop daily.

Company Introduction

                      WELCOME TO MRC GREEN ENERGY COMPANY India is the sixth largest energy consumer in the world, consuming about 3 per cent of the world&＃039;s total energy per year. Though the annual electricity generation and consumption have nearly doubled since 1990 the country has been facing peak level electricity shortage to the extent of 11-18 percent. Nearly, out of half of a million or so villages in India, about 80, 000 remain completely un-electrified. Thus there is a need for development of long term sustainable solutions so that the non electrified villages have reliable, regular, adequate, or good quality power.
