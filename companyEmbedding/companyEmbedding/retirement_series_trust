Northern Trust Asset Management Launches Goal Engineer Series for Individual Retirement Accounts
Target date managed account portfolios focus on market, longevity and inflation risk
CHICAGO, September 21, 2016 —
Northern Trust Asset Management today announced its Goal Engineer Series of target date managed accounts, launched in response to increased demand for robust solutions for individual retirement accounts. The series of seven portfolios provides solutions for investors who are either building for their life in retirement or managing their savings during retirement.
“We recognize saving as early as possible and effectively managing funds in retirement are fundamental challenges of retirement investing,” said Melinda Mecca, managing director of Managed Account Solutions at Northern Trust Asset Management. “Goal Engineer is a simple, effective, low-cost solution that is designed to help financial advisors help their clients invest smarter and smoother, and take the right risks at the right time.”
The Goal Engineer Series uses a diversified asset allocation framework and Northern Trust’s investment glidepath, which aims to minimize the effects of market volatility by automatically adjusting the investment mix from more aggressive to more conservative as the target date draws near. The disciplined, multi-asset class approach includes innovative factor-based equity strategies, traditional active fixed income investments and inflation-sensitive securities.
The growth component of Goal Engineer portfolios uses Engineered Equity™, Northern Trust’s targeted equity exposure strategy that includes such factors as value, low volatility, quality and size, and systematically combines the best of active and passive management. Through equity factor exposures, this method can provide greater consistency, less risk and added transparency, as well as the potential for higher returns with less risk compared to traditional equity indexing. The income portion of the glidepath is delivered through Northern Trust’s active fixed income strategies, and the inflation-sensitive investments include commodities, global real estate and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).
“Our new generation of managed accounts is designed to better align portfolio composition with an investor’s time horizon until retirement and expected lifespan in retirement,” said Northern Trust Chief Investment Officer Bob Browne. “In short, Goal Engineer portfolios are designed to build better outcomes by managing market, inflation and longevity risk.”
Unlike traditional target date funds in which all the asset classes are contained within one fund, Goal Engineer is a Separately Managed Account investing in Northern Trust products to gain multi-asset class exposure. This structure provides enhanced transparency into the asset allocation. Additionally, it provides flexibility in the event investment objectives change in the future,
“We expect that regulatory changes will increase advisor demand for effective individual retirement account solutions, said Mecca. “To meet this demand, the Goal Engineer Series builds on Northern Trust’s long-standing heritage as a trusted investment management institution by delivering a cost-efficient solution for advisors and investors.”
Goal Engineer is available to individual investors through registered investment advisors.

Vanguard portfolio holdings disclaimerPortfolio holdings information:Vanguard may publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, the ten largest stock portfolio holdings of a Vanguard fund, and the percentage of the fund's total assets that each of these holdings represents as of the most recent calendar-quarter-end, 15 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter, except for Vanguard index funds (15 calendar days after the end of the month).Vanguard may also publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, the ten largest stock portfolio holdings of a Vanguard fund, and the aggregate percentage that these holdings represent of the fund's total net assets and equities, as of the most recent month-end, ten business days after the end of the month.Vanguard may publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, a detailed list of the securities (aggregated by issuer for money market funds) held in a Vanguard fund (portfolio holdings) as of the most recent calendar-quarter-end, 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter, except for Vanguard Market Neutral Fund (60 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter), Vanguard index funds (15 calendar days after the end of the month), and Vanguard Money Market Funds (within five [5 business days after the last business day of the preceding month). Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, Vanguard may exclude any portion of these portfolio holdings from publication on this Site when deemed in the best interest of the fund.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on a delayed basis and will not necessarily represent all of the actual investments held by the relevant Vanguard fund.Portfolio holdings may exclude any temporary cash investments and equity index products.The following additional terms and conditions apply to the publication on this Site of any Vanguard fund's portfolio holdings as described above:By accessing the portfolio holdings, you agree not to reproduce, distribute, or disseminate the portfolio holdings, in whole or in part, in any form without prior written permission of Vanguard.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on an "as is" basis, and Vanguard makes no express or implied warranties or representations with respect to the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or fitness of the portfolio holdings or any financial results you may achieve from their use.In no event shall Vanguard or its affiliates have any liability relating to the use of the portfolio holdings.






StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for bond funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for bond funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.






About the optionsFund share classesA fund may offer multiple share classes. The objectives, strategies, and policies for all share classes of a fund are identical. However, expense ratios vary by share class, reflecting the differing costs of providing services to the holders of each share class.Here are some of the key distinctions:Investor SharesTraditional shares for individual investors that typically feature low minimum initial investments.Admiral™ SharesA lower-cost share class generally available without a minimum initial investment requirement to institutional investors and financial intermediary clients. Vanguard created Admiral Shares to recognize and encourage the cost savings stemming from large, long-standing investment accounts and to pass these savings on to the shareholders who generate them.Institutional SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances of $5 million or more.Institutional Plus SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances from $100 million to $200 million, depending on the fund.Institutional Select SharesShares generally available to large institutional investors. Fund account minimums range from $3 billion to $5 billion, depending on fund.ETF SharesExchange-traded shares of certain Vanguard index funds, ETF Shares combine the benefits of indexing, such as low costs and broad market diversification, with the trading and pricing flexibility of individual stocks.Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.Notes:All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.

* The Management Fee includes a 0.20% fee ($2.00 per $1,000 invested) paid to the issuers of synthetic investment contracts (also known as ”wrap agreements”). The fund performance results are net of these benefit responsive contract costs.


	 	 
	

Fees

•

Purchase fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor buys shares. This fee is not a sales charge or load because it is paid directly to the fund to offset the costs of trading certain securities. None

•

Redemption fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor sells shares. A redemption fee differs from a back-end load because the money is paid back into the fund. Many funds charge redemption fees only when shares are bought and then sold within a specific period of time, generally in an effort to discourage market-timing and short-term trading. Some brokers also charge their clients redemption fees for the sale of securities. None

Vanguard Fixed Income Group
Product management
Vanguard Retirement Savings Trust seeks stable returns comparable to those of short-term fixed income securities by investing in a combination of synthetic contracts (backed primarily by Vanguard bond trust funds), traditional insurance, and bank contracts. The average maturity range of the trust is 2–4 years. Because it invests in contracts designed to preserve a stable net asset value, the trust generates income without the price volatility associated with traditional short-term credit instruments. The trust maintains a strict credit policy, investing with issuers rated A- and higher, and investing in funds that are rated investment grade or higher. A dedicated team of analysts regularly assesses the financial health of each contract issuer.

* Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). ”NR” is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include a fund’s investment in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund or Vanguard Municipal Cash Management Fund, each of which invests in high-quality money market instruments and may serve as a cash management vehicle for the Vanguard funds, trusts, and accounts. U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, and U.S. Agency mortgage-backed securities appear under ”U.S. Government. Credit-quality ratings for each issue are obtained from Barclays using ratings derived from Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard & Poor’s (S&P). When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used. When ratings are available from two of the agencies, the lower rating is used. When one rating is available, that rating is used.

Risk and volatility






A stable value fund investment does not constitute a balanced investment program. The fund will seek to invest with a diversified selection of investment contract issuers, however the number of qualifying institutions may fluctuate over time. Although Vanguard selects only highly rated investments for the fund, the contracts held by the fund are not guaranteed by the U.S. government, Vanguard, the trustee, or your retirement plan. A stable value fund is designed as a low-risk investment, but you could still lose money by investing in it. The primary risks of investing in the fund are:  Credit risk: The chance that an issuer will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it invests mainly in investments that are considered high-quality. Event risk: The chance that a synthetic or traditional contract issuer will pay participant benefits at a value less than book value because of the occurrence of an event or condition which is outside the normal operation of the plan (for example, layoffs, plan amendments, sale of a division, participant withdrawals due to the plan sponsor’s insolvency or bankruptcy). Due to the diversification of plans participating in the fund, event risk is low. Income risk: The possibility that a fund’s income will decline as a result of falling interest rates. Investments are generally made for terms of at least two to five years, on average, producing a rate of fund income that will be higher than that earned on shorter-maturity money market funds. But because it is influenced by average interest rates over a period of several years, the fund’s income yield may remain above or stay below current market yields during some time periods. Income risk will be moderately high for the fund. Inflation risk: The chance that fund returns will not keep pace with the cost of living. Inflation risk will be moderate for the fund. Market risk: The chance that the fund’s price per share will change as a result of movements in market interest rates, resulting in gains or losses on investments made in the fund. The risk is minimized by investing primarily in investment contracts that enable the fund, under present accounting standards, to value its assets at book value. Most often associated with stock mutual funds, short-term market risk is low.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing. 
Although the target date funds are managed for investors on a projected retirement date time frame, the funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' retirement goals will be met. The target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals. American Funds investment professionals manage the target date fund's portfolio, moving it from a more growth-oriented strategy to a more income-oriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date. Investment professionals continue to manage each fund for 30 years after it reaches its target date.
