Board of Directors
Nominees



(a)     Subject to Section
2.4, the Investors shall be entitled collectively to designate (i)
two nominees (each an " Investor Nominee ") for election to

of the Investors is not less than 11.1% and (ii) one Investor
Nominee for election to the Board of Directors, for so long as the
As-Exchanged Ownership of the Investors is less than 11.1% but
greater than 5%. Each Investor Nominee must be an individual
acceptable to the Parent, acting reasonably, and eligible to serve
as a director of the Parent pursuant to applicable Law.
(b)     The Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Investor

actions taken by the Parent to ensure the election of the other
nominees selected by the Board of Directors for election to the
Board of Directors.
(c)     So long as the
Investors are entitled collectively pursuant to Section 2.4 to
designate Investor Nominees to the Board of Directors, the size of
the Board of Directors shall not exceed nine directors.
(d)     The Investors shall
advise the Parent of the identity of an Investor Nominee at least
60 days prior to any meeting of shareholders at which directors of
the Parent are to be elected or within 10 days of being notified of
the record date for such a meeting. If the Investors do not advise
the Parent of the identity of an Investor Nominee prior to such
deadline, then the Investors will be deemed to have nominated their
incumbent nominee.
(e)     The parties
acknowledge that the initial Investor Nominees are: (i) Dean Hollis
and (ii) Albert D. Bolles, and have been appointed to the Board of
Directors as of the date hereof.
(f)     In the event that an
Investor Nominee shall cease to serve as a director of the Parent,
whether due to such Investor Nominee's death, disability,
resignation or removal, the Parent shall cause the Board of
Directors to promptly appoint a replacement Investor Nominee (who
shall be a different person) designated by the Investors to fill
the vacancy created by such death, disability, resignation or
removal, provided that the Investor remains eligible to designate
an Investor Nominee and that the replacement Investor Nominee is
acceptable to the Parent, acting reasonably, and is an individual
eligible to serve as a director pursuant to applicable
Law.
(g)     Each Investor
Nominee shall be compensated for his or her service and reimbursed
for expenses related to such service consistent with the Parent's
policies for director compensation and reimbursement; provided that
an Investor Nominee that is a full-time employee of the Investors
are not entitled to such compensation but are entitled to such
expense reimbursement.
(h)     The Parent shall
indemnify an Investor Nominee and provide the Investor Nominee with
director and officer insurance to the same extent it indemnifies
and provides insurance for the members of the Board of Directors
pursuant to its organizational documents, applicable Law or
otherwise.

Board of Directors to appoint one or both of the Investor Nominees,
if applicable, to each such committee to ensure that the Investors

criteria for such committee, including any requirements under
applicable Laws, as determined by the Board of
Directors.

(a)     Subject to Section
2.4, the Investors shall be entitled collectively to designate one

Directors, committee meetings of the Board of Directors and any
executive sessions, as a non-voting observer. The Board Observer

in which (A) the subject matter relates to a transaction,
proceeding or matter in which the Investors or their Affiliates or
investee entities (other than the Parent) are or may be interested
parties, and where the participation in such portion of any such
meeting by the Board Observer or access to Confidential Information
relating to the Parent would, upon the advice of counsel, give rise
to a conflict of interest between the Investors and the Parent, as
determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, (B)
the Board of Directors determines, upon the advice of counsel, that
such exclusion is reasonably necessary to preserve solicitor-client
privilege or (C) the Board of Directors determines, upon the advice
of counsel, that such exclusion is reasonably necessary for the
Parent or its subsidiaries to comply with their respective
confidentiality obligations.

Observer of a bona fide claim or possible claim for a breach or
threatened breach by the Board Observer of the Observer Agreement,
the Parent shall not be required to comply with Section 2.3(b)
unless and until such claim is abandoned or resolved substantially
in the Board Observer's favour.

being provided with any materials provided to the Board of
Directors.

be entitled to designate one alternate Board Observer, who shall be
acceptable to the Parent, acting reasonably, to attend meetings of
the Board of Directors, committee meetings of the Board of
Directors and any executive session, in the place of the Board
Observer, provided that (i) the Investors provide written notice of
the identity of such alternate Board Observer to the Board of
Directors as soon as practicable prior to the meeting at which such
alternate Board Observer will attend, and (ii) such alternate Board
Observer shall have executed an Observer Agreement before being
permitted to attend any meetings of the Board of Directors and/or
being provided with any materials provided to the Board of
Directors. For greater certainty, the Parent shall not be required
to comply with the timing requirements of Section 2.3(b)
.
(g)     The Parent shall not
be required to (i) pay any compensation to the Board Observer or
any alternate Board Observer or (ii) provide any indemnification,
or maintain coverage under any policies of directors' and officers'
insurance, in favour of the Board Observer or any alternate Board
Observer; provided, however, that the Parent shall reimburse any
reasonable costs or expenses incurred by the Board Observer or any
alternate Board Observer in connection with his or her attendance
at meetings of the Board of Directors, committee meetings of the
Board of Directors or any executive sessions.

Participation
Right



(a)     Subject to Section
4.2, the Parent agrees that if the Parent issues for cash
consideration any Common Shares or other securities that are
convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares (such securities
other than Common Shares, collectively, " Subject Securities
"), other than pursuant to an Exempt Issuance (any such issuance, a
" Subsequent Offering "), then the Parent shall, promptly
following the announcement of such Subsequent Offering, provide a
written notice (the " Subsequent Offering Notice ") to the

exercise of the Participation Right by the Investors will take
place on the date set out in the Subsequent Offering Notice. If the
closing of the exercise of the Participation Right has not been
completed by the end of the applicable period (or such earlier or
later date as the parties may agree), provided that the Parent has
used its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all required
regulatory and other approvals, then the Exercise Notice will be
deemed to have been irrevocably withdrawn and the Parent will have
no obligation to issue any Common Shares or Subject Securities, as
applicable, pursuant to such exercise of the Participation
Right.

Registration shall be selected by the Investors and shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Parent.

statement filed pursuant to a Demand Registration any securities of
the Parent to be sold by the Parent for its own account unless the
underwriters advise the Parent that the aggregate amount of
securities requested to be included in such offering is
sufficiently large to have a material adverse effect on the
distribution or sales price of the Registrable Shares in such
offering in which case the Parent will include in such Demand
Registration, to the extent of the amount that the underwriter
believes may be sold without causing such material adverse effect,
first the Registrable Shares requested to be included by the

account.

Parent within three Business Days after the receipt of the
Piggyback Notice, to request that the Parent cause any or all of
the Registrable Shares held by the Investors to be included in such
prospectus or registration statement (such qualification being
hereinafter referred to as a " Piggyback Registration ").
The Investors shall specify in the Piggyback Request the number of
Registrable Shares which the Investors intend to offer and sell and

Shares in (i) any such distribution by the Parent for its own
account if the Parent is advised by its lead underwriter or
underwriters that the inclusion of all such Registrable Shares and
securities of any other securityholder may have a material adverse
effect on the distribution or sales price of the securities being
offered by the Parent, in which case, the number of Registrable
Shares and the securities of the other securityholder to be
included in such registration statement or prospectus shall each be
reduced, as necessary, on a pro rata basis, or (ii) any such
distribution by any other securityholders, if the other
securityholders are advised by their lead underwriter or
underwriters that the inclusion of all such Registrable Shares may
have a material adverse effect on the distribution or sales price
of the securities being offered by such other securityholders, in
which case, the number of Registrable Shares and securities of any
other securityholders shall be reduced, as necessary, on a pro
rata basis.
(c)     The Parent may, at
any time prior to the issuance of a receipt for a final prospectus
or the effectiveness of any registration statement in connection
with a Piggyback Registration, at its sole discretion and without
the consent of the Investors, withdraw such prospectus and
registration statement, as applicable, and abandon the proposed
distribution in which the Investors have requested to participate
pursuant to the Piggyback Request.

fees and disbursements of counsel to any underwriter, investment
bank, manager or agent are not assumed by such underwriter,

Registration
Procedures



The

and Piggyback Registration, as applicable.



5.7


Indemnification



(a)     By the
Parent. Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the
maximum extent permitted by law, each holder of Registrable Shares,
such holder's officers and directors, employees, agents and
representatives, and each Person who controls such holder (within
the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act) (collectively, the "
Investor Indemnified Parties ") against all losses (other
than loss of profit in connection with the distribution of the
Registrable Shares), claims, actions, damages, liabilities and
expenses (including with respect to actions or proceedings, whether
commenced or threatened, and including reasonable attorney fees and
expenses) caused by, resulting from, arising out of, based upon or
related to any of the following statements, omissions or violations
by the Parent: (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus
or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, in respect of a Demand Registration or Piggyback
Registration, or any omission or alleged omission of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading; or (ii) any violation or alleged
violation by the Parent of the Securities Laws or any rule or
regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to the Parent and
relating to action or inaction required of the Parent in connection
with any such registration, qualification or compliance. In
addition, the Parent will reimburse such Investor Indemnified Party
for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in
connection with investigating or defending any such losses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent shall not be liable in
any such case to the extent that any such losses result from, arise
out of, are based upon, or relate to an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission, made in such
registration statement, any such prospectus, preliminary prospectus
or any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any application, in
reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information prepared
and furnished in writing to the Parent by such Investor Indemnified
Party expressly for use therein or by such Investor Indemnified
Party's failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement or
prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto after the
Parent has furnished such Investor Indemnified Party with a
sufficient number of copies of the same.


- 22 -
(b)     By the
Investors . In connection with any registration statement or
prospectus in which an Investor is participating, each such
Investor shall furnish to the Parent in writing such information as
the Parent reasonably requests for use in connection with any such
registration statement or prospectus. Each Investor agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, the Parent, its directors and officers, employees, agents and
representatives and each Person who controls the Parent (within the
meaning of the U.S. Securities Act) (collectively, the " Parent
Indemnified Parties ") against all losses (other than loss of
profit in connection with the distribution of the Registrable
Shares), claims, actions, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including with respect to actions or proceedings, whether
commenced or threatened, and including reasonable attorney fees and
expenses) caused by, resulting from, arising out of, based upon or
related to any of the following statements, omissions or violations
by the Investors: (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus
or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue
statement or omission is contained in any information furnished in
writing by such Investor; or (ii) any violation or alleged
violation by the Investor of the Securities Laws or any rule or
regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to the Investor and
relating to action or inaction required of the Investor in
connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance.
In addition, the Investors will reimburse such Parent Indemnified
Party for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by
them in connection with investigating or defending any such losses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of the Investors to
indemnify shall be individual, not joint and several, for each
Investor and shall be limited to the net amount of proceeds
received by such Investor from the sale of Registrable Shares
pursuant to such registration statement.
(c)     Claim
Procedure . Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder
shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of
any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided
that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any
Person's right to indemnification hereunder only to the extent such
failure has not prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless
in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may
exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to
assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed,
the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for
any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent
(but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or
elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated
to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all
parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such
claim, unless in the opinion of outside counsel to any indemnified
party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified
party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to
such claim. In such instance, the conflicted indemnified parties
shall have a right to retain one separate counsel, chosen by the
holders of a majority of the Registrable Shares included in the
registration if such holders are indemnified parties, at the
expense of the indemnifying party.
(d)     Non-exclusive
Remedy; Survival . The indemnification and contribution
provided for under this Agreement shall be in addition to any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any indemnified
party may have pursuant to law or contract and shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or
controlling Person of such indemnified party and shall survive the
transfer of Registrable Shares and the termination or expiration of
this Agreement.


- 23 -
(e)     Contribution
. The Parent and the Investors also agree to make such provisions,
as are reasonably requested by any indemnified party, for
contribution to such party in the event the Parent's or the
Investors', as applicable, indemnification is unavailable for any
reason. Such provisions shall provide that the liability amongst
the various Persons shall be allocated in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such Persons in
connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in
losses (the relative fault being determined by reference to, among
other things, which Person supplied the information giving rise to
the untrue statement or omission and each Person's relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such untrue statement or omission) and, only if such
allocation is not respected at law, would other equitable
considerations, such as the relative benefit received by each
Person from the sale of the securities, be taken into
consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Investor shall
be required to contribute any amount in excess of the proceeds
received by such Investor in the transaction at issue and (ii) no
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the U.S. Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.
(f)      Release . No
indemnifying party shall, except with the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term
thereof giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified
party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation.



5.8


Expiry of Registration
Rights



The
Demand Registration rights and Piggyback Registration rights
granted to the Investors pursuant to this Article 5 shall terminate
and be of no further force or effect on the first day following the
date on which the As-Exchanged Ownership of the Investors is less
than 5%.



5.9


Grant of Registration
Rights to Others



The
Parent covenants and agrees that, so long as the Demand
Registration rights and Piggyback Registration rights granted to
the Investors pursuant to this Article 5 have not expired, the
Parent will not grant to any Person rights of registration that are
on terms and conditions, taken as a whole, more favourable than the
Demand Registration rights and Piggyback Registration rights
granted to the Investors pursuant to this Article 5, taken as a
whole, unless the Parent offers such rights of registration to the
Investors.
ARTICLE 6 
COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES



6.1


Shareholder
Meeting



(a)     The Investors may
request in writing (a " Shareholder Meeting Request ") that
the Parent use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain approval
by the shareholders of the Parent of a resolution to remove the
Beneficial Ownership Exchange Cap and the Voting Cap (as defined in
the Voting Trust Agreement) and to waive the application of the
Shareholder Rights Plan to the acquisition by the Investors of
beneficial ownership of the Special Voting Shares and those Common
Shares which are issuable or deliverable to the Investors upon
exchange of the Preferred Shares (collectively, the "
Shareholder Approval ").


- 24 -
(b)     If a Shareholder
Meeting Request is received by the Parent prior to January 31 in
any year, the Parent will propose, and use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the Shareholder Approval at the Parent's next
regularly scheduled annual general meeting of shareholders
following such request, to be held no later than June 30 of such
year. If a Shareholder Meeting Request is received after January 31
in any year, the Parent will propose, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Shareholder Approval at the first
shareholders' meeting following such next regularly scheduled
annual general meeting of shareholders.
(c)     The Board of
Directors shall recommend that the shareholders of the Parent
provide the Shareholder Approval at the Parent's next regularly
scheduled annual general meeting (if a Shareholder Meeting Request
is obtained by January 31, 2017) and, subject to the directors'
fiduciary duties, at each subsequent shareholders' meeting at which
the Shareholder Approval is sought.



6.2


Earnings
Release



The
Parent shall, in connection with its earnings release for the
quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 (the " Earning
Release "), cooperate with the Investors and otherwise use
commercially reasonable efforts to include in such Earnings Release
any material, non-public information provided to the Investors
prior to the date hereof in connection with the transaction
contemplated under the Transaction Agreements that was not
previously publicly disclosed by the Parent.



6.3


Excluded
Matters



During
the Standstill Period, each Investor covenants and agrees with the
Parent that it shall not exercise any voting rights attached to
Common Shares beneficially owned or controlled by the Investors and
its Affiliates in connection with any proposal submitted to the
shareholders of the Parent in respect of any amendment, waiver,
renewal or replacement of the Parent's Shareholder Rights Plan. At
no time shall the Investors exercise any voting rights attached to
Common Shares beneficially owned or controlled by the Investors and
its Affiliates to obtain any Shareholder Approval.



6.4


Regulatory
Approval



The
Parent and the Investors agree that, at the request of the other
party, from time to time, they shall cooperate with and assist each
other to determine whether a Regulatory Approval is applicable or
would be required in connection with the exercise of voting rights
pursuant to the Special Voting Shares or the exercise of
Beneficiary Votes (as defined in the Voting Trust Agreement) by the
Investors and their Affiliates pursuant to the Voting Trust
Agreement, and whether the exercise of such voting rights must be
limited in accordance with the terms of the Voting Trust Agreement
pending receipt of such Regulatory Approval, including in each case
cooperation from the Parent and the Investors in providing each
other with such financial and other information as is required to
assess whether the size of the transaction, size of the parties or
other thresholds applicable to the determination of whether a
Regulatory Approval is required are attained. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is agreed by the parties that the Investors and their
Affiliates shall not be required to apply for a Regulatory Approval
in connection with the exercise of Beneficiary Votes if such
Beneficiary Votes are limited to the Regulatory Voting Cap (as
defined in the Voting Trust Agreement).

Investors own Registrable Shares, the Parent, at all times while it

extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace
period) all reports required to be filed by the Parent pursuant to
Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act.



6.9


Confidentiality



(a)     The Investors will,
and will cause their Representatives to, keep confidential and will
treat confidentially all Confidential Information. Each of the
Investors agrees that it will, and will cause their Representatives
to, not disclose or use, for itself or for the benefit of any other
Person, any Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, during the Standstill Period the Investors shall be
permitted to disclose Confidential Information to their
Representatives for the purpose of allowing the Investors to
provide advice and assistance to the Parent and its subsidiaries in
respect of the operations of the Parent and its subsidiaries and
for no other purpose.
(b)     As a condition to
the furnishing of Confidential Information to a Representative of
the Investors, the Investors shall advise such Representative of
the confidential nature of the information disclosed and ensure
that the Representative is bound by an obligation of
confidentiality sufficient to ensure compliance with the terms of
this Agreement. The Investors agree that they will be fully
responsible for any breach or non-compliance of any of the
provisions of this Agreement by their Representatives
.
In addition, the Investors will take
all commercially reasonable steps including the obtaining of
suitable undertakings, to ensure that Confidential Information is
not disclosed to any other Person or used in a manner contrary to
this Agreement, and promptly notify the Parent of any unauthorized
disclosure of Confidential Information or breach of this
Agreement.


- 28 -
(c)     The Investors hereby
acknowledge that Securities Laws impose restrictions on their
ability to purchase, sell, trade or otherwise transfer securities
of the Parent until such time as material, non-public information
received by the Investors becomes publicly available or is no
longer material and the Investors further hereby agree to comply
with all such restrictions and to inform those of its
Representatives provided with any Confidential Information of such
restrictions.
(d)     The term
Confidential Information shall exclude: (i) any information that
was generally available to the public prior to the date hereof, and
(ii) any information that becomes generally available to the public
(through no violation hereof by the Investors, their
Representatives or by any other Person of its obligations to keep
confidential any Confidential Information); provided that a
combination of information shall not be considered public merely
because individual elements thereof are in the public domain,
unless the actual combination of all the elements is in the public
domain.
(e)     Nothing in this
Section 6.8 is to be construed as granting the Investors any title,
ownership, license or other right of interest with respect to the
Confidential Information. The Parent retains all right, title and
interest in and to the Confidential Information.
(f)     If the Investors are
requested or required to disclose any Confidential Information in
connection with any legal or administrative proceeding or
investigation, or are required by Law to disclose any Confidential
Information, the Investors will provide the Parent with prompt
written notice of any such request or requirement, unless
prohibited by Law, so that the Parent has an opportunity to seek a
protective Order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance
with the provisions of this Section 6.8. If timely notice cannot be
given, the Investors agree to make reasonable efforts to seek a
protective Order or confidential treatment from the applicable
Governmental Entity for such information. If the Parent waives
compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.8 with respect to
a specific request or requirement, the Investors shall disclose
only that portion of the Confidential Information that is covered
by such waiver and which is necessary to disclose in order to
comply with such request or requirement. If (in the absence of a
waiver by the Parent) the Parent has not secured a protective Order
or other appropriate remedy, and the Investors are nonetheless then
legally compelled to disclose any Confidential Information, the
Investors may, without liability hereunder, disclose only that
portion of the Confidential Information that is necessary to be
disclosed.
(g)     At any time upon
written request by the Parent, the Investors shall, and shall cause
their Representatives to, promptly return to the Parent or promptly
destroy all Confidential Information (including, electronic copies)
supplied by the Parent to the Investors and their Representatives,
without retaining any copy thereof, other than pursuant to standard
back-up and emergency recovery procedures, and the Investors shall
promptly destroy all Confidential Information prepared by or on
behalf of the Investors or their Representatives, together with
copies thereof (including, without limitation, electronic copies),
except that the Investors shall be entitled to retain copies of the
Confidential Information as necessary to comply with applicable Law
or with standard back-up or emergency recovery
procedures.


- 29 -
(h)     Notwithstanding the
return or destruction of the Confidential Information as
contemplated hereby or the termination of this Agreement, the
Investors will continue to be bound by the terms of this Section
6.8 with respect thereto, including all obligations of
confidentiality.

Assignment



(a)     No party may assign
any of its rights or benefits under this Agreement, or delegate any

of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Investor
may assign and transfer all of its rights, benefits, duties and
obligations under this Agreement in their entirety, without the
consent of the Parent, to an Affiliate of the Investor, provided
that (a) any such assignee shall, prior to any such transfer, agree
to be bound by all of the covenants of the Investor contained
herein and comply with the provisions of this Agreement, and shall
deliver to the Parent a duly executed undertaking to such effect in
form and substance satisfactory to the Parent, acting reasonably,
and (b) where any rights of the Investors under this Agreement have
been assigned, such rights shall only be exercised on behalf of all
assignees and the Investors as provided for herein. For greater
certainty, no assignment by an Investor or any assignee (each, an "
Assignee ") of its rights hereunder shall relieve such
Assignee of its obligations hereunder.
(b)     The rights of the

Oaktree Acquires Additional Securities of SunOpta in Q2 2017 | Business Wire


























































Oaktree Acquires Additional Securities of SunOpta in Q2 2017






June 21, 2017 04:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ("Oaktree"), a leading 
      global alternative investment management firm, announced today that 
      funds managed by Oaktree (the "Investors") have increased 
      their beneficial ownership in common shares (the "Common Shares") 
      of SunOpta Inc. ("SunOpta") during the second quarter of 
      2017.
    

      On May 12, 2017, the Investors acquired 1,392,699 Common Shares in the 
      aggregate through the facilities of the NASDAQ exchange, at a price of 
      US$8.00 per share.
    

      Following such acquisition, the Investors now beneficially own an 
      aggregate of: (i) 4,392,699 Common Shares that they acquired through the 
      facilities of the NASDAQ exchange; and (ii) 85,000 Series A preferred 
      shares (the "Preferred Shares") of SunOpta Foods, Inc., a 
      subsidiary of SunOpta, which were acquired in connection with the 
      previously announced private placement transaction completed on October 
      7, 2016 (the "Private Placement").
    

      The Preferred Shares are currently exchangeable into 11,333,333 Common 
      Shares, representing approximately 11.64% of the outstanding Common 
      Shares on a partially diluted basis (excluding all other securities 
      convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares). Taken together with the 
      4,392,699 Common Shares acquired through the facilities of the NASDAQ 
      exchange, the Investors beneficially own an aggregate of 15,726,032 
      Common Shares on an as-exchanged basis, representing approximately 
      16.16% of the outstanding Common Shares on a partially diluted basis 
      (excluding all other securities convertible or exchangeable into Common 
      Shares).
    

      The Investors acquired the Common Shares and the Preferred Shares for 
      investment purposes, and the Investors intend to continuously 
      evaluate the businesses and prospects of SunOpta and its subsidiaries, 
      alternative investment opportunities and all other factors deemed 
      relevant in determining whether additional securities of SunOpta will be 
      acquired by the Investors or by other accounts or funds associated with 
      the Investors, or whether the Investors or any such other accounts or 
      funds will dispose of the Preferred Shares or Common Shares. At any 
      time, subject to the limitations set forth in the definitive agreements 
      entered into in connection with the Private Placement, additional 
      securities of SunOpta or its subsidiaries may be acquired or some or all 
      of the securities beneficially owned by the Investors may be sold, in 
      either case in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or 
      otherwise, including, without limitation, by electing to exchange 
      Preferred Shares into Common Shares, or by increasing or decreasing 
      holdings in Preferred Shares or in Common Shares.
    

      An early warning report with additional information in respect of the 
      foregoing matters has been filed and made available on the System for 
      Electronic Document Analysis and Review (SEDAR) at www.sedar.com 
      under SunOpta's issuer profile. The Investors are Oaktree Organics, L.P. 
      and Oaktree Huntington Investment Fund II, L.P. In order to obtain a 
      copy of the early warning report, you may also contact Alyssa Linn of

Forward-Looking Information

      implied by the forward-looking statements. Such statements are qualified

      obligation, and expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to 
      update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of 
      new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by 
      applicable law.

 Oaktree Acquires Additional Securities of SunOpta in Q2 2017 
 Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ("Oaktree"), a leading global alternative investment management firm, announced today that funds managed by Oaktree (the "Investors") have increased their beneficial ownership in common shares (the "Common Shares") of SunOpta Inc. ("SunOpta") during the second quarter of 2017. 






 On May 12, 2017, the Investors acquired 1,392,699 Common Shares in the aggregate through the facilities of the NASDAQ exchange, at a price of US$8.00 per share. 
 Following such acquisition, the Investors now beneficially own an aggregate of: (i) 4,392,699 Common Shares that they acquired through the facilities of the NASDAQ exchange; and (ii) 85,000 Series A preferred shares (the "Preferred Shares") of SunOpta Foods, Inc., a subsidiary of SunOpta, which were acquired in connection with the previously announced private placement transaction completed on October 7, 2016 (the "Private Placement"). 
 The Preferred Shares are currently exchangeable into 11,333,333 Common Shares, representing approximately 11.64% of the outstanding Common Shares on a partially diluted basis (excluding all other securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares). Taken together with the 4,392,699 Common Shares acquired through the facilities of the NASDAQ exchange, the Investors beneficially own an aggregate of 15,726,032 Common Shares on an as-exchanged basis, representing approximately 16.16% of the outstanding Common Shares on a partially diluted basis (excluding all other securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares). 
 The Investors acquired the Common Shares and the Preferred Shares for investment purposes, and the Investors intend to continuously evaluate the businesses and prospects of SunOpta and its subsidiaries, alternative investment opportunities and all other factors deemed relevant in determining whether additional securities of SunOpta will be acquired by the Investors or by other accounts or funds associated with the Investors, or whether the Investors or any such other accounts or funds will dispose of the Preferred Shares or Common Shares. At any time, subject to the limitations set forth in the definitive agreements entered into in connection with the Private Placement, additional securities of SunOpta or its subsidiaries may be acquired or some or all of the securities beneficially owned by the Investors may be sold, in either case in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including, without limitation, by electing to exchange Preferred Shares into Common Shares, or by increasing or decreasing holdings in Preferred Shares or in Common Shares. 
 An early warning report with additional information in respect of the foregoing matters has been filed and made available on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Review (SEDAR) at www.sedar.com under SunOpta's issuer profile. The Investors are Oaktree Organics, L.P. and Oaktree Huntington Investment Fund II, L.P.

Oaktree Announces Investment in SunOpta | Business Wire


























































Oaktree Announces Investment in SunOpta






October 11, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ("Oaktree"), a leading 
      global alternative investment management firm, announced today that, on 
      October 7, 2016, funds managed by Oaktree (the "Investors") 
      invested US$85 million in SunOpta Foods, Inc. ("SunOpta Foods"), 
      a subsidiary of SunOpta Inc. ("SunOpta"), a leading global 
      company focused on organic, non-genetically modified and specialty foods.
    

      The private placement (the "Private Placement") was 
      completed in connection with SunOpta's previously announced review of 
      strategic alternatives. The net proceeds from the Private Placement have 
      been used by SunOpta to reduce its second lien debt. The Investors 
      intend to work with SunOpta to assist in the development and execution 
      of a long-term strategic and operational plan which is expected to 
      benefit all SunOpta stakeholders. The Investors are active in the 
      consumer and retail industry, with a track record of driving growth in 
      complex consumer businesses, including AdvancePierre Foods, Campofrio 
      Food Group and Diamond Foods.
    

      The Investors purchased US$85 million of newly created Series A 
      preferred shares of SunOpta Foods (the "Preferred Shares") 
      that are exchangeable into common shares of SunOpta at an initial 
      exchange price of US$7.50, subject to adjustments. The Preferred Shares 
      entitle the holder to a cumulative dividend of 8% per year that may be 
      paid-in-kind or in cash at SunOpta's option. The cumulative dividend 
      will increase from 8% per year to 12.5% beginning in October 2025.
    

      Concurrently with the issuance of the Preferred Shares, SunOpta created 
      and issued to an affiliate of the Investors, as trustee for the benefit 
      of the Investors, a series of special shares designated as Special 
      Shares, Series 1 (the "Special Voting Shares"). The Special 
      Voting Shares entitle the Investors to vote on an as-exchanged basis 
      together with the holders of common shares, as a single class, on the 
      basis of one vote per common share issuable upon exchange of the 
      Preferred Shares, subject to certain exceptions and limitations.
    

      Prior to the Private Placement, the Investors did not own any securities 
      in SunOpta. The Preferred Shares that the Investors acquired in 
      connection with the Private Placement are exchangeable into 
      approximately 11.7% of the issued and outstanding common shares of 
      SunOpta on a partially diluted basis.
    

      The Investors acquired the Preferred Shares for investment purposes and 
      the purposes set out below. The Investors continuously evaluate the 
      businesses and prospects of SunOpta and its subsidiaries, alternative 
      investment opportunities and all other factors deemed relevant in 
      determining whether additional securities of SunOpta will be acquired by 
      the Investors or by other accounts or funds associated with the 
      Investors or whether the Investors or any such other accounts or funds 
      will dispose of Preferred Shares or common shares. At any time, subject 
      to the limitations set forth in the definitive agreements entered into 
      in connection with the Private Placement, additional securities of 
      SunOpta or its subsidiaries may be acquired or some or all of the 
      securities beneficially owned by the Investors may be sold, in either 
      case in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or 
      otherwise, including, without limitation, by electing to exchange 
      Preferred Shares into common shares, or by increasing or decreasing 
      holdings in Preferred Shares or in common shares.
    

      Pursuant to the investor rights agreement entered into between SunOpta, 
      SunOpta Foods and the Investors in connection with the Private Placement 
      (the "Investor Rights Agreement"), the Investors have agreed 
      not to dispose of their Preferred Shares or common shares issuable upon 
      exchange of their Preferred Shares until April 7, 2018 and have agreed 
      not to purchase additional common shares of SunOpta, in each case 
      without the consent of SunOpta and subject to certain exceptions set 
      forth in the Investor Rights Agreement. Such exceptions include the 
      ability of the Investors to purchase up to 3,000,000 common shares of 
      SunOpta on the market or in private transactions within 12 months of the 
      closing date of the Private Placement without the prior written consent 
      of SunOpta.
    

      Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, the Investors are entitled to 
      designate two nominees for election to SunOpta's board of directors for 
      so long as the Investors beneficially own or control at least 11.1% of 
      the common shares, on an as-exchanged basis. If the Investors 
      beneficially own or control less than 11.1% but more than 5% of the 
      common shares, on an as-exchanged basis, they shall be entitled to 
      designate one nominee.
    

      This summary description of definitive agreements entered into in 
      connection with the Private Placement does not purport to be complete 
      and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of 
      such agreements to be filed by SunOpta on the System for Electronic 
      Document Analysis and Review (SEDAR) at www.sedar.com.
    

      This news release is being issued pursuant to the early warning 
      reporting provisions of applicable Canadian securities laws. An early 
      warning report with additional information in respect of the foregoing 
      matters will be filed and made available on the System for Electronic 
      Document Analysis and Review (SEDAR) at www.sedar.com 
      under SunOpta's issuer profile. The Investors are Oaktree Organics, L.P. 
      and Oaktree Huntington Investment Fund II, L.P. In order to obtain a 
      copy of the early warning report, you may also contact Alyssa Linn of 
      Sard Verbinnen & Co on behalf of Oaktree, at telephone number:

      Angeles, CA 90071. SunOpta's address is 2233 Argentia Road, Suite 401,

Mutual funds can help lower investing risks
Take some of the anxiety out of investing by letting a mutual fund do a little of the work for you.

Browse Vanguard funds by asset class


Give your money a chance to grow



Investing in mutual funds offers benefits you won't get from trading individual stocks and bonds on your own.




Less risk through more diversification
One mutual fund can invest in hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual securities at once. So if any one security does poorly, the others are there to help offset that risk.
 




Lower costs
With a no-load mutual fund, you pay one (hopefully low) expense ratio—instead of racking up the commissions you'd pay when buying and selling individual securities yourself.
See how low-cost, no-load mutual funds are just the start 

Get details on fees & minimums for Vanguard mutual funds 

 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every security your mutual fund owns. The fund is managed by experts who take care of that for you.
 




Convenience
You can buy and sell mutual fund shares online or by phone and set up automatic investments and withdrawals.
 

Consider your mutual fund options








Choosing which Vanguard mutual funds to invest in can be as simple as picking one fund to do the work of an entire portfolio or as customized as building your portfolio from a variety of fund options.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.
See a complete list of Vanguard index funds 

 




We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

Low-cost investing for everyone



Our passion for low costs will always be our driving force. When others take notice, expense ratios fall more broadly. Everyone wins!

How would index funds fit into your portfolio?



Because of their low costs, broader diversification, and tax efficiency, index funds could be appropriate for any portion of your portfolio. In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through a broker like Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (you may incur commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares aren't redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Like stocks, ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you'll pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
