About Us











Who We Are
NorthStar Real Estate Income II, Inc.
NorthStar Real Estate Income II, Inc. (NorthStar Income II) is a public, non-traded real estate investment trust (REIT) formed to originate, acquire and asset manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate debt, equity and securities investments. The portfolio will be diversified across a variety of underlying commercial property types and geographic locations.
 
NorthStar Securities, LLC
NorthStar Securities, LLC is the broker-dealer affiliate of Colony NorthStar, Inc. (NYSE: CLNS) and the dealer-manager for NorthStar Income II’s public offering. NorthStar Securities, LLC is dedicated to providing financial advisors and their clients with tools to make informed investment decisions.
 
*NorthStar Income II may be a solution for investors with these objectives who have a longer-term investment horizon. 1) There is no guarantee of distributions. Distributions have been paid and may continue to be paid from sources other than cash flow from operations, such as offering proceeds, borrowings or sales of assets and distributions may exceed earnings. We have paid distributions in excess of our cash flow provided by operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we declared distributions of $19,371,000 compared to cash flow provided by operations of $16,917,000. The remaining $2,454,000, or 12.7%, was paid using offering proceeds, including the purchase of additional shares by our sponsor, which reduces the amount we can invest in income-producing assets and your overall return may be reduced. Distributions have also exceeded our net income of $10,467,000 for the same period. Fees paid to the advisor were not determined on an arm’s length basis and reduce the amount the program can invest in income-producing assets and your overall return may be reduced. 2) Diversification does not eliminate risk and does not assure better performance.

         10-K: NORTHSTAR REAL ESTATE INCOME II, INC.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and risk factors in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this report. References to "we,'' "us,'' or "our'' refer to NorthStar Real Estate Income II, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. Introduction We were formed to originate, acquire and asset manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate, or CRE, debt, equity and securities investments predominantly in the United States. CRE debt investments include first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests. Real estate equity investments include direct ownership in properties, which may be structurally senior to a third-party partner's equity, as well as indirect interests in real estate through real estate private equity funds, or PE Investments. CRE securities primarily consist of commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, and may include unsecured real estate investment trust, or REIT, debt, collateralized debt obligation, or CDO, notes and other securities. We may also invest internationally. In addition, we own investments through joint ventures. We were formed in December 2012 as a Maryland corporation and commenced operations in September 2013. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We conduct our operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are externally managed and have no employees. Prior to January 11, 2017, we were managed by an affiliate of NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. , or NSAM. Effective January 10, 2017, NSAM completed its previously announced merger with Colony Capital, Inc. or Colony, NorthStar Realty Finance Corp., or NorthStar Realty, and Colony NorthStar, Inc., or Colony NorthStar, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NSAM, which we refer to as the mergers, with Colony NorthStar surviving the mergers and succeeding NSAM as our Sponsor. As a result of the mergers, our Sponsor became an internally-managed equity REIT, with a diversified real estate and investment management platform and publicly-traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "CLNS". In addition, following the mergers, NSAM J-NSII Ltd, an affiliate of NSAM, or our Advisor, became a subsidiary of Colony NorthStar. Our Advisor manages our day-to-day operations pursuant to an advisory agreement. The mergers had no material impact on our operations. Our Sponsor and its affiliates also provide asset management and other services to NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    NRE, +0.00%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         other sponsored public retail-focused companies, private funds and any other companies our Sponsor and its affiliates may manage in the future, or collectively, the Managed Companies, both in the United States and internationally. As of February 28, 2017, our Sponsor had an aggregate of $56.0 billion of assets under management, adjusted for commitments to acquire or sell certain investments by our Sponsor and the Managed Companies. Previously, we were managed by an affiliate of NorthStar Realty until June 30, 2014 when it spun-off its asset management business into NSAM. Concurrent with the spin-off, our Advisor agreed to manage our day-to-day operations on terms substantially similar to those set forth in our prior advisory agreement with NS Real Estate Income Advisor II, LLC, or our Prior Advisor. References to our Prior Advisor herein refer to the services performed by and fees paid and accrued to our Prior Advisor during the period prior to June 30, 2014. The spin-off of NorthStar Realty's asset management business had no material impact on our operations. Our primary investment types are as follows: Commercial Real Estate Debt - Our CRE debt investments include first mortgage loans, subordinate interests and mezzanine loans and participations in such loans, as well as preferred equity interests.   Commercial Real Estate Equity - Our CRE equity investments include direct and indirect ownership in real estate and real estate assets that may be structurally senior to a third-party partner's equity and indirect interests in real estate through PE Investments since the underlying collateral in the funds is primarily real estate.   Commercial Real Estate Securities - Our CRE securities investments include CMBS and may include unsecured REIT debt, CDO notes and other securities.  We believe that our targeted investment types are complementary to each other due to their overlapping sources of investment opportunities, common reliance on real estate fundamentals and application of similar portfolio management and servicing skills to maximize value and to protect shareholder capital. We believe our Advisor's platform and experience provide us the flexibility to invest across the real estate capital structure.  Table of Contents  Offering and our DRP are herein collectively referred to as our Offering. In our Offering, our shares of common stock were offered in any combination of the two classes of shares of our common stock: Class A shares and Class T shares. NorthStar Securities, LLC, or our Dealer Manager, formerly a subsidiary of NorthStar Realty that became a subsidiary of NSAM upon completion of the spin-off and a subsidiary of our Sponsor upon completion of the mergers, was responsible for marketing the shares that were offered pursuant to our Primary Offering.  Table of Contents  in 2016, traditional capital sources such as banks and CMBS lenders may lack sufficient lending capacity to absorb the high refinancing demand. As regulatory uncertainty continues to limit CMBS issuance, these developments may provide attractive lending opportunities for new market participants such as alternative investment platforms, REITs and insurance companies. Industry experts estimate a projected total origination volume of approximately $55 billion for 2017, with the shift to non-traditional lenders resulting in higher underwriting standards that may support market stability and a protracted environment of increasing commercial real estate values.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and risk factors in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this report. References to "we,'' "us,'' or "our'' refer to NorthStar Real Estate Income II, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. Introduction We were formed to originate, acquire and asset manage a diversified portfolio of CRE debt, select equity and securities investments predominantly in the United States. CRE debt investments may include first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests. Real estate equity investments may include direct ownership in properties and may be structurally senior to a third-party partner's equity and indirect interests in real estate through PE Investments. CRE securities primarily consist of CMBS and may include unsecured REIT debt, CDO, notes and other securities. We may also invest internationally. In addition, we may own investments through a joint venture. We were formed in December 2012 as a Maryland corporation and commenced operations in September 2013. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We conduct our operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are externally managed and have no employees. Prior to June 30, 2014, we were managed by an affiliate of NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    NRF

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         Effective June 30, 2014, NorthStar Realty spun-off its asset management business into a separate publicly traded company, NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    NSAM

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         our Sponsor. Our Sponsor and its affiliates provide asset management and other services to us, NorthStar Realty, other sponsored public non-traded companies and any other companies our Sponsor and its affiliates may manage in the future, or collectively the NSAM Managed Companies, both in the United States and internationally. Concurrent with the spin-off, affiliates of our Sponsor entered into a new advisory agreement with us and each of the other NSAM Managed Companies. Pursuant to our advisory agreement, NSAM J-NSII Ltd, an affiliate of our Sponsor, or our Advisor, agreed to manage our day-to-day operations on terms substantially similar to those set forth in our prior advisory agreement with NS Real Estate Income Advisor II, LLC, or our Prior Advisor. References to our Prior Advisor herein refer to the services performed by and fees paid and accrued to our Prior Advisor during the period prior to June 30, 2014. The spin-off of NorthStar Realty's asset management business had no impact on our operations. Our primary investment types are as follows: Commercial Real Estate Debt - Our CRE debt investments may include first mortgage loans, subordinate interests and mezzanine loans and participations in such loans, as well as preferred equity interests.   Select Commercial Real Estate Equity - Our CRE equity investments may include direct and indirect ownership in real estate and select real estate assets that may be structurally senior to a third-party partner's equity and indirect interests in real estate through PE Investments since the underlying collateral in the funds is primarily real estate.   Commercial Real Estate Securities - Our CRE securities investments may include CMBS, unsecured REIT debt, CDO notes and other securities.  We may also invest in CRE debt investments and equity investments indirectly through joint ventures.  Table of Contents  Sources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows We primarily generate revenue from net interest income on our CRE debt and securities investments. Our income is primarily derived through the difference between revenue and the cost at which we are able to finance our investments. We may also acquire investments which generate attractive returns without any leverage.  Table of Contents  to manage credit risk across our investments as well as to structure and finance our assets efficiently. We believe that our targeted investment types are complementary to each other due to their overlapping sources of investment opportunities, common reliance on CRE fundamentals and ability to apply similar portfolio management and servicing skills to maximize value and to protect capital. We use the net proceeds from our Offering and other financing sources to carry out our primary business objectives of originating and acquiring real estate-related investments.   From Inception Through March 17, 2015 Number Principal Amount (1) Real estate debt 11 $ 575,063 __________________________________  Critical Accounting Policies  Table of Contents  of the underlying collateral is less than the net carrying value of the loan, a loan loss reserve is recorded with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses. The loan loss reserve for each loan is maintained at a level that is determined to be adequate by management to absorb probable losses. Income recognition is suspended for a loan at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90-days past due or when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful. When the ultimate collectability of the principal of an impaired loan is in doubt, all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. When the ultimate collectability of the principal of an impaired loan is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as interest income when received, under the cash basis method until an accrual is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. A loan is written off when it is no longer realizable and/or legally discharged. As of December 31, 2014, we did not have any impaired CRE debt investments. Real Estate Securities  Table of Contents  Results of Operations   Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2014 2013 (1) Amount Net interest income Interest income $ 11,539 $ 137 $ 11,402 Interest expense 3,231 42 3,189 Net interest income 8,308 95 8,213 Expenses Asset management and other fees - related party 2,601 21 2,580 General and administrative expenses 2,524 62 2,462 Total expenses 5,125 83 5,042 Net income (loss) $ 3,183 $ 12 $ 3,171 __________________________________________________________  On September 18, 2013, we commenced operations and at the same time made our first investment.  Table of Contents  Our charter limits us from incurring borrowings that would exceed 300% of our net assets. We cannot exceed this limit unless any excess in borrowing over such level is approved by a majority of our independent directors. We would need to disclose any such approval to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with the justification for such excess. An approximation of this leverage calculation is 75% of the cost of our investments, including cash. As of December 31, 2014, our leverage as a percentage of our cost of investments was 56%. Once we have fully invested the proceeds of our Offering, we expect that our financing may approximate 50% of the cost of our investments, although it may exceed this level during our organization and offering stage.   Years Ended December 31, Cash flow provided by (used in): 2014 2013 (1) Operating activities $ 2,129 $ (184 ) Investing activities (484,002 ) (16,500 ) Financing activities 516,234 23,761 Net increase (decrease) in cash $ 34,361 $ 7,077 ___________________________________  Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to December 31, 2013 . . .

Consulting service agreements are documents used when an individual or company hires an outside consultant for their expertise. Consultants work in multiple fields including the medical, engineering and human resources fields, and present expert opinions on the current conditions of their client's business.The contracts define the scope of the work the consultant will perform and outline the terms of their payment. These agreements also cover the method of payment and the estimated time for the project. Consulting service agreements may contain clauses that outline terms and conditions regarding the consultation, and will make the parties aware of any repercussions that may arise due to breach of contract.There are several varieties of consulting work, and a contract may contain language specific to a certain type. Contracts may include clauses regarding ownership of the work product, such as reports and case studies. Using a consultant services agreement helps a consultant see what the client expects.
