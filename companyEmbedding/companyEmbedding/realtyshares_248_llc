About RealtyShares
Founded by Nav Athwal, RealtyShares is a crowdfunding website for real estate developments that claims to help you diversify your portfolio and invest in pre-screened and professionally managed residential, commercial, retail, and mixed-use projects. Not only does RealtyShares claim to help you purchase shares in private real estate investments, but the company also claims to help companies access a new source of funding to raise capital for their investments.
How Does RealtyShares Claim To Work?
By now, you’re almost certainly familiar with crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, GoFundMe, and Booster.com, which help people raise money for their business ventures and personal needs. Using these websites, all you have to do is list your project, and if other people are interested in helping you out, they can contribute as much money as they’re comfortable with.
Recently though, a new era of crowdfunding has entered the market with websites like RealtyShares, which claims to serve two primary purposes: 1) to help accredited investors invest in a variety of real estate projects, and 2) help companies fund their real estate projects without having to go through traditional banks or other large lenders.
Since coming online in late 2013, RealtyShares has garnered quite a lot of media attention, having been featured on the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, CNN Money, Business Times, and more, due in no small part to their claimed focus on helping individuals invest in real estate projects from their living rooms, and giving them everything they need to invest intelligently.
In short, RealtyShares acts as a centralized area where companies who need funds for their private real estate projects can meet with investors who are willing to purchase shares in these projects. And according to the company, they give you the ability to make real estate investments in 5 simple steps:

Sign up for a RealtyShares account.
Browse investments securely. If you find one you’re interested in, you’ll then be able to access a detailed page explaining the offering, including “financials, property information, legal and financial documents and investment manager bios.”
Finalize your investment directly through the RealtyShares website. The company even claims all documents can be signed electronically using DocuSign and funds can be transferred via Balanced.
Next, each investment comes with a specific funding goal that must be met before you officially own a share. While you’re waiting for this to occur, your money will be held in an FDIC insured escrow account. And if this goal isn’t reached, then 100% of your money will be refunded.
All RealtyShares members have access to a personalized dashboard where you can monitor your investments and returns and manage your documents. You’ll also receive quarterly updates about the project via email, and tax documents are provided once per year.

You’ve worked diligently over the years to make smart investment decisions, and this new breed of real estate crowdfunding websites has piqued your interest, but you’re wondering if they’re ultimately worth your time, or are just a passing fad. After all, you invest carefully and aren’t in the habit of losing your hard-earned money.
But is RealtyShares a company that you can count on to help you make wise investment decisions? Consider the following:
You Have Options When it Comes to Real Estate Investing
First and foremost, if you’re thinking about using a real estate crowdfunding website, keep in mind that RealtyShares isn’t your only option, as other sites such as Fundrise, Realty Mogul, CrowdStreet, Collaperty, and many more are vying for your business.
With this said, according to RealtyShares’ CEO, the company differentiates itself from other real estate crowdfunding websites by offering lower fees, complete transparency, a seamless investment process, and access to a wider range of investment opportunities.
How Much Risk Are You Willing to Take On?
Next, like any other type of investment, real estate projects come with a certain level of risk, so you’re not guaranteed to make any money. In fact, in a worst-case scenario, you could end up losing your entire investment.
Also, remember that real estate investments are not liquid, which means that your money might be tied up for long periods of time. As such, you’ll need to thoroughly vet any investment you’re thinking about becoming involved with it.
RealtyShares’ Investor Guidelines
If you’re thinking about investing in a real estate project featured on RealtyShares, the most important thing you need to know is that you must be qualified as an Accredited Investor. According to the RealtyShares FAQ, this means you must be “a natural person with (1) a net worth or joint net worth with the person’s spouse exceeding $1 million, not including the value of the primary residence, and / or (2) annual income of $200,000 in each of the two most recent years, or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000 for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income in the current year.”
On top of this, you must have a minimum of $5,000 to contribute to a project, although some investments may go as low as $1,000. There is no maximum investment amount, and you can even qualify as a foreign investor.
RealtyShares’ Investment Options
If you qualify as an investor, you’ll have two options: Debt investment and equity investment.
Debt investment means that your contribution funds a loan for the company who’s responsible for the project, and depending on your level of investment, your portion of the money earned from monthly interest charges will be deposited into your account. On the other hand, an equity investment pays a percentage of cash flow from rent on a monthly basis, or on the profits if the project is sold.
Regardless of the type, each investment will come with its own ‘hold period,” which references the expected amount of time that will pass before investors recoup their money after a project has been paid off or sold. This information will be available on the project’s Investment Overview page, and can last anywhere from less than 6 months to more than 5 years.
RealtyShares’ Company Guidelines
According to the company’s website, RealtyShares only provides loans (e.g. debt investments) for 1-4 unit residential properties, and some commercial properties, such as apartment buildings. Specifically, the website’s FAQ states projects must be:

Cash-flowing/Value-Add equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments, retail, office and pools of single family homes;
Equity investments in Fix & Flips located in high demand/low supply markets;
Loans secured by residential and commercial real estate.

On top of this, borrowers must have a minimum 650 credit score, a loan to purchase price of less than 80%, and an “estimated loan to after repair value (once the property is rehabbed) less than 65%.” As such, the RealtyShares will not work for construction or ground-up development projects.
On top of this, RealtyShares claims to closely screen all new projects prior to being listed, including background and credit checks, comps, projected returns, geography, property type and quality, investment structure, a knowledgeable team, and a proven track record.
Although RealtyShares doesn’t guarantee successful funding, the company claims that most projects listed are funded within 5-7 days. However, for any projects listed on RealtyShares, companies will not be able to advertise them elsewhere in order to remain in compliance with Regulation D Rule 506(b).
Finally, RealtyShares’ funding methods are claimed to help you focus on operating the investment instead of communicating with numerous investors, since all funds are pooled into a single LLC.
The Difference Between RealtyShares & REITs
When compared to REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts), RealtyShares claims to give investors the ability to choose the specific type of property or groups of properties they’d like to invest in, whereas REITs traditionally only allow you to invest in specific asset classes or projects based on geography. In addition, RealtyShares claims to charge substantially lower fees than REITs (we’ll talk more about this in a moment).
What Are Other Investors Saying About RealtyShares?
RealtyShares, Inc. has only been in business since late 2013, and there were no individual reviews available online at the time of our research.
However, most professional reviews from large websites such as Forbes and TechCrunch seem to be favorable, not just for RealtyShares, but for the growth of the real estate crowdfunding industry in general.
RealtyShares Pricing
RealtyShares is free to sign up for an account, whether you’re an individual looking to invest or a company looking for funding. However, according to the company’s FAQ, they “will charge a fee to cover ongoing investor reporting and communications for the investment,” although the specific fee for each investment can vary, and will be outlined in the project’s operating agreement.
After a project has been funded, the money is pooled and moved into an individual LLC, which is the entity that will actually provide the loan or hold equity in the investment. As such, you will be a shareholder in this LLC.
Compared to many other real estate crowdfunding websites, RealtyShares accepts Bitcoin for investments, either through Coinbase or your Bitcoin Address, although distributions will be paid in US Dollars.
In order to ask questions about fees, payments, or anything else, you can contact RealtyShares’ customer service department at 866-202-2023.
Can RealtyShares Help You Wisely Diversify Your Investment Portfolio?
Chopping to the Point: Considering the fact that RealtyShares has received a fair amount of positive media attention, that the real estate crowdfunding industry is in a growth phase, and that there aren’t any negative online reviews for the company, they appear to be a solid choice for purchasing shares in real estate projects.

                                            The e-trade for real estate

Very positive experience. I've always wanted to invest in real estate, but there haven't been many great options. I was able to invest in 10 different investments (with as little as $5,000) and get exposure to diverse markets and product types.
The user experience is simple, and everything is streamlined.


Bottom Line: Yes, I would recommend this to a friend

                                            Duping investors

I invested two years ago in few offerings and so far, everything is in deep red. "Triwest" who sponsored 12954 Blairwood Dr & 12090 Chalon Rd. investment and Paragon who sponsored 1651 Gilbert Road, have stopped making payments. They have given lame excuses for delays. 
They are running a Ponzi scheme to dupe investors and RealtyShares did not do any due diligence before offering this deal and luring investors. Don't get caught in this poor dealings.


Bottom Line: No, I would not recommend this to a friend

TriWest certainly has been a disaster. Fortunately, they managed to sell the property I had investments in and made some money, but nothing like their claimed return. Even though the property sold for more than the original financial estimate.
I agree that RealtyShares does minimal due diligence. What is shocking is you can't get access to the agreement with the sponsor, only the RealtyShares LLC., you are investing in, so the real terms and conditions aren't available.
They are also easy to dupe, they did an investment that claimed it would put no debt on the property and the sponsor secretly went to another website and got another big loan on the property while claiming it was unencumbered. RealtyShares has been almost completely unresponsive to emails about issues but they certainly keep sending out emails about new opportunities.
A strong buyer beware. Not only does RealityShares do little to no due diligence, but they make it impossible for you to do so either. Go ahead and ask if the sponsor has other projects at RealityShares and they won't answer.
I went back to making my own hard money loans so I have access to the property, the borrower and can track things closely.

It seems natural to approach with caution, since most people don't have much experience with this specific concept. My experience has been very positive. RealtyShares has been very professional and responsible. Any real estate project has risks by default, but I have had no issues after making more than 35 investments using the RealtyShares platform. RealtyShares does a great job screening prospective deal sponsors; because of that, projects that might include underfunded developers, crackpots, slackers or sponsors who are challenged with planning and organization get screened out before any deal is offered on the platform. The return/risk equation has seemed promising to me on the vast majority of the deals offered. I would - and have - recommended RealtyShares to good friends.


Bottom Line: Yes, I would recommend this to a friend

RealtyShares makes raising capital for your investment much easier. Submitting your investment
        opportunity, receiving approval, listing and funding can all be completed in a fraction of the time
        required to deal with banks or institutional funding channels.
We’ll present your opportunity to investors across the country; investors for whom we make real estate
        investing easy. We’ll be providing you with access to a broader capital pool made up of investors that
        want to participate in projects like yours. We’ll come to you as a single investor, in a manner that is
        legally compliant. We’ll take over all the investor communications chores for our investor pool, while at
        the same time your corporate brand is being elevated through its access to this much broader group. And
        our experience will give you the comfort you want that the funding process is going to be smooth and
        efficient.
RealtyShares can become your company’s capital-raising partner. Please contact us at raise@realtyshares.com to discuss your particular project.
What kind of real estate investments can be listed on RealtyShares?
RealtyShares lists investment opportunities involving a variety of real estate property types, including
        multi-family residential, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, and hospitality facilities.
        Single-family residences being used for investment purposes (not owner-occupied) are also the subject of
        many investment opportunities. We generally prefer to finance properties in or near a significant
        metropolitan area, but it all depends on the particular situation.
RealtyShares also offers several different types of financing options. We can do secured real estate
        loans (both first- or second-lien positions); equity financing, usually for properties involving in-place
        cash flow that provide an income component to the investment; and/or “preferred equity” investments
        involving a preferential position in the equity capital structure but with only limited potential upside
        (so that sponsors retain most of the appreciation). If there is a specific property or financing type you
        might be interested in, let us know
        here.
What criteria does RealtyShares have for debt financing?
RealtyShares, through its lending subsidiary RS Lending, Inc., provides business-purposes loans (i.e., no
        owner-occupied properties) secured by both conventional residential properties (such as single-family
        residences) as well as commercial properties (e.g., larger apartment buildings, retail centers, office
        buildings, etc.). We can provide both short-term (usually, 36 months or less) 1st-lien and 2nd-lien debt
        financing on residential properties. We can also provide both bridge or permanent debt financing on
        commercial properties.
RealtyShares looks at a number of criteria in underwriting potential loan opportunities. Generally, we
        look for certain minimum loan-to-cost (LTC) or loan-to-after-repair-value (ARV) criteria. We also like to
        understand the operating plan for the project, and we verify borrower credit and background history.
Each of these criteria vary slightly by situation and loan product; please contact us here to discuss your particular project.
How do you keep my personal information secure?
We go to great lengths to ensure the security of all of our members and our data and use Secure Sockets
        Layer. SSL is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and
        a browser. We use 128-bit encryption, which is the same level of encryption used by top national banks. We
        are also regularly audited by third party security firms to ensure compliance with the most rigorous
        security standards.
For added protection, we never store your banking information on our servers and we automatically log you
        out of your account after 30 minutes of inactivity.
How do you choose which real estate companies can raise money through RealtyShares?
We’re looking for companies with a knowledgeable team and a proven strategy and track record. Among other
        diligence inquiries, we will run background and credit checks on the principals of your company, and will
        perform a more thorough review of each project that is initially thought to be a suitable fit for our
        platform. Once we are comfortable with your team and the investment, we can proceed to the details of
        getting your project listed on our platform.
Currently, we list only a relatively small percentage of all of the prospective projects that are
        brought to us.

Thank you for visiting the RealtyShares website, owned and operated by RealtyShares, Inc. ("RealtyShares" or the "Company"). Please read these Terms of Service (this "Agreement" or the "Terms") carefully before using the services offered by RealtyShares. This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the website at www.realtyshares.com, all other sites owned and operated by RealtyShares that redirect to www.realtyshares.com, and all subdomains (collectively, the “Site”), and the service owned and operated by the Company (together with the Site, the “Service”). By accessing, browsing or using the Service in any manner, including, but not limited to, visiting or browsing the Site or contributing content, information, or other materials or services to the Site, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, RealtyShares' Privacy Policy, and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published by RealtyShares from time to time on the Site (collectively, the “Published Information”), each of which is incorporated by reference and each of which may be updated by RealtyShares from time to time without notice to you. In order to access the Site and the Service, you must accept these Terms, the Privacy Policy and any Published Information.

Your use of the Site and Service is governed by the then current version of the Agreement in effect on the date of such use. RealtyShares may, at its sole discretion, modify and replace the Agreement at any time and without prior notice to you by posting the updated Agreement on the Site. By using and accessing the Service, you acknowledge and agree to review the then current version of the Agreement prior to each such use. Your continued use of the Service after any modifications to the Terms have been published on the Service or otherwise provided to you constitutes your acknowledgement of, and binding agreement to, the then current Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the resolution of any dispute that arises between you and RealtyShares will be governed by the Terms in effect at the time the events giving rise to such dispute occurred. RealtyShares further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to block or otherwise discontinue your access and use of the Site at any time and for any reason. You agree that RealtyShares and its subsidiaries and affiliates will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance.

Please also note that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are in addition to any other agreements between you and RealtyShares, including any customer, account or marketing agreements, and any other agreements that govern your use of products, services, content, tools, and information available on the Site. This Agreement does not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with RealtyShares, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, for the Service or otherwise. If you do not agree to all the terms of this Agreement, RealtyShares’ Privacy Policy and/or any Published Information, you are not eligible to participate in RealtyShares’ Service or otherwise use this Site. This Agreement applies to all users of the Site or Service, including investment managers ("Managers"), investors, including Accredited Investors, as defined by SEC Regulation D Rule 501 (collectively, "Investors"), and visitors to the Site, who in any way use the Site or Service provided by RealtyShares (in each case, a "User"). Nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to confer rights on Users or third parties.

Authorized User
The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old (and at least the legal age in your jurisdiction). You represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are at least 18 years old and of legal age in your jurisdiction to form a binding contract, and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. RealtyShares may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity. The Service is not available to any Users suspended or removed from the Site or Service by RealtyShares. By using the Service, you represent that you have not been previously suspended or removed from the Site or Service.

Some of our services, and certain web pages of the Site, are available only to those Users who have been authorized by us to access those services and web pages. Only Users of the Service who are Accredited Investors as defined in Regulation D Rule 501 adopted pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (“Accredited Investors”) with a valid User ID and password are authorized to access such services and web pages. In general, to qualify as an Accredited Investor, individuals must have a net worth of more than $1 million (excluding their primary residence), or gross income for each of the last two years of at least $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with their spouse) with the expectation of a similarly qualifying income during the current year. The authorization for such Accredited Investors may require completion of an Accredited Investor questionnaire and satisfactory background information screening and/or identification verification. By registering for, accessing, browsing, and/or otherwise using the services and/or web pages for which access is restricted to Accredited Investors, you represent and agree that you are an Accredited Investor. Should you cease to be an Accredited Investor at any time, you agree to immediately notify RealtyShares and to refrain from accessing such restricted portions of the Site and/or Service. Further, because access to the restricted portions of the Site is limited by applicable law to Accredited Investors, you agree that you will not allow anyone to access such restricted portions of the Site, or share or disclose any information obtained through restricted portions of the Site with anyone, regardless of whether you believe such person or entity to also be an Accredited Investor.

As part of RealtyShares’ authorization process, each user shall be required to provide, among other things, a valid email address. In providing your email address and agreeing to these Terms of Service, each authorized user consents to receiving email notifications from RealtyShares concerning offerings. In some cases, users of the restricted portions of the Site may be required to confirm their status as an Accredited Investor. In order for RealtyShares to confirm that your representation regarding your status as an Accredited Investor is accurate when made and continues to be accurate from time to time, you agree to provide RealtyShares with all information and documentation reasonably required by RealtyShares to verify your status as an Accredited Investor, including (without limitation) delivering a completed Accredited Investor questionnaire, tax returns, brokerage statements, bank statements, resumes and other private financial information. Should you fail to provide any requested information and documentation that confirms your status as an Accredited Investor, RealtyShares may immediately suspend, block or otherwise discontinue your access and use of the Site or Service. RealtyShares may change its eligibility criteria at any time, for any reason, and without prior notice.

Persons who are resident outside of the United States are allowed access to such investment opportunities only if such access does not violate the laws of their country of residence. Our services (and certain pages of the Site) that relate to the viewing of actual investment opportunities or to making investments in the securities offered therein may not be used by any person or entity in any jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules or regulations of any governmental authority or where RealtyShares or North Capital is not authorized to provide such information or services.

Securities Offerings; No Professional Advice Provided
The Service and securities offerings on this Site are available only to Accredited Investors who understand economic and investment risk and are willing to bear the consequences of that risk. Additionally, the securities offerings on this Site are only suitable for Accredited Investors who are familiar with and willing to accept the high risk associated with private real estate investments. By using the Site or Service, you represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are of legal age to form a binding contract and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. You acknowledge and agree that you have significant experience investing in investments of the type offered through the Site, including, without limitation, real estate, equities, notes and other securities, you understand that all of the investments offered through the Service are inherently very risky, and you understand the risks associated with the investments offered through the Site, and you are comfortable with the risk of losing your entire investment invested through the Service. You further acknowledge and agree that investing in private placements carries with it low liquidity concerns and long-term commitments and that the securities sold through private placements are not publicly traded. Additionally, Investors may receive restricted stock that may be subject to holding period requirements. For those reasons, these offerings may be made availabile only to certain institutional investors and high net worth individuals and entities. If you are using the Site on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on such entity’s behalf, and that such entity agrees to indemnify RealtyShares for violations of this Agreement.
You further represent and agree that you understand that RealtyShares does not guarantee the performance of any offerings made through the Site or Service and any and all projections, estimates, and expectations for investments offered through the Site or Service are merely opinions and should not be relied on for any purpose whatsoever. The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise. Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. The contents of this Site do not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice. Investors are solely responsible for conducting any legal, accounting or due diligence review.

You should obtain investment and tax advice from your advisers before deciding to invest. Investment products are not FDIC insured, may lose value, and there is no bank guarantee.
The securities offered on the Site have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, in reliance on the exemptive provisions of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D and Rule 506, and/or Regulation S, promulgated thereunder. Securities sold through private placements are restricted and not publicly traded, and are therefore illiquid. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission or other regulatory authority has approved, passed upon or endorsed the merits of any offering on this Website.
RealtyShares is not a registered broker-dealer, funding portal, or investment advisor and does not conduct any activity that would require such registration.

Copyright Policy

If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that any material on the Site violates this Agreement or your intellectual property rights, please notify RealtyShares as soon as possible by sending an email to contact@realtyshares.com, or by contacting RealtyShares’ Agent (listed below), with the following information pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) (please confirm these requirements with your legal counsel, or see the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3), for more information): (i) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; (iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site, sufficient for RealtyShares to locate the material; (iv) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and email address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement by you that the information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
Pursuant to Section 512(c)(2) of the DMCA, RealtyShares’ designates the following agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement:

		Nav Athwal
		525 Market Street, Suite 2800
		San Francisco, CA 94105

You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section, your DMCA notice may not be valid. We reserve the right to remove User Content alleged to be infringing or otherwise illegal without prior notice and at our sole discretion. In appropriate circumstances, RealtyShares will also terminate a User's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”

Crowdsourcing Knowledge For A Commercial Real Estate Investment | Financial Samurai



















































Financial SamuraiSlicing Through Money's MysteriesCrowdsourcing Knowledge For A Commercial Real Estate Investment
Posted by Financial Samurai 88 Comments 
I’ve got an idea that could be great for an ongoing series. Given Financial Samurai is an established site with a large community of investment savvy readers from all over the U.S. and the world, why not crowdsource our knowledge to see if we can make better investment decisions!
Real estate is my favorite asset class to build wealth long term because it is simple to understand, tangible, and rides the inflation wave. But buying physical real estate requires a large downpayment, ongoing property taxes, maintenance, tenant headaches, and often takes up a dangerously large percentage of one’s overall net worth.
Given I already have four physical properties, I’d like to diversify and reduce risk by surgically investing smaller amounts of capital in properties with higher rental yields from different parts of the country. San Francisco cap rates (net rental yields), for example, are only in the 2% – 4% range. This is where real estate crowdsourcing platforms come in. You can easily invest smaller amounts in different areas of the country with potentially much higher returns without betting the farm.
By 2Q2017 I will have a relatively large 4% CD in the amount of $340,000 coming due. Before then, I want to get comfortable with real estate crowdsource investing. My goals are: 1) geographic diversification, 2) beating a 4% yield in a low risk way, and 3) investing in commercial real estate given all my properties are residential.
Suburban Philadelphia Class-A Office Conshohocken, PA

Here’s a current offering RealtyShares just e-mailed to me. It’s a Class-A office building with 30,000+ square feet about 14 miles away from Philadelphia. With a target 18% internal rate of return (annual return over 5-year life of investment), I’m salivating like Pavlov’s Dog wanting to invest. But I know nothing about Conshohocken, PA real estate and need help from those of you living in the region and from those who’ve invested in commercial real estate before.

Pros
* Commercial property built in 2000 with a ~30% vacant rate for upside rental income potential.
* $172/square foot potential purchase price.
* Stronger than average demographics (see below).
* RealtyShares investors are entitled to a 10.0% IRR (including return of capital) before the Sponsor (real estate developer) receives adjusted economics. Furthermore, the Sponsor’s position is to be at 16.4% of the required equity for this project, which includes the conversion of its 2% acquisition fee into part of its equity interest. Proceeds above a 10% internal rate of return are to be split 75% to deal-level investors and 25% to the Sponsor, until such investors have earned a 16% annualized internal rate of return. Proceeds above a 16% internal rate of return are to be split 60% to deal-level investors and 40% to the Sponsor. In other words, there’s incentive for the Sponsor to maximize returns.
* Quarterly dividend payment.
* Haverford Properties, the sponsor, has participated in several billion dollars in transactions and currently own five projects that collectively represent more than $300 million in assets under management since 2012.
Cons
* 5 year term. Might be difficult for some people to lock up cash for so long. I’m coming from a position where I locked up cash in a 7-year CD, so 5 years is in the ballpark.
* $10,000 minimum versus $5,000  minimum for other deals. I’d ideally like to invest in two $5,000 deals to test things out, although one good $10,000 deal would make things easier to track and write about.
* Nothing is a guarantee. The 18% IRR is just a target. The sponsor might not be able to fill the vacancies with high quality tenants. We could enter a recession post election. The sponsor might not be able to sell as planned in five years etc. I generally like to cut target IRRs in half, and treat anything higher as gravy. People tend to overpromise, underdeliver all the time when it comes to raising capital.
* Was targeting Midwest and Southern properties, but Conshohocken seems similarly cheap.
* Haverford Properties has only been investing since 2012, although the LinkedIn bio of the co-founder, Charles Houder says he’s been at Haverford Properties since 2010. Perhaps there was no activity the first two years when he first started. At least Charles has been in the real estate investment arena since 2001, working for other firms.
Here is the official overview posted on RealtyShares that comes from Haverford Properties.





Property Summary




375 East Elm Street, (the “Property”) is a multi-tenanted Class-A office building on 2.7-acres in the Conshohocken submarket of Philadelphia, PA. The property was developed in 2000 and currently configured with six separate suites, five of which are expected be occupied at close. Of the approximately 9,000 square feet that will be vacant, it can be broken up into smaller suites or leased as a whole depending on tenant requirements. The tenants are generally characterized as professional type office users and include attorney’s and medical offices among others. Blended average in-place lease term and blended average in-place lease rate are 2.9 years and $23.80 PSF, respectively.
The physical condition of the building is reported to be good and the suites are in leasable condition per the third-party property inspection and the Sponsor’s feedback. The $25 PSF in tenant improvements budgeted for two new leases (6,042 sf assumed after 6 months and 3,021 sf after 15 months) is to most likely go to customizing the spaces and cosmetic upgrades. The $5 PSF budgeted for renewals (70% probability) is to either serve as incentive capital or for moderate upgrades.
Please refer to the Photos tab for pictures of the Property.

Investment Summary
RealtyShares invites its investors to participate in a common equity investment relating to the acquisition of a 30,266 square foot Class-A office building (the “Property”) located at 375 East Elm Street in downtown Conshohocken, a suburb in the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”). Developed in 2000, the Property is located approximately 14-miles northwest of Philadelphia’s Central Business District (“CBD”). Conshohocken is one of Philadephia’s most vibrant and successful sub-markets for suburban office properties, and is supported by excellent residential demographics and strong demand for office inventory (see Investment Highlights below). The 2-story multi-tenanted building is expected to be approximately 30% vacant upon acquisition, presenting the Sponsor with the opportunity to substantially grow revenue by leasing space at market rates and to negotiate market rental rates with existing tenants as their leases come up for renewal; most these tenants are currently paying below market rates.
Haverford Properties (“Haverford” or the “Sponsor”) is acquiring the Property directly from seller at a potentially attractive basis of $172 per square foot. The Property was identified by the Sponsor on an off-market basis and is to relieve the Seller of a negative cash flow situation caused by the recent vacancy of a tenant. The expected new loan facility is to provide for 18-months of interest-only payments (no amortization), which is designed to reduce the initial debt service burden on the Sponsor so that it has sufficient time needed to stabilize the Property.
The Sponsor is a diversified real estate investment and development firm based outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Sponsor is involved in all aspects of real estate development and investment, including, but not limited to, acquisition, entitlement and project construction, management, asset management, property management, accounting, and underwriting. As reported by the Sponsor, it has participated in several billion dollars in transactions and currently own five projects that collectively represent more than $300 million in assets under management.
Please note that this investment is scheduled to close in September and is to most likely be debited late August/ early September.



Investment Highlights and Risk Mitigants






Top Office Submarket: Conshohocken is among the top submarkets in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area (MSA) according to CoStar’s Mid-Year 2016 Report due to its low vacancy and high rental rates. Per CoStar, Conshohocken vacancy and asking rates are 6.6% and $30.47 Per Square Foot (“PSF”), respectively—substantially exceeding metro-wide office market averages of 9.3% and $22.16 PSF. Conshohocken is also the second highest rental rate submarket, behind only the neighboring Main Line submarket (per CoStar). From an underwriting standpoint, the Property is projected to stabilize at 8% vacancy and $27.00 PSF base rent, adjusted for inflation.
Strong Demographic Area Profile: The Property’s surrounding residential base exceeds state and national benchmarks in a variety of key metrics collected by ESRI (a demographic data provider) from U.S. Census data. According to this data, the 48,648 residents living within a 3-mile radius of the Property are generally high earning, well-educated, and employed in white collar labor sectors—aspects which can broadly support a successful office submarket.








The following table compares the demographics in the area with state and country demographics:

Well-Amenitized, Transit-Oriented Location: The Property potentially benefits from strong, transit-oriented connectivity with two train stations within a half mile and easy access to several major interstates. Downtown Philadelphia is a 45 minute commute by train and 20 minutes by car. The immediate submarket has a large variety of restaurants, cafés, and other neighborhood amenities, cultivating an archetypal live-work-play environment for its office and multifamily properties. To this end, 760 residential apartment units were recently completed adjacent to the Property and two additional developments of 595 Class-A residential apartments are planned.
Newer Construction, High Quality Asset: The Property was developed in 2000 to a Class-A standard. The Property is being purchased (off market) from a small operator who has meticulously managed the physical condition of the asset. The third party Property Condition Report performed in July 2016 found no deferred maintenance issues and no immediate capital expense concerns.
Value-Add Strategy: Near-term rollover should bring the occupancy of the Property to approximately 70%. Along with the $25 PSF budgeted for tenant improvements, the business plan is to leverage the Sponsor’s long standing brokerage relationships to attract tenants to the building at rental rates that are close to market rates, as well as to renew existing tenants (whose rollover is somewhat staggered) at rates also more consistent with those of the market. Underwritten new and renewal rent anticipates $27 per square foot (PSF), compared to $29+ PSF suggested by actual signed lease comparables in the area (see Lease Comparables in Documents tab).
Potentially Attractive Senior Debt: The Sponsor has signed a term sheet with Tompkins VIST Bank for a 10-year loan at 72.5% of cost with a fixed rate of 4.25% for the first 6.5 years. The loan features 18 months of interest-only payments before it begins to amortize on a 25-year schedule, and has no prepayment penalty if the property is sold to a third party. The loan is to be guaranteed by the principals of Haverford.
Favorable Transaction Structure: Deal-level investors (such as RealtyShares 248, LLC) are entitled to a 10.0% IRR (including return of capital) before the Sponsor receives adjusted economics. Furthermore, the Sponsor’s position is to be at 16.4% of the required equity for this project, which includes the conversion of its 2% acquisition fee into part of its equity interest.
Experienced Sponsor and Property Manager: Principals of Haverford have acquired more than $1 billion of real estate assets since 2012. Haverford is to be contracting property management services from Beacon Commercial Real Estate, which has been in business for over 17 years providing lease & sale brokerage and property management services to its clients in the greater Philadelphia area.





Management Biographies


* Don’t see world class institutions like The College of William & Mary and UC Berkeley, but at least both have graduate degrees and a decent amount of real estate investing experience. William & Mary and Cal are my alma maters, so I’m just having a little fun. 
Investment Deal / Use Of Proceeds

* Nice to see $356,633 in reserves and $45,000 in working capital. It’s interesting to see that despite a purchase price of $5,200,000, $700,000 more is set aside (13.5%) for various reasons. 
Sources Of Funding For The Office Building

* It’s always good to see a Sponsor have skin in the game. However, $267,433 is only 4.5% of the total sources of funding, despite being 16.4% of the equity. From a RealtyShares investor’s point of view, you want the Sponsor to put up even more capital. My preference is for 10% of the capital or greater.
Blue Sky Exit Assumption

* I still can’t believe it will cost a 5% commission in five years to sell a property ($365,339/$7,306,787). That seems outrageous given many of these deals are directly negotiated. Hopefully there is 1-2% upside in terms of commission savings here.
If You Invested $50,000 In This Deal

* If the deal pans out, an impressive 51% of your initial investment will be paid out in quarterly interest payments for the life of the deal. The chart also states that if you invest $50,000, you will end up with profits of $54,098 over a five year period ($104,098 total proceeds after initial capital is returned). That’s a 108% total return if all works out, or 18% annual return. But again, things tend to never work out as planned, which is why I cut my return assumptions in half to be more conservative.
INVEST OR PASS?
I’m itching to invest in my first RealtyShares deal and this commercial property in the suburbs of Philly could be it. But before I do, I’d love to get your feedback, especially if you are a real estate crowdsourcing veteran or live in the PA area. Every potential investment always looks good when you read the marketing material. But as we all know, not every investment turns out great hence the desire to crowdsource knowledge.
There are a lot of deals on RealtyShares that already say “join the waitlist.” Further, as I’m focusing on commercial real estate instead of single or multi-family home properties, supply is even scarcer. Please feel free to be very critical of this potential investment. It’s always good to know all the potential red flags before deploying any capital. If there are any other investments on the platform that look intriguing, let us know!

Update 9/28/2016: The deal closed and I decided to invest $10,000 to see how things go and familiarize myself with the RealtyShares platform until end of 1Q2017 when I’ll have a lot more money to put to work.

I’d wait for another opportunity.  Conshohocken is in a somewhat awkward location and there is a lot of development going on in the King of Prussia area (about 8 miles away), especially commercial property.  Landlord might need to offer additional incentives to fill vacancies and it isn’t clear how much of any impact that would have to any anticipated investor returns.

Interesting about the King of Prussia area. Are you saying that there is potentially oversupply of commercial real estate? 8 miles seems a little far away to be a direct comp no?

Many of the potential tenants and their employer will be coming from the west by car.  They will drive by King of Prussia on their way to Conshohocken.  Why would a tenant choose Conshohocken over King of Prussia, especially if most of their employees are already living in the western suburbs?

I have to agree. I used to live in Philly or rather, in a nice sub on the mainline and learned that it’s all about the Schuylkill – i.e. the death trap interstate that is the main artery for traffic getting to the burbs to this location. There is a long portion where this artery merges together into a two lanes creating one of the worst jams I ever experienced. In my day, this impacted my decisions all of the time on when I would venture out towards this area and wound up being not too often – too much of a treacherous headache. Philly is a gritty city with Conshohocken a unique area but not one seen for high comers and well known as a complete pain in the ass to get in and out of.

Sam, I live about :30-:45 from Conshohocken, but do not know too much about commercial real estate. I can tell you that it is a “hot” area and well positioned with easy access to Philadelphia and a few train stations as the article mentioned.
Lot’s of people have been moving there for years. It is considered to be a nice suburb to commute to Philadelphia from and is relatively higher income. Consequently, there would probably be demand for high-end service providers to occupy that space.
From a macro perspective, I would not have an issue investing in that area, but again, I don’t know too much about commercial properties or the factors that people may want to consider.
I’ll be following closely to see what others have to say!

Hi Jon, are there any particular reasons why the area is considered “hot”? I’m all for hot, but why do you think?

I think this is a very worthwhile subject you are now covering.  I’d like to be personally invested in real estate but also don’t want to buy a house/condo locally to rent because of all of the headaches I understand that come along with it.  I see crowd source RE investing as an opportunity to be directly in the market, managing risk, and not having to be up in the middle of the night to fix a plumbing problem.    
Thanks for starting this subject.

Yes, I’m reaching my limit w/ two rentals in SF and one in Lake Tahoe. Something is always going wrong (last week, the garage spring broke), and I would rather simplify life. 
I like buying physical real estate to enjoy and live in it, and then rent it out. With real estate crowdsourcing, I’m PURELY focused on the numbers/returns now. Investing $10,000 – $50,000 here and there and letting others do the heavy lifting for a fee seems better than going all-in w/ another multi-hundred thousand dollar downpayment or cash payment on just one property now.
But right now is incubation period where I will get as smart as possible before the large funds start getting deployed in 2017.

I’d say that crowd-sourcing is really changing the real estate investment market, and for the better in my opinion. Especially in the commercial area which has historically been hard to access by the retail investor besides public REITS. 
FS I think it’s a good move to diversify your RE holdings away from residential into commercial for your specific situation.  However I’m hoping to clarify your comment about “riding the inflation wave” from above. Is that in regards to commercial or residential real estate?  
Maybe start with small amount until you get more comfortable with these types of deals. And I agree that I’d be conservative in my expectations compared to what the marketing material tells me. Note that’s not me giving the rubber stamp on this deal.

That is a really interesting opportunity. We just visited friends who moved to Ardmore – about 6 miles from there. They purchased an amazing condo in a beautifully restored church and the area is full of colleges and universities too. They looked for homes and had trouble finding one for a long time due to low inventory in the class of home they were looking for. Not sure if that helps at all but I could probably get some questions answered if you needed more information. We’ll be following what you do here closely!

Here’s what my friends who just bought the condo in the renovated church in Ardmore said – “I am very familiar with Conshohocken.  They call it Conshie around here!  It is definitely a spot worth investing in. Has become more and more popular especially with the younger crowd.  Tons of apartments and condos, lots of renovations going on. They recently finished the Schuylkill Valley Nature Trail that runs along the river through Conshie, so lots of people walk, run, bike on that and that is a big draw.  Also, recently a brewery opened along the trail, so that also draws the younger crowd.  Lots or restaurants and activities take place year round, too. So, yes. Good place to invest.”  Not sure if that helps at all – but thought I would send it along!

I’ve only been to Phili a couple times and unfortunately don’t know the surrounding areas at all. I’m also new to commercial real estate but wow the price per square foot on that property is so incredibly lower than what I’m used to seeing on residential properties in the Bay Area. I like the concept of crowdsourcing properties in various parts of the country and not having to worry about any of the actual leasing, maintenance and taxes yourself.

One of my biggest problems is that EVERYTHING (except for Manhattan) I look at investing in, looks so darn cheap compared to SF. I need to be careful to confuse finding a bargain relative to SF prices versus finding a bargain versus the prices IN THAT AREA. This is why I’m more than happy to have local experts manage and invest my money.

I invested in this deal and it was also my first with RealtyShares.  I am not from the Philly area, but here are the reasons I chose it:
1. Like you, I am also looking to diversify my investments with commercial real estate.
2. The figures in the “Financial Summary” document looked reasonable, despite not being able to verify the calculations (would have been nice to see the spreadsheet version of the PDF).
3. Haverford Properties has a professional online presence and a verifiable track record (if you Google them, you’ll see articles from Philadelphia magazine and others referencing their selection by the City of Philadelphia to redevelop part of the Delaware River Waterfront, the historic “Knox Home” in Wynnewood, and others).
4. The current tenants from the Rent Roll seem stable, and unlikely to vacate in response to raising rents to market levels.
5. Marcus & Millichap predict office rent and occupancy increases this year in the Philly suburbs, and the overall office building investment outlook looks positive )
6. Glenn Mueller of Dividend Capital Research assessed office real estate in the Philadelphia metropolitan statistical area (MSA) to be in the late stages of the “Recovery Phase” of the market cycle as of 1Q16 (http://info.dividendcapital.com/rs/dividendcapital/images/Cycle_Monitor_16Q1_FINAL.pdf).  Given that it should be close to or into the “Expansion Phase” by now, the office market looks favorable for investment.
7. (Most important) My wife, who is a CPA and more conservative than me when it comes to investments, did not object.

Financial Samurai says

Thanks for this Dustin. This is exactly the insights I’m looking to crowdsource!
“Rents Reach Nine-Year High; Philly Suburbs Attract Opportunistic Investors
A steady pace of job growth and renewed interest in the Philadelphia suburbs will support office rent and occupancy increases this year. Urbanization outside the metro core and access to a highly skilled workforce has elevated demand for suburban office space. Building activity will increase modestly to meet demand with new suburban space as well as intown developments slated for delivery. 
In downtown Philadelphia, the completion of the 575,000-square-foot FMC Tower will lead office construction in 2016 as completions more than triple last year’s clip. The project will be joined by the new 59-story Comcast headquarters in the next few years, helping reshape the Philadelphia skyline. Developers won’t only focus on corporate space, however. Two fully leased medical office buildings will be completed this year, adding more than 65,000 square feet to market inventory. 
The metro boasts a high concentration of health education and research institutions, driving demand for medical office space. As health and business organizations expand their footprints, the metrowide vacancy rate will see further contractions this year, reaching the lowest level since early 2009. Tight market conditions will generate a rent hike, pushing average asking rent to a post-recession high.”
Maybe Philly and its suburbs is the new Seattle/Portland. I’ll be ruminating. 
Regarding the returns…. I’m really just looking to replicate 4%. Anything more is a bonus. So if I cut 18% in half, a 9.5% IRR would be a grand slam for me. Let’s see.
Do you have a list of the tenants and know what they do? Let me see if I can find it on the RS platform as well.

Yep, from the “Rent Roll” in the Documents tab: Insight Medical; Southwark, LLC; Frederic I.

As mentioned in the Overview section of the offering, the lease rollovers are staggered, which should allow for a methodical value-add approach.

I would not touch this.
First, it’s not a Class A building.  It’s a Class C, neighborhood office building.  The market statistics that count are rents, vacancy and lease up times for Class C buildings in the immediate vicinity.  Second, look at Google Street View.  Well maintained?  Doesn’t look so good to me.  Note the “space available” notice on the sign.  Picture was taken in 2014 so occupancy has probably been under 100 percent consistently.  Drive the surrounding area using Street View.  Not exactly a Class A neighborhood.  Surrounding uses are residential, light industrial, and service commercial with a few office buildings mixed in.  The street is narrow.  The City public works uses are down the street a few blocks.  Finally, put the address in Google maps and have a look at the tenant list in the sidebar.  Not exactly credit tenants.
Somewhere in the tabs that were not included in your post is likely a pro forma income and expense statement.  Would love to see that.  No cap rate shown.  Maybe it’s in one of the other tabs.  Would also like to see the total debt payment, the debt service coverage ratio, and how that was calculated.  This property is an alligator for a small investor – a couple of vacancies can put the owner in foreclosure or loan workout in a hurry.  It takes deep pockets to continue making mortgage payments and shell out tenant improvement dollars when 30 percent of your gross income disappears.  
This is the type of property you pick up in a down market for 30 cents on the dollar and re-tenant to catch a rising market for the resale.  From what I see, it’s not a strong “value add” proposition as described.

Love it! Didn’t think about doing a Google street view and checking things out virtually. I have some Twitter followers and readers who know the area who will check it out. Just checked it out. Looks like a nice, sunny day on Google SV. I like the middle class neighborhood, and the closeness to the river. What suburban America might be all about! I need to look into all the existing tenants and what they do.
The place doesn’t look like Class-A compared to the Class A office buildings in the major cities. But it is considered Class-A for the suburbs. The stuff you see in Sand Hill Road (silicon valley), CA are supposedly Class-A, that all look like this place if not actually much older.
May I ask where you are investing your disposable income/savings at this moment?

Hi, medium time reader, first time poster. I don’t think the suburbs have their own definition of Class A. Class A is the Empire State Building, the Met Life building, etc. Suburbs just have Class B and C’s and below, generally.

Reply






Financial Samurai says 
August 14, 2016 at 10:38 am 

It’s all relative to the quality in the area. Check out definition below.
Class A: These properties represent the highest quality buildings in their market and area.  They are generally newer properties built within the last 15 years with top amenities, high-income earning tenants and low vacancy rates.  Class A buildings are well located in the market and are typically professionally managed.  Additionally, they typically demand the highest rent with little or no deferred maintenance issues. 
Class B:  One step down from Class A, these properties are generally older than Class A, tend to have lower income tenants and may or may not be professionally management.  Rental income is typically lower than Class A along with some deferred maintenance issues.  Mostly, these buildings are well maintained and many investors see this as a “value-add” investment opportunity because through renovation and common area improvements, the property can be upgraded to Class A or a Class B+.  Buyers are generally able to acquire these properties at a higher CAP Rate than a comparable Class A property because these properties are viewed as riskier than Class A.  
Class C:  Class C properties are typically more than 20 years old and located in less than desirable locations.  The property is generally in need of renovation, including updating the building infrastructure to bring it up to date.  As a result, Class C buildings tend to have the lowest rental rates in a market with other Class A or Class B properties.   Some Class C properties need significant reposting to get to steady cash flows for investors.
It is important for investors to understand that each class of property represents a different level of risk and reward.  Class A provides investors with more security by knowing that they are investing in top tier properties, with little or no outstanding issues requiring further capital expenditures.   However, despite better property conditions, Class A can be sensitive in times of a recession if high income earners suffer from increased unemployment.
Class B and C properties tend to be bought and sold at higher CAP rates than class A as investors are paid for the additional risk of an older property with lower income tenants, or a property in a lower income neighborhood.
The property class investors invest in can have a great deal of influence on the stability of an investment over time, as well as its growth appreciation.  For investors looking for capital preservation, Class A may be the right investment.  For investors looking for capital appreciation, Class B and C may be better investments for that specific risk profile.

I can’t speak about commercial real estate but I can share a few things about “Conshy”.
A) it’s home to Ikea USA.
B) close access to a lot of major highways
C) property taxes are generally high in Philly suburbs ($350k homes in nice ‘burbs often have ~$8k annual), except in Conshy, likely because Ikea generates a lot of tax revenue for city
D) schools are great and home prices high

1.  It’s not home to Ikea.  Ikea is in Plymouth Township but it has a Conshohocken zip code.
2.  Conshohocken does have great access to highways.  It’s is a few minutes drive from I-476 (The Blue Route), I-76 (Schuylkill Expressway) and the PA Turnpike.  It also has access to SEPTA train line, bus routes and the Schuylkill River Trail.
3.  Property taxes are average, but this has nothing to do with Ikea.  See #1.
4.  Schools are good and home prices are above average, I agree.  Average 3 BR/2.5 BA is probably around $300K.

The residential real-estate is old stock, so $300K is high.  Most of the homes are twins or townhome-types that are small and dated.  
A new home/twin sell for $400k-$500k easy.  I sit on the Conshohocken Planning Commission so I see the market a bit earlier then most.  New residential, where there is any, is looking like this @ $440K.  (http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/212-Wood-St-Unit-2_Conshohocken_PA_19428_M47497-40984).

There is a lot of commercial properties near the river that help with the taxes. There is also a 1% earned income tax, so high earners.  Lastly, it’s a small Borough. It’s only 1 square mile.  So, there is not much to suck up the tax money.
This Borough was a different place just 20 years ago.  Steel mill was closing, Lee Tire Factory was closing, it was in big trouble.  Some tough decisions in the 90s that resulted in the huge commercial expansion along the river lead to where we are today.  Note, the building Financial Samurai is referring to is only 2-3 blocks from all the new building that went up along the river.  Here is an article I love to show people that know what Conshohocken was like about 20 years ago.  Broke.

Great idea for a post so we can all learn. I am on west coast where my returns for real estate are sub5% and I also was seriously looking at large apartment buildings in the south where there is good demographics and returns but trying to feel comfortable with doing out of area…
When doing realty shares how are distributions taxed ?
I used to goto West Conshohocken a bunch for work. There are lots of institutional/buy side money managers based there instead of in Philly. Its good schools and affluent there. Lots of commercial office building complexes so I wonder how stable vacancy rates are due to supply? A good resource is asking on Biggerpockets forum for local pro opinion, some very savy commercial investors there.

Hi Brian,
The tax reporting documents, and the taxation regime, applicable in RealtyShares investments vary by transaction type and sometimes by specific deals within transaction types.
For debt investments and certain preferred equity investments, investors purchase related debt securities (Notes) of a RealtyShares subsidiary. For these investments, investors will receive a 1099-INT for the interest payments on their Notes, and such interest payments will be taxed at ordinary income rates regardless of the duration of the term of the Notes.
For other preferred equity investments, investors will become members of a special-purpose limited liability company and will receive Schedules K-1 for such investments. The payments on these preferred equity investments are still treated largely similar to interest payments, however, and such payments will generally be taxed at ordinary income rates even for investments that last beyond one year.
For common equity investments, investors may enjoy certain potential tax benefits related to real estate ownership. As with some of the preferred equity investments, investors will become members of a special-purpose limited liability company and will receive Schedules K-1 for such investments. The potential tax benefits involved with common equity investments, though, means that investors may see depreciation, mortgage interest, and other deductions that often offset (sometimes entirely) the actually distributed cash payments received — so that investors may receive distributions throughout the year and yet, in some instances, have little or no taxable income. These benefits (if any) are temporary in nature, and involve deferral, but not avoidance, of taxes on the distributions received; much or all of this tax advantage is generally “recaptured” later at the time that the property is sold. That portion of returns that are attributable to the sale of an appreciated property will generally be subject to capital gains treatment, which generally involves lower rates than gains taxable as ordinary income.
If you have any other questions about RealtyShares, feel free to send an email to contact@realtyshares.com

Responding to this question” Also, how does one file for taxes for investments that are out-of-state? Is there an extra step to take or do you just report the income like normal dividend income or is it like a K-1?”
As a general rule, if an entity has an equitable interest in real property in a specific state that state will subject the partners to taxation (assuming that state imposes income tax). Accordingly, when you invest in a RealtyShares equity investment opportunity that state will typically tax you and it does not matter what state you reside in.
If a state imposes a state income tax, withholding and filing requirements are typically done under the following scenarios:
No state withholdings are made by the partnership and the individual partners are required to file state tax returns and to pay income tax on their respective share of the partnership income.
The partnership withholds state income tax on behalf of the partner and remits it to the state. This withholding is then reflected on Form K-1 and the partner is responsible for filing the required tax forms.
The partnership withholds, remits and files all information with the state and the individual partner is not required to file or pay anything. This is called a composite or group filing. State filing requirements are complex. We strongly recommend that you discuss your state filing requirements with your tax professional.

Items of Notes on Conshohocken:
1.  There is a lot of new and planned construction in the Borough.  Please see this blog post that I did a few years ago on some activity (http://www.conshy.org/2013/01/20/a-third-proposed-development-of-new-apartments-in-conshy/).
2.  NOTE:  The development at West Elm and Corson St is no longer a apartment building, it is now a 340K sq/ft office space.  (http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/blog/real-estate/2015/06/equus-capital-conshohocken-lafayette-street.html)
3.  As noted above, the Conshohocken real estate market is very hot for both commercial and residential spaces.  Commercial availability of Class A space dropped below 10% and Class B space to below 6%.  (http://morethanthecurve.com/commercial-real-estate-vacancy-rates-continue-to-drop-in-conshohockens/)
4.  There are major happenings in the Borough over the next few years.  There will be a boutique hotel and office space built on First/West Elm, new apartments have start construction on Washington St, and AmerisourceBergen, a Fortune 50 Company, is looking to make Conshohocken it’s new Corporate HQ location once contiguous office space is built (http://morethanthecurve.com/amerisourcebergen-opening-office-in-conshy-but-keeping-its-headquarters-in-chesterbrook/).

Brian Tobin says 
August 14, 2016 at 6:19 pm 

We’ll see.  The big problem right now with commercial build out is not the demand for space, I foresee solid demand.
In my opinion, it’s that bridge over the river.  All of the highway access is on the other side of the bridge.  So, at rush hour, its a bit of a mess.  I don’t know how they expect to remediate the problem, but it may be a turnoff for continued growth.
Conshohocken’s access to public transit and bike trails are what make the possible traffic issues a bit less. 
What I do see is the big builders, the O’Neil Properties, Equus Capital and Pulver are bullish on Conshohocken commercial space.  They have investments with 0’s at the end of them and they know a lot more then I do.

Hi Brian: 
I notice you mention the development on West Elm.  The subject is on East Elm.  A Google Street View drive shows this to be a much different area than the nicer areas of West Elm.  The housing on East Elm, including across from the subject, is reminiscent of the mill town Conshohockon once was.  The City sewage treatment plant, which reportedly has a long standing uncorrected odor problem, is less than a block east of the subject building.  The location would be of concern to me as an investor.
Can you tell us a little more about the subject neighborhood?  Do you have any information about office vacancy and demand in the immediate area?  There seems to have been some newer development south of the railroad tracks adjacent to the river.  Is occupancy in that sub-neighborhood strong?  What effect does the sewage treatment plant have on the subject property and those properties?

Reply






Brian Tobin says 
August 15, 2016 at 12:59 pm 

Yes, the sewage treatment plant is fairly close to the subject building.  I admit, I live on the West side of town and don’t get to enjoy the odor as much as my neighbors!
With that being said, the complaints have been heard and the SA is planning some additional remediation in order to alleviate the problem. (http://www.conshohockensa.com/information/odor-control.aspx)
I can’t say I know much more then what has already been mentioned.  My opinion on demand and vacancy is based on the big-time investors.  The are putting millions of dollars into commercial, residential and hotel space over the next 3-5 years.  Even during the lows of 2008-2009, both commercial and residential vacancies were acceptable.  There were some, but not many, foreclosures and short sales.  
Right now, the residential market is pretty solid.  I found some data here (http://marketminute.longandfoster.com/Market-Minute/PA/Conshohocken-Lafayette-Hill.htm)  that shows positive numbers.  Inventory is down, prices are up and DoM is down to only 40 days.  Impressive…

Sam do you have an opinion regarding concentration risk for this relatively new product? Meaning, in terms of your overall investment portfolio (or net worth for that matter)… I’m curious to know your appetite for risk-taking. 0.5% concentration / property is kind of where my head’s at. That would limit me to the $5k investments at this point… So unfortunately this one is out.  As far as advice, this is a bit anecdotal but I’ve heard from a colleague that is moving to that area that it’s the place to be right now (from a residential standpoint). I suspect that doesn’t help you from the commercial side of things. However the greater population density can never hurt.

Financial Samurai says

Concentration risk is exactly why I’m hesitant to buy another physical property. I recommend/like keeping real estate as less than 50% of total net worth. The more diversified that 50% or less is, the better at this stage. I basically went “all-in” with properties in SF that have done well, but the market seems to be fading now.
0.5% concentration is pretty small. My investments with high conviction go to 5% – 10% of my entire portfolio. I do like to make more concentrated bets. 
I’m thinking of carving $100,000 of my $340,000 expiring CD in real estate crowdsourcing. Hence, a $10,000 investment in this commercial property would be 10%.

Fair. I guess I’m still recovering emotionally from ’07-’12 as far as real estate goes…
Stock markets bounced back in ~5 yrs. Real estate still isn’t there… 
I understand past performance does not guarantee future results. I guess even though I’m a regular reader I still question your confidence in real estate. Are you not seeing some of the irresponsibly free-flowing capital that we saw in the lead up to the last crash? Some would argue products such as this one we are discussing now are evidence of overconfidence in the sector… aren’t you better off investing in your own business?

Did you have a bad experience between 2007 and 2012? A lot of areas have recovered to  reach their previous Heights, and some places like New York and San Francisco are way beyond their previous peaks.
 Lending and refinancing has been incredibly tight and difficult over the past six or seven years since the financial crisis. The irony is that only the people who don’t need the money seem to be getting money to invest. Down payment levels are much much greater than in the past and if there is a downturn I suspect they much shallower one e.g. 20% versus 50%.
 It took me almost 4 months to refinance my mortgage, with the bank where I have more than 1 million in assets and a 15 year relationship with. I’ve never missed a payment and I have an 800 credit score. When people have a lot more skin in the game it is much more difficult to walk away from an underperforming property.
But due to the potential for a downturn, I’m investing much less money in different locations.

Question….what is the worst case scenario for this kind of investment? Losing interest only? Losing everything? 
Thanks

I would think a realistic worst case scenario oh is that a recession hits in the area, there is only a 50% occupancy, and investors just collect half or less than half of the Projected rents and hold until there is a recovery to be able to sell.

At 50% vacancy, would they be able to cover the cost of the debt?  Would they be able to hold until there is a recovery, especially if that recovery happens after the “interest only” part of the loan expires?  It seems there is a reasonable chance that the bank forecloses on this loan and equity owners get nothing.

If you are bearish over the next few years on RE, why are you investing in these deals especially since it would be tricky to get out. When I read the documents this seems like a note and there are a few firms with longer track record of buying notes for pennies on the dollar and also servicing it so you don’t have to deal with the headache of default. I dont believe RealtyShares services and would help convert the notes from non-performing to performing.

Haven’t bought yet John, but will highlight when I do. Plenty of people also make money in bear markets. It’s not a 100% one way loss for all investors. You just have to go look and do your due diligence on various investment opportunities, which is what I’m doing now. 
I like to lock my money up for 5 – 10 years w/ a strong IRR so I don’t have to deal w/ it. B/c I live below my means, I have an excess of capital coming in every month that I’ve got to figure out what to do with it. The big one is coming in 1Q2017 when a CD comes due. 
What are you doing with your money? And how are you exposed to real estate if any? Thx

Conshohocken has an “awkward” location? It has exits to 476 and 76 and close to the turnpike and close enough to 202. It also has two train stations. 
As Brian shared above, MoreThanTheCurve.com provides vacancy rates every quarter. It has been sliding down and is now at a three year record low. 
The one issue is that there is a million plus square feet approved, but not yet built. That could alter the market if they get built.

“I would think a realistic worst case scenario oh is that a recession hits in the area, there is only a 50% occupancy, and investors just collect half or less than half of the Projected rents and hold until there is a recovery to be able to sell.”
If it worked at 70 percent occupancy, the current owner would likely not be forced to sell.  There’s a reason the sponsor is coming to the table with less than 5 percent equity and crowdfunding the rest of the 20 percent and it is they can afford to take risk with this capital structure. It’s easy for them to walk away.
I would love to know who is lending on this deal.  Guess I will have to sign up for an account to get the full story.

Lots of these deals start with the founders only putting in 5%. That’s part of the reason I look at them.  I want to see how to get a 5% down project with 20+% IRR. Not sure it’s worth the effort but interesting to look at.

I work in commercial real estate private equity. Waterfall and fee structure are favorable to investors. I think the fact that the sponsors are willing to take on recourse is a very good sign. My concern would be on the exit and on re-leasing the space. Not sure how many questions you can ask on RealtyShares, but I would want to know the sponsor has a competitive advantage over current ownership to lease the space and that there are several tenants interested in the area. I would also be concerned about an exit in 5 years, especially with office product, when we could be in the midst of an economic recession. I think crowdsourcing is hard because you don’t know these guys at Haverford, and you don’t know their relationships in the market. Cash on cash is strong but that’s all contingent upon a quick lease-up with solid rents.
If you can find out answers to these questions, and they check out, I’d say this is a go for your higher-risk bucket.

Hi Justin,
Thanks for your insights. I can ask RealtyShares an endless amount of questions with answers, but perhaps not so much the sponsor, Haverford Properties. But maybe. I don’t see why I can’t just e-mail them this post and have them answer questions, unless there is some SEC rule against that during a private placement offering. 
I worry with you regarding exits as well. Who knows the future in 5 years. It would be interesting if in 5 years, Conshy becomes a BOOM TOWN and rents rocket and there is max occupancy. Why sell then? Just collect outsized returns every year for a s long as possible. 
Based on the feedback on FS from locals, Haverford has a good track record. I’d like to reach out to them.

I voted no after reading the post and all the comments. I think the projections are overly optimisitic especially considering the tenant vacancy is at a 3 year low. I think the markets are going to be unstable for at least the next two years and businesses are going to suffer as usual. This leaves only 3 years for this to make you money.
I think you should stick to your rule, sponsor should have at least 10% invested. I also think they should at minimum guarantee your capital if they’re locking you in for 5 years and if possible guarantee a minimum return. That’s what a bank does and the return is guaranteed there.
50K is a lot of money (imho) to have sitting doing nothing for 5 years (or worse to lose that capital). If you invested it in a CD at 4% interest, you’d get 10K after 5 years which is 20% of the original investment amount. 
*Disclaimer: But that’s just me with my very, very, very (did I mention very?) limited knowledge of finance and investments. I don’t like investments that take my money, choose how to spend it, don’t guarantee returns and not allow me any flexibility to move it when I see fit.

Ah, I do love a guaranteed return over time. A guaranteed return or a hedged return is why I’ve invested heavily in structured notes since leaving my day job in 2012. Here are some posts about structured notes:

I’d love a minimum guarantee e.g. 2% a year + upside. What I’ve also learned from private deals is that a lot of things are negotiable.

Sam,
Thanks for posting on this topic. The idea of crowdsourcing due diligence is brilliant! 
A few comments on the property starting with my background. 1) I have been an active Realtyshares investor for the past couple of years primarily using a solo 401k account, 2) I look at public REITs as part of my day job, 3) I have been trying to invest in CRE for the past year or so with primary focus on shopping centers in the midwest area. 
Regarding this property, I would not be in a rush to invest given that it has been sitting on Realtyshares website for more than a month – the amount they are trying to raise is not particularly high relative to previous commercial real estate deals – implies investors not particularly keen on this. I think the main reasons are a) long hold time of 5 years, b) office properties typically do poorly in a recession both from a lease as well as sale perspective vs multi family etc c) optimistic assumptions on their ability to lease existing vacancy, rent growth/year in their proforma, as well as the lease rate assumption for a vacancy which seems to be on the market for a while (see loopnet) – lease rate assumption is $25/sqft vs current market seems to be around $20, which is their most recent lease signed for similar sized space, d) relatively short duration lease with low credit quality tenants, e) you could easily end up with a flat to low single digit IRR for equity depending on the vacancy, rental growth (and not just half the IRR you are assuming in your conservative case) and even a negative IRR in a recession case.
I do like the economics in the deal which is more investor friendly – more typical for an experienced commercial team is to take 50% after the hurdle rate. 
If you want to do more due diligence, best to talk to commercial leasing agents in the area – easy to sign up for a free account and get a list from loopnet. These agents usually have the best intel on the location, the specific class of real estate as well as realistic rental and vacancy assumptions. One such example is Joe on loopnet – http://omegare.com/. Disclaimer – I do not have any relation with loopnet or with Joe. The other issue we found while looking at CRE is how the tax basis and the real estate taxes change when you buy (a lot of times this can be passed on to the tenants depending on the lease, but need info on the leases to make sure). In this case, looks the property sold for $4.7mm in 2012 and about $4mm in 2011. So the bump up in taxes is 10% from prev purchase price which is manageable. We ran into situations where the property tax would double and was not fully reimbursable and was a deal killer for us.
There is plenty of question marks on this deal for me and not a fan of suburban office space, hence my decision to move on and spend time on other deals. I do think there is a high chance of recession in the next couple of years, definitely in the next 5 years, so I am more focused on single family debt for the solo 401k (less attractive for after tax dollars as interest is taxed at marginal rate) and multi family and neighborhood shopping centers which are more service oriented – for after tax investments.
Please keep up the good work.

Hi Ravi,
Thanks for all the feedback! I can see how investing in one’s portfolio can turn into a full-time job! For example, let’s say I have $500,000 to invest, and I plan to invest in 20, $25,000 projects. To do all that due diligence would take forever. No wonder why so many people are happily willing to pay 2% management fee and invest a fund with a team of people who look at deals full time w/ hopefully more expertise. 
I think their 18% IRR target is simply just a target, and probably a marketing target. 8%-9% is what I’d realistically shoot for and expect. 
Nice find on this property being bought for $4.7M in 2012. $5.2M, four years later doesn’t seem like a huge premium. If this was SF, the $4.7M would be worth $7M now.
I do agree the in a recession, suburbs get hit hardest. Maybe we can collectively ask for MORE concessions before coming in. For example, I create a Financial Samurai Syndicate in the amount of $500,000 that gets better terms. This happens all the time in private equity deals. 
Any favorite public REITs you’d buy now given that’s your expertise?
thx,
Sam

Sam, 
Agreed on the time consuming and often times frustrating nature of evaluating deals – I have spent probably 10 hrs/week for most of this year working with couple of other partners (all of us have full time jobs and one is based in midwest who does all our local diligence) looking at hundreds of operating memos and making offers on 10 and investing in 1 deal so far. Given the time we are spending, we are making bigger commitments and looking to have 5-10 properties rather than 20 that you are looking to do. 
Regarding the price appreciation, 10% change in 4 years seems like a bargain, but as you well know, bay area laps Philly suburbs in job growth and rental growth of 10%/year vs flat to 1% growth/year in this philly sub market – I saw rents in the same $20-25/sqft for office space 4 years ago as well. Based on the other comments in this thread though, feels like this region is starting to revitalize, which would mean this opportunity might turn out better than expected.
The syndicate concept makes a lot of sense once you get some critical mass, as you do get much better terms (particularly get rid of the fees on fees as you well know).
On public REIT recommendations, I am not allowed to peddle investment advise. I do however broadly like the Tower and Self Storage REITs.
I am not sure if you have looked at RealtyMogul, given your commercial real estate focus. I have 1 investment with them and they have more CRE deals vs residential focus at RS. Unfortunately the minimums are also higher for the commercial deals, but both RS and RM have some flexibility on the minimums, particularly if you have invested in a lot of their deals (shhh.. you did not hear that from me). I have lot more exposure with RS having done 22 deals (mostly residential debt) with them so far with 10%+/year returns – which is my risk adjusted hurdle rate. It also helped that RS was local, and I met the CEO, who is a fellow Haas alum, a couple of times – having a personal relationship goes a long way to create trust in this nascent asset class. I believe you chose RS for a similar reason. I also saw that you went to Haas. Go Bears! 
Cheers,
Ravi

My focus has been the property. Ravi nailed the problems with the market, the product type and the specific financial projections.  A recession at the five year point is a good possibility.  This property could easily drop to 50 percent occupancy or less at $20.00 FSG or less (not including concessions), and sell for $3MM in five years in a recessionary environment.
Did not see the for lease info on LoopNet.  There was space available in 2014 when Google drove by.  The deal is probably more investor friendly to make up for some of the property’s shortcomings.

I live in Philadelphia and think that Conshy is one of the better burbs for a city dweller. Pretty easy to get the train there. I have a friend who works at 101 Elm Street and it takes him about 20 minutes to get there from the north side of Center City. Some businesses move there to avoid Philadelphia Wage, BIRT & NPT taxes. The 5% transaction costs / commission probably includes transfer taxes which is why it’s higher than usual.

Long-time lurker posting for the first time.  I live in Philadelphia, but commute to the suburbs for work.  I think it’s important to consider a few items, and I’ll try to point a case towards the actual city, or a different part of the suburbs. 
1.  In terms of location, there are often geographic demarcations to be aware of.  On a micro level, these could be train tracks or the highway.  In some Philadelphia neighborhoods, you don’t want to live on “that side” of the tracks, for instance.  On a broader level for metro Philadelphia, the demarcation is slightly less pronounced, but I believe it to be the Schuylkill River.  North of the river can range from working class (Norristown) to upper middle class (Plymouth Meeting, Conshohocken) and recent college grads (Manayunk).  Fine neighborhoods, no doubt, but there’s a stark contrast between those neighborhoods and the ones south of the river.  Here we’re talking about old money, the 1% and the 0.1% of the population.  This is also where many of PA’s top schools are.  One only needs to drive by Harriton, Radnor, Lower Merion, etc, to see the wealth of the area.  I recommend reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Main_Line.  
There are suburban office parks sprawled along the Main Line, which I could consider true Class A properties.  Many locations with density along Route 30 are ideal.  If you want to move further along to the west, there’s a bunch of office parks just off of 202 (Vanguard).  
I have a few comments about transportation.  Distance-wise, it’s not too far from the city, but as several folks have mentioned, I-76 is always a nightmare.  I can’t overstate this enough.  You’d think it’d only take 20 minutes from Conshohocken to the city, but that time can easily be doubled on a routine basis.  So, sure, it has easy entry to the highway, but I wouldn’t count on it actually functioning as a “highway” outside of 6-11 AM, and 3-7 PM.  This problem arises for all suburbs, though.  For public transit, SEPTA regional rail, which is the most commonly used form of public transportation to get into/out of the city, commute times are similar.  However, the Main Line has a crucial difference Conshohocken doesn’t: Amtrak, which will get you into the city almost twice as fast, at maybe $2 more in fare.  
So, in terms of location, I believe the Main Line/KOP area to be superior to Conshohocken.  
2.  Geopolitical events: I foresee the KOP area developing more rapidly than Conshohocken.  Aside from the massive KOP expansion, there’s a potential rail project in the works, which would seem to drive more foot traffic to the KOP area, through increased accessibility.  Google KOP rail for some insight there.  I don’t believe there will be an oversupply, either.         
I haven’t mentioned Center City much yet, but a huge incentive for new development is present in the form of the 10-year tax abatement (suburbs don’t have this).  The most famous beneficiary of this benefit is Comcast.  Did you know that according to my rough calculations, for the duration of time (about 7 years) that skyscraper has been built, they’ve only paid approximately 700K in property taxes (or on average, 100K a year)?  Now ask yourself – if you’re a business, why would you locate in the suburbs (at all), if you can enjoy this massive tax benefit in the city?  While there’s no way to empirically prove it, anecdotally this has contributed to a boom in both residential and commercial construction.  The most recent commercial corridor to take off has been the University City district, spurred by Penn Medicine’s expansions.  When you’re in that area, you literally feel like you’re a different city, that’s 20 years more modern.

Excellent points. Seems like traffic is becoming a nightmare EVERYWHERE in the country. This demonstrates robust demographic growth outpacing public transportation growth. Traffic also shows a backstop for demand for housing and office space overall theoretically. Every time I sit in SF Bay Area traffic, to make myself feel better, I tell myself this must be good for company profits, which is good for company stock prices, which is good for landlords to raise rents, which is good for assets owners who will see their assets inflate.
If I didn’t focus on the positives of traffic, I might very well move to Montana, a beautiful place. I did the next logical thing was to move several miles west of city center to enjoy more peace and quiet since I no longer have a commute. 
I do wonder about the structural demand for office space w/ more co-working space and more telecommuting. But it seems like the economy is so strong right now that the leakage is not enough to counteract the wave of new workers.

I am active with RS and a few of the other portals.  I saw this one and passed.  Biggest reason is i am not too high on office buildings in general because of long term demographic trends of much less actual space per employee due to telecommuting etc.
i am familiar with philly and suburbs and I do agree with the poster who wondered how strong the office building market really is in the speciifc locale that this building is in.  Its not KoP nor is it center city which are reakky the more eatablished markets

Long time reader here who also loves real estate as an asset class. The amount of feedback and local knowledge your post has generated is very impressive and really speaks to the value of your reader base. I work in commercial real estate for a living and would vote no on this opportunity for the following reasons… 
I think the target IRR is over inflated and the lack of sponsor equity in the deal scares me off. When you don’t know the market and are not able to complete the DD yourself my two requirements on a crowd funded real estate deal would be proven track record and market knowledge from the sponsor (seems to be true) and significant co-investment from sponsor which is not the case here. 
Below are my Pros and Cons on the deal. 
Pros 
1)	Below Replacement Cost – at $172 PSF this property would be purchased below replacement cost which somewhat shelters this investment from new development. Any new development would likely have a much higher cost basis and therefore would require higher rents for the deal to make sense and would maintain a higher yield if market rental rates were to drop.
2)	Below Market Rent – Possible for cash flow growth by rolling expiries to market. The question here is what is market rent? I would want to see what recent new deals were done at and what inducements were made. $5 PSF might be a low assumption for renewals.
3)	Opportunity for increased occupancy – buying this property with 30% vacancy allows for additional upside through lease up
Cons
1)	Lack of Sponsor Investment – Very little equity from the GP with 39% of their equity coming from the Acquisition Fee. Even with the favourable hurdle rate the sponsor has very little to lose if this deal doesn’t work out.
2)	Short Average Lease Term – with only 2.9 years of average term there is lots of lease turn over within the hold period which could lead to additional vacancy. Without being able to walk the building, talk to tenants, and understand the competitive properties this seems like a major risk to the cash flow due to the potential for increased vacancy and/or leasing costs.
3)	Inflated Exit – Exit at $241 PSF seems somewhat high. Even if the property is 100% occupied the next investor would likely include a general vacancy allowance. Also when the property is sold in 5 years it will be 20 Years old and likely reaching an age that requires significant re-investment that the next buyer will likely include in their valuation.

This is just a general comment, but it may be worth it.  I don’t necessarily see the need for crowdsourcing knowledge about purchasing a very small amount of an institutional-quality real estate asset (other than helping the people reading the blog post and helping the egos of the people posting – possibly me?).  That’s  similar to engaging in a very long and detailed conversation about putting $10k into bonds.  You’re probably not gonna make a ton of money or lose a ton of money.  The ROI on your time to discuss the issue is nill.  At best, maybe you increase your portfolio percentage by 1/8 of a percent?  The worse part is the underwriting (essentially seeing if the Class A property is a good investment) is exponentially longer and more complex.  Notice the “CFA” designation behind the co-founder’s name?  They most certainly used Argus software and inserted their assumptions that take most people years of experience to truly understand.  In addition, they probably have someone that knows the local market very well and has pulled all the demographics, construction starts, lease expirations of office tenants in competing buildings, and trends in the local office market (absorption, vacancy rates, etc).  I think the crowdsourcing of knowledge would be better served for the company purchasing the asset as some kind of way to find out some inside knowledge about how to either add value to the project or notify them of a potential downfall.  Crowdsourcing knowledge for the guy investing a small amount seems hard for me to see value.
However, the reason I read this blog post is because I work in commercial real estate and I thought you’d be crowdsourcing knowledge on smaller private placements or syndications from smaller investors.  I think that’s a very interesting idea.  I’ve seen limited partners in syndications make 25% – 30% on consecutive deals and the sponsor / general partner making over 100%.  I was also in the industry during the downturn and had an incredibly wealthy client with three shopping centers anchored by Circuit City.  First time I’ve seen a grown man weep after losing nearly everything.  (FYI that’s also when I learned the importance of what’s called a co-tenancy clause held by nearly every co-anchor like Office Depot in Neighborhood and Regional Centers.  Once the anchor goes dark, the co-anchor’s rent goes way down…bad news).  So it’s not a boy’s game, but with the crowdsourcing of knowledge and finding an investor group with a relatively small minimum investment and good track record, the idea seems to make more sense.  In my opinion, that’s a group that focuses on 20+ unit multifamily or 15,000sf+ retail / commercial.  Groups that deal with smaller properties may have good track records but the lack of understanding macro-economic signs that the tide is turning (of course I’m speaking in generalities here).  The guys that deal with Class A properties have mostly had a job their entire life.  They’re probably the most intellectual guys in the room, but they’ll be the first to admit their primary goal is never to hit a home run, but to instead hit a single every time (which is great if that’s your goal!).  This is a relatively small Class A asset, but judging by the amount owned by this group, they most certainly follow the same low-risk strategy of the big boys like Equity Office and Transwestern.
On a totally unrelated note, if you’re just looking for consistent returns and not so much worried about asset appreciation or tax-shielding the income, I think the best investments that provide excellent returns commensurate with the risk are notes secured by real estate.  I happen to solely invest in these inside my IRA (two notes) and Roth IRA (one note) so the tax issue is still avoided/delayed for me, but it’s amazingly simple to find notes that pay 10%-12% with strong borrowers at ridiculously low LTV’s like 50%-60% and some even lower.  Think about the last downturn and how much property values went down.  Maybe some areas depreciated more than 40%, but not many, and if they did, most have recovered fairly quickly.  So if the borrower doesn’t pay you, you take the property, and if it happens to be in the next worse downturn, maybe you have a property at exactly the current market value?  Well, at least you can say you bought it at the bottom of the market ;-)   I just think that’s the best risk/return for someone looking for consistent income.  The biggest risk in notes (and only way I could see losing money on my investment other than outright fraud) is being sued by the borrower so I stay away from owner-occupied properties and hire a professional loan servicer.  My opinion is younger investors should buy real estate for the capital appreciation & tax benefits and slowly build up a portfolio of notes (possibly inside tax protected vehicles) as they’re older so their cash flow is great for retirement.  But hey, I’m an RE guy.  I own no stocks or bonds.  
The Financial Samurai is the annointed one with a more diverse and well-rounded (and many times extremely creative) understanding of how to compare two different asset classes.  So take my comment with a grain of salt.
Sorry in advance if I was off topic or offended anyone here.  Much longer response than I intended…

Hi Todd,
Thanks for sharing some ideas. I just love to learn, and get as thorough as possible before investing larger sums of money. I’ve started with $10,000, and plan to invest another $250,000 over the next 12 months. I like this space, like how they are forced to offer higher returns as rates have gone higher, and am a big fan of real estate in general. I just don’t want to buy another physical property anymore at my age and current portfolio.
I’m tired and want to simplify life!
Happy Holidays!
Sam

Todd,
What sources do you use to find notes paying 10-12% w/ LTV’s of 50%?  All the crowdfunding notes don’t come close to that, unless you look at LTV for the value of a “to be finished” flip which is not really the same thing.

Hey Dave, with all due respect to Sam, I’d rather not change the direction of his posting, but I see them almost every day.  I live in CA and I never calculate LTV as ARV…always current value.  Not sure about other states.  The best notes I find are phone calls from relationships with hard money lenders and a few guys who run funds that find something outside their scope, but there’s a very large lender out here that sends nearly a deal every day.  If Sam’s OK with it, I’m happy to share the URL or maybe he can relay it to you.
One comment on the subject.  I think crowdfunding for commercial real estate deals is a great idea.  Those deals need enough money where the crowdfunding is solving a true problem so RE professionals see the value in it and enter that market…win-win.  Even with P2P, I see the value of crowdfunding simply based on pure volume of people that want consumer debt (unfortunately).  But with notes, I live in SoCal and constantly see notes as low as $100k – $200k.  (BTW I think $100k is the minimum total note size to invest into considering the fixed costs of a trustee sale.  Anything less and the fixed costs eat up the protected equity too quickly if it goes badly…in CA at least).  If you don’t have or want to invest that much, it’s much better to find someone to split it with and know what you’re getting into, with the property, borrower and servicer.  Look at this just from the worst-case risk standpoint:  With CRE, the sponsor will own/control it unless the lender takes it and you lose everything.  With P2P, you’ll get paid until you don’t…no collateral.  But with notes, I think about downside as upside in many cases.  I don’t loan to own, but I certainly don’t mind that scenario and I always underwrite that case before investing.  So if it’s crowdfunding for notes, I’m assuming you’d be trusting the operation of a distressed asset (people don’t lose well-run properties to the lender) in the hands of a lender or a receiver, either of which will likely eat up that last little bit of upside through inefficiencies (lender) or exorbitant fees (receiver).  You can do better yourself and if you have another beneficiary (partner) with you in the note, make sure you have an operating agreement outlining who’s in charge of making the decisions during servicing, default and after taking the asset back.
It all circles back to my belief that younger investors should focus on RE for appreciation and tax benefits, which will give them the experience to handle the notes if they go bad when they’re investing for cash flow later in life.  And if they’re reading Financial Samurai the entire time, they’ll be ninjas with swords of cash.
