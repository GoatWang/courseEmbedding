KEELEY Funds - Our Story
 
Keeley-Teton Advisors, LLC was formed in late 2016 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Teton Advisors, Inc. and served as an acquisition vehicle for the purchase of the asset management business of Keeley Asset Management Corp., a pioneer in small and mid-cap value investing founded by John L. Keeley, Jr. in 1982.  Although Keeley-Teton was a new registrant with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2017, the investment philosophy, staffing, and Chicago location will remain consistent with that of Keeley Asset Management Corp., is now a wholly-owned subsidiary. The creation of Keeley-Teton Advisors, LLC and the resulting combination with Teton Advisors, Inc. has created a transformational combination of two well-established, active asset managers. As of February 28, 2017, the combined firms had $3.8 billion in assets under management (AUM). The complementary investment teams at Teton and Keeley will seek to leverage the resources of both firms to the benefit of fund shareholders, clients and stakeholders. The investment teams at Teton and Keeley-Teton will focus their research coverage across an expanded product suite, including 12 mutual funds (the TETON Westwood Funds and the Keeley Funds) and seven separate account strategies. 
Keeley-Teton seeks to uncover the inefficiently priced stocks of excellent companies through fundamental research. As active investors, we focus on exploiting short-term market distortions to generate long-term alpha.  Its product offerings consist of two distinct, complementary investment strategies - a restructuring strategy and a dividend strategy. The restructuring strategy focuses on companies undergoing major corporate change, which often involves events that act as catalysts and direct our research team toward attractive opportunities. These types of events often share a common thread in that they create market inefficiencies where, for a period of time, there is little-to-no Wall Street research or sponsorship. We believe it is precisely these inefficiencies that offer us a notable edge and allow our team to invest below our fair market value assessment. Specifically, the Keeley Small Cap Value, Small-Mid Cap Value, and All Cap Value strategies represent the restructuring product offerings.
To complement this strategy, Keeley-Teton also offers a dividend product to help investors who seek to minimize the volatility typically associated with small- and mid-cap stocks. In 2009 and 2011, we launched the Keeley Small Cap Dividend Value Fund and Mid Cap Dividend Value Fund, respectively, to focus our bottom-up research efforts on a unique universe of dividend-paying stocks. With this approach, investors access small- and mid-cap dividend paying stocks, which seek to minimize the volatility typically associated with these company sizes. In challenging investment environments, we believe the quality of our dividend-focused portfolios, coupled with our attention to valuation, offers downside market protection and capital preservation.
As an investment boutique, our investment professionals share in the belief that being different is fundamental to discovering hidden value in equities. Our dedicated team is committed to serving clients. From modest beginnings over 40 years ago, to today, The Disciplined Discovery of Value™ shapes the cornerstone for our clients' long-term success.
Dedicated Value Investors for Over Three Decades

Keeley Asset Management Corp. enters into agreement to transfer Ownership to TA Associates with Key Employee Participation

		  Appoints Brien O'Brien as Executive Chairman

						 from   Keeley Asset Management Corp. 











 
















































 

 




















 


CHICAGO, Aug. 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Keeley Asset Management Corp. ("KAMCO") is pleased to announce that today it entered into a definitive agreement for the transfer of the voting shares of its parent company, Joley Corp. ("Joley"), to TA Associates ("TA").  In addition to TA's ownership, certain KAMCO employees will be participating with TA as non-controlling equity owners. The transfer is subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed in September 2015.  
In July 2008, KAMCO completed a minority leveraged recapitalization with TA, a leading global growth private equity firm with a strong track record of successful investments in the asset management industry.
"We were excited in 2008 to engage TA's proven asset management industry expertise and experience," said Kevin Keeley, who was recently named President of KAMCO upon the death of his father and founder of the firm, John L. Keeley, Jr. "The transfer of ownership to TA, which includes non-controlling equity interests going to our key employees, will complete our transition from sole ownership by the Keeley family."  Mr. Keeley will remain President of KAMCO after the close of the transaction.  
KAMCO also announced that Brien O'Brien, the former Head of Asset Management at Piper Jaffray and Chairman, CEO and Co-Founder of former TA portfolio company Advisory Research, Inc., will be assuming the role of Executive Chairman of Joley and KAMCO effective as of the closing of the transfer to TA. Mr. O'Brien's industry expertise and leadership will solidify KAMCO's efforts to further the firm's long and successful history as a boutique asset management firm. 
"I have great respect for TA and their ability to bring the best out of the firms in which they invest," said Mr. O'Brien. "While at Advisory Research, I had first-hand experience with TA's deep commitment to working cooperatively with its portfolio companies, while driving management to perform to their fullest." 
"As long-time investors in KAMCO, we are very familiar with the firm's investment process and have strong relationships with its employees," said Roger Kafker, a Managing Director at TA Associates and current member of the Board of Directors of KAMCO's parent company. "We have great respect for Brien, with whom we have worked successfully for many years, and feel that he is a proven leader in the industry. We look forward to continuing our active involvement with KAMCO, Brien and the employees to ensure that KAMCO continues to strive to be a premier investment boutique." 
"We welcome the additional resources, oversight and expertise that TA's ownership brings to KAMCO," said Kevin Chin, the Chief Investment Officer of KAMCO. "As we move ahead, we will adhere to our firm's long-held investment philosophy and value-oriented approach of helping our clients find opportunity in increasingly efficient equity markets."

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Emerging Markets at the Crossroads
A radical shift in the forces shaping emerging market (EM) growth will require investors to take a different investment approach from what may have worked in the past. Increasingly, discovering EM investment opportunities will be rooted in the ability to capture the alpha from the new growth drivers, rather than in chasing the beta of the broad EM universe.
