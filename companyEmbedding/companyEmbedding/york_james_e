James E. York.
 

 


A HISTORY OF LONG ISLAND VOL III, by Peter Ross, LL. D., The Lewis Publishing Company, New York, NY. 1902.  Page 136, JAMES E. YORK. 







James E York is acknowledge to be one of the best informed men in all branches of iron and steel manufacturing, with its many ramifications, having taken an active part in its development in this country from its infancy. He is thoroughly conversant with its various phases and potentialities . 







Born in England, February 3, 1846, at Wednesbury, South Staffordshire, Mr. York served his apprenticeship at this business in the only way in wich a complete and accurate mastery of details can be acquired-by actual manipulation and hard work in a steel works. After twelve years spent at the works of the Patent Shaft and Axletree Company, Mr. York sought, like so many have done, a wider scope for his talents, and came to this country at a time when as yet its immense manufacturing developments were only in their very inception. He obtained a position at Troy in connection with one of the earliest Bessemer steel plants erected in the United States, and carried out projects and improvements there that surprised much older heads than his own. His next position was at Akron, Ohio where he had charge of the finishing department of the Akron Iron Company, and then of the finishing department of Swift's Iron & Steel Works at Newport, Kentucky. During this period he introduced patented improvements in the iron and steel business of great value and wich are now in general use. The Burgess Iron & Steel Works at Portsmouth, Ohio, next claimed his attention, and as it's manager he succeeded in putting it into a flourishing condition, although at the time he took matters in hand it was almost looked upon as a "forlorn hope." These works were for twenty years in the hands of the York family, until they were finally merged into the Crucible Steel Company of America. The next work that engaged his energies was the rebuilding of the New York & Ohio Works at Ironton, Ohio and he subsequently became the manager of the Birmingham Rolling Mill at Burmingham, Alabama Mr. York afterward organized the works of the York Iron Company At Black River Falls, Wisconsin, and when this plant had been put into successful operation he proceeded, at the request of the citizens of Ashland, that state, to form the Ashland Iron & Steel Company, and built the phenomenal furnace there wich up to the present time is the largest and most successful charcoal blast furnace in the world.  







During these years Mr. York frequently spoke in public on important phases of the iron and steel industry and on the suitability of locations at the head of Lake Sperior, and he may be regarded as the pioneer of the movemet to establish steel works and blast furnaces at that point. He was known as the " The Iron Giant " on account of the largeness of the plans he promoted to further the iron and steel business and the gigantic possibilities he thereby opened up for that part of the country. The citizens of Duluth enlisted his aid in the development of buisiness in their town. Living there and fully recognizing the importance of the immense iron ore deposits in that neighborhood, he organized the Ironton Structural Steel Company and built works under the York patents for the manufacture of structural steel. These patents have since been adopted in Germany and a large manufactory erected there. At the present time Mr. York is interested chiefly in utilizing his scientific and practical knowledge to introduce patented methods by wich steel can be brought into more general and at the same time more economic use. 







Kindness, amiability and courtesy not only characterize his social relations, but are a marked feature of his in his business life, and the humble employee never sees a trace of the overbearing taskmaster in him. That the relations have always been of the pleasantest character is indicated by the fact that there has never been a strike in any of his mills. He believes in paying good wages and his employes know that faithful service will mean for them a good financial return, and will bring promotion as opportunity occours.  







Mr. York was married January 22 1874 in Portsmouth, Ohio, to Miss Mary Elizabeth McConnell, a daughter of Samuel Mcconnell, of that place, and they have one child, Howard P. Mr. York attends St Paul's Episcopal church, Flatbush, and makes his home at No. 1811 Albemarle Road, Flatbush. He belongs to the Midwood Club, the Engineers Club, the Iron and Steel Institute of London. England, and also the American Institute of Mining Engineers, New York. 







To the subject of this review there has come the attainment of a distinguished position in connection with the great material industries and financial institutions of our nation, and his efforts have been so discerningly directed along well defined lines that he seems to have realized at any one point of progress the full measure of of his possibilites for accomplishmentat that point. A man of distinctive and forceful individuality, of broad mentality and most mature judgment, he has left and is leaving his impress upon the industrial world, while his study of economic questions and matters of public policy has been so close, practical and comprehensive that his judgement is relied upon and his utterancees have weight in those circles where the material progress of the nation is centered.

Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

4.4/5.0










*Attorneys who only have peer reviews prior to April 15, 2008 are not displayed.









Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

I met with Mr. Sak this week regarding my financial situation as I sell a property. He was quite thorough and answered all of my questions. I have no doubt I will be satisfied in working with Mr. Sak, as I am going to retain his services when the time comes.{para}Once I've had additional interactions with Mr. Sak and his staff, I will adjust my ratings (if necessary) at that time. For now, I am quite pleased.

Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

Manhattan Storage Warehouse, New York, NY James E. Ware, architect(s). From the American Architect and Building News, November 27, 1886. 8.75 by 13.25 inches. VG+ condition with browning around the edges and light crinkling. Gelatine Print. This picture is extremely hard to find. The American Architect and Building News had a very small circulation during this time and these original gelatine prints only appeared in a very limited number of issues that were distributed to a few prominent architects. This is from the architect Bruce Price's collection. It measures 8.75 by 13.25 inches. Has a mat border and foam core backing (not attached to the picture). The whole picture measures 14.25 by 11.75 inches (with border). Extraordinary detail in this early photographic print. Shrink wrapped.

Highlights, News & Knowledge

 

James E. Kellett is a senior partner in Crowell & Moring's  Litigation & Trial Department and the Labor & Employment Practice  Group, resident in the New York office. Jim is a trial lawyer with 25  years of experience and has litigated employment and commercial cases in  federal and state courts across the country. Jim's focus has been on  representation of management in discrimination and other employment matters,  including enforcement of non-competition agreements, theft of trade secrets,  and similar claims related to disputes over intellectual property. These  matters include representing clients at administrative hearings and bench and  jury trials. 
Jim's practice also  includes counseling employers regarding employee disciplinary matters, business  strategies such as layoffs or reorganizations, and any issues implicating  federal, state or local employment laws. Jim also assists clients in developing  and implementing personnel policies and in complying with a myriad of  employment laws including, but not limited to, those relating to wage and hour  matters, family and medical leave, drug testing, disability, sexual harassment,  and discrimination generally. His assistance to clients includes conducting seminars  for managers and supervisors related to a wide variety of issues in which  everyday management and human resources activities intersect with statutory and  common law requirements. 
Jim is actively involved in  alternative dispute resolution and currently serves on the mediation panels for  the District Court for the Southern District of New York and the New York State  Supreme Court, Commercial Division, New York County. Jim is also an author  for Practitioner Insights, a Thomson Reuters offering on the WestlawNext legal  research platform.
Jim has served as counsel  to numerous national corporations in a variety of industries, including The  Clearing House, Brink's, Incorporated, GBG USA, BAX Global, Sbarro, Inc., TNT  USA Inc., and ARCADIS US Inc.
Jim is also actively  involved in pro bono matters, handling cases individually and supervising teams  on large projects. Jim is a member of the Firm's Public Service Practice Group,  and his pro bono activities have been recognized by the designation of New York  State Empire Counsel for the last six years.
Recent matters include:

Successfully litigated a petition for temporary injunction in Pennsylvania state court in which the court granted the petition in its entirety, and enforced the client company’s non-compete agreement. The resulting Order barred the former employee from a broad range of competitive employment activities.
                                
Achieved dismissal for a national corporation on summary judgment in Florida federal court in employment discrimination suit alleging race and same-sex sexual harassment, and seeking 10 million dollars in damages.  The District Court's dismissal was upheld on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.
                                
Defended national retailer in federal court in breach of contract action by foreign corporation; achieved favorable ruling of lack of personal jurisdiction. 
Achieved dismissal on summary judgment in state court of employment discrimination case seeking 10 million dollars in damages against national armored car carrier. An appeal of this dismissal was made to the Supreme Court of the State of New York Appellate Division: Second Judicial Department, which recently affirmed the lower court’s decision and upheld the dismissal of this case.
