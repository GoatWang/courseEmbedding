What our customers say





























World Auto
Group


Our vision is to be ‘The World’s Greatest Car Dealership’ it’s in our stores and it’s how we answer our phones.  CloudOne helps us reach that goal by allowing us to achieve the high level of customer data quality that supports our strategic initiatives.
 
-Sheri Sevik - General Manager, World Auto Group, Matteson, IL







"We've had phenomenal success with these campaigns. Each one generates stronger and stronger results. We've adjusted our advertising spend and are now diverting more resources into this program to position ourselves as the premier digital dealer in the San Diego market."
 
- Chris George - General Manager, Team Kia El Cajon, El Cajon, CA







"In a very competitive digital market I was extremely impressed by the amount of unique traffic this program directed to our website. It was the number 1 source of traffic to our site during the campaign, generating over 5,100 unique visitors in just 6 weeks."
 
- Brad Preble - General Manager, Carr Chevrolet, Beaverton, OR







"Not only was I impressed that they exceeded their guarantee by a significant amount- this program also generated 216 brand new customers for our service bays, and service revenue of over $53,000. That's gross revenue over 5 times the total cost of the program from new service business alone."
 
 - Michael Davidson - Dealer-Principal, Rockland Hyundai, Nanuet, NY
 







"I've never seen an email marketing program consistently generate a 10% open rate. Our first campaign had over 30,000 people in our market that we've never done business with open our ad. These folks have the strongest database I've ever encountered. Our unique traffic to the website and showroom ups have been off the charts."
 
 - Kamal Chaer - General Sales Manager, Dick Hannah Subaru, Vancouver, WA
 







"I loved the transparency and accountability from their ROI report. It's hard to track the results we get from our TV and radio advertising, and it's refreshing to be able to show our ad dollars working for us with this email program."
 
 - Bob Hook, III - General Manager, Bob Hook Chevrolet, Louisville, KY

What Our Customers Say




Sheri Sevik General Manager, World Auto Group, Matteson, IL
"Our vision is to be 'The World's Greatest Car Dealership' it's in our stores and it's how we answer our phones. CloudOne helps us reach that goal by allowing us to achieve the high level of customer data quality that supports our strategic initiatives."





Chris George General Manager, Team Kia El Cajon, El Cajon, CA
"We've had phenomenal success with these campaigns. Each one generates stronger and stronger results. We've adjusted our advertising spend and are now diverting more resources into this program to position ourselves as the premier digital dealer in the San Diego market."





Brad Preble General Manager, Carr Chevrolet, Beaverton, OR
"In a very competitive digital market I was extremely impressed by the amount of unique traffic this program directed to our website. It was the number 1 source of traffic to our site during the campaign, generating over 5,100 unique visitors in just 6 weeks."





Michael Davidson Dealer-Principal, Rockland Hyundai, Nanuet, NY
"Not only was I impressed that they exceeded their guarantee by a significant amount- this program also generated 216 brand new customers for our service bays, and service revenue of over $53,000. That's gross revenue over 5 times the total cost of the program from new service business alone."





Kamal Chaer Dick Hannah Subaru, Vancouver, WA
"I've never seen an email marketing program consistently generate a 10% open rate. Our first campaign had over 30,000 people in our market that we've never done business with open our ad. These folks have the strongest database I've ever encountered. Our unique traffic to the website and showroom ups have been off the charts."





Bob Hook, III General Manager, Bob Hook Chevrolet, Louisville, KY
I loved the transparency and accountability from their ROI report. It's hard to track the results we get from our TV and radio advertising, and it's refreshing to be able to show our ad dollars working for us with this email program.
