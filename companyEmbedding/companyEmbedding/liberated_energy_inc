New England Guard Lite, LLC has assured us that they are ready to process additional orders now that product deliverability and functionality has been proven.2. Liberated Energy has signed a Letter of Intent to acquire Eastern Energy Services, Inc. Currently; Eastern serves as the manufacturer of Liberated Energy's Guard Lite product. By bringing Eastern Energy into the company it gives Liberated control over production and costs. The goal is for Eastern Energy to continue operations of their twenty year old company under their brand, providing expanding revenue and product offerings for Liberated Energy. Eastern CEO Fred Hauber would stay on as an employee in charge of operations and production. We are in the final contract and auditing stage now, and based on the past 5-6 years of Eastern revenue, we see the potential value of this acquisition being between 2 to 5 million dollars per year for Liberated.3. Liberated Energy has signed a Letter of Intent to acquire The Outage Expert. This company specializes in significantly reducing costs and increasing performance of energy management. From managing power to over 12,000 units in Parkchester, NY to bringing efficiency to businesses such as Lockheed Martin, Con Edison and Cushman & Wakefield, they add a high level of expertise and exposure for Liberated Energy's products. We have just begun negotiations and see the potential initial value of the acquisition at 1 million dollars per year for Liberated.4. Liberated is in talks with various investment banking firms including LG Capital to help settle remaining debt on the company's balance sheet, to establish a non-dilutive line of credit to cover the high yield operations of Eastern Energy and to build up an inventory of Guard Lites. LG Capital has recently purchased Eastmore Capital, LLC's convertible note as a sign of good intentions to help alleviate pressure on our market. In addition, we also hope to have KBM Worldwide's note retired in the next several days (balance $10,000).5. Liberated Energy, through their new advertising agency Voiceflix, has launched Twitter and Facebook pages for the purpose of providing shareholders a faster and more frequent source for company news and updates. They are open to the public and can be found at:https://twitter.com/LIBEnergyhttps://facebook.com/liberatedenergyAbout Liberated Energy, Inc.Liberated Energy, Inc. is a growing alternative energy company seeking to reduce the purging of our planet's resources by bringing patentable and, more importantly, affordable ideas to the marketplace.Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements:This press release may contain forward-looking information.

(OTC PINK: LIBE) is pleased to announce today that it has finalized the contract to acquire EcoCab Portland, LLC. The company has also paid out two hundred and eleven thousand dollars to settle debts and liabilities over the past week. Liberated has secured a more conventional credit facility to fund its future operations based o...n its new revenues with EcoCab. EcoCab is the nation’s first employee-only zero emission taxi company using luxury Teslas in Portland Oregon. This is a modern, clean energy company that is strategically positioned between taxi and town car for a new era of customer expectation. In the vein of Uber, Lyft, Gett, EcoCab utilizes a mobile smart phone application for on-demand service. Unlike the others, they specialize in non-emergency medical transportation. Founded in July of 2015, EcoCab’ s employee base has increased from 12 to over 70 + employees and operates a fleet of 32 vehicles with 13 more on order. With a focus on the medical transportation industry, it has quickly become the partner of choice for many national medical organizations for the city of Portland alone.  “The company’s revenues have grown exponentially per month in its first year, “stated Ron Knori, CEO of EcoCab. “We are currently in discussions to launch the EcoCab brand across the United States, utilizing our luxury electric zero emission vehicles with drivers delivering 5-Star hospitality experiences while also reinventing the medical transportation model to provide transportation to millions of seniors and retiring baby boomers who require caring respectful transportation.” Continued Mr. Knori. “We are very excited to bring in such a fast growing and innovated company to Liberated,” said Brian Conway, CEO. “it’s incredibly relevant in today’s market and goes along with our focus of reducing the carbon footprint on our planet. It’s a simple model, more cars equal more revenue, more cities” The acquisition is complete upon immediate financing for additional vehicles. 展开Liberated Energy, Inc., Stock Symbol: LIBE · 2016年5月13日 · http://www.solar-masters.com/Solar MasterSolar MasterSolar MasterSolar MasterSolar Master点击 SOLAR-MASTERS.COM 查看更多内容Liberated Energy, Inc., Stock Symbol: LIBE · 2016年1月29日 · Update -  LIBERATED ENERGY, INC.

Once complete, I'm looking to move more towards being a business development company. The Guard Lite will continue to operate as a division, along side others - agriculture, food & beverage, trucking, etc. I will announce each of these companies ONLY after the deals are complete, not before. I have never held interest in letters of intent PR's. The go...od news is I'm in the final stages of two of them that I look forward to sharing. I'll be in Boston Monday until Weds completing one of them (and I'll stop by Marina Bay to grab some pics).  I'm working right now on repaying the last note holders (Carbourn and LG who are partners) their initial loans and offering straight equity on the balances, in hopes they agree to be affiliates and end the dilution before the above can take place. Idea is the value of the above deals will far out way conversions.

Liberated Energy, Inc. has announceed the Guard-Lite, a revolutionary hybrid lighting and security system. Its unique self-powered design enables it to be installed at any location without wiring or an electrical permit. With an increasing need for security and the demand for alternative energy growing, the Guard Lite provides a complete solution..
Many ranchers, farmers and ag retailers would like to know who is at a security gate, barn, warehouse or other facility without having to meet them face-to-face or simply need to address how to maintain security at these locations from 10 miles to thousands of miles away.
The Guard Lite from Liberated Energy, Inc provides solar and wind powered wireless security camera and lighting systems that are both a license plate camera and motion activated camera system combined. Property owners and businesses can maintain security on their remote properties by installing the Guard Lite wireless outdoor security cameras in areas where a "picture" would provide vital information for the owners to proceed with their daily activities.
These pictures acquired by the wireless outdoor security cameras can be instantly pushed to any mobile phone as an SMS alert or stored on cloud-based servers for future review. The web-based user interface that is available in a mobile phone app, is the software that controls the solar and wind powered cellular security camera for picture acquisition methods, capturing a LIVE image, time-lapse video and many more helpful features.
Many ranches have feeding and water stations that require a long drive to get to in order to verify food and water volume for the animals. The Guard Lite solar and wind powered outdoor surveillance camera, will provide a live image upon request at these locations and deliver them to any mobile phone and e-mail them instantly. This remote security camera technology is making the rancher more efficient in how they operate and increasing their profit margins.
Some farmers simply have crops too far away to visit all the time and observe if it is time to take action with farm machinery or just check on overall growth. The outdoor wireless security camera makes these unnecessary trips a thing of the past while documenting crop growth for future comparison and knowledge.
This motion activated camera with night vision technology and lighting is a great product that businesses can use especially in the night hours. If an unexpected visitor enters the property, the owner or employee will receive an instant SMS alert on a cell phone once motion is detected. The Guard Lite provides rural and ranch locations modern technology in a not so modern environment.
Solar and wind wireless security camera and lighting systems by Liberated Energy are changing the way rural businesses can establish security.
