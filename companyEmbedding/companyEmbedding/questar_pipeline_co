Its FERC code is 55.[1] Questar Pipeline is a subsidiary of Questar Corporation. Questar Corporation was acquired in 2016 by Dominion Energy.
Background[edit]
Questar Pipeline Company is an interstate natural gas pipeline company that provides transportation and underground storage services in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado. Questar Pipeline owns and operates slightly more than 2,500 miles of pipeline with total daily capacity of 2,530 million decatherms (mdth). Questar Pipeline’s system is in the Rocky Mountains, near large reserves of natural gas in six major producing areas, including the Greater Green River, Uinta and Piceance basins.
Questar Pipeline transports gas from these areas to other major pipeline systems for delivery to markets in the West and Midwest including the Questar Gas local distribution system serving natural gas utility customers in Utah, southwest Wyoming and southern Idaho.
Through wholly owned subsidiaries, Questar Pipeline also owns and operates the Overthrust Pipeline in southwestern Wyoming and the eastern segment of Southern Trails Pipeline, extending 488 miles from the Blanco Hub to just inside the California state line. Questar Pipeline owns 50% of the White River Hub in western Colorado. These facilities connect with six interstate pipeline systems and a major processing plant near Meeker, Colorado.
Questar Pipeline owns and operates the Clay Basin storage facility. Located on the Wyoming-Utah border, Clay Basin is the largest underground storage reservoir in the Rocky Mountains Region.

            Gross: Cable guy fixes plugs, then plugs toilet
          













It's frustrating when a contractor comes to fix something in your house, and then breaks something else, or leaves a mess behind.
But one Northern Kentucky man is dealing with an even nastier issue: a contractor who left a real mess in his toilet.

            L'appel du vide
          






L'appel du vide, literally "the call of the void", is a French phrase used to refer to intrusive thoughts , or the urge to engage in destructive behaviors during everyday life. [1] Examples include thinking about swerving in to the opposite lane while driving, or feeling the urge to jump off a cliff edge while standing on it.
