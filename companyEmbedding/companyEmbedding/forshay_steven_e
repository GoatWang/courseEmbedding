 Career History



Senior Vice President, Advanced Technology Group

                                    1982 - Current                


Dolby Laboratories Inc.


                  Since the 1960s, Dolby Laboratories has been a leader in audio innovation. Beginning with Dolby® noise reduction, a form of audio compression and expansion that reduces background hiss in tape recording, Dolby Laboratories has developed many groundbreaking technologies, advancing the science of audio reproduction.

Early on, Dolby decided that the company would manufacture professional audio products only, and license technologies that were appropriate for consumer applications. Since then, many Dolby innovations have set the bar for entertainment technology in both the professional and consumer markets.

From the cinema to your living room, Dolby has transformed the entertainment experience. Today, Dolby technologies can be found in cinemas, professional recording studios, video games, laser discs, DVDs, mobile media, digital broadcast TV, digital cable, and satellite systems
