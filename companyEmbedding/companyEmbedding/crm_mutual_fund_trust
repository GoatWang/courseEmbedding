1 The net expense ratio for the CRM Mid Cap Value Fund is the ratio listed in the CRM Funds Prospectus, dated October 28, 2016. This figure will fluctuate over time.

 



Summary
CRM Mid Cap Value Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation. The CRM Mid Cap Value Fund, under normal circumstances, invests at least 80% of its assets in a diversified portfolio of equity and equity related securities of companies with market capitalizations at the time of initial purchase similar to those in the Russell Midcap Value Index (“mid cap companies”) that are publicly traded on a U.S. securities market.
The market capitalization range of the Russell Midcap Value Index changes constantly, and as a result, the capitalization of mid cap companies in which the Mid Cap Value Fund will invest will also change. As of December 31, 2016, the market capitalization range of the Russell Midcap Value Index was from approximately $643 million to $39 billion.
Supported by an experienced team of investment professionals, the portfolio managers make judgments about the relative attractiveness of various securities in selecting stocks for the Mid Cap Value Mutual Fund. This Fund typically will be invested in 40 to 55 stocks. Although the Fund is built from the bottom up, stock-specific risks, sector weightings and risk/reward characteristics are all taken into account in the portfolio construction process.

CRM Mid Cap Value Fund Fact Sheet 1Q 2017 Summary Prospectus 1Q 2017 Market Commentary 

 

Shares of CRM Funds are distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc.
Cramer Rosenthal McGlynn, LLC is the investment advisor to the CRM Funds and is not affiliated with ALPS.
Principal investment risks: The Fund invests in value stocks which can perform differently from the market on whole and may continue to be undervalued for long periods of time. Compared to mutual funds that focus exclusively on large capitalization companies, shares of the Fund may be more volatile because they invest in mid capitalization companies. Mid capitalization companies are likely to have more limited product lines, fewer capital resources and less depth of management than larger companies.
The Funds are subject to risks, which are described in the prospectus. In particular, when compared to mutual funds that focus on larger capitalization companies, shares of the Funds generally are more volatile because of the exposure to smaller and mid capitalization companies, which may have more limited product lines and fewer capital resources. Value-based investments are subject to the risk that the broad market may not recognize their intrinsic values.
The Russell Midcap Value Index measures the performance of those companies in the Russell Midcap Index with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. The Russell Midcap Index measures the performance of the 800 smallest companies in the Russell 1000 Index, which represents the performance of the 1,000 largest companies in the U.S. equity market. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

 


You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds carefully before investing. Before making an investment, please download a prospectus containing all the information about the Funds or call 800.276.2883. You should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

CRM Small Cap Value Fund Fact Sheet 1Q 2017 Summary Prospectus 1Q 2017 Market Commentary 

 

Shares of CRM Funds are distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc.
Cramer Rosenthal McGlynn, LLC is the investment advisor to the CRM Funds and is not affiliated with ALPS.
Principal investment risks: The Fund invests in value stocks which can perform differently from the market on whole and may be undervalued for long periods of time. Compared to shares of mutual funds that focus exclusively on large capitalization companies, shares of the Fund may be more volatile because it invests in small capitalization companies. Small capitalization companies are likely to have more limited product lines, fewer capital resources and less depth of management than larger companies.
The Funds are subject to risks, which are described in the prospectus. In particular, when compared to mutual funds that focus on larger capitalization companies, shares of the Funds generally are more volatile because of the exposure to smaller and mid capitalization companies, which may have more limited product lines and fewer capital resources. Value-based investments are subject to the risk that the broad market may not recognize their intrinsic values.
The Russell 2000 Value Index measures the performance of those companies in the Russell 2000 Index with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. The Russell 2000 Index is an unmanaged, capitalization weighted index of 2000 small cap U.S. companies. It is not possible to invest directly in any index.


 


You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds carefully before investing. Before making an investment, please download a prospectus containing all the information about the Funds or call 800.276.2883. You should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

	PROXY STATEMENT

	FOR THE MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

	To Be Held on June 30, 2017





	This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Trustees (the "Board" or "Trustees") of CRM Mutual Fund Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"), currently consisting of seven series: CRM Small Cap Value Fund, CRM Small/Mid Cap Value Fund, CRM Mid Cap Value Fund, CRM Large Cap Opportunity Fund, CRM All Cap Value Fund, CRM International Opportunity Fund and CRM Long/Short Opportunities Fund (each, a "Fund" and, collectively, the "Funds"), for use at the Meeting of Shareholders of the Funds to be held at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on June 30, 2017, at 520 Madison Avenue, 20

	th

	Floor, New York, NY 10022, or at any adjournments or postponements thereof (the "Meeting"). This Proxy Statement and the accompanying materials were mailed on or about April 12, 2017 to all shareholders of record as of the Record Date (as defined below).




	All properly executed proxies representing outstanding shares of a Fund received prior to the Meeting will be voted in accordance with the instructions marked thereon. If no specification is made, the shares will be voted "FOR" the Proposal for the Election of Trustees at the Meeting. Any shareholder who has given a proxy has the right to revoke it at any time prior to its exercise. A shareholder who executes a proxy may revoke it with respect to a proposal by attending the Meeting and voting his or her shares in person, or by submitting a letter of revocation or a later-dated proxy to the Funds at the above address prior to the date of the Meeting. If you hold shares through a bank or other









	1









	intermediary, please consult your bank or intermediary regarding your ability to revoke voting instructions after such instructions have been provided.




	Shareholders of a Fund are entitled to one vote for each full share held and fractional votes for fractional shares. Forty percent (40%) of the shares entitled to vote present in person or by proxy, on a matter shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Meeting. Abstentions and broker "non-votes" (that is, proxies from brokers or nominees indicating that such persons have not received instructions from the beneficial owner or other persons entitled to vote shares on a particular matter with respect to which the brokers or nominees do not have discretionary power) will be treated as shares that are present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for transacting business at the Meeting, but will not count as votes cast. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Meeting, the persons named as proxies on the enclosed proxy card may propose one or more adjournments or postponements of the Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. The persons named as proxies will vote upon such adjournment or postponement after consideration of all circumstances that may bear upon a decision to adjourn or postpone the Meeting. Any business that might have been transacted at the Meeting originally called may be transacted at any such adjournments or postponements at which a quorum is present. The Funds will pay the costs of preparing and distributing to shareholders additional proxy materials, if required in connection with any adjournment or postponement.




	The Board has fixed the close of business on April 3, 2017 as the record date (the "Record Date") for the determination of shareholders of each Fund entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting and any adjournments or postponements thereof. At the close of business on April 3, 2017, the Funds had issued and outstanding shares as follows:

	PROPOSAL: ELECTION OF TRUSTEES





	At the Meeting, shareholders are being asked to consider the election of Trustees of the Funds.




	Louis Ferrante, Louis Klein, Jr., Carlos A. Leal and Clement C. Moore, II currently serve as the Funds' Trustees. Shareholders are being asked to re-elect Mr. Ferrante and Mr. Leal. Mr. Klein and Mr. Moore are not standing for re-election.




	In addition to Mr. Ferrante and Mr. Leal, shareholders are being asked to consider the election of two new Trustees to the Funds' Board, F. Gregory Ahern and Rodney P. Wood. The Trustees believe that the experience and qualifications of Mr. Ahern and Mr. Wood, as described below, will complement the experience and qualifications of the incumbent Board members and benefit the Funds.




	Mr. Klein and Mr. Moore are not standing for re-election because they intend to retire from the Board prior to December 31, 2017. Accordingly, while the number of Trustees shall be fixed at six upon the election of Trustees at the Meeting, the number of Trustees shall be fixed at four upon the retirement of Mr. Klein and Mr. Moore.




	Nominees must be elected by a plurality. Being elected by a plurality means receiving the greater number of votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Proxies at the Meeting cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named. Since the number of nominees equals the number of Trustees to be elected, a nominee receiving any votes will be elected.




	Each Trustee nominee, if elected, will serve a term of office from the time of election and qualification until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his earlier removal, resignation, or death. Each Trustee nominee has consented to serve as a Trustee, if elected at the Meeting.





	Information about Incumbent Trustees, Trustee Nominees and Officers





	Information pertaining to the incumbent Trustees, Trustee nominees and officers of the Funds is set forth below. Each of the nominees was recommended for nomination by the Trustees Committee of the Board, which is comprised of all of the Trustees who are not "interested persons" of the Funds ("Independent Trustees"), as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").

	*  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, each Trustee also received $25 from CRM Global Opportunity Fund as part of their aggregate compensation. CRM Global Opportunity Fund was liquidated on December 16, 2015.





	(1)

	  Under a Deferred Compensation Plan adopted August 12, 2005, an Independent Trustee may elect to defer receipt of all, or a portion, of his annual compensation. If an Independent Trustee opts for deferral, then the deferred amounts are credited to an Independent Trustee's deferral account and invested and reinvested in Institutional Shares of one or more of the Funds until such amounts are distributed in accordance with the Plan. As of June 30, 2016, the total amounts in the Independent Trustees' deferral accounts were: $0.





	(2)

	  Estimated for the current fiscal year. CRM Long/Short Opportunities Fund commenced operations on August 16, 2016.





	(3)

	  Mr. Yadegari, the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer, is an employee of CRM. The Funds reimburse CRM for a portion of his salary allocated to his duties as the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer. He received $40 from CRM Global Opportunity Fund as part of his compensation.





	Responsibilities of the Board of Trustees





	The Board of Trustees is responsible for overseeing the Funds' management and operations. The Board met four times during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.




	The Trustees were selected to join the Board based upon the following as to each Board member: such person's character and integrity; such person's willingness and ability to commit the time necessary to perform the duties of a Trustee; as to each Independent Trustee, his status as not being an "interested person" as defined under the 1940 Act; and, as to Mr. Leal, his association with CRM. In addition, Mr. Klein and Mr. Moore each served as a trustee of certain of the Funds' predecessor funds, which were a series of a different mutual fund complex.








	14









	The Board believes that each Trustee's experience, qualifications, attributes or skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of the other Trustees lead to the conclusion that the Board possesses the requisite skills and attributes. The Board believes that the Trustees' ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with CRM, other service providers, counsel and independent auditors, and to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties, support this conclusion. The Board has also considered the contributions that each Trustee can make to the Board and the Funds. In addition, the following specific experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills apply as to each Trustee: Mr. Ahern, regulatory and mutual fund experience as an executive of a U.S. broker dealer regulatory organization and an investment company trade organization; Mr. Ferrante, accounting, financial, investment and business experience as an investment officer and operating officer of various investment-related businesses; Mr. Klein, investment and financial experience as a financial consultant and mutual fund board experience; Mr. Moore, financial and business experience as an executive and mutual fund board experience; Mr. Leal, accounting, financial and business experience as a chief financial officer at CRM; and Mr. Wood, financial and business experience as an executive of various investment-related businesses.




	References to the qualifications, attributes and skills of Trustees are pursuant to the requirements of the SEC, do not constitute holding out of the Board or any Trustee as having any special expertise or experience, and shall not impose any greater responsibility or liability on any such person or on the Board by reason thereof.





	Board Committees





	The Board currently does not have a Chairman or a lead Independent Trustee. However, the Board of Trustees has a standing Trustees Committee that takes a central role in governance and oversight of the Funds, including as to matters customarily covered by an audit committee, and those presenting conflicts or potential conflicts of interest for management. The Trustees Committee is comprised of all of the Independent Trustees. The Independent Trustees regularly meet without the presence of management and are advised by independent legal counsel. The responsibilities of the Trustee Committee are to:




	(1)  perform the specific tasks assigned to Independent Trustees pursuant to the 1940 Act, including annual consideration of the investment management contracts and service plans with respect to the Funds;








	15









	(2)  nominate Independent Trustees of the Funds;




	(3)  oversee the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Funds and their internal controls over financial reporting, and as the Trustees Committee deems appropriate, inquire into the internal control over financial reporting of the service providers to the Funds;




	(4)  oversee the quality and integrity of financial statements of the Funds and the independent audit thereof;




	(5)  pre-approve the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the Funds and, in connection therewith, to review and evaluate the qualifications, independence and performance of the independent registered public accounting firm and approve audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to the Funds and certain other affiliated parties;




	(6)  act as a liaison between the independent registered public accounting firm of the Funds and the Board;




	(7)  review on a periodic basis the governance structures and procedures of the Funds;




	(8)  review proposed resolutions of conflicts of interest that may arise in the business of the Funds, and may have an impact on the investors in the Funds;




	(9)  review and consider matters that are reported to the Trustees Committee under the Sarbanes Oxley Code of Ethics of the Funds;




	(10)  review matters that are referred to the Trustees Committee by the Chief Legal Officer or other counsel to the Funds pursuant to the SEC Standards of Professional Conduct for Attorneys;




	(11)  meet no less frequently than annually with the Chief Compliance Officer of the Funds pursuant to Rule 38a-1 of the 1940 Act and consider any compliance matters referred to the Trustees Committee by the Chief Compliance Officer;




	(12)  review and consider the appointment, performance and compensation of the Chief Compliance Officer and any proposal to remove the Chief Compliance Officer; and




	(13)  provide general oversight of the Funds on behalf of the Funds' shareholders.




	The Independent Trustees have adopted a written charter for the Trustees Committee, which is available on the Funds' website, www.crmfunds.com.




	In connection with these oversight responsibilities, the Trustees Committee, along with the Board, oversees risk management of the Funds'








	16









	investment management and business operations. In addition, the Trustees Committee works with fund management in setting the agendas for Board and Trustee Committee meetings.




	The Board has determined that delegation to the Trustees Committee of the oversight responsibilities outlined above helps ensure that the Funds have effective and independent governance and oversight. The Board further has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate given CRM's role with respect to the Funds' investment and business operations. The Board also believes that its leadership structure serves to facilitate the orderly and efficient flow of information to the Independent Trustees from management and otherwise enhance the Board's oversight role.




	The Trustees Committee does not have a formal policy for considering nominees for the position of Trustee recommended by the Funds' shareholders. Nonetheless, the Trustees Committee may on an informal basis consider any investor recommendations of possible Trustees that are received. The Trustees Committee does not have specific, minimum qualifications for nominees, nor has it established specific qualities or skills that it regards as necessary for one or more of the Independent Trustees to possess (other than qualities or skills that may be required by applicable law or regulation). In identifying and evaluating potential Independent Trustee candidates the Trustees will consider experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that the Trustees Committee believe, based on the then current composition and skills of the Independent Trustees and experience or skills that may be appropriate in light of anticipated retirements, changing business conditions and regulatory or other developments, would maintain or enhance the effectiveness of the Independent Trustees' oversight of the Funds' affairs. The Committee considers diversity in identifying candidates but has no formal policy.




	The Board will consider Trustee candidates recommended by shareholders and submitted in accordance with applicable law and procedures as described in the section of this Proxy Statement entitled "Submission of Shareholder Proposals."




	The Trustees Committee recommended each of the non-interested nominees to serve as an Independent Trustee. The Trustees Committee followed its standard practices in identifying and recommending each Nominee. The Trustees Committee considered the experience and capabilities of the current Board members as a group in order to identify a skill set and other characteristics that would be most complementary in a new Board member.








	17









	The Trustees Committee held four meetings during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.




	The Funds also have a standing Valuation Committee. The members of the Valuation Committee are the President, Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer and each of the Independent Trustees of the Trust. In addition, the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer is a non-voting member. The Valuation Committee is responsible for determining the value of securities under certain circumstances, and for considering other matters with respect to the valuation of securities and performing other functions assigned to the Valuation Committee in the Funds' Fair Valuation Procedures. The Valuation Committee has delegated certain responsibilities to CRM; the Board and Trustees Committee oversee CRM's performance of these responsibilities and receive regular reports regarding valuation of securities from CRM and the Funds' other service providers. The Valuation Committee did not meet formally during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.







	Other Board-Related Matters





	Shareholders who wish to send communications to the Board should send them to the address of the Funds and to the attention of the Board. All such communications will be directed to the Board's attention. The Funds do not have a formal policy regarding Board member attendance at a meeting of shareholders.





	Required Vote





	Nominees must be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the Meeting at which a quorum is present. Shareholders of all Funds shall vote together as a single class and the shares of each Fund will be counted together in determining the results of the voting for the Proposal.






	THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE TRUSTEE NOMINEES.











	18















	SUBMISSION OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS





	The Funds do not hold annual meetings of shareholders. Any shareholder who wishes to submit a proposal for consideration at a subsequent shareholders meeting should mail the proposal promptly to the Funds at 520 Madison Avenue, 20th Floor New York, NY 10022. Any proposal to be considered for submission to shareholders must comply with Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and must be received by the Funds within a reasonable time before the solicitation of proxies for that meeting. The timely submission of a proposal does not guarantee its inclusion.





	OTHER MATTERS TO COME BEFORE THE MEETING





	The Board is not aware of any other matters that will be presented for action at the Meeting other than the matters set forth herein. Should any other matters requiring a vote of shareholders properly come before the Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof, it is intended that the proxies that do not contain specific instructions to the contrary will be voted in the discretion of the persons named as proxies.

	The Trustees Committee reviews, negotiates and approves in advance the scope of work, any related engagement letter and the fees to be charged by the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm for audit services and, subject to any de minimis exceptions, permitted non-audit services for the Funds and for permitted non-audit services for CRM and any affiliates thereof that provide services to the Funds if such non-audit services have a direct impact on the operations or financial reporting of the Funds. All of the audit and non-audit services described above for which E&Y billed the Funds for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2016 were pre-approved by the Trustees Committee.
