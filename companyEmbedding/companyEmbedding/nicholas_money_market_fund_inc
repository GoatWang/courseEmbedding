1 Retail Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. Beginning October 14, 2016, the Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.

2 Government Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.

^ The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund 
(the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). 
The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance 
data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown in the 
performance sub-tab when the fund is hovered over) and the actual performance 
results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have 
lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed 
over the periods shown, would have been higher. 
					

						The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
					
* Some income is subject to state and local taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

Why T. Rowe Price for a Roth or Traditional IRA?





Low Fees and Minimums.




 



You need to maximize your return potential, so we work to keep our fees competitive. That's why our solutions include no-load mutual funds with low expense ratios. Keep in mind that a Traditional IRA/Roth IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when a Traditional IRA/Roth IRA is closed. Here's more information on fees.



















Convenient and Flexible Fund Choices.




 



You can choose from target date funds with strategic asset allocation and diversification, or select from more than 100 mutual funds to suit your investing needs.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or loses arising from any use of this information. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating ™ (based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance, including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) One cannot invest directly in an index. Fund holdings and/or sector weightings are subject to change at any time and are not recommendations to buy or sell any security.

Investment Objective 

Nicholas High Income Fund, Inc. seeks to provide high levels of current income by investing in a diversified portfolio that includes primarily high yield bonds. Its secondary objective is capital appreciation. The Fund may invest in securities of any credit quality, as well as unrated securities.
Investment Policies & Considerations
We seek to add value by capitalizing on our ability to identify undervalued companies with outstanding growth potential. Our in-depth credit analysis considers each issuer’s financial resources, sensitivity to economic trends and conditions, operating history, management, and other factors. Our expertise in equity analysis enhances our bond assessments because high yield bonds and equity securities tend to respond to market fluctuation similarly.
We do not limit the maturities of the holdings in Nicholas High Income Fund, and the Fund may invest in both long- and short-term debt and equity securities.
Diversification does not assure a profit nor protect against loss in a declining market.

Industry experience: 33 years
Nicholas Company Tenure: 14 years
Portfolio Manager - Nicholas High Income Fund, Inc.
Larry Pavelec serves in a leadership position for Nicholas Company as the Chief Operating Officer and head of product distribution.  This position involves collaborating with the other senior members of the Management Committee on strategic initiatives for the Company.  He also serves as an analyst and client portfolio manager for the separately managed account equity portfolios and manager for the Nicholas High Income Fund, a high yield corporate bond fund.

As portfolio manager for the high yield corporate fund, he employs a bottom-up, value approach philosophy that focuses on companies with sufficient earnings growth and adequate asset coverage to meet debt obligations. Nicholas High Income Fund is generally positioned with a short-to-intermediate maturity structure and securities that we believe tend to provide more stability during difficult markets, while generating a market level of income consistent with the high yield corporate sector.

Larry joined Nicholas Company in 2003, to serve as the portfolio manager for the Nicholas High Income Fund and lead the product distribution effort.  Larry's career as a credit analyst and portfolio manager began in 1984 with M&I Investment Management Corp., where he focused on investment-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities. Before joining Nicholas, he was with Brandes Investment Partners as the co-manager for Brandes Fixed Income Partners, serving as portfolio manager and head of marketing for the firm.

Larry earned his B.S. in Finance from the University of Wisconsin at La Crosse. He has served on various non-profit boards over the years including the Mequon-Thiensville Education Foundation and North Shore County Club.  He has earned the right to use the CFA designation and is a member of the CFA Society Milwaukee.

 NICHOLAS MONEY MARKET FUND INC (Form: N-30D, Received: 08/30/1999 10:42:32) 










August 24, 1999



Report to Fellow Shareholders:



Early in 1999, short-term interest rates fell before
leveling off later in the first and second quarters.  However, at
the end of the second quarter rates began to rise.  The decline
in rates in early 1999 was in response to decreases in the
Federal Funds target rate late in 1998.  The Federal Reserve
Board ("Fed") lowered rates late last year largely in an effort
to revive what was at the time slumping U.S. stock and bond
markets.  The target rate remained unchanged at 4.75% until the
end of June 1999, when the rate was set at 5.00%.  Short-term
interest rates have followed the late second quarter increase,
and have slowly climbed upwards by the end of the six month
reporting period of June 30.


The seven-day effective yield for Nicholas Money Market Fund
("Fund") declined from 5.04% at December 31, 1998 to 4.64% at
June 30, 1999.   Net assets fell from roughly $160 million at
December 31, 1998 to $142 million at June 30, 1999 with weighted
average days to maturity slightly increasing from 37 days to 38
days.  Over 93% of the Fund's net assets were invested in various
issuers of commercial paper.   Management would once again like
to remind shareholders that its yield and total return ranked
above the average for taxable money market funds as reported by
IBC's Money Market Insight ("IBC") a service of the IBC Financial
Data, Inc.  Of the 928 taxable funds reported by IBC on June 30,
1999, the Funds 12-month return of 4.96% outperformed the taxable
fund average 12-month return of 4.69%.  Yields for the Fund are
shown in the table below:








                                                Yield   Yield
                                                As Of   As Of
                                               6/30/99 7/31/99
                                               ------- -------
Current 7-day*  ..........................      4.54%   4.66%
Effective 7-day*  ..........................    4.64%   4.77%
Current 12-month*  .........................    4.85%   4.78%
Effective 12-month* ........................    4.96%   4.91%








As of August 24, 1999, the Fund's effective seven-day yield
has risen to 4.86%.  Also on this date the Fed raised its target
rate by a quarter of a percent to 5.25%.  The Fed hikes in June
and August 1999 were largely in response to growth in U.S.
economic activity.  The Fed felt such boosts were warranted
because the financial strain from the previous year eased,
foreign economics firmed and the U.S. economy was at a brisk
pace.  Expect the Fed to keep an eye on such key variables as
unemployment rates which are historically low, and the ability of
productivity gains to keep inflation (which has risen as measured
by the consumer price index just 1.40% through July 31, 1999)
manageable.  Also the public's response to potential Y2K problems
and how that would effect financial markets may influence the Fed
as to whether or not to change rates in the future.  Currently
the Fed's neutral stance on future rate changes has caused many
economists to believe that if there are any additional rate
increases for the remainder of this year, they should be small.


Thank you for your continued support.


Sincerely,






/s/ Albert O. Nicholas

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies -


The Nicholas Money Market Fund, Inc. (the  "Fund") is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as an open-end
diversified investment company.  The primary objective of the Fund is
to achieve as high a level  of current income as is consistent with
preserving capital and providing liquidity.  The following is a summary
of  significant accounting policies followed by the Fund.


(a)  Securities held by the Fund, which are purchased at a discount or
premium, are valued on the basis of  amortized cost, done on a
straight line method which is not materially different than the
level yield method. Amortized cost approximates market value and
does not take into account unrealized gains or losses or the
impact of fluctuating interest rates.  Variable rate instruments
purchased at par are valued at cost which approximates market
value.  Investment transactions are generally accounted for on the
trade date.


(b)  Yield to maturity is calculated at date of purchase for commercial
paper.  For variable rate securities, the yield to maturity is
calculated based on current interest rate and payment frequency.


(c)  The Fund maintains a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of
90 days or less and purchases investments which have maturities of
397 days or less.  As of June 30, 1999, the Fund's dollar-weighted
average portfolio maturity was 38 days.  Days to maturity on
variable rate securities are based on the number of days until the
interest reset date or demand feature, whichever is longer.


(d)  It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies, and to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders.  Therefore, no federal income tax or excise tax
provision is required.


(e)  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.  Actual results could differ from estimates.


(2)  Investment Adviser and Management Agreement -


The Fund has an agreement with Nicholas Company, Inc. (with whom
certain officers and directors of the Fund are affiliated) to serve as
investment adviser and manager.  Under the terms of the agreement, a
monthly fee is paid to the investment adviser at an annual rate of .30
of 1% of the daily average net asset value of the Fund.  The adviser
will reimburse the Fund if total operating expenses (other than the
management  fee) incurred by the Fund exceed .50 of 1% of the average
net assets for the year.  At June 30, 1999, the Fund owed Nicholas
Company, Inc. $35,443 for advisory services.

1 Retail Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. Beginning October 14, 2016, the Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.

^ The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund 
(the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). 
The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance 
data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown in the 
performance sub-tab when the fund is hovered over) and the actual performance 
results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have 
lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed 
over the periods shown, would have been higher. 
					

						The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
					
* Some income is subject to state and local taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
