S&W SEED COMPANY Company Profile

   S&W Seed breeds seeds of the alfalfa variety. The agricultural company contracts locally grown alfalfa seeds from farmers in California's San Joaquin Valley, processes them at its production facility, and sells them to agribusinesses and farmers worldwide for use in growing animal feed -- particularly alfalfa hay -- for dairy and beef cattle, horses, and other livestock. About 50% of its certified seeds are sold to customers in the Middle East and Latin America, since the varieties it produces are better suited for warmer climates. S&W Seed also produces wheat on occasion and supplies PureCircle with stevia, a natural no-calorie sweetener. The company went public in May 2010.

S&W SEED COMPANY Revenue and Financial Data

   S&W Seed breeds seeds of the alfalfa variety. The agricultural company contracts locally grown alfalfa seeds from farmers in California's San Joaquin Valley, processes them at its production facility, and sells them to agribusinesses and farmers worldwide for use in growing animal feed -- particularly alfalfa hay -- for dairy and beef cattle, horses, and other livestock. About 50% of its certified seeds are sold to customers in the Middle East and Latin America, since the varieties it produces are better suited for warmer climates. S&W Seed also produces wheat on occasion and supplies PureCircle with stevia, a natural no-calorie sweetener. The company went public in May 2010.

Many years are needed to create, test and build a market for seed products, and we have used the past 35 years to breed and build awareness of the seed varieties we market and sell. Accordingly, we believe we enjoy high barriers to entry because of the length of time required to develop competitive alfalfa seed varieties (typically 5 years). The plant breeders at S&W Seed Company have ensured that our seeds are disease and pest resistant to the most common challenges plaguing alfalfa, as well as producing high yields. With the population expanding and arable land decreasing, the market for certified high yielding alfalfa seed varieties is poised for growth. S&W Seed Company offers investment opportunities to capture this market.

Alfalfa & Forage News: Why Alfalfa is the Best Crop to have in a Drought
According to this May 2015 article: “The 2013-2015 California drought has brought much public attention to the amount of water used in agriculture, and particularly which crops use the most water. Contrary to some popular views, alfalfa has a range of positive biological characteristics that should be quite useful when facing water-short conditions. These characteristics include a high degree of flexibility to ‘deficit irrigate’ the crop, ability to survive drought periods, high water-use efficiency, deep rootedness, salinity tolerance, and the ability to utilize degraded water. It is additionally very valuable to wildlife, which also suffers during a drought. Oh, and by the way, it is also very valuable to the millions of consumers who depend upon the milk, cheese, yogurt, and yes ice cream, produced from alfalfa.”

    Alfalfa  

For more than 35 years, S&W Seed Company has bred alfalfa seed of the highest quality with superior genetic traits, the unique ability to grow in challenging soil conditions and to generate outstanding crop yield. Our specialty is high-yield, non-dormant alfalfa varieties focused on maximizing profit per acre for the farmer, regardless of soil and water salinity.
Alfalfa seed is primarily used for growing animal feed, which is generically referred to as “forage.” Seed is planted to produce alfalfa that is then used for grazing, “greenchop” (fresh alfalfa cut in the field without drying), silage, baled hay, cubes or pellets as a primary food stock for the livestock industry, which includes dairy and beef cattle, horses and sheep.
The climate in the western U.S., where a majority of the company’s production is located, is ideally suited for high-quality alfalfa seed production.

    About S&W Seed Co.  

S&W provides expertise in agricultural breeding, production and processing for the alfalfa and stevia industries. Each day that passes, three major issues affect the world’s population. First, the population of the world continues to increase; secondly, the availability of arable land continues to decrease. This creates a dire set of circumstances for farmers trying to feed a population increasingly wanting a diet which includes many of the foods that alfalfa hay, the “queen of forages,” supports, including milk, cheeses and beef. Third, the rates of obesity, diabetes and other health-related issues continue to rise around the world, much of which has been attributed to the over-consumption of sugar. A natural alternative is needed in the marketplace, and S&W believes that alternative is Stevia. S&W Seed Company is capitalizing on these three very important trends to help farmers combat the challenges of today, while keeping an eye on providing sustainable solutions for tomorrow.
 
Mission
S&W’s vision is to be the world’s preferred proprietary seed company which supplies a range of forage, grain and specialty crop products that supports the growing global demand for animal proteins and healthier consumer diets.
 
History of S&W Seed Co.
More than 37 years ago, a group of cattleman, were looking to develop the very best alfalfa hay forage for their herd. They enlisted the expertise of the leading breeders and agronomist to develop varieties that would provide superior traits, while maximizing yield.
Since 1980, S&W’s breeders have developed the leading, university verified, non-dormant alfalfa seed varieties available anywhere in the world. In addition, due to the soil conditions around the base of the former Tulare Lake where much of their production took place, S&W developed varieties that would withstand the rigors of the highly saline conditions of the former lakes rim.
As farmers in the region began to recognize the capabilities of these recently developed varieties, S&W began selling the seed to farmers throughout the region, as well as other areas of the world that had similar soil challenges, such as the Middle East.
As the original owners transitioned their ownership in the company, the company elected to go public, enlisting famed agronomist Mark Grewal to lead the company going forward. Since going public in 2010, S&W has dramatically opened new markets, expanded acreage dedicated to the production of alfalfa, and expanded its research and development focus to expand not only its non-dormant varieties, but dormant and biotech varieties as well. The company acquired Imperial Valley Seed in October 2012 to expand production in the Imperial Valley growing region of California, and in April 2013 acquired Seed Genetics International, expanding its production capabilities into Australia.
With worldwide sales and distribution through both a direct sales force as well as dealer-distributors, the company is dedicated to providing the world’s farmers with the very best alfalfa seed varieties to maximize their yields and profits, while providing cattle and dairyman the highest quality alfalfa hay on the market, just as they have for the past 37 years ago.
