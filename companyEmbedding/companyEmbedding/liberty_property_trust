A Word from Our CEO

		When Bill Rouse, our founder, hired me in 2001 to be Liberty's chief investment officer, he said something I thought at the time was very strange.  He told me that my performance, and my advancement, would be judged not by him, but by my peers.  I totally did not get that.  Wasn't Bill the CEO?  Didn't he make all the decisions?
		
		It didn't take long for me to understand.  Liberty is a place where people work together in collaboration.  We help others learn and advance, and we help ourselves in the process.  We believe, with all our hearts, that our culture has a positive impact on the services and products we provide for our customers.
		
		Liberty has room for many people, many different kinds of people with many different talents, but all with a passion for achieving success through mutual trust and cooperation.
		
		We want you to succeed.  Come and join us.
		


Bill Hankowsky
			Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer

Liberty Property Trust, based in Malvern, Pennsylvania, United States is a real estate investment trust. Liberty Property Trust owns over 65,000,000 square feet (6,000,000 m2) of office and industrial space in 20 markets throughout the United States and the United Kingdom (as of September 30, 2006[update]).
History[edit]
Liberty Property Trust’s predecessor company, Rouse & Associates, was formed in 1972 by Willard G. Rouse III, George Congdon, David Hammers and Menard Doswell, to develop warehouse space in southern New Jersey. Rouse & Associates opened an office in Jacksonville, Florida two years later.
In 1974 Rouse & Associates purchased the Great Valley Corporate Center (GVCC) in Malvern, Pennsylvania. This property was the first office park to incorporate a graduate college, a business development and training center, and a day care center. GVCC has grown to include over four million square feet of office space, and remains a part of Liberty Property Trust's portfolio to this day.
Between 1974 and 1994, Rouse & Associates expanded into many new markets, including the Baltimore/Washington Corridor, the Lehigh Valley, the United Kingdom, and the Piedmont Triad. In 1987 Rouse & Associates opened One Liberty Place, the first skyscraper in Philadelphia to be taller than Philadelphia City Hall, and the tallest building in Pennsylvania from 1987-2007.
In 1994, Rouse & Associates becomes a real estate investment trust and changed its name to Liberty Property Trust. Rouse remained the chief executive officer of Liberty Property Trust until his death from cancer in 2003.
Liberty's most recent development is the Comcast Center in Philadelphia. At 975 feet (297 m), it is Pennsylvania's tallest building.
On February 19, 2003, the company would develop a 70-acre, nine-building office park just east of the main gate, in a joint venture with Synterra Partners of Philadelphia.[1] On May 29, 2003, the annual shareholders meeting of Liberty Property Trust was held as scheduled despite the death of the company's founder, Willard G. Rouse III. He died of lung cancer at age 60.[2]

Situation 

A tedious, time-consuming SEC report development process and printer delays created headaches for Liberty’s SEC reporting team. After having an extremely stressful filing due to a printer’s error with XBRL, Liberty started searching for a better way to produce SEC reports.



Results 

Gained total control over report development and filing Learned to create 10-Q reports in just hours Slashed four days from quarterly report development Saved money by not outsourcing to printers

Case Study 



 Liberty Property Trust Takes Control with Wdesk 
  
When you’re on a beach vacation with your family, the last thing you want to think about is XBRL tagging. But that’s just what Jeff Rendell, Senior Financial Analyst of Liberty Property Trust, was doing last summer. Rendell helps oversee SEC report development for the Pennsylvania-based real estate investment trust, which owns commercial real estate in 12 states around the U.S. and several locations in the U.K.
The day before Liberty’s 8-K filing, Rendell’s team discovered the printer hadn’t included tagging for one of the company’s registrants. Rendell had already spent hours of his vacation on the phone with the printer. This delay only added additional costs to Liberty and stress to everyone involved, including senior management.

Not long after that incident, Liberty’s SEC reporting team started looking for a better way to develop and file SEC reports.
In a stroke of good timing, a Workiva sales representative contacted Liberty and offered to give a demonstration. Liberty’s internal auditor, Rendell, and Jaclyn Kelly, the financial analyst who helps prepare the SEC reports, attended the demo.
They put the sales representative through his paces asking him a myriad of questions about the solutions’s capabilities. “At the end of the presentation, we couldn’t think of anything important that was missing from the solution,” says Kelly.

We were blown away by the functionality of Wdesk. The solution seemed to resolve many of the inefficiencies in the financial reporting process.
— Jaclyn Kelly, Financial Analyst, Liberty Property Trust

Selling Senior Management
One of Workiva founders even flew to Philadelphia to give Liberty’s senior finance management a demonstration. “Management was impressed with the product and, through talking to the owner, became confident that Workiva management had the experience and track record to be trusted with Liberty’s SEC filings,” says Kelly.
Liberty subscribed to Wdesk in late summer 2011 and now uses the solution for all its reports: 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and XBRL tagging. “Wdesk has made each quarter go smoothly,” says Kelly. “It’s much more efficient and we feel entirely confident in our reports.”
Kelly likes the solution’s functionality and how easy it is to create reports with Wdesk. She also appreciates the fact that more than one person can work in the document at a time. “The biggest challenge with word processor and spreadsheet interfaces was that only one person could edit the document at a time,” says Kelly. “Wdesk automatically saves changes so you never have to worry about anything being lost.”

Switching to Wdesk has saved time and stress while significantly increasing our confidence in our end product. We are thrilled with Wdesk.
— Jeff Rendell, Senior Financial Analyst, Liberty Property Trust

The solution has also helped Kelly learn more about SEC reporting. “I’ve learned a great deal about XBRL,” she says. “Workiva has information readily available on the website as well as extremely knowledgeable support staff who are willing to answer any number and type of questions about the platform and XBRL.”
Total Control
Previously, Kelly had to have her SEC reports ready two weeks before the filing deadline so the document could be sent to the printer for EDGARizing and tagging. At this point the process was completely out of Kelly’s and Liberty’s hands. All the while the clock ticked toward the filing deadline. Having an unmovable deadline and no control is very stressful, they noted.
Now filing day at Liberty is low-key because it’s all handled in house. “It’s definitely less stressful since we are no longer playing the waiting game with the printers,” says Kelly.

With Wdesk, we cut four days off our quarterly report development process.
— Jaclyn Kelly, Financial Analyst, Liberty Property Trust

Even last minute changes aren’t a concern. On the day Kelly was filing Liberty’s 10-K, she was asked to add a table to the report. “If we were using a printer, it would have been a big problem. We would have had to decide either to not include the table or push back our filing. Since we were using Wdesk, I said ‘No problem’.”
Everyone at Liberty, from external legal counsel to senior management, is happy with Wdesk. “With our first filing using Wdesk, our external legal counsel and external auditor said it was highest quality first draft we’ve ever done,” says Kelly. And now that she's spending less time creating SEC reports, she has more time to help company executives gather the information they need to help the company succeed. “Wdesk is a win-win for all of us!”

Liberty Property Trust owns over 65,000,000 square feet (6,000,000 m2) of office and industrial space in 20 markets throughout the United States and the United Kingdom (as of September 30, 2006[update]).
History[edit]
Liberty Property Trust’s predecessor company, Rouse & Associates, was formed in 1972 by Willard G. Rouse III, George Congdon, David Hammers and Menard Doswell, to develop warehouse space in southern New Jersey. Rouse & Associates opened an office in Jacksonville, Florida two years later.
In 1974 Rouse & Associates purchased the Great Valley Corporate Center (GVCC) in Malvern, Pennsylvania. This property was the first office park to incorporate a graduate college, a business development and training center, and a day care center. GVCC has grown to include over four million square feet of office space, and remains a part of Liberty Property Trust's portfolio to this day.
Between 1974 and 1994, Rouse & Associates expanded into many new markets, including the Baltimore/Washington Corridor, the Lehigh Valley, the United Kingdom, and the Piedmont Triad. In 1987 Rouse & Associates opened One Liberty Place, the first skyscraper in Philadelphia to be taller than Philadelphia City Hall, and the tallest building in Pennsylvania from 1987-2007.
In 1994, Rouse & Associates becomes a real estate investment trust and changed its name to Liberty Property Trust. Rouse remained the chief executive officer of Liberty Property Trust until his death from cancer in 2003.
Liberty's most recent development is the Comcast Center in Philadelphia. At 975 feet (297 m), it is Pennsylvania's tallest building.
On February 19, 2003, the company would develop a 70-acre, nine-building office park just east of the main gate, in a joint venture with Synterra Partners of Philadelphia.[1] On May 29, 2003, the annual shareholders meeting of Liberty Property Trust was held as scheduled despite the death of the company's founder, Willard G. Rouse III. He died of lung cancer at age 60.[2]

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
