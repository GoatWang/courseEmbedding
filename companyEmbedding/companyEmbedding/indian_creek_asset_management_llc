Gary Siegler, Manager Of Indian Creek Investors, The Largest Holder Of Kearny Financial Asks Board To Consider Strategic Alternatives

Dec 06, 2013, 15:32 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Indian Creek Investors LP 











 
















































 

 




















 











 



AVENTURA, Fla., Dec. 6, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Indian Creek Investors LP, a private investment fund and the largest independent shareholder of Kearny Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:   KRNY), the holding company for Kearny Federal Savings Bank based in Fairfield, NJ, sent a letter to Kearny's Board of Directors encouraging the Board to consider strategic alternatives to remaining an independent, partially-converted thrift. Gary Siegler, the manager of Indian Creek Investors, wrote in the letter to the Board of Directors, "While we applaud the Company's recently announced share repurchase program and CEO Craig Montanaro's efforts to transform the company, we believe that shareholder's interests are best served at this time through a strategic transaction." Citing the recent acquisition of another New Jersey based thrift, Roma Bancorp, Mr. Siegler continued, "As was the case with Roma, we believe Kearny's shares offer tremendous upside potential in a strategic transaction."



A copy of the full letter is included below.
 
December 6, 2013
 
Attn: Board of Directors
Kearny Financial Corp.
120 Passaic Avenue
Fairfield, NJ 07004
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Indian Creek Investors, a private investment fund based in Aventura, FL, is the beneficial owner of over 1,200,000 shares of Kearny Financial Corp. ("Kearny" or the "Company").  Based on information available on Bloomberg, we believe Indian Creek is currently the largest independent holder of Kearny Financial shares, holding approximately 8% of the Company's outstanding common stock that is held by persons other than the Company's parent mutual holding company, Kearny MHC.  
While we applaud the Company's recently announced share repurchase program and CEO Craig Montanaro's efforts to transform the company, we believe that shareholder's interests are best served at this time through a strategic transaction.  This view is reinforced by the recently approved purchase of Roma Financial Corp, of which Indian Creek was also a significant holder, by Investors Bancorp. Like Kearny, Roma is a partially-converted New Jersey based thrift.  Prior to the announcement last December that Roma would be sold for stock to Investors Bancorp, Roma shares traded at approximately $8.50 per share. At this same time Kearny shares traded at approximately $10.50 per share. Today Roma shares have risen approximately 150% to over $21 per share in anticipation of the merger's imminent closing. Kearny's shares meanwhile remain under $10.50 per share. As was the case with Roma, we believe Kearny's shares offer tremendous upside potential in a strategic transaction. Given what we perceive to be the extraordinary gap between Kearny's current trading value and its value in a strategic combination, we respectfully ask the Board to formally consider strategic alternatives to remaining an independent, partially-converted thrift.  We are available to discuss our views with you in further detail at your convenience.  We look forward to speaking with you.
Very truly yours,
 
/s/ Gary Siegler
ManagingMember of IC Holdings LLC, as
Managing Member of Indian Creek Asset Management LLC, as

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
