About — Sean Carney | Voice Talent































































Hello, I'm Sean.











As a graduate of Ithaca College with a degree in Integrated Marketing Communications (B.S.), I'm trained in the fields of business, marketing, and advertising. A minor in Communications Studies has also trained me in the technique and theory of public speaking and rhetoric. As a very detail-oriented person, I find the little things in life most important. This quality extends to my professional life as well with heavy attention to detail in my business and marketing experience.I currently operate my own small business as a voice over artist with well over 5,000 voice overs under my belt. I've worked with individual clients and companies from all over the globe 7 days a week since May 2014. Some of my clients include Toyota, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler, and the American Cancer Society to name a few. From radio commercials, television voice over, voice acting, product videos, explainer videos, app videos, phone system recordings, and more. I currently hold the highest ranking a seller on Fiverr can achieve; Top Rated Seller—including a 100% positive rating from my clients. My business has been featured in Fiverr's blog post "From Student to Small Business Owner", the Central New York Business Journal, and The Huffington Post.Previous experience involves my role as the Station Manager of Ithaca College's nationally-ranked radio station 91.7 WICB-FM. As a staff member of WICB since September 2012, I gained professional on-air and off-air skills. In April 2015, I was selected and moved into the position of Station Manager, overseeing and managing the radio station and all departments within. I was responsible for overseeing more than 100 on-air and off-air staff on the station and 13 department executives. During my time as manager, I created data-driven marketing material to better understand WICB's audience for future sales purposes. Before managing the station, I joined WICB's executive staff in April 2014 as the Public Service Announcement and Traffic Director, where I worked with local community businesses and organizations to promote events.
