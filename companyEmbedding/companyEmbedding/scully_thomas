No. 03-5046.
United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit.

Decided February 13, 2004.

COPYRIGHT MATERIAL OMITTED Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (No. 02cv02259).

Steven A. Zalesin, Eugene Tillman, and Helen G. Kirsch were on the brief for appellee Ortho Biotech Products LP.
Before: HENDERSON and ROGERS, Circuit Judges, and WILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge.
Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge ROGERS.
ROGERS, Circuit Judge:


1
The principal issue on appeal is whether the court has jurisdiction of a complaint filed by Amgen, Inc., the manufacturer of an anemia treatment, Aranesp, challenging an adjustment to the Medicare Part B rate at which the federal government pays hospitals for using its product. The district court dismissed Amgen's complaint for lack of prudential standing. Although we hold that Amgen has prudential standing, we affirm the dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.

I.

2
Title XVIII of the Social Security Act of 1935, 42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq., establishes the Medicare program, which provides federally funded medical insurance to the elderly and disabled. Part A of the Medicare program provides insurance coverage for inpatient hospital care, home health care, and hospice services. Id. § 1395c. Part B of Medicare is a voluntary program that provides supplemental coverage for other types of care, including outpatient hospital care. Id. §§ 1395j, 1395k. The Medicare program is subject to both fiscal limits and restrictions on administrative and judicial review. We address the former as applied to Amgen in Part I and the latter in Part III.


3
A component of the Medicare B program is the Outpatient Prospective Payment System ("OPPS"), which pays hospitals directly to provide outpatient services to beneficiaries. To control costs, OPPS, rather than reimbursing providers after-the-fact for their reasonable expenses in any given year, as was done prior to 1997, pays hospitals prospectively for their services in each upcoming year, thus requiring payments for outpatient hospital care to be made based on predetermined rates. See Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub.L. No. 105-33, 111 Stat. 251 (1997). As relevant here, OPPS payments governed by 42 U.S.C. § 1395l(t) are calculated through a formula setting payment weights for the provision of certain services (or certain groups of clinically similar services) based on the mean or median costs of providing such services in past years, with adjustments for regional cost variations. Id. at §§ 1395l(t)(2)(C) & (t)(2)(D). Pursuant to amendments to the outpatient prospective payment system in the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, Pub.L. No. 106-113, 113 Stat. 1501 (1999), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services ("the Secretary") then additionally modifies those resulting payment amounts. Hospitals facing actual costs significantly above their prospective payment amounts receive outlier adjustments. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395l(t)(2)(E) & (t)(5). Hospitals also receive supplemental payments, called "pass-through" payments, to help cover the cost of providing certain treatments, including new drugs, biologicals and medical devices. Id. § 1395l(t)(6) (hereafter, "§ (t)(6)"). Under § (t)(6), when a drug, biological, or medical device becomes eligible for pass-through status, hospitals providing it to beneficiaries receive supplemental payments equal to 95% of the wholesale cost of the treatment minus whatever amount the hospital would otherwise receive through the prospective payment system, §§ (t)(6)(D)(i) & 1395(u)(o), for a period of two to three years. § 1395l(t)(6)(C). At the end of that period, the treatment is factored into the normal prospective payment system. More generally, the Secretary also has authority, in light of his or her "significant expertise" and "judgment grounded in policy concerns" over Medicare's "complex and highly technical regulatory program," see Tenet HealthSystems HealthCorp. v. Thompson, 254 F.3d 238, 248 (D.C.Cir. 2001) (quoting Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S. Ct. 2381, 2387, 129 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1994) (internal quotation omitted)), to make "other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments." 42 U.S.C. § 1395l(t)(2)(E) (hereafter, "§ (t)(2)(E)"). No supplemental funding is available for these three types of adjustments: when the Secretary makes any of the three — outlier adjustments, pass-through adjustments, or other equitable adjustments — any additional projected expenses must be offset by a reduction in all prospective payment rates. § (t)(2)(E). Supplemental pass-through payments are additionally subject to a cap; they may not exceed a fixed percentage of OPPS payments, and must be reduced pro rata in the event they exceed that limit. § (t)(6)(E).

Amgen is the manufacturer of darbepoetin alpha, also known as Aranesp, a relatively recent biological product used to treat anemia in chemotherapy and kidney disease patients. 67 Fed.Reg. 66718, 66758 (Nov. 1, 2002). A similar product, epoetin alpha, was developed in the late 1980s, and is presently marketed both as Amgen's own predecessor product, Epogen, and the product of its competitor (and intervenor here) Ortho Biotech Products, Procrit. Id. Providers are presently compensated for providing epoetin alpha to beneficiaries through the regular prospective payment system. While the parties disagree about the significance of molecular differences between darbepoetin alpha and epoetin alpha, Aranesp differs clinically in that it has a longer half-life, such that many patients require less frequent dosages and therefore fewer hospital visits. Id.


5
Amgen applied on November 30, 2001, to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") (known prior to July 1, 2001 as the Health Care Financing Administration), which, as relevant here, administers the Medicare Part B program, for transitional pass-through new-drug status so that hospitals would receive supplemental payments for providing Aranesp to Medicare Part B beneficiaries. See § (t)(6)(A)(iv). According to the complaint, in September 2001 and July 2002, respectively, the Federal Drug Administration approved Aranesp for marketing as a treatment for kidney disease-related anemia and for chemotherapy-related anemia. CMS sent Amgen an approval letter on February 5, 2002, and on March 1, 2002, CMS included Aranesp in the reimbursement rates for 2002, to be effective April 1, 2002. 67 Fed.Reg. 9556, 9562 (March 1, 2002). CMS's proposed 2003 OPPS rates, published on August 9, 2002, also included pass-through payments for Aranesp. 67 Fed.Reg. 52092, 52119 (Aug. 9, 2002). The proposed rule stated, however, that the pass-through provisions had "been exceptionally difficult to implement" and that CMS was "actively seeking comment on all aspects of these [proposed] rates," explaining that it was "open to making changes, perhaps significant" to the proposed rates based on comments received. Id. at 52093. Ortho Biotech, the manufacturer of Procrit, submitted comments questioning the pass-through payments for Aranesp in light of its purported similarity to Procrit. 67 Fed.Reg. 66718, 66757 (Nov. 1, 2002). Amgen responded that the two biologicals were not substitutes, and that reimbursement amounts for Aranesp should not be determined in reference to Procrit.


6
On November 1, 2002, the Secretary published the final rule setting 2003 OPPS rates. 67 Fed.Reg. 66718 (Nov. 1, 2002). Claiming to act pursuant to the authority in § (t)(2)(E) to make "adjustments ... to ensure equitable payments," CMS adjusted payments for Aranesp to the level hospitals would receive under the prospective payment system, effectively eliminating the supplemental pass-through payment for the biological. Id. at 66758. The decision to reduce payments was predicated on the availability of the clinically similar yet cheaper Procrit, and noted that it was not "an equitable or efficient use of Medicare funds to pay for these two functionally equivalent products at greatly different rates." Id. Because no historical cost data were available to calculate Aranesp's reimbursement level under the prospective payment system pursuant to § (t)(2)(C), CMS calculated a reimbursement amount using what it determined to be the equivalent dosage ratio between Procrit and Aranesp. Id. at 66758-59. As an alternative ground for the decision, the final rule stated that Aranesp is not "new" for pass-through purposes under § (t)(6)(A)(iv) because it is "functionally equivalent" to Procrit and Epogen. Id. at 66759.


7
Amgen sued the Administrator of CMS and the Secretary on the ground that the rule reducing its pass-through payments violated the plain language of the Medicare Act. Amgen argued that under § (t)(6) the Secretary is required to make pass-through payments for new treatments and can only reduce those payments when necessary to keep total pass-through payments under the statutory cap, and then only on a pro rata basis for all pass-through products. Alleging violations of its procedural rights as well, Amgen argued that the rule was arbitrary and capricious, and that procedural irregularities violated Amgen's rights under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The district court allowed Ortho Biotech to intervene on the question of whether Amgen had standing to bring the suit. Relying in large part on the Fourth Circuit's decision in TAP Pharmaceuticals v. U.S. Dept. of Health, 163 F.3d 199 (4th Cir.1998), the district court ruled that Amgen, as a drug manufacturer not itself regulated by or within the zone of interests of the relevant portion of the Medicare Act, lacked prudential standing, and dismissed the complaint. Amgen v. Scully, 234 F. Supp. 2d 9 (D.D.C.2002).

II.

8
Amgen appeals the dismissal of its complaint on the ground that the district court's ruling that it lacks prudential standing to challenge OPPS payment amounts for its product conflicts with this court's precedent as well as that of the Supreme Court. The court reviews de novo the dismissal of a complaint, accepting as true the allegations of the complaint. See American Federation of Gov't Employees AFL-CIO v. Rumsfeld, 321 F.3d 139, 142 (D.C.Cir.2003).

Section 10(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702 (2004) ("APA") provides that "[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof." The Supreme Court has held that to qualify as "`adversely affected or aggrieved ... within the meaning' of a statute, a plaintiff must establish that the injury he complains of ... falls within the `zone of interests' sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint." Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871, 883, 110 S. Ct. 3177, 3186, 111 L. Ed. 2d 695 (1990) (quoting Clarke v. Securities Industry Assn., 479 U.S. 388, 396-97, 107 S. Ct. 750, 755, 93 L. Ed. 2d 757 (1987)). A party's claimed injury from administrative action, therefore, will be considered "within the meaning" of the relevant statute for purposes of 5 U.S.C. § 702 only if the party can meet the so-called "zone of interests" test. Qualified plaintiffs include not only those who are themselves the "subject of the contested regulatory action," Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399, 107 S.Ct. at 757, but also those whose interests are not "so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit." Id. Amgen contends that it is the subject of the Secretary's action and that its interests are consistent with the statutory scheme. We hold that Amgen's interests are congruent with interests underlying the Medicare Act and do not reach the question whether it is a regulated party.


10
The Supreme Court has explained that "[t]he [zone of interests] test is not meant to be especially demanding." Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399, 107 S.Ct. at 757. Thus, "there need be no indication of congressional purpose to benefit the would-be plaintiff." Id. at 399-400, 107 S.Ct. at 757. Not only need a party not be a beneficiary of a statute, a putative party's "objectives in [the] action" need not be "eleemosynary in nature;" whether they are is "beside the point." Nat'l Cred. Union Admin. v. First National Bank, 522 U.S. 479, 498, 118 S. Ct. 927, 937-38, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1998). Congruence of interests, rather than identity of interests, is the benchmark; the zone of interests test serves to exclude only those "parties whose interests are not consistent with the purposes of the statute in question," Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 306 F.3d 1144, 1148 (D.C.Cir.2002), because lawsuits by such plaintiffs "[c]arr[y] a considerable potential for judicial intervention that would distort the regulatory process." Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. EPA, 861 F.2d 277, 282-86 (D.C.Cir.1988).


11
Parties motivated by purely commercial interests routinely satisfy the zone of interests test under this court's precedents. As the court observed in Mova Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 1075 (D.C.Cir.1998), the salient consideration under the APA is whether the challenger's interests are such that they "in practice can be expected to police the interests that the statute protects." See also Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Glickman, 154 F.3d 426, 444-45 (D.C.Cir.1998) (en banc); cert. denied sub nom., Nat'l Ass'n for Biomedical Research v. Animal Legal Defense Fund, Inc., 526 U.S. 1064, 119 S. Ct. 1454, 143 L. Ed. 2d 541 (1999). Manufacturers' challenges to agency actions, then, fall within the zone of interests of a statute when their interests appear congruent with those of the statute. For instance, in Ethyl Corp., 306 F.3d at 1148, a manufacturer of fuel additives had prudential standing, under the Clean Air Act, to challenge regulations applied to automobile manufacturers because, as the developer of products that will "reduce harmful air pollutants," the company's interests "appear congruent with those of the statute." Id. Similarly, in Motor & Equipment Mfrs. Ass'n v. Nichols, 142 F.3d 449, 458 (D.C.Cir.1998), the court held that the manufacturers of replacement automobile parts could challenge, under the Clean Air Act, the agency's order permitting California to prohibit tampering with pollution monitors, reasoning that the manufacturers' commercial interest in selling replacement parts was "congruent" with those of mechanics and ultimately of the statute. And in Nat'l Cottonseed Products Ass'n v. Brock, 825 F.2d 482, 492 (D.C.Cir.1987), the manufacturers of respirators had prudential standing to challenge the effectiveness of OSHA regulations in filtering cotton dust "on the basis of the vendor-vendee relationship alone." Id. (quoting FAIC Securities v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 768 F.2d 352, 359 (D.C.Cir.1985)).


12
Amgen's commercial interest in a full statutory reimbursement rate for Aranesp is neither incidental nor antagonistic to the purposes of § (t)(6), the "statutory provision whose violation forms the basis for the complaint," Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 156, 117 S. Ct. 1154, 1158, 137 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1997). Congress adopted § (t)(6) as an amendment to the Medicare Act in 1999 because the proposed outpatient prospective payments did "not adequately address issues pertaining to the treatment of drugs, biologicals and new technology," and to prevent "restricted beneficiary access to drugs, biologicals and new technology." H.R. REP. 106-436(I) at 53 (1999). Amgen's commercial interest in selling Aranesp is congruent with the interests of beneficiaries in obtaining access to the technology because Congress' reason for providing supplemental pass-through payments was that hospitals inadequately reimbursed for new drugs or biologicals are less likely to provide them and more likely to steer beneficiaries towards older, less expensive treatments. The required offset to other reimbursements caused by supplemental payments for Aranesp under § (t)(2)(E)'s budget-neutrality requirement does not create a disqualifying conflict between Amgen and beneficiaries. There would be such an offset as a result of any successful challenge brought by any eligible plaintiff seeking access to a new treatment. Moreover, just as beneficiaries desiring access to Aranesp and hospitals desiring reimbursement for providing it would have prudential standing to challenge pass-through payment amounts, Amgen as a vendor does as well, cf. Nat'l Cottonseed Products Ass'n, 825 F.2d at 492. This is true irrespective of whether hospitals or beneficiaries could file lawsuits; whether Amgen's claim is ultimately precluded is a separate question from whether it has prudential standing to file a lawsuit. Unlike Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, 861 F.2d 277, where the court held that an association of pollution equipment providers lacked standing to challenge the agency's adoption of allegedly too weak regulations and that the statute did not manifest "congressional intent to improve the competitive position" of suppliers of more expensive pollution control devices, id. at 284, here the purpose of the pass-through provision is precisely to attract supply of higher-priced items, making Amgen a suitable challenger.


13
The district court concluded that Amgen's "competitive interest in financial gain" was "not closely aligned with the federal health care insurance act." Amgen, 234 F.Supp.2d at 21. In reaching this conclusion the court focused on the broad purpose of the Medicare Act "to provide more adequate and feasible health insurance protection for the elderly," id. at 18, and neglected the more specific interest protected by § (t)(6) itself, namely, preventing "restricted beneficiary access to drugs, biologicals and new technology." H.R. REP. 106-436(I) at 53. Under the precedents discussed, the fact that Amgen's motives were commercial is not disqualifying, and in distinguishing this circuit's precedent, the district court did not give adequate weight to Amgen's financial alignment with Congress' purpose in § (t)(6) of increasing beneficiary access to new medical technology. The district court's reliance on TAP Pharmaceuticals v. U.S. Dept. of Health, 163 F.3d 199 (4th Cir.1998), was also misplaced, for in holding that drug manufacturers lack prudential standing to challenge the Medicare B rates at which providers are reimbursed for their drugs, the Fourth Circuit limited the standing of commercial entities to regulated firms, their competitors, and other firms whose interests put them in the "same position," id. at 208, a test that this court has rejected. See Tax Analysts & Advocates v. Blumenthal, 566 F.2d 130, 142 (D.C.Cir.1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086, 98 S. Ct. 1280, 55 L. Ed. 2d 791 (1978). Adopting a more flexible approach that focuses instead on whether a party "in practice can be expected to police the interests that the statute protects," Mova Pharmaceutical Corp., 140 F.3d at 1075, is more faithful to the Supreme Court's teachings, in Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399, 107 S.Ct. at 757, that parties are denied a right to judicial review only when their interests are "marginally related to or inconsistent with" the statute at issue, and in Nat'l Credit Union Admin., 522 U.S. at 499, 118 S.Ct. at 938, rejecting as "beside the point" whether a putative plaintiff's objectives are the same as those intended by Congress. The "commercial competitor[s]" of regulated parties, TAP Pharmaceuticals, 163 F.3d at 208, and those in the "same position," id., may be examples of parties whose interests sufficiently align with some statutory schemes to confer prudential standing, but the court sees no reason to consider them the only parties so situated.


14
Accordingly, we hold that Amgen's interests are sufficiently aligned with the purpose of § (t)(6) in ensuring the access of Medicare beneficiaries to new technology, and, consequently, it has prudential standing to sue the Secretary and the Administrator.

III.

15
That Amgen has prudential standing does not resolve this appeal, however. Another threshold issue is whether the court has jurisdiction to entertain Amgen's complaint. The Administrator and Secretary contend that adjustments to OPPS rates are not subject to judicial review. This court may affirm the dismissal of a complaint on different grounds than those relied upon by the district court. See Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 166, 117 S. Ct. 1154, 1163, 137 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1997). The court's jurisdiction is a pure question of law, and as the merits do not hinge on any fact-finding or discretionary balancing of competing interests, a remand to the district court is unnecessary. Compare McGraw-Hill Cos., Inc. v. Procter & Gamble Co., 515 U.S. 1309, 1311, 116 S. Ct. 6, 7, 132 L. Ed. 2d 892 (1995); EEOC v. Nat'l Children's Ctr., Inc., 98 F.3d 1406, 1411 (D.C.Cir.1996).


16
Under § (t)(2)(E), the Medicare Act authorizes the Secretary to make adjustments to the payments hospitals receive under the outpatient prospective payment system:


17
(E) The Secretary shall establish, in a budget neutral manner, outlier adjustments under paragraph (5) and transitional pass-through payments under paragraph (6) and other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments, such as adjustments for certain classes of hospitals.


18
42 U.S.C. § 1395l(t)(2)(E). Regarding judicial review of the Secretary's adjustments, the Medicare Act provides, in pertinent part:


19
There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395ff, 1395oo, of this title, or otherwise, of —


20
(A) The development of the [prospective payment] classification system under paragraph (2), including the establishment of groups and relative payment weights for covered OPD [outpatient department] services, of wage adjustment factors, other adjustments, and methods described in paragraph (2)(F) [regarding measures to control "unnecessary increases in the volume of covered OPD services"];


21
Id. § 1395l(t)(12)(A) (hereafter "§ (t)(12)(A)"). In order to determine whether the court has jurisdiction to consider Amgen's complaint, the court must determine first, whether the "other adjustments" of which § (t)(12)(A) precludes review include the "other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments" authorized by § (t)(2)(E), and second, whether the Secretary may use the equitable adjustment authority under § (t)(2)(E) to alter a payment amount to which a hospital would have been otherwise been entitled pursuant to the pass-through provision in § (t)(6). Because we hold that § (t)(12)(A) precludes review of the equitable adjustments made pursuant to § (t)(2)(E), and that the Secretary, through CMS, acted within the authority under § (t)(2)(E) in adjusting the pass-through payment amount for Aranesp, our review of DHHS's decision is at an end.


22
There is a "strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action," Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670, 106 S. Ct. 2133, 2135, 90 L. Ed. 2d 623 (1986), and it can only be overcome by a "clear and convincing evidence" that Congress intended to preclude the suit. Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 141, 87 S. Ct. 1507, 1511, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681 (1967) (quoting Rusk v. Cort, 369 U.S. 367, 380, 82 S. Ct. 787, 794, 7 L. Ed. 2d 809 (1962)). The presumption is particularly strong that Congress intends judicial review of agency action taken in excess of delegated authority. See Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. 184, 190, 79 S. Ct. 180, 184-85, 3 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1958); Aid Ass'n for Lutherans v. U.S. Postal Service, 321 F.3d 1166, 1173 (D.C.Cir.2003). Such review is favored, the court stated in Dart v. United States, 848 F.2d 217, 221 (D.C.Cir.1988), "if the wording of a preclusion clause is less than absolute."


23
The court therefore turns to the statute's "language, structure and purpose, its legislative history, and whether the claims can be afforded meaningful review." Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 206, 114 S. Ct. 771, 776, 127 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1994). That Congress intended to preclude judicial review of the Secretary's adjustments to prospective payment amounts is "clear and convincing" from the plain text of § (t)(12) alone. The text of § (t)(12)(E) stipulates that "there shall be no administrative or judicial review" of "other adjustments." The legislative history reflects this stipulation. See H.R. REP. 105-149 at 724. That Congress would use such language of prohibition is unsurprising, for piecemeal review of individual payment determinations could frustrate the efficient operation of the complex prospective payment system. Cf. Block v. Community Nutrition Inst., 467 U.S. 340, 348, 104 S. Ct. 2450, 2455, 81 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1984). Payments to hospitals are made on a prospective basis, and given the length of time that review of individual payment determinations could take, review could result in the retroactive ordering of payment adjustments after hospitals have already received their payments for the year. Moreover, both the pass-through and equitable adjustments to payment rates are subject to a budget-neutrality requirement under § (t)(2)(E), such that judicially mandated changes in one payment rate would affect the aggregate impact of the Secretary's decisions by requiring offsets elsewhere, and thereby interfere with the Secretary's ability to ensure budget neutrality in each fiscal year. Other circuits have noted the havoc that piecemeal review of OPPS payments could bring about, see Skagit County Pub. Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Shalala, 80 F.3d 379, 386 (9th Cir.1996); American Soc'y of Cataract & Refractive Surgery v. Thompson, 279 F.3d 447, 454 (7th Cir.2002), and this court has noted similar concerns with respect to the prospective payment system the Medicare A program utilizes to reimburse hospitals for the costs of providing inpatient care. See Methodist Hosp. of Sacramento v. Shalala, 38 F.3d 1225, 1232-33 (D.C.Cir.1994); County of Los Angeles v. Shalala, 192 F.3d 1005, 1019 (D.C.Cir.1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1204, 120 S. Ct. 2197, 147 L. Ed. 2d 233 (2000).


24
In light of the presumption that Congress rarely intends to foreclose review of action exceeding agency authority, however, see Leedom, 358 U.S. at 190, 79 S.Ct. at 184-85; Aid Ass'n, 321 F.3d at 1173; Dart, 848 F.2d at 221, we construe § (t)(12)(E) to prevent review only of those "other adjustments" that the Medicare Act authorizes the Secretary to make; in other words, the preclusion on review of "other adjustments" extends no further than the Secretary's statutory authority to make them. First, the reference to "other adjustments" in § (t)(12)(A) appears alongside other components of outpatient prospective payments that are contemplated by the Act, such as the establishment of "relative payment weights" and "wage adjustment factors." The canon of statutory construction, noscitur a sociis, i.e., a word is known by the company it keeps, cf. Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Services v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U.S. 371, 384-85, 123 S. Ct. 1017, 1025-26, 154 L. Ed. 2d 972 (2003), which is "often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid giving unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress," Jarecki v. G.D. Searle & Co., 367 U.S. 303, 307, 81 S. Ct. 1579, 1582, 6 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1961), suggests that the reference to "other adjustments" in § (t)(12)(A) should similarly be confined to those "other adjustments" otherwise provided for in the Act, and at least creates sufficient ambiguity to trigger the presumption that judicial review of allegedly ultra vires agency action is favored. Second, the text in § (t)(12)(A) — "other adjustments" — matches the language of "other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments" in § (t)(2)(E), implying that Congress intended to reference adjustments made pursuant to that subsection. Third, the interference with the administration of the Medicare B program that would result from judicial review pertaining to the overall scope of the Secretary's statutory adjustment authority, as opposed to case-by-case review of the reasonableness or procedural propriety of the Secretary's individual applications, would be sufficiently offset by the likely gains from reducing the risk of systematic misinterpretation in the administration of the Medicare B program. In the similar context of prospective payments to hospitals providing inpatient services under the Medicare A program, which also operates under budget-neutrality constraints, review of the validity of certain system-wide determinations by the Secretary has been held to be available notwithstanding an express preclusion on review of individual determinations, see Universal Health Services of McAllen, Inc. v. Sullivan, 770 F. Supp. 704, 711-12 (D.D.C.1991), aff'd, 978 F.2d 745 (table) (D.C.Cir.1992).


25
Proceeding, then, on the basis that § (t)(12)(A) precludes judicial review of any adjustment made by the Secretary pursuant to the equitable adjustment authority under § (t)(2)(E), but not of those for which such authority is lacking, the court turns to the question of whether § (t)(2)(E) authorizes the type of adjustment the Secretary, acting through CMS, made here. This requires consideration of the merits of Amgen's claim that the Secretary's decision to eliminate pass-through payments for Aranesp violated § (t)(6), which dictates the manner in which such payments are to be calculated. If a no-review provision shields particular types of administrative action, a court may not inquire whether a challenged agency decision is arbitrary, capricious, or procedurally defective, but it must determine whether the challenged agency action is of the sort shielded from review. Otherwise, agencies could characterize reviewable or unauthorized action as falling within the scope of no-review provisions whose application to such action Congress did not intend. In such cases, the determination of whether the court has jurisdiction is intertwined with the question of whether the agency has authority for the challenged action, and the court must address the merits to the extent necessary to determine whether the challenged agency action falls within the scope of the preclusion on judicial review.


26
Most apposite is COMSAT Corp. v. FCC, 114 F.3d 223 (D.C.Cir.1997). The Communications Act of 1934 provides the Federal Communications Commission with authority to make certain amendments to fees, and includes in the same paragraph a provision stipulating that "amendments pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to judicial review." 47 U.S.C. § 159(b)(3) (2004). The court held that it had jurisdiction to review whether the Commission's fee changes fell within the scope of the Commission's authority under the paragraph, and that the Commission's position that it was acting pursuant to authority shielded from review did not end the matter: "the statute merges consideration of the legality of the Commission's action with consideration of this court's jurisdiction in cases in which the challenge to the Commission's action raises the question of the Commission's authority to enact a particular amendment. Where, as here, we find that the Commission has acted outside the scope of its statutory mandate, we also find that we have jurisdiction to review the Commission's action." 118 F.3d at 226-27. Similarly, in E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Train, 430 U.S. 112, 124-25, 97 S. Ct. 965, 973, 51 L. Ed. 2d 204 (1977), involving a challenge to regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Supreme Court faced a statutory scheme whereby review was available in the Court of Appeals for agency action taken pursuant to a particular section of the Act, but the parties were in disagreement regarding whether that section authorized the agency to issue regulations. The Supreme Court held that "the issue of jurisdiction is intertwined with the issue of EPA's power to issue the regulations" and proceeded to address the merits. Id. at 125, 97 S.Ct. at 973.


27
The court therefore must determine whether § (t)(2)(E) authorizes the Secretary to alter a pass-through payment otherwise required by § (t)(6). If it does, review is precluded. If it does not, because the court construes § (t)(12)(A) as only shielding from review "other adjustments" contemplated by the Medicare Act, the preclusion of review would not apply to shield the Secretary's unauthorized action. The effect of the interplay of these statutory provisions is also to render irrelevant Amgen's contentions that the Secretary's elimination of the pass-through payment for Aranesp was arbitrary, capricious, and procedurally deficient. If the Secretary is authorized to alter pass-through payments, judicial review is precluded and it does not matter how the Secretary made the decision. If the Secretary is not so authorized, even a procedurally proper and reasonably explained decision would be contrary to law because it would be ultra vires.


28
On the merits, Amgen's statutory claim is defeated by the text of § (t)(2)(E). The plain meaning of the Secretary's equitable adjustment authority permits the type of adjustment that the Secretary, acting through CMS, made here. Under § (t)(2)(E), the Secretary may make "other adjustments" to hospital payments beyond those already allowed under by the statute, "as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments." It is difficult to see how a decision by the Secretary to adjust pass-through payments for a specific treatment downward, based on the Secretary's conclusion that the treatment is too costly relative to its benefits, would not lie at the heart of such authority. The text of § (t)(2)(E), by authorizing the Secretary to adjust payments where "necessary to ensure equitable payments," manifests Congress's recognition that the payment system might otherwise sometimes produce inequitable results. The House and Conference Reports to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub.L. No. 105-33, 111 Stat. 251 (1997), state that that Act "giv[es] the Secretary discretion in determining the adjustment factors that will be applied to OPD prospective rates." H.R. REP. 105-149 at 1323 (1997), H.R. CONF. REP. No. 105-217 at 785 (1997). That discretion is what was exercised here.


29
Amgen presents several arguments for why the Secretary's decision to alter Aranesp pass-through payments is not the sort of "adjustment" authorized under § (t)(2)(E), but none are persuasive. It relies primarily on a textual argument relating to the words "shall" and "other." Amgen maintains that § (t)(6), which sets forth the means for calculating pass-through payments, provides in § (t)(6)(A) that the Secretary "shall" make pass-through payments, as does § (t)(2)(E), and describes the manner of their calculation. Focusing on the specificity of § (t)(6)'s instructions — that pass-through payments shall equal 95% of the wholesale cost of the drug or biological minus the payment amount under the prospective payment system, §§ (t)(6)(D) & 1395(u)(o); that the payments shall continue for no fewer than two years and no more than three, § (t)(6)(C); and that all pass-through payments shall be reduced pro rata in the event that total pass-through payments exceed a fixed percentage of total payments for that year, § (t)(6)(E) — Amgen contends that the Secretary acted unlawfully in using the equitable adjustment authority to override the "clear statutory mandate" to make pass-through payments in the prescribed manner. Amgen points to the pro rata reductions required by § (t)(6)(E) and shielded from review by § 1395l(t)(12)(E), and contends that because pro rata reductions to avoid budgetary overruns are the only reductions to pass-through payments addressed in § (t)(6), the Secretary's authority to reduce pass-through payments is correspondingly limited. Amgen also contends that the legislative history of § (t)(2)(E) supports its reading of the word "shall." Prior to 1999, § (t)(2)(E) provided that "the Secretary shall establish other adjustments, in a budget neutral manner, as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments, such as outlier adjustments or adjustments for certain classes of hospitals." This language was changed in the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, Pub.L. No. 106-113, 113 Stat. 1501 (1999), so that § (t)(2)(E) now provides that "the Secretary shall establish ... outlier payments ... pass-through payments... and other adjustments as determined to be necessary to ensure equitable payments." Amgen contends that the new language, by changing outlier payments from an example of an equitable adjustment the Secretary may consider into an adjustment the Secretary "shall establish," reduced the Secretary's discretion, both for outlier payments and pass-through payments. The Secretary's discretionary authority, Amgen maintains, is therefore limited to "other" adjustments — adjustments to rates "other" than those already adjusted by the outlier and pass-through payment provisions.


30
This line of reasoning reads too much into the "shall" in §§ (t)(2)(E) and (t)(6)(A). In the Balanced Budget Refinement Act, Congress made outlier and pass-through payments mandatory, but they are mandatory only in the same sense that regional adjustments in § (t)(2)(D) and the use of past cost data in § (t)(2)(C) are mandatory: they are part of default OPPS rate calculations subject to later adjustment. Congress' amendments to § (t)(2)(E) do not mean that Congress also eliminated the Secretary's discretion to make further equitable adjustments to payment rates already adjusted through the outlier or pass-through provisions. Similar uses of the statutory term "shall" elsewhere for the Medicare B program suggest the opposite. Almost every provision in § 1395l(t)(2) governing OPPS payments requires that the Secretary "shall" compute payment amounts in a certain manner: the Secretary "shall" develop a classification system for covered services, § (t)(2)(A); "shall" use median or mean cost data to establish payment weights for those services, § (t)(2)(C); "shall" determine wage adjustment factors, § (t)(2)(D). Other than the Secretary's authority to group clinically similar services together for payment purposes pursuant to § (t)(2)(B), OPPS payments are calculated almost entirely based on steps the Secretary "shall" take. If use of the word "shall" makes those payments final, there would be nothing left for the Secretary to adjust pursuant to § (t)(2)(E), for "other" adjustments would violate a "shall" provision. Congress' use of the term "shall" to describe OPPS calculations throughout § (t)(2) thus contemplates the qualification that initial payment amounts are subject to later adjustment, subject to the Secretary's "discretion." H.R. REP. 105-149 at 1323, H.R. CONF. REP. No. 105-217 at 785. The Balanced Budget Refinement Act used the same terminology in adding pass-through and outlier payments to the initial calculation of OPPS payments, and there is nothing in the Act to suggest that Congress intended to bar adjustments by the Secretary.


31
Congress' recent amendment to § 1395l(t)(6) in § 622 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, Pub.L. No. 108-173, highlights the Secretary's flexibility under § (t)(2)(E). As amended, § (t)(6)(F) bars the Secretary, after the date of enactment (December 8, 2003), from calculating pass-through payments for drugs or biologicals in future rates using a "functional equivalence" standard, although determinations of "functional equivalence" made prior to the date of enactment may still be used in future rates so long as they are made only to determine eligibility for pass-through adjustments and not to calculate other OPPS payments. Id. at § 622; 42 U.S.C. § 1395l(t)(6)(F)(ii). The amendment only applies "on or after December 8, 2003", id., so it does not apply retroactively of its own force to the 2003 OPPS rates at issue here. The new limitation on the future application of a "functional equivalence" standard to pass-through payments, however, by permitting the continuation of some such calculations made "prior to December 8, 2003," § (t)(6)(F)(ii)(I), contemplates the Secretary's authority to apply such a standard in the first instance. Yet if Amgen's interpretation of §§ (t)(2)(E) and (t)(6)(A) were correct, and the "clear statutory mandate" by which § (t)(6) sets pass-through payments cannot be altered, there would be no opportunity to apply a "functional equivalence" standard to pass-through payments to begin with: payment amounts would have been finally set under § (t)(6)(D), which sets total payments for pass-through drugs and biologicals at 95% of wholesale costs. Congress did not enact such an inflexible system.


32
Nor, as Amgen contends, does a flexible understanding of the Secretary's equitable adjustment authority under § (t)(2)(E) render superfluous § (t)(12)(E), which prevents review of only certain decisions related to the calculation of pass-through payments. Amgen maintains that if the Secretary could make equitable adjustments to pass-through payments, it would be redundant for the Medicare Act also to exempt decisions about matters such as the duration of payments or the application of any pro rata reduction from judicial review, because the Secretary could make all such decisions as "equitable adjustments" under § (t)(2)(E) and shield them from review under § (t)(12)(A). This is not a redundancy at all; the initial setting of OPPS rates and later adjustments are different decisions. Amgen does not point to any concrete way in which the Secretary could use the equitable adjustment authority to shield a calculation or decision for which the Medicare Act contemplates review. Section (t)(12)(E) is not exhaustive; it lists calculations the Secretary would make while setting pass-through payments in the first instance. The fact that Congress also used § (t)(12)(A) to shield any later adjustments to those initial rates pursuant to § (t)(2)(E) is not a redundancy. Nor, for that matter, is the breadth of the no-review provisions surprising, given Congress' reasons for limiting review. See Skagit County Pub. Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Shalala, 80 F.3d 379, 386 (9th Cir.1996); American Soc'y of Cataract & Refractive Surgery v. Thompson, 279 F.3d 447, 454 (7th Cir.2002); cf. Methodist Hosp. of Sacramento v. Shalala, 38 F.3d 1225, 1232-33 (D.C.Cir.1994); County of Los Angeles v. Shalala, 192 F.3d 1005, 1019 (D.C.Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1204, 120 S. Ct. 2197, 147 L. Ed. 2d 233 (2000).


33
The Secretary's equitable adjustment authority that enables the adjustment of OPPS payments otherwise set by the Medicare Act, including pass-through payments, would not, as Amgen contends, give the Secretary the absurdly broad power to make drastic adjustments, such as the elimination of the entire pass-through program, and term it an "equitable adjustment," thereby undermining the mandatory nature of the pass-through payment system while evading judicial review. Limitations on the Secretary's equitable adjustment authority inhere in the text of § (t)(2)(E), which only authorizes "adjustments," not total elimination or severe restructuring of the statutory scheme. As in MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 U.S. 218, 225, 114 S. Ct. 2223, 2228-29, 129 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1994), where the Supreme Court held that the Federal Communication Commission's authority to "modify" certain requirements could not reasonably be read to encompass the power to make "basic and fundamental changes in the scheme" such as eliminating them entirely, similar limits inhere in the term "adjustments" to those the Supreme Court found in the word "modify." The statutory requirement that the Secretary "shall" develop certain aspects of the payment system is qualified by the Secretary's authority to "adjust[]" those payment amounts, but a more substantial departure from the default amounts would, at some point, violate the Secretary's statutory obligation to make such payments and cease to be an "adjustment[ ]." Because the Secretary would, in that event, exceed his statutory authority under § (t)(2)(E), the preclusion on judicial review in § (t)(12)(A) would not apply. Cf. Leedom v. Kyne, 358 U.S. at 190, 79 S.Ct. at 184-85; Dart v. United States, 848 F.2d at 223. But because the adjustment to which Amgen objects, involving only the payment amount for a single drug, does not work "basic and fundamental changes in the scheme" Congress created in the Medicare Act, MCI Telecommunications Corp., 512 U.S. at 225, 114 S.Ct. at 2229, but is rather of the sort contemplated by the plain text of § (t)(2)(E), the court has no occasion to engage in line drawing to determine when "adjustments" cease being "adjustments."


34
Finally, the court does not reach the question of whether review of Amgen's constitutional claim is barred, as it is not properly before us. Amgen contends in its reply brief that the court has jurisdiction to review Amgen's constitutional claim that the administrative process violated its due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment irrespective of whether § (t)(12)(A) shields the adjustment from review. The court has "repeatedly held that an argument first made in a reply brief ordinarily comes too late for our consideration." Students Against Genocide v. Department of State, 257 F.3d 828, 842 (D.C.Cir.2001); see also Bd. of Regents of the Univ. of Washington v. EPA, 86 F.3d 1214, 1221 (D.C.Cir.1996). There is no reference in the district court's opinion to Amgen's constitutional claim, and Amgen's main brief mentions neither its constitutional claim nor the district court's failure to address it. Instead, Amgen's main brief seeks reversal only of the district court's ruling on prudential standing under the Medicare Act and the APA, notwithstanding the irrelevance of such a requirement to constitutional claims, see Clarke, 479 U.S. at 400 n. 16, 107 S.Ct. at 757 n. 16, and its awareness of the Secretary's arguments in the district court that judicial review of Amgen's complaint, which included a constitutional claim, was precluded. The Secretary's brief on appeal does not address whether the court has jurisdiction of the constitutional claim made in Amgen's complaint, as Amgen mentions that claim for the first time in its reply brief. Under these circumstances, the court has no occasion to make exception to its usual refusal to address contentions raised for the first time in a reply brief.


35
Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of Amgen's complaint. Although we hold that Amgen has prudential standing to bring its complaint, we also hold that the court lacks jurisdiction under § (t)(12)(A) to consider Amgen's complaint challenging the Secretary's exercise of the equitable adjustment authority under § (t)(2)(E).

Geckskin: Super Adhesive

Posted on December 7, 2012 by Thomas Scully 


 Some things we see in nature we describe as phenomena because we cannot explain them.  One phenomenon for many years was the ability of geckos to stick to walls or other surfaces with great ease.  We’ve all probably wished for this “spider-man-like ability” at one time or another in our life but never been able to achieve it.  Recently, researchers at the University of Massachusettes have discovered what exactly gives geckos their ability to stick to various surfaces and have had success replication it in a new material called geckskin.
The secret behind geckos’ adhesive properties is what is known as “van der Waals” force.  Geckos’ feet have tiny hair-like structures on them which each have tiny flat ends called “spatulae.”  These spatulae give the geckos’ feet a much larger surface area than they would have without them.  Van der Waals force is the attraction that occurs between atoms and molecules.  Between small objects, this force is too minimal to apply, however objects with large surface areas have a much greater attraction due to this force.  The increased surface area of the geckos’ feet allows them to attract to surfaces and stick.  The researchers at the University of Massachusettes have successfully been able to replicate this in there design, geckskin.  This design could become very popular as it can support up to 700 pounds of weight with a very small square of geckskin.  It also leaves behind no residue as current sticky devices would, becuase of its application of van der Waals force in its design.  It works exactly like a gecko’s skin and supports huge amounts of weight relative to its size but it can be removed easily.
These designers have taken a page out of nature’s book and used biology to aid in their design and production of a new material that could be very popular soon.  More research and development is being done with this groundbreaking discovery and with some slight tweaks it could be put into mass production in the near future.  The possiblities to stick things together easily and effectively with no other effects or results is very appealling to a number of businesses and consumers and if a glove company picks up the design, who knows, maybe we’ll see some clothing that allows the wearer to be spider-man-like.  Whatever the future, this material is a very promising design.

Smart Headlights: Making Rain and Snow seem Invisible

Posted on December 6, 2012 by Thomas Scully 

         
In a world where one of the biggest emphases around is placed on safety, and rightly so, many of the most sought after innovative designs are those which improve the safety of users.  People value their safety extremely highly and because of this fact there is incentive for designers to seek the safest form of design despite the extra cost.  People are always willing to pay a little extra for guaranteed extra safety.  One extremely common aspect of everyday life that can also be life threatening in extreme circumstances is driving a car or other vehicle.  In certain weather it can become dangerous to be driving due to road conditions or another aspect, sight impairment.  Imagine when you are driving at night and it starts raining.  The rain appears as illuminated drops falling from the sky that can be distracting or impairing to the eye while driving.  This has been a problem for drivers until now.
Professor Srinivasa Narasimhan of Carnegie Mellon University has been a leading developer of the smart headlight system.  It is designed to reduce or eliminate the glare from rain caused by headlights.  The system involves a high frequency camera which continuous takes pictures of the falling rain.  The system then sends these pictures to a computer which “applies a computer algorithm to predict where each bit of precipitation will be a few milliseconds later.”  This prediction system sends a signal to the headlights which automatically turn off the rays from the headlights that would intersect the path of the rain as each drop passes the point of intersectionand turns the rays back on after the drop passes.  Because the rays turned off at one moment are so small compared to the total rays projected, the headlights will not appear to have lost any brightness but the rain will be almost invisible to the driver.  The system is 100% reliable at very low speeds and as the vehicle’s speed increases, the system becomes less reliable; however, it is very reliable up to extreme speeds.  This is pretty good considering during rain or snowfall most people will not be driving very fast anyway.  This is a very good and effective design that improves safety in vehicles a good deal and may become a common aspect of vehicles for years to come.

Service Design

Posted on December 6, 2012 by Thomas Scully 

                                                   
Although it is a relatively young field in terms of the existence of it’s formal education, service design has always been developed among competing businesses as a way to improve and stand out.  You can find it today anywhere someone is trying to make your life easier or anywhere a product is tailored to appeal to specific needs or desires.  Every company or business applies it in some way or another because they have now come to realize that people will seek and always prefer something that makes them feel comfortable or at home.  “The backbone of this process is to understand the behavior of the customers, their needs and motivations.”  Companies now try to cater to the customers’ needs in order to gain their business.  The difficulty is in knowing and understanding what customers want before asking them.  Some people even believe this to be impossible.  How can a designer really know what service people will want?  In order to better understand how to incorporate service design, some designers go “undercover” in a service business and learn by example.  They practice and gain firsthand knowledge in how to serve people.
One company that has been successful in its service design is McDonald’s in France.  At one point in time, French citizens had no desire to incorporate McDonald’s into their lives or eat there at all.  They disliked the fast food restaurant’s presence in their country, but nowadays the average French customer at McDonald’s spends 3 times as much as the average American customer.  This change occurred because of McDonald’s service design which appealled to French interests.  The fast food restaurant changed its atmosphere.  It modeled itself after, Starbucks, a place frequented by French citizens.  Starbucks sought to create there locations “designed to provide customers with a third place; a place between home and work where they can go to relax or meet with friends.”  McDonald’s adapted this making the place less uniform and more relaxed and open environment to enjoy the company of friends.  They no longer appeared to treat customers as the same uniform person, but as individuals.  This attracted more people and, as a result, more business.
In conclusion, the ways to design for service are vast and variable, but the effects of a good service design are no small matter.  Many companies pride themselves and thrive on service design.  If the customer is the person you are looking to buy your product, doesn’t it make sense to design it to serve him?  The best designs incorporate this technique in order to make the customer feel at home.

Beaming Technology

Posted on November 1, 2012 by Thomas Scully 

This exciting new technology in the realm of social interaction is still in development process, but it could become very important in long distance communication one day.  The researchers and developers of this “beaming” technology notice, “Humans are social animals and, paradoxically, as telepresence technologies evolve they become more frustrating.”  This can be seen commonly in video calls as people understand they are not really with the person whose face they are seeing.  The idea behind beaming is that people need a more personal way of interacting across long distances to create the best effect and get the most out of the interaction.
The technology, as anyone can imagine, is incredibly advanced and requires even more study and advancement before it can be completely functional.  The device used requires the reception and transmition of multiple signals from two locations.  In the first location the person wears a transmitor that reads signals given by the person including facial expression, motion, body language, and other functions.  In the other location is a robotic avatar or a virtual avatar which receives the signals from the human and acts them out.  This second location also receives signals from the surrounding environment and transmit them back to the human on the other side.  This allows for a person to understand and react to everything in an environment without even being there.  Strides have been made and recently there was an experiment done using a small robotic avatar in a cage with a mouse.  The person controlling the robot used the signals transmitted to him to follow the mouse’s actions and people on the robot’s side confirmed the successful mimicry.
This technology still has a long way to go in every aspect but the idea of being able to “be” somewhere else without actually travelling there is appealing to a great deal of people and probably especially business men who need to conduct meetings across countries.  We may never reach the beaming capabilities in such science fiction stories as Star Trek, but this new technology is a step towards it and hopefully as step towards better and easier long distance communication.

Pipistrel Taurus G4

Posted on November 1, 2012 by Thomas Scully 


The Pipistrel Taurus G4 is a remarkable innovation in the world of flying.  The plane, which is remarkably similar to a glider in several ways, can hold 4 passengers including the two pilots.  It is powered entirely by electric power and won the NASA/CAFE green flight challenge, the prize for which was $1.35 million.  Although it is small and almost half of the plane’s weight is accounted for by the battery powering the engine, the technological opportunity presented by this plane shows that there may be a future in electronic powered aircraft.  The plane was able to travel 200 miles in 2 hours giving it an average speed of 100mph.
The plane itself weighs a little less than 2500 and the battery that powers it weighs just over 1000 pounds.  The lithium polymer battery generates 150 kilowatts which is an output of 200 horsepower.  The physical design of the plane with a wingspan of roughly 75 feet and two twin fuselages on either side of a central part where the battery is located makes the plane efficient but may not catch on as a guide for future plane designs.  The designers note that the Taurus G4 is more of a prototype in the way of electric powered planes and is not likely to ever be on the market.  It will, however, serve as a stepping stone to future developments in electronic air travel and greener air travel.

3-D Printing

Posted on November 1, 2012 by Thomas Scully 

3-D printing is a revolution in the way we produce various items.  It creates an easy and low effort way of creating objects.  Although the software and setup of the 3-D printer requires a great deal of time, work, and effort, once it is set up it makes the process of creating a part or object extremely simple.  Although it is still young in its existence, 3-D printing is well on its way to immensely changing how we create parts and products.
3-D printers operate with the use of a created or scanned CAD, or Computer Aided Design, file.  The computer uses this file and sends it to the the printer which then produces the image by laying it out layer by layer.  This process will naturally take more or less time depending on how complex the object is and because the object is produced layer by layer it requires the object to have at lest one flat surface.  The various types of machines can print using plastics, metals, and now even printing in concrete is developing.  As the process advances and can be applied to a wider range of materials it will become more prevalent and valuable to manufacturers.
The positives associated with 3-D printing are numerous.  One benefit would be how easily it can produce parts and objects.  This could prove a huge benefit for manufacturers as the technology develops.  They’re parts can be made in whatever shapes they can imagine and all they’ll have to do is send a signal to the printer to create it.  Researchers at Loughborough University in the United Kingdom are examining 3-D printing with concrete which could lead to huge advances in what can be printed.  The possibilities seem endless.
Some negatives include the fact that right now the majority of 3-D printers only produce very small items but there is a lot of room to expand and develop larger printers.  They also can take a long time to print, especially with very complicated designs which could lead to slow production of parts.  The biggest drawback in the design though may be the impact on personal production.  People can buy 3-D printers for their homes and although they are expensive, prices are dropping, and if people can produce their own products they may consume much less which will hurt the economy.  Another problem with personal production is what people can produce.  One point was made that all someone would need to do to produce a gun is find the design online and download it and that is possible.  3-D printers have produced operational guns which demonstrates that people could produce their own unregistered guns.  In reality most people will not do this, however, the possibility is there which could lead to problems.
Overall, if the production and use of 3-D printers is regulated and research continues to yield big results, I believe 3-D printing could become a key part of production of goods in the future.

Product Life Cycles

Posted on October 31, 2012 by Thomas Scully 


We have all seen this happen multiple times during our life and we will continue to see it as long as we live.  As long as there are new and innovative ideas and improvements in technology (and there always will be) a product will always experience the stages of the product life cycle.  Some products may experience longer time periods of certain stages but all will undoubtedly experience a rise in popularity and sales and then a decline in both.  The product life cycle is expected by all designers and although there are multiple views of the product life cycle the overall trend of it is constant.
One view of the product life cycle include the affectionate view which is the idea that life cycles occure because people always buy what looks sleek and new and what looks the best as designers are always improving the look of their designs.  Another view is the business view of product life cycles which operates under the idea that marketing and competition will create product life cycles as people desire the newest and best and will replace their old products with the new.
There are other views as well but what all the views share in common is the idea that the designers are the ones who have the most influence on product life cycles with how they design.  They can design with the intention of their product becoming obsolete quickly thus leaving room for them to design new products or they can design with the intention of a lasting design that may grow obsolete on its own or be forced into obselescence by new technologies.  The impact of product life cycles have created a great deal of waste and exhaustion of natural resources.  The debat has become whether it is better to design sustainably or with the intention of long life rather than designing to be obsolete and make money.  Ultimately it is in the hands of the designers and the companies but it is a fact that resources are depleting and eventually will run out with increased consumption.  Whether or not this will lead to increased shortening of product life cycles or lead to designing for longer product life cycles is still uncertain but the consequences of either will have massive effects on the world.

Environmental/Sustainable Design

Posted on October 31, 2012 by Thomas Scully 


One hot button topic of the last decade has been environmental impact and whether or not we as humans are having a large negative impact on the environment.  Although it is less prevalent in discussions today, many people still see problems such as global warming or the exhaustion of natural resources as the world’s most pressing issues.  In order to combat these potential dangers to human existence engineers and designers are now incorporating a great deal more of sustainability in their designs.
Sustainability can be explained as “the philosophy of designing physical objects, the built environment, and services to comply with the principles of social, economic, and ecological sustainability. ”  It is a key idea in the preservation of natural resources and involves sustaining the existing environment while also creating a new building or whatever else is being designed.  Involved in sustainable design is the use of more natural energy to reduce energy costs and promote clean energy.  Many buildings incorporate large glass windows to allow for use of natural light for most of the day or motion sensor lights in rooms to ensure the lights are not left on and the energy wasted.  Along with this goes the development of solar, wind and other renewable energy sources which are very sustainable, however, as of now they are much more expensive than coal, natural gas, oil, and other current forms of producing energy.
Many buildings are also now incorporating green roofs which allow plant life to thrive on the tops of the buildings thus preserving the natural design of the area while also including new human design.  One example of commitment to developing sustainable buildings is at The Pennsylvania State University.  Many of Penn State’s newest buildings include green roofs, motion sensor lights, effective use of glass to reduce artificial light dependency, and other environmentally friendly and sustainable features.  It is this type of commitment that will improve design sustainability going forward.  An example of a design that is not extremely sustainable is the plastic bottle which requires the digging of landfills and is harmful to the environment if left in nature.  It can inhibit the growth of the natural plant and animal species of the are.  In essence it does not work with the environment, but against it.
Although strides have been made in the field of sustainability, there are still many more to be made.  More companies can become involved and more design fields can involve increased sustainability in their designs.  The result will be better use of natural resources and a much better environmental impact by humans.

Emotions and Design

Posted on October 31, 2012 by Thomas Scully 

Many designers today are realizing that people do not always necessarily buy the product that does in fact work the most efficiently or have the cheapest price.  Many consumers purchase products that arouse strong emotional feelings within them.  Although it is hard to explain why emotions have such power of us as humans, it is without question that they do hold this power.  For designers to be successful they want to tap into this impulsive factor of consumption and give people an emotional attachment to their products.  One example of a powerful emotion in design is nostalgia.  Those products that make people feel nostalgic and remind them of past glory days and fun times are sold very easily.  One examples of important emotions in design are joy and fear.  One well said example of how fear controls us is as follows:
”
Imagine a plank 10 meters long and 1 meter wide. Place it on the ground. Can you walk on it? Of course – no problem. You can jump up and down, dance, and even walk along with your eyes shut. Now lift the plank 3 meters in the air. Can you walk on it? Yes, although more carefully.
What if the plank were 200 meters in the air? Most of us wouldn’t dare go near it, even though the act of walking along it and maintaining balance should be no more difficult than when on the ground. Why would a simple task suddenly become so difficult – impossible, even? Tell yourself all you want that if you can walk on the plank on the ground, you can still walk on it in the air. You still won’t walk along it, let alone jump and dance or, heaven forbid, close your eyes while walking. Fear dominates. (Norman, Emotion and Design)”
This shows that people will not go near a product they fear even if in another scenario they would be indifferent.
Aesthetics are very important in emtional design.  The sight of a nice looking object creates positive feelings toward that object and draws people to that object, just as something that looks ugly or unappealing will create negative feelings that cause people to stay away from that product.
One example of this used in design is in the “Bottoms Up Draft Beer Dispensing System” found on the site “Built to Love.”  This design creates positive feelings in customers because they enjoy just watching it work and therefore will purchase beer to see it operate.  It also creates a more efficient way or filling cups with beer.  One of the negatives of this design is it may be more likely to damage the cup and spill the beer and another is once people grow bored with it they will most likely return to the old fashioned pour but for now it is an innovative and effective example of emotional design.

Safe Design

Posted on October 31, 2012 by Thomas Scully 

Safe Design involves not the elimination of all risk, because that is impossible, but rather the minimization of potential risks and problems that may arise in a product.  It requires a good deal of thought in the design process in order to avoid all major problems that may arise.  The Law of Unitended Consequences states, “Almost all human actions have at least one unintended consequence.”  This is certainly true in design as desginers cannot predict everything that will come from their design.  Alfred Nobel had the intention of his invention, dynamite, being used in construction and excavation.  He realized soon that man would develop and use it as a weapon as time went on.
Although it is impossible to find all the possible outcomes or x’s, especially the negative ones, many of these various outcomes can be predicted and planned for.  Another thought is that not all unexpected outcomes will be negative.  A product could have an unexpected outcome that actually benefits the user or the product itself.  Also the negative results will not occur very frequently provided adequate time is spent planning for them, which it almost always is.  In cases where there are drastic negative results product liability comes in to play.  Product liability protects the customers in the case of poor design or failure to warn about know flaws in design.  In many cases the manufacturer is responsible for defects even if they were not known to ensure the customers are always protected.  This further ensures focus and time devoted to eliminating as many negative consequences as humanly possible.
Some well known flawed designs include the Titanic, The Challenger Space Shuttle, and the Dell Computer Notebook Battery, which needed to be recalled due to dangerous consequences.  A recall costs a company millions of dollars.  So a few extra hours or days to review and improve ceratain aspects of a design seems like a small price to pay in comparison to this cost.  These flawed designs resulted in disastrous consequences and will hopefully serve as an example to future designers to examine more aspects.  They will most definitely always serve as an example that no design is perfect and there are always consequences.  One interesting example of a product which many in the public view as dangerous is Hydrogen gas.  Hydrogen gas is in fact much safer, more abundant, and cleaner than gasoline and may prove to be a better source of energy.  It is not viewed positively because of one event, the explosion of the Hindenburg, which did not even explode because of the Hydrogen gas.  This shows how fear of danger can prevent even what could be beneficial designs from being created.  Safety will always and should always be one of the most if not the most important inputs in design.
