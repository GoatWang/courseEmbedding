Our Services : Hedge Fund Marketing : Fund Accounting Administration : Fund Management Solutions








 

























Our value added services  consist of many different pieces. As the hedge fund manager you need to focus  your attention on the buying and selling of securities. Why are hedge fund  managers outsourcing their back-office operations? Simple, focusing on an  in-house back office diverts their attention from their core responsibilities,  namely asset accumulation and building your franchise. Your investors will  appreciate the independent third-party verification of your funds’ operating  results by our CPAs at Strategic Asset Management.  Our individualized services packages tailored  to your fund or situation are crucial to satisfying your customers.   We  greatly reduce expenses and overhead for your fund by eliminating the need for  a large administrative and operational staff.

Egerton Co-Founder Bollinger Launches Hedge Fund In Asia
Feb 17 2012  |  4:32am ET

William Bollinger, a co-founder of Egerton Capital and former protégé of Julian Robertson, has launched a new hedge fund in Singapore.
Bollinger's Judico Capital has started small—while it is on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's list of investment advisers in the city-state, it is not registered with the regulator, a step it will have to take only when it has 30 or more clients, the Financial Times reports.
One of the pioneers of the British hedge fund industry, Bollinger set up Egerton with John Armitage in 1994. He remains a minority partner at the US$5 billion firm, with Armitage still at the helm.
Bollinger got his start in hedge funds at Tiger Management, before leaving Robertson's nest to found a New York-based hedge fund, which he managed from 1987 until 1992.

As hedge funds hemorrhage cash at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, a new crop of money managers is starting to buck the trend in Europe with backing from some of the industry’s biggest names, including George Soros and Donald Sussman at Paloma Partners LLC.The new funds are being started by traders who have built reputations at some of the best-known investment firms. Former BlueBay Asset Management managers Neil Phillips and Jonathan Fayman have raised almost $2 billion including money from Soros, according to people familiar with the matter. Former Highbridge Capital Management’s John Aylward, 37, has received about $300 million from Paloma to start a credit fund.“This vintage of new funds is probably going to be the best performing vintage since 2009 because you are getting higher quality managers coming out, hungry to prove a point," said Erik Serrano Berntsen, chief executive officer of Stable Asset Management, which invests in hedge-fund startups. “All the best investments, to some extent, are a bit contrarian."








Poor returns, the mounting cost of regulatory compliance and investors’ reluctance to allocate capital has led to more hedge funds closing than starting in Europe since 2015. Investors are also balking at high fees -- hedge funds have traditionally charged 2 percent of assets and taken a 20 percent cut of performance -- that have rewarded managers so well in the past. Charges are declining, according to industry tracker Preqin Ltd, and investors want them to fall further.About 530 hedge funds have closed in the region since the start of 2015, while only 452 have started, according to Eurekahedge data. The industry is dominated by managers overseeing less than $100 million and they are struggling to remain afloat, with the Eurekahedge index for European hedge funds declining 1 percent through August this year, underperforming a 2.8 percent rise in a gauge that measures returns for global peers.“There’s an opportunity right now because all the big guys have become super big and the smaller guys are struggling --in between there’s an empty space,” said Marcello Sallusti, who left Egerton Capital U.K. LLP after 16 years in February to start his own hedge fund. "In a zero interest-rates world, people are looking for investment opportunities and a startup doesn’t need multi-billion assets under management to cover running costs."Sallusti, 53, who was part of the core investment team at $14.6 billion Egerton Capital, said he will start Engadine Partners in London later this year to bet on equities with more than $200 million raised from partners and early-stage investors. “Everybody tells me it’s very tough,” Sallusti said in an interview.“There’s never an ideal moment to start a new business. Important choices in life come naturally.”




Among other startups, Mikael Brantberg, 37, a former managing director at Farallon Capital Management LLC, is seeking regulatory approval to start a credit hedge fund, while Andrew Manuel, a co-founder of the $2.5 billion hedge-fund firm LMR Partners LLP, is setting up Ixworth Capital LLP in London. Tej Johar, 28, a former money manager at BlueCrest Capital Management, is starting an event-driven firm, Broad Bridge Capital LLP, and has received money from a U.S. institution, a person familiar said.The Soros-backed Glen Point Capital, where Phillips and Fayman have already started trading, is one of the largest hedge-fund startups in Europe this year, according to two people familiar with the matter. Officials at Glen Point declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Soros.

Glen Point bets on macroeconomic trends with a focus on emerging markets. Phillips, 46, joined BlueBay, owned by Royal Bank of Canada, in 2005 and managed a macro hedge fund. The firm closed the $1.4 billion fund after he and Fayman, 33, left in November 2014. The fund had gained 8 percent through October of 2014 and closed under “ridiculously successful circumstances”, Phillips had said in an interview at the time.Challenges remain because investors are backing only the best of the breed, with some of the biggest players in the industry still seeing negative returns. Funds managed for some of Europe’s biggest firms such as Lansdowne Partners and Brevan Howard Asset Management have lost money this year."We are witnessing hedge-fund culling in Europe," said Mohammad Hassan at Singapore-based industry tracker Eurekahedge. “Managers continue to face the axe following a disappointing stream of returns.”For the moment, investors are focusing their attention on smaller firms, with data from research firm eVestment showing hedge funds with less than $1 billion in assets received net inflows of $4.2 billion globally in August, more than double the amount that went into funds managing more than $1 billion.That may drive more money managers to venture out on their own, according to Stable Asset Management’s Berntsen, who said there are many traders at big firms unable to take risks because their employers want to play safe. And that’s cutting into pay packets.Some younger mangers “may be incentivized to leave because they know that they are not going to be paid this year and probably next year,” said Michele Gesualdi, the London-based chief investment officer at Kairos Investment Management, which invests in hedge funds. “So they might as well start on their own.”— With assistance by Katia Porzecanski

Egerton co-founder, William Bollinger, to launch Singapore hedge fund

Weekly Asia News (Friday)











William Bollinger (pictured), a pioneer of London’s hedge fund industry and one of the co-founders of Egerton Capital, one of the UK’s first and most successful hedge funds he established with John Armitage in 1994, is to launch a new hedge fund – Judico Capital - in Singapore reported the Financial Times this week. The Lion City has a less prescriptive regulatory regime and, along with a more competitive tax regime than London and high quality lifestyle, is beginning to attract more overseas fund managers, both new and existing. Egerton was one of the first firms to use long/short equity strategies in Europe and paved the way for others to follow suit, most notably Lansdowne Partners and Odey Asset Management. Bollinger began his career at Goldman Sachs. He went on to work as a portfolio manager at Julian Robertson’s Tiger Capital and decided to set up Egerton after working with Armitage at Morgan Grenfell. The new fund is yet to be formally registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore as it currently has fewer than 30 clients.

The Site does not allow visitors to make investments in any of the Funds. If you require additional information, you should contact appropriate Egerton personnel.
Risk Notice
Egerton Capital wishes to draw your attention to the following. You should appreciate that the value of interests in any Fund, and any income from them, may go down as well as up and that if you choose to invest in any Fund, your capital will be at risk and you may therefore lose some or all of any amount that you choose to invest. Past performance should not be seen as an indication of future performance. Changes in rates of exchange between the base currency and the currency in which the investments of any Fund are denominated may additionally cause the value of the interests to go up or down. The material set out on the Site is provided for convenience and information purposes only and is subject to change without notice.
The investments covered in this material may not be dealt on a recognised or designated investment exchange for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the 'Act') and it may therefore be difficult for an investor to dispose of such investments otherwise than by way of redemption or to obtain reliable information about the extent of the risks to which his investment is exposed.
All the opinions, forecasts, estimates and comparable information given in this material are the non-binding opinions of our research personnel and neither Egerton Capital (UK) LLP nor any of its partners, officers and/or employees and affiliates makes any guarantees, representation or warranty, nor does any person accept any responsibility or liability for any loss or profit, indirect or other consequential losses or other economic losses suffered by any person arising from reliance upon any information, statement or opinion contained in this material (whether such losses are caused by the negligence of such person or otherwise).
