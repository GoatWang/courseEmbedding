(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as "anticipate", "believe", "plan", "expect", "future", "intend", and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing and actual results may differ materially from historical results or our predictions of future results.  OUR CORPORATE HISTORY AND BACKGROUND  Sandfield Ventures Corp. was incorporated in the state of Nevada in 2007. Its primary business was resource exploration in that state. Management of our company decided to take on a new direction for the business. The new strategy is to focus on consumer goods - primarily branded nutrition products and ingredients. On June 12, 2013 the Board of Directors approved an agreement and plan of merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary called Trident Brands Incorporated. At that point it affected the name change from Sandfield Ventures Corp. to Trident Brands Incorporated.  On July 9, 2013, our company's board of directors approved a resolution to effect a 4 for 1 forward split. Upon effect of the forward split, our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 to 300,000,000 shares of common stock and correspondingly, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock will be increased from 7,000,000 to 28,000,000 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001  On August 1, 2013, our directors approved the adoption of a 2013 Stock Option Plan which permits us to issue up to 4,200,000 shares of its common stock to directors, officers, employees and consultants of our company upon the exercise of stock options granted under the 2013 Stock Option Plan.  On December 23, 2013, we took on an agreement with Everlast World's Boxing Headquarters Corp., International Brand Management & Licensing. Through this agreement, we received a 15 year license to market and sell products in the nutritional foods and supplements category under the Everlast(R) brand. Trident's licensing agreement enables it to introduce a portfolio of nutritional products in categories such as supplements and functional foods using this brand mark.  Effective March 21, 2014, we appointed the following individuals as officers and directors:  * Donald MacPhee was appointed to our Board of Directors, Chairman of the Audit Committee and as a member of the Corporate Governance Committee.  Mark Holcombe resigned as Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer, and has been appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Compensation Committee. Mr. Holcombe's resignation as Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer was not the result of any disagreement with our company regarding its operations, policies, practices or otherwise.  On May 5, 2014, we entered into a Product Development Agreement with Continental Ingredients Canada Inc. with respect to our plan to commercialize nutritional supplements and functional food and beverage products for sales in North America.  Under the Agreement, we have engaged Continental Ingredients on an exclusive basis to provide services for the development, manufacturing and supply of our products for a period of five years commencing on May 5, 2014 and ending on May 5, 2019, such term to renew automatically for a further 12 months unless either party delivers written termination notice six months prior to the expiration of the initial term or renewal period.  On May 5, 2014, we appointed Robert Campbell and Karen Arseneault as special advisors.  Also on May 5, 2014, we granted an aggregate of 2,875,000 stock options to directors, officers, employees and consultants of our company pursuant to our 2013 Stock Plan. The stock options are exercisable for five years from the date of grant at exercise prices of $0.75 per share for shares vesting 12 months from the date of issuance, $1.00 per share for shares vesting 24 months from the date of issuance and $1.50 for shares vesting 36 months from the date of issuance. Of the 2,875,000 stock options granted, we granted:  1. 1,125,000 stock options to our President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Michael Browne;  2. 300,000 stock options to each of our directors, Donald MacPhee, Scott Chapman, Mark Holcombe;  3. 150,000 stock options to its controller, Peter Salvo; and  4. 350,000 stock options to each of our special advisors, Robert Campbell and Karen Arseneault.  Our administrative office is located at 200 South Executive Drive, Suite 101, Brookfield, Wisconsin, 53005. Our fiscal year end is November 30.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  We are still in our development stage and have generated no revenues to date.  We incurred operating expenses of $144,627 and $13,014 for the three months ended August 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These expenses consisted of general operating expenses, rent and professional fees incurred in connection with the day to day operation of our business and the preparation and filing of our required reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  We incurred operating expenses of $287,047 and $40,644 for the nine months ended August 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These expenses consisted of general operating expenses, rent and professional fees incurred in connection with the day to day operation of our business and the preparation and filing of our required reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Our net loss from inception (November 5, 2007) through August 31, 2014 was $422,786.  We have sold $75,000 in equity securities to date. We sold $15,000 in equity securities to our officer and director and $60,000 to independent investors.  The following table provides selected financial data about our company for the quarter ended August 31, 2014.   Balance Sheet Data: 8/31/14 ------------------- ------- Cash $ 34,315 Total assets $ 35,364 Total liabilities $ 383,150 Shareholders' equity $(347,785)  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Our cash balance at August 31, 2014 was $34,315 with $383,150 in outstanding liabilities. Of the liabilities there is a $41,776 note payable to Mark Holcombe, a director, for funds he has loaned the Company.  We also have two short term loans. The first of $200,000 from Rene Arseneault, which bears interest at the rate of 8.0% per annum, payable on maturity, calculated on the principle amount of the loan outstanding. Unless paid earlier, the loan and accrued and unpaid interest shall be payable in full on April 30, 2015. As of August 31, 2014, the full amount of the loan is outstanding and the accrued interest expense is $5,333.  The second of $100,000 from 1169822 Ontario Limited, which bears interest at the rate of 8.0% per annum, payable on maturity, calculated on the principle amount of the loan outstanding. Unless paid earlier, the loan and accrued and unpaid interest shall be payable in full on June 21, 2015. As of August 31, 2014, the full amount of the loan is outstanding and the accrued interest expense is $882.  Management believes the current funds available to the company will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. The company is currently exploring bridge financing options. We are a development stage company and have generated no revenue to date.  PLAN OF OPERATION  CASH REQUIREMENTS  Over the next 12 months we intend to carry on business as a food and nutrition product company. We anticipate that we will incur the following operating expenses during this period:   Estimated Funding Required During the Next 12 Months Expense Amount ($) ------- ---------- Professional fees 156,000 Rent 9,600 Sales, Travel and Marketing 280,000 Other general administrative expenses 60,000 Royalty obligations(1) 177,500 -------- Total $683,100 ======== ----------  We will require funds of approximately $683,100 over the next twelve months to operate our business. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on their investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable.  PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT  We do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment during the next 12 months.  GOING CONCERN  There is significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  As shown in the accompanying financial statements, we have incurred net losses of $422,786 since inception. This condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. In response to these conditions, we may raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, through an offering of debt securities or through borrowings from financial institutions or  individuals. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.  Our objective is the creation of value through strategic investments high growth early stage consumer brands businesses. We intend to focus on control investments in companies within the segment/sectors which are currently experiencing long term growth. Our goal is to provide our shareholders with private equity like returns through strategic investments in multiple branded platforms. The platforms we will be focusing on are:  * Brand Licenses or Consolidated Licenses  INVESTMENT STRATEGY  Trident will seek to acquire majority and/or control positions through common and preferred equity, senior secured, unsecured, and convertible debt in organizations who meet our investment hurdles. Through our management and directors vast expertise in both the consumer branded segment and investment experience, we seek to provide our shareholders with near term value and liquidity. Through strategic investment and controlled organic growth, Trident Brands will seek to provide their investments with solid short and long term returns and yields.  The Company strategic objective is:  * Make strategic controlled investments in high growth companies  COMPANIES & STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS  EVERLAST NUTRITION  Trident Brands finalized documentation to acquire Sports Nutrition Products Inc. the company has obtained a 15 year exclusive North American license for Everlast's functional and nutritional product brand segment from IBML (a worldwide leader in Brand licensing). This transaction closed in December 2013.  PRODUCT PRODUCTION  Trident Brands is currently in negotiations with vendors to outsource the manufacture of the products currently under the Everlast brand. These vendors would be responsible for the private label production of our products.  PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  On May 5, 2014, Trident Brands Incorporated (the "Company") entered into a Product Development Agreement with Continental Ingredients Canada Inc. ("Continental Ingredients") with respect to the Company's plan to commercialize nutritional supplements and functional food and beverage products for sales in North America (the "Agreement").  Under the Agreement the Company has engaged Continental Ingredients on an exclusive basis to provide services for the development, manufacture and supply of the Company's products for a period of five years commencing on May 5, 2014 and ending on May 5, 2019, such term to renew automatically for a further 12 months unless either party delivers written termination notice six months prior to the expiration of the initial term or renewal period.  Continental Ingredients will submit for approval by the Company, proposals for the production of any products. Once product specifications have been approved by the Company, the parties will enter into separate production agreements for the manufacturing, pricing and distribution of the products (the "Production Agreements"). The pricing of the products under the Production Agreements will result in a gross margin to Continental Ingredients of between 20 to 30 percent, as more particularly described in the Agreement.  The Company will remain the sole owner or licensee of all intellectual property rights associated with the products.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

	Basis of Presentation






	Except where the context otherwise requires, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”, “Trident” and “Trident Brands” or similar words and phrases are to Trident Brands Incorporated and its subsidiaries, taken together.





	In this report, all currency amounts are expressed in thousands of United States (“U.S.”) dollars (“$”), except per share data, unless otherwise stated.  Amounts expressed in other than U.S. dollars are noted accordingly.  For example, amounts if expressed in Canadian dollars are expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars and preceded by the symbol “Cdn $”.






	Forward-Looking Statements






	This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations and assumptions and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Generally, forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and are typically accompanied by words such as “anticipate”, “estimate”, “intend”, “project”, “potential”, “continue”, “believe”, “expect”, “could”, “would”, “should”, “might”, “plan”, “will”, “may”, “predict”, the negatives of such terms, and words and phrases of similar impact and include, but are not limited to references to expected increases in revenues and margins, growth opportunities, the success of new product launches and line extensions, our ability to finance our business, potential strategic investments, business strategies, competitive strengths, goals, references to key markets where we operate and the market for our securities.  These forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses we make in light of our experience and our interpretation of current conditions, historical trends and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we believe are appropriate in the circumstance.





	Whether actual results and developments will agree with our expectations and predictions is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations and predictions. We believe these factors include, but are not limited to, the following:









	·




	we have a limited operating history with significant losses and expect losses to continue for the foreseeable future;













	·




	there is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to recurring losses from operations, an accumulated deficit and insufficient cash resources on hand to meet our business objectives, all of which means that we may not be able to continue operations;













	·




	we could face intense competition, which could result in lower revenues and higher expenditures and could adversely affect our results of operations;













	·




	we are governed by only three persons serving as directors and officers which may lead to faulty corporate governance;






	 







	·




	we must attract and maintain key personnel or our business may fail;






	 







	·




	we may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our future capital needs due to changes in general economic conditions;













	·




	our business and operating results could be harmed if we fail to manage our growth or change;













	·




	we have a limited operating history and if we are not successful in growing our business, then we may have to scale back or even cease our ongoing business operations;











	3

















	·




	if our intellectual property is not adequately protected, then we may not be able to compete effectively and we may not be profitable;













	·




	if we are the subject of an intellectual property infringement claim, the cost of participating in any litigation could impact our ability to stay in business;













	·




	we could lose our competitive advantages if we are not able to protect any of our food and nutritional products and intellectual property rights against infringement, and any related litigation could be time-consuming and costly;













	·




	if we fail to effectively manage our growth our future business results could be harmed and our managerial and operational resources may be strained;













	·




	if we fail to effectively manage our growth our future business results could be harmed and our managerial and operational resources may be strained;













	·




	our services may become obsolete and unmarketable if we are unable to respond adequately to rapidly changing technology and customer demands;













	·




	our failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products or product enhancements could significantly harm product sales and harm our financial condition and operating results;













	·




	if we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to adequately meet the changing needs of our customers, some of our products could fail in the marketplace, which could negatively impact our revenues, financial condition and operating results;













	·




	we are affected by laws and governmental regulations with potential penalties or claims, which could harm our financial condition and operating results;













	·




	since we rely on independent third parties for the manufacture and supply of certain of our products, if these third parties fail to reliably supply products to us at required levels of quality and which are manufactured in compliance with applicable laws, then our financial condition and operating results would be harmed;













	·




	we may incur material product liability claims, which could increase our costs and harm our financial condition and operating results;













	·




	unless we can generate sufficient cash from operations or raise additional funds, we may not be able to meet our debt obligations;













	·




	our customers generally are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us;













	·




	if we do not manage our supply chain effectively, our operating results may be adversely affected;













	·




	our stock price may be volatile, which may result in losses to our shareholders;













	·




	our common shares are thinly traded and our shareholders may be unable to sell at or near ask prices, or at all;













	·




	the market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively small and developing company, which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. Our shareholders may be unable to sell your common stock at or above their purchase price if at all, which may result in substantial losses;








	4

















	·




	we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to our common shareholders

	 

	and as a result shareholders may only realize a return when the shares are sold;













	·




	we are listed on the OTCQB quotation system and our common stock is subject to “penny stock” rules which could negatively impact our liquidity and our shareholders’ ability to sell their shares;













	·




	volatility in our common share price may subject us to securities litigation;













	·




	the elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Nevada law and the existence of indemnification rights of our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees; and













	·




	our business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.









	Consequently all forward-looking statements made herein are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that our actual results or the developments we anticipate will be realized. The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this report.

	TRIDENT BRANDS INCORPORATED




	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


	February 28, 2017


	(Unaudited)








	NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS





	Trident Brands Incorporated (f/k/a Sandfield Ventures Corp.) (“we”, “our”, “the Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on November 5, 2007.  The Company was formed to engage in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural resource properties.





	The Company is now focused on the development of high growth branded and private label consumer products and ingredients within the nutritional supplement, life sciences and food and beverage categories. The Company is in its early growth stage and has transitioned out of its shell status with the Super-8 filing at the end of August, 2014. Activities to date have focused on capital formation, organizational development and execution of its branded and private label consumer products and ingredients business plan.


	 


	NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	Basis of Presentation






	The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of Trident Brands Incorporated have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in Trident’s Form 10-K filed with SEC.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein.  The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for fiscal 2016 as reported in the Form 10-K have been omitted.





	NOTE 3. LIQUIDITY





	On September 26, 2016, the Company completed a long term financing with a non-US institutional investor, receiving proceeds of $4,100,000 through the issuance of a secured convertible promissory note. The investor has agreed to make additional investments at the Company’s request of up to $5,900,000 ($10,000,000 in the aggregate). On February 28, 2017, the Company had $823,593 in cash and has access to $5,900,000 available from the investor. The Company feels this represents substantial liquid resources (cash & available financing), sufficient to meet the Company’s obligations for the next twelve months.





	NOTE 4. WARRANTS AND OPTIONS





	The total outstanding stock options as of February 28, 2017 are 2,125,000. The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to value the stock options at $571,624. For the period ended February 28, 2017, the Company expensed $15,835 as compensation expense compared to $81,303 in the previous year. Following are the assumptions used for the shares vested 12, 24 and 36 months from the date of issuance: Discount rate .9%, 1.29%, 1.29%; Volatility 68.35%, 67.35%, 65.50%; and Term 3.0, 3.5, 4.0.

	NOTE 6. LOAN PAYABLE – THIRD PARTY





	On February 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with CIC whereby the Company received proceeds of $200,000 on March 4, 2016 in return for a $200,000 secured promissory note due 12 months from the issuance date, bearing interest at the rate of 10%


	per annum, plus 100,000 warrants to purchase common shares of the Company at an exercise price of $1.35 per share for three years from the date of issue. As of February 28, 2017, the full amount of the loan is outstanding. See note 4 for valuation of warrants. The loan was subsequently paid back on March 3, 2017.





	NOTE 7. CONVERTIBLE NOTE





	On January 29, 2015, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a non-US institutional investor whereby it agreed to sell an aggregate principal amount of $2,300,000 of senior secured convertible debentures, convertible into shares of the company’s common stock.





	The Company received $1,800,000 of the funds from the transaction on February 5, 2015. The balance of $500,000 was received on May 14, 2015.





	The convertible debentures are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion price of $.71 per share, for an aggregate of up to 3,239,437 shares. The debentures originally accrued interest at 6% per annum. On September 26, 2016 the Company entered into an amendment agreement related to these convertible debentures whereby the applicable interest rate was increased from 6% to 8% and provisions added to allow the investor to transfer, sell or hypothecate the convertible notes subject to applicable securities laws. The maturity date of the notes was also extended through September 30, 2019.





	Due to the note being convertible to common shares of the Company, a beneficial conversion feature analysis was performed. The intrinsic value of the conversion feature was $647,888 which was recognized as debt discount. As of February 28, 2017, the full amount of the debt discount has been amortized.





	On September 26, 2016, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a non-US institutional investor, pursuant to which, in consideration for proceeds of $4,100,000, the Company issued a secured convertible promissory note in the amount of $4,100,000. Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, the investor has agreed, from time to time after January 1, 2017, to make additional investments at the Company’s request of up to $5,900,000 ($10,000,000 in the aggregate) in one or more tranches of not less than one tranche during any 60 day period. The funding of any tranche under the agreement (other than the first $4,100,000 which has been funded) is subject to the mutual agreement of the parties as to the use of funds. The parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith to pre-approve use of funds with 120 days following September 26, 2016.





	The Company intends to use the proceeds of the secured convertible note for general working capital purposes including, without limitation, settlement of accounts payable and repayment of mature loans.

	In consideration of each advance made by the investor pursuant to the securities purchase agreement, the Company will issue to the investor a convertible promissory note of equal value, maturing three years after issuance, and bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum. Each note will


	be secured in first priority against the present and after acquired assets of the Company, and will be


	convertible in whole or in part at the option of the holder into common shares of the Company at a conversion price of $.60 per share.





	Due to the note being convertible to common shares of the Company, a beneficial conversion feature analysis was performed. The intrinsic value of the conversion feature was $1,366,667 which was recognized as debt discount. As of February 28, 2017, $192,751 of debt discount was amortized of which $111,920 was amortized during the current 3 month period and $80,831 in the prior year. The unamortized discount is $1,173,916.





	The Company analyzed the embedded conversion option for derivative accounting consideration under ASC 815-15 “Derivatives and Hedging” and determined that the conversion option should be classified as equity.





	NOTE 8. INTANGIBLE ASSETS





	On January 22, 2015, pursuant to a Deed of Assignment dated effective January 20, 2015, the Company entered into an Emulsion Supply Agreement with Oceans Omega LLC which represents the rights acquired pursuant to the Deed of Assignment. The Emulsion Supply Agreement provides the Company with the non-exclusive right and license (without the right to sublicense) to purchase, market, promote, sell and distribute Oceans Omega LLC’s omega-3 emulsions for use in the development, production, processing, manufacture and sale of food and beverages and exclusive rights to purchase, market, promote, sell and distribute Oceans Omega emulsions for meats, for human or animal consumption. On January 6, 2016 the Company issued 3,000,000 shares to mark the closing of the Deed of Assignment and the Emulsion Supply Agreement, which did not specify the amount of consideration payable by the Company when they were executed on January 20, 2015. The consideration payable was subsequently established by the parties at a market value of $2,700,000 and common shares issued as compensation based on the closing price of the common shares as quoted on the OTC Markets quotation systems on January 6, 2016. The value of the license is being amortized over the remaining contractual life which is 9 years. As of February 28,


	2017, the net value of the license was $2,350,000 after amortizing $350,000.







	NOTE 9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS





	On March 3, 2017 the loan of $200,000 payable to a third party and bearing interest at 8% per annum was paid back.

	While still in the early stages of commercialization, Brain Armor® sales in the first quarter of 2017 increased to $15,642 versus $5,361 in the prior year. This was offset by a decrease in Everlast® Nutrition sales in the period resulting in revenue of $16,686 versus $19,195 in the prior year. Gross Profit increased to $7,482 or 44.8% of revenues versus $5,375 or 28.0% of revenues in the prior year, indicative of an improved product mix. We expect Brain Armor, Private Label Sports Nutrition and Everlast product sales to ramp-up significantly over the course of 2017 as commercial efforts gain traction, distribution expansion is realized and product innovation enters the market.

	Operating expenses for the three month period ended February 28, 2017 were $726,200 as compared to $616,284 for the comparative period in 2016, an increase of 18%.  The increase in our operating expenses was primarily due to increased general and administrative costs and marketing and promotional expenses as we build out our organization and roll-out our product offering.  These costs are expected to continue to increase throughout 2017 as we continue to develop and commercialize our product offerings.


	 


	Other Expenses





	Other expenses for the three month period ended February 28, 2017 increased to $253,732 versus $168,178 in the comparative period in 2016. The increase was due to an increase in interest expense due to higher debt levels and the impact of certain other items including the beneficial conversion feature related to the convertible note entered into in 2016.

	Our objective is to provide our shareholders with solid returns through strategic investments across multiple consumer product and food ingredient platforms. The platforms we are focusing on include:









	·




	Life science technologies and related products that have applications to a range of consumer products;






	 


	 




	16









	 






	·




	Nutritional supplements and related consumer goods providing defined benefits to the consumer; and













	·




	Functional foods and beverages ingredients with defined health and wellness benefits.









	We are building our business through strategic investments in high growth early stage consumer brands and functional ingredients platforms within segment/sectors which we believe offer long term growth potential.  We are focused on three core strategies underpinning our objectives:









	·




	To execute our multi-tier brand and innovation strategy to drive revenue;













	·




	To aggressively manage our asset light business model to drive a low cost platform; and













	·




	To drive disciplines leading to increased investor awareness and ability to finance and govern growing operations.









	While we have yet to realize break even cash flows or profitability, we believe we are making progress against our goals and objectives, and expect revenues and margins to increase as we begin commercializing the products within our portfolio. All three of our product platforms show solid potential in the markets where they compete and both our

	Everlast

	® and

	Brain Armor

	® product lines are now in the market and generating revenues. Our strategy was to first establish listings for these products with non-bricks and mortar accounts, and this has been successful.  Brain

	Armor

	® has now been listed at a large retail account as well, and we expect listings for Everlast® to follow.  The development of Oceans Omega as an ingredient for food and beverage products is ongoing, and given the longer sales cycle for ingredients, we expect to realize revenues later in fiscal 2107 both through external customer product development and also internally via potential line extensions for both the E

	verlast

	® and

	Brain Armor

	® product lines.






	Liquidity and Capital Resources






	Our cash balance at February 28, 2017 was $823,593. Management believes the current funds available to the company will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months.





	As of February 28, 2017 we had a loan of $200,000 payable to a third party (CIC) bearing interest at 8% per annum due March 4 2017. The loan was subsequently paid back on March 3, 2017.





	On January 29, 2015, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with a non-US institutional investor whereby we agreed to sell an aggregate principal amount of $2,300,000 of senior secured convertible debentures, convertible into shares of the company’s common stock.  We received $1,800,000 of the funds from the transaction on February 5, 2015 and the balance of $500,000 on May 14, 2015.  On September 26, 2016, we entered into a Convertible Promissory Note Amendment Agreement with this investor whereby we agreed to extend the maturity date and amend the interest payable on the senior secured convertible debentures, whereby we extended the term of the notes through September 30, 2019 and interest rate was increased from 6% per annum to 8% per annum.   The convertible debentures are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion price of $.71 per share for an aggregate of up to 3,239,437 shares.





	On September 26, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with a non-US institutional investor   pursuant to which, in consideration for proceeds of $4,100,000, we issued a secured convertible promissory note in the amount of $4,100,000.  Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the investor has agreed, from time to time after January 1, 2017, to make additional investments at our request of up to $5,900,000 ($10,000,000 in the aggregate) in one or more tranches of not less than one tranche during any 60 day period. The funding of any tranche under the agreement (other than the first $4,100,000 which has been funded) is subject to the mutual agreement of the parties as to the use of funds. The parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith to pre-approve use of funds within 120 days following September 26, 2016.  We intend to use the proceeds of the secured convertible note for general working capital purposes including, without limitation, settlement of accounts payable and repayment of mature loans. In consideration of each advance made by the investor pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, we will issue to the investor a


	 




	17








	 


	convertible promissory note of equal value, maturing three years after issuance, and bearing interest at the rate of 8% per annum. Each note will be secured in first priority against the present and after acquired assets of the Company, and will be convertible in whole or in part at the option of the holder into common shares of the Company at a conversion price per share of $.60, equal to a 25% discount to the 10 day average closing price of the Company’s common stock for the period immediately preceding the issuance of the applicable note. Due to the note being convertible to the Company common shares, a beneficial conversion feature analysis was performed. The intrinsic value of the conversion feature was $1,366,667 which was recognized as debt discount. As of February 28, 2017, $192,751 of debt discount was amortized of which $111,920 was amortized during the current 3 month period and $80,831 in the prior year. The unamortized discount is $1,173,916.






	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.


	 



	Contractual Obligations



	 



	Except for the transactions noted in Business Developments, there have been no material changes outside the normal course of business in our contractual obligations since January 3, 2015.


	 



	Critical Accounting Estimates




	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related revenues and expenses, and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements.  The estimates and assumptions made require us to exercise our judgment and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  We continually evaluate the information that forms the basis of our estimates and assumptions as our business and the business environment generally changes.  The use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements.  There have been no material changes to the critical accounting estimates disclosed under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, of the Form 10-K.

	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



	 




	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 






	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officer, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our company, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared.

	Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting



	 



	Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our Story












A Sea Change In The Fishing Industry


Here at Trident, catching fish isn't just our business. It's our livelihood. It's our calling. We are all fishermen here, and catching the purest and healthiest seafood is what we do — it's what we've done for more than 40 years. And if we stay true to our beliefs in protecting the oceans where we fish, it's what we'll be doing 40 years from now, too.

The Journey North

 




The story of Trident Seafoods starts back in 1961, when a 19-year-old kid with nothing but a dream drove an old Ford from Tennessee to Seattle, in search of a great adventure at sea.
That 19-year-old kid was Chuck Bundrant. And that little “adventure” stretched into a 12-year journey across Alaska, aboard any ship he could find, discovering everything there is to know about fishing and crabbing along the way.
Chuck met two other likeminded crab fishermen in the early 1970s, Kaare Ness and Mike Jacobson. All three pooled their money together and built the Billikin—a 135-foot boat that not only changed the course of their partnership, but also changed the course of the entire seafood industry. The ingenious Billikin was the first vessel of its kind to feature crab cookers and freezing equipment onboard, so their fresh catch could be processed as soon as it was pulled out of the water instead of coming all the way back to shore.



In the winter of 1961, Chuck Bundrant drove his old ’53 Ford from Tennessee to Seattle. But not before snapping a quick shot with his father.






Soon after, the pioneering partnership expanded once more when the three fishermen joined with Edd Perry and his Bellingham-based company San Juan Seafoods. Now they had all the resources they needed to match their ambitions.
That partnership over 40 years ago marked the beginning of Trident Seafoods. And that 19-year-old kid from Tennessee would become its founder and CEO. Chuck Bundrant could never have imagined how far that little “adventure” back in ‘61 was going to take him.

Chuck and his crew of the Tugidak are all smiles as they pose with the biggest king crab they’ve ever seen.








It took a lot of hard work and determination to make Trident what it is today, and Chuck was never afraid to get his feet wet or his hands dirty.

Today, that dream is still alive and stronger than ever. Trident Seafoods has become the largest vertically-integrated seafood company in North America since its founding, yet we still hold true to the same beliefs we held four decades ago. Now more than ever, we believe that fish is our future, because it’s the healthiest protein we can put in our bodies. And we believe that this gift from the oceans is one we can never take for granted. We treat the sea with the respect it deserves, working toward sustaining a thriving and abundant ocean for generations to come.
Because we are fishermen at our core, and we have a bond with the ocean—when it prospers, we prosper too.



Chuck has every reason to smile. That little company he started over 40 years ago is now the largest vertically-integrated seafood company in North America.

Family of Fishermen

 




Many other seafood companies buy the fish they sell to you. We don’t. We catch our own. 
 
We know our seafood is the purest, freshest, and best-tasting seafood you will ever buy, because we catch it ourselves. We have our own fleet of state-of-the-art fishing vessels, where our fish are caught, prepared and frozen right onboard. And we partner with only the most experienced fishermen—fishermen who love what they do for a living, who have been with us for decades, and who respect the oceans as much as we do. 



Measuring 124 feet long with a crew of five, the steel fishing vessel Gladiator has been catching wild Pollock in the Alaskan waters for 36 years.






We partner with thousands of independent and dedicated Alaskan fishermen—like the Morovic family. They’re a small, family-run business who have been catching wild salmon for us on their salmon-seining ship Miss Danica for years. All the fishermen in our extended family love what they do for a living, or they wouldn’t be working with Trident if they didn’t.



The Morovic family is one of the many independent, family-run businesses that catch wild Alaskan salmon for Trident.






Meet Our Captains
In addition to partnering with independent fishermen, Trident also has its own fleet of fishing vessels that are skippered by only the most experienced captains. 








  





Captain Ed French is skipper of the Gladiator, and he’s proudly been fishing for Trident for 22 years now.








Captain Howard Malcolm has been a fisherman for 36 years, with 28 of those years working for Trident onboard the Northern Patriot.








Captain Craig Jenssen is skipper of the 124-foot steel catcher-vessel Dominator. He’s been fishing for Trident for 23 years.








Captain Rick Clark is skipper of the fishing vessel Columbia. He’s got 28 years of experience at sea, with the last 22 of those years working for Trident.

And not only is Trident a family of fishermen, but we are also a family-owned business. We don’t answer to investment bankers like some other seafood companies. We only answer to our customers, our fishermen, and our employees. Chuck Bundrant founded Trident Seafoods on family principles some 40 years ago, and now his son Joe captains the ship as CEO.



Chuck and his son Joe onboard the Bountiful in 1979, and today. We’re proud to be family-owned and operated, with Joe now serving as Trident’s CEO.

The Trident Advantage

 




We’ve made our life from the sea for over 40 years now, and no one knows how to do it better than Trident. We’ve spent so much time catching fish that saltwater runs in our blood, our sweat, and our tears. And we’ve learned quite a few things along the way…
We know we sell the best seafood available today because we control every part of the process, every step of the way—from the second it leaves the icy Alaskan waters to the moment you prepare it.



This fierce bald eagle keeps a close eye on the crew at our plant in Akutan, Alaska. He knows good seafood when he sees it.






How can we be so sure? We already told you about our state-of-the-art fishing vessels, where each and every fish is caught, prepared, and frozen right onboard, within minutes of capture. But we’ve also developed innovative processing plants along Alaska’s shores in the heart of the fishing grounds, strategically located to ensure the freshest fish possible.
In facilities across the lower 48 states, we take Alaska’s bounty and provide you with convenient, easy-to-love seafood entrees and value-added products.

Seafood lovers around the world prize Trident’s superior taste, quality and health benefits. 






Our Catch
The Trident logo is your assurance of quality that every product we sell is held to the highest possible standards. And that’s a pretty tall order. Because while we specialize in wild Alaskan seafood, we also offer a lot of other species from around the world.
Our Catch



While our focus is bringing you the best wild Alaskan seafood, Trident also offers a wide variety of species from around the globe.






It’s our Responsibility 
For us, sustainability isn’t just a badge or a stamp to make our products more desirable. Sustainability is an investment in our future. It’s a way to ensure this resource is still around for our kids, and their kids. It’s why we invest in and support the local communities where we fish. Sustainable, responsible fishing is one of our core beliefs, and it’s also one of the many reasons we love fishing in the beautiful Alaskan waters—they’ve actually written into their state constitution that all fisheries must follow the strictest of sustainability guidelines.
Responsibility



Our bond with the ocean runs deep. We proudly participate in some of the most sustainable fisheries in the world.






Fish. It’s our Future.
Fish leave a lighter environmental footprint on our planet than pork, poultry, dairy and beef. Fish is better for our bodies, our minds and the environment than any other source of protein out there. Fish is the way to nourish ourselves and keep us healthy without neglecting the earth in the process. It’s what 40 years of fishing experience has taught us.
And by partnering with organizations who share our vision—like The Seafood Nutrition Partnership, The Genuine Alaska Pollock Producers, The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, and The National Fisheries Institute—we can ensure a responsible stewardship of Alaskan seafood for generations to come. 



Compared to land-based proteins like cattle and poultry, wild-caught Alaska Pollock leaves a much lower carbon footprint on our planet.
