It also provides property, casualty and health insurance through its agency subsidiaries and provides insurance premium financing and membership association services through its other subsidiaries. The Company's operations are categorized between the Company's segment, the insurance company operation and other insurance operations.

All policies are produced by a network of brokers and retail agents.The Company's subsidiary, American Acceptance Corporation (AAC), is a licensed insurance premium finance company that provides insurance purchasers with the ability to pay their insurance premiums on an installment basis. The premium finance company pays the insurance premium to the insurance company in return for a premium finance note from the insured.

(AIB), markets health insurance in California as a general agency and an independent broker through non-affiliated insurance companies for individuals and groups.

“Our fourth quarter had no surprises;
it was better than the third quarter but not good enough to satisfy our growth and profit objectives,” said Cary L. Cheldin,
Unico’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Although the 2016 year’s financial results were disappointing,
the work we did in 2016 serves as a solid foundation for our long term future success. In addition to continuing our work with
independent strategic advisors, we also engaged investment advisors, IT advisors, marketing firms, and a product development firm.
We are working towards improved growth and profitability moving forward.”

Balance sheet strength and high profitability of an insurance company are highly preferable.

COMPANY NEWS

                    UNICO AMERICAN SAYS IT IS IN TALKS ABOUT A MERGER                
The Unico American Corporation said yesterday that it was in preliminary talks to merge with another company. The announcement sent Unico's shares up $2.50, to $17.50. Unico, a Woodland Hills, Calif., insurance company, is up 33 percent this week and 67 percent in the last 12 months. No information was provided about the prospective partner, and Unico said ''significant issues'' must be resolved before any deal was struck. Unico sells property, casualty, life and health insurance, and it makes loans to cover premium payments.











                    Market Place; Insurer's stock suffers quake damage despite little exposure.                
AFTER the Northridge earthquake last week, some insurance stocks experienced their own seismic shock. Investors' fears about potential losses drove down the price of the Unico American Corporation's shares by 11 percent, to $6.125, in over-the-counter trading last Monday. The company is based in Woodland Hills, Calif., less than 10 miles from the epicenter of the quake.











                    Unico American                
The Unico American Corporation, an insurance holding company dealing primarily with small businesses through its Crusader Insurance unit, posted a first-quarter profit, in contrast to a loss a year earlier because of claims related to the Los Angeles riots. Property-casualty premiums have risen 55 percent since California moved to shut down some 250 unlicensed insurers.










FINANCE/NEW ISSUES

                    8-Currency Offer By World Bank                
The World Bank offered an eight-currency borrowing, amounting to $321.4 million, from the Unico Group of European and Japanese cooperative banks. The borrowing, which was coordinated by DG Bank in Frankfurt, consists of eight installments, two semi-private placements and two loans, each of which will be repayable in full on its respective maturity date.
