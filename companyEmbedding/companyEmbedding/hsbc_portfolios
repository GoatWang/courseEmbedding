About Us
HSBC Overview
The HSBC Group is one of the world's largest banking and financial services organisations. The Group has offices in 71 countries and territories, serves over 46 million customers worldwide and has assets of USD2,608 billion as at 30 June 2016.
HSBC Global Asset Management in India is part of the core global investment management business of the HSBC Group. With dedicated investment professionals across Europe, Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Americas, HSBC Global Asset Management has strong global investment capabilities that are delivered to clients locally. For institutions, corporates and financial intermediaries, a comprehensive range of investment management solutions are offered. For high net worth individuals, HSBC Global Asset Management works with relationship managers to provide bespoke portfolio management services.

A Guide to HSBC Portfolio Management Services
HSBC Global Asset Management, India started its Portfolio Management Services (PMS) business on 27 March 2006. PMS business offered segregated mandate and advisory solutions to large institutional investors, insurance companies, High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs), etc.
HSBC Asset Management (India) Pvt. Ltd., under its PMS platform, has been mandated (one of four) fund managers by The Employees‘ Provident Fund Organization, India (EPFO). EPFO is one of the largest provident fund institutions in the world. The mandate puts us in the top league of asset managers in the country, and positions us well to handle similar institutional/trust/PF mandates.

Areas of Business
Individual
We launched our first portfolios, HSBC Alpha Account Signature Portfolio and HSBC Alpha Account Strategic Portfolio in 2006. These are designed for investors who seek capital appreciation through investment in equity and equity related instruments. Our portfolios are built around our expertise in Indian equities. They also reflect our active, unconstrained, management approach.
However, starting 2015, we have discontinued offering these products to individual clients.
Institutional
PMS offers segregated mandate and advisory solutions to a wide range of institutions including institutional investors, large individual investors, welfare trusts among others. This includes mandates where both the advisory and execution on the portfolio are conducted by us, as well as mandates wherein we only provide advice on a non binding basis, and the final investment decision and execution is undertaken directly by the customer.
HSBC Portfolio Management Services offers customised investment solutions for each client based on specific requirements and investment objectives. However, these are offered above a certain prescribed threshold which at the discretion of the Portfolio Manager may be changed from time to time. While institutional investors can benefit from segregated portfolios based on individual, bespoke specifications, they may also wish to consider our existing portfolio range.

Investment philosophy and process

Equity
Fixed Income


Equity
Our investment process has strict investment guidelines that ensure we contain portfolio risk within specified levels and run a diversified portfolio to deliver consistent risk adjusted returns to our investors. On a bottom-up approach, we believe that company fundamentals are the primary determinants of stock performance.
We highlight below some key parameters that we use in our investment process.

We seek to invest in companies that in our view have sustainability of business growth and are trading at a substantial discount to their true business (intrinsic) value. 
We believe that, over time, the price of a stock could rise to reflect the value of the underlying company. As such, we are patient investors and not market timers.
We believe that this approach to investing is capable of generating consistent investment returns over the long term through power of compounding.
We adopt a blend of value and growth strategies for stock picking.
Asset allocation is driven primarily by the portfolio mandate. In the case of structured products (for e.g. CPPI products), the model drives the asset allocation. In long only portfolio mandates, we believe that stock picking abilities and patient investing are capable of generating better and consistent returns as compared to market timing.
Across equity portfolio themes, it's a pre-dominantly “buy and hold” strategy. We may hedge portfolios to protect potential downside through the use of F&O and effective use of cash.
The investment decision-making is process driven involving the Fund Manager and the sector specialist. Decision-making starts with the company management meeting to assess the business, size of opportunity and the future potential. Financial inputs, projections over the next two years and valuation are key inputs into the decision.


In evaluating potential equity investments, we focus on the following fundamental characteristics:

Sustainability of Business growth and its ability to generate free cash flows and higher Return on Equity (RoE). 
Quality of Management in terms of its vision, cost & innovation competence along with business ethics and integrity.
Value of business and whether the market price is at a significant discount to our estimate of underlying business value. Also, the number of price-value mismatches is taken into account to ascertain if it would be able to offer reasonable margin of safety, with an endeavour to reduce the level of risk.

In arriving at the value of business or company, we look at a variety of factors. Key focus is on cash flow, economic value added and also analyse trends in returns on equity and capital, EV/EBITDA multiple, P/E multiple, Price to book and PEG ratio. We examine these on an absolute as well as relative basis. While looking at these parameters we closely monitor market expectations to identify potential positive / negative surprises.
We evaluate companies on the basis of its cash flows discounted at an appropriate rate (DCF- discounted cash flow methodology). We believe that the valuation of a company is nothing but the cash flow it can generate over the life of its business. In addition we also use other tools like P/E, ROE, ROCE and qualitative criteria like management quality.

Fixed Income
We believe that

The Fixed Income Market offers a number of attractive investment opportunities, which we endeavour to capture with a rigorous but flexible investment process. 
A given level of conviction in our views should result in the same amount of risk in a portfolio over time.
Product focus is the key to creating excellence across our entire product range.
Credit and Duration are the key determinants of performance in a fixed income portfolio.
Curve Positioning and Individual security selection are also drivers of the fixed income market.
Active management of the above drivers has the ability to enhance returns and may outperform passive investing.
Effective control of risk is an essential element in the management of fixed income portfolios.

The investment process that we follow is an adaptation of the HSBC Global Investment Process for Asset Management. The four components that we monitor in terms of criticality to risk/return performance on a fixed income portfolio are Duration, Credit, Curve Positioning & Individual Security Selection. The process is a “Top Down – Bottom Up” approach with a Top Down perspective being applied to Duration and Credit and a Bottom Up perspective being applied on Curve Positioning and Individual Security Selection. 

The process is run periodically or at any intermittent time frame should the Investment Team see the need if market/economic events warrant.
From a portfolio construction perspective, the team looks at liquidity, spread and relative valuation of the credit before it enters the portfolio. A strong bias is maintained on liquidity to enable the fund manager to churn the portfolio and execute a change in view should he so desire.
Starting 2015, we have discontinued offering PMS products to individual clients.

Please remember that the value of investments, and any income received from them can fall as well as rise, is not guaranteed and you may not get back the amount you invested. 

This could also happen as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, particularly where overseas securities are held or where investments are converted from one currency to another. We always recommend that any Investments held should be viewed as a medium to long-term investment, at least five years.

This information contained on this webpage does not constitute investment advice, a solicitation or a recommendation to buy, sell or subscribe to any investment. It is not intended to provide and should not be relied upon for accounting, legal or tax advice.
HSBC Global Asset Management is the marketing name for the asset management businesses of HSBC Holdings Plc. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. serves as the investment adviser to the HSBC Funds. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., member FINRA, is the distributor of the HSBC Funds and is not affiliated with the adviser. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., member NYSE, FINRA and SIPC, is a sub-distributor of the HSBC Funds. Affiliates of HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. may receive fees for providing various services to the funds.

Risk Considerations: 
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective or will work under all market conditions. The value of investments may go down as well as up and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks, which should be considered carefully along with their investment objectives and fees. Equity investments fluctuate in value based on changes to an individual company’s financial condition and overall market conditions. Investments in foreign markets involve risks such as currency rate fluctuations, potential differences in accounting and taxation policies, as well as possible political, economic, and market risks. These risks are heightened for investments in emerging markets which are also subject to greater illiquidity and volatility than developed foreign markets. Frontier markets generally have smaller economies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging markets, and therefore investing in frontier markets can magnify the risks of investing in emerging markets. Fixed income is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed income security that result from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, a portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Investments in high yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are often considered speculative investments and have significantly higher credit risk than investment grade securities. The prices of high yield securities, which may be less liquid than higher rated securities, may be more volatile and more vulnerable to adverse market, economic or political conditions. Risk is inherent in all investing. You could lose money by investing in the Money Market Fund (‘MM Fund’). Although the MM Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the MM Fund is not a deposit of HSBC Bank USA, N.A. and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The MM Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the MM Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the MM Fund at any time. For complete risk considerations, please refer to the fund's prospectus.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company and the mutual fund. For clients of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., please call 1-888-525-5757 for more information. For other investors and prospective investors, please call the Funds directly at 1-800-782-8183. You can download the fund prospectus from this site.  Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
US persons (both entities and individuals) are subject to US taxation on their worldwide income and may be subject to tax and other filing obligations with respect to their US and non-US accounts. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a US law designed to prevent the use of non-US accounts or non-US entities to avoid US taxation of income and assets.

Risk Considerations:

        Past performance is no guarantee of future results. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective or will work under all market conditions. The value of investments may go down as well as up and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks, which should be considered carefully along with their investment objectives and fees. Equity investments fluctuate in value based on changes to an individual company's financial condition and overall market conditions. Investments in foreign markets involve risks such as currency rate fluctuations, potential differences in accounting and taxation policies, as well as possible political, economic, and market risks. These risks are heightened for investments in emerging markets which are also subject to greater illiquidity and volatility than developed foreign markets. Frontier markets generally have smaller economies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging markets, and therefore investing in frontier markets can magnify the risks of investing in emerging markets. Fixed income is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed income security that result from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, a portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Investments in high yield securities (commonly referred to as "junk bonds") are often considered speculative investments and have significantly higher credit risk than investment grade securities. The prices of high yield securities, which may be less liquid than higher rated securities, may be more volatile and more vulnerable to adverse market, economic or political conditions. Real Estate investments are subject to many of the risks associated with direct real estate ownership, such as changes in economic conditions, credit risk, property taxes, zoning laws, and interest rate fluctuations. Derivatives can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on performance. Non-diversification occurs when portfolio assets are invested in fewer securities, industries, currencies or countries than in diversified investment portfolios, Non-diversification increases risk because each investment has a greater effect on portfolio performance and can also be affected by single economic, political or regulatory occurrences. Geographic concentration occurs when a portfolio concentrates its investments in one country or region. Portfolio performance is expected to be closely tied to the social, political, and economic conditions in that country or region, and may therefore be more volatile than the performance of more geographically diversified funds.
        
        Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing. 
        
        The HSBC funds are sub-funds of the HSBC Global Investment Funds, a Luxembourg domiciled SICAV. All applications are made on the basis of the current HSBC Global Investment Funds Prospectus, Key Investor Information Document (KIID), Supplementary Information Document (SID) and most recent annual and semi-annual reports, which can be obtained from  https://investorfunds.us.hsbc.com/default.fs (under Offshore Funds Literature) or free of charge from HSBC Global Asset Management (UK) Limited, 8 Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London E14 5HQ, UK. Investors and potential investors should read and note the risk warnings in the prospectus and relevant KIID and additionally, in the case of retail clients, the information contained in the supporting SID.
        
        US persons (both entities and individuals) are subject to US taxation on their worldwide income and may be subject to tax and other filing obligations with respect to their US and non-US accounts.  Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act  (FATCA) is a US law designed to prevent the use of non-US accounts or non-US entities to avoid US taxation of income and assets. To meet this objective, FATCA imposes on US and non-US entities certain documentation, due diligence, withholding and reporting requirements with respect to accounts and certain payments. Investors should consult their independent tax advisors about investment tax implications.

HSBC Global Asset Management is the marketing name for the asset management businesses of HSBC Holdings Plc. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. serves as the investment adviser to the HSBC Funds. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., member FINRA, is the distributor of the HSBC Funds and is not affiliated with the adviser. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., member NYSE, FINRA and SIPC, is a sub-distributor of the HSBC Funds. Affiliates of HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. may receive fees for providing various services to the funds.

Risk Considerations: 
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective or will work under all market conditions. The value of investments may go down as well as up and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks, which should be considered carefully along with their investment objectives and fees. Equity investments fluctuate in value based on changes to an individual company’s financial condition and overall market conditions. Investments in foreign markets involve risks such as currency rate fluctuations, potential differences in accounting and taxation policies, as well as possible political, economic, and market risks. These risks are heightened for investments in emerging markets which are also subject to greater illiquidity and volatility than developed foreign markets. Frontier markets generally have smaller economies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging markets, and therefore investing in frontier markets can magnify the risks of investing in emerging markets. Fixed income is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed income security that result from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, a portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Investments in high yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are often considered speculative investments and have significantly higher credit risk than investment grade securities. The prices of high yield securities, which may be less liquid than higher rated securities, may be more volatile and more vulnerable to adverse market, economic or political conditions. Risk is inherent in all investing. You could lose money by investing in the Money Market Fund (‘MM Fund’). Although the MM Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the MM Fund is not a deposit of HSBC Bank USA, N.A. and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The MM Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the MM Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the MM Fund at any time. For complete risk considerations, please refer to the fund's prospectus.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company and the mutual fund. For clients of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., please call 1-888-525-5757 for more information. For other investors and prospective investors, please call the Funds directly at 1-800-782-8183. You can download the fund prospectus from this site.  Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
US persons (both entities and individuals) are subject to US taxation on their worldwide income and may be subject to tax and other filing obligations with respect to their US and non-US accounts. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a US law designed to prevent the use of non-US accounts or non-US entities to avoid US taxation of income and assets. To meet this objective, FATCA imposes on US and non-US entities certain documentation, due diligence, withholding and reporting requirements with respect to accounts and certain payments. Investors should consult their independent tax advisors about investment tax implications.  


Investment products are offered by HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. (HSI), member NYSE/FINRA/SIPC. HSI is an affiliate of HSBC Bank USA, N.A.

Please remember that the value of investments, and any income received from them can fall as well as rise, is not guaranteed and you may not get back the amount you invested. 

This could also happen as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, particularly where overseas securities are held or where investments are converted from one currency to another. We always recommend that any Investments held should be viewed as a medium to long-term investment, at least five years.

1 Foreign securities can be subject to greater risks than U.S. investments, including currency fluctuations, less liquid trading markets, greater price volatility, political and economic instability, less publicly available information, and changes in tax or currency laws or monetary policy.  These risks are likely to be greater for emerging markets than in developed markets.  Prices of securities in emerging markets can fluctuate more significantly than the prices of companies in more developed countries.  Securities of emerging market issuers generally have more risk than securities issued by issuers in more developed markets.  The less developed the country, the greater affect the risks  may have in an investment, and as a result, an investment may exhibit a higher degree of volatility than either the general domestic securities market or the securities markets of developed foreign countries.

HSBC World Selection portfolios include a wide range of investments from around the world.

As part of a global bank, we're able to take advantage of great investment opportunities from around the world.
Our World Selection portfolios are diversified globally to include a wide range of investments. This means you're not reliant on the
			economic success of just one country.
World Selection portfolios also include many different investment types and styles, helping reduce the risk you have to take to grow your money.
Each HSBC World Selection portfolio is available in three different currencies: sterling, US dollar or euro.

For more information on HSBC World Selection, you can download:

Please remember that the value of investments, and any income received from them can fall as well as rise, is not guaranteed and you may not get back the amount you invested. 

This could also happen as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, particularly where overseas securities are held or where investments are converted from one currency to another. We always recommend that any Investments held should be viewed as a medium to long-term investment, at least five years.






You'll need a Freedom Plus account
If you don't have a Freedom Plus account, you need to set one up before you invest in an HSBC World Selection portfolio. It's part of the same
		application process - so it's simple to do. Having a Freedom Plus account also makes it quicker and easier to manage your investments over time.
With a Freedom Plus account you can:

buy, sell and switch your investments between other World Selection portfolios
quickly and easily apply for additional investments within the Freedom Plus range
call and email our Jersey based fund administration team to discuss your requirement

Why HSBC Expat?
As an HSBC Expat customer you can:

check the value of your investments daily using online banking
use your currency savings account to reduce the purchase costs of this investment - avoiding a potential foreign exchange if investing in
			another currency

 Tax obligations 
			Whilst banking offshore may have potential tax benefits for you, tax rules differ from country to country. 
			Our
			 Global Tax Navigator 
			can give you more guidance, but if you are unsure about your personal tax obligations, you should seek professional advice. It is your
			responsibility to disclose your income to the tax authorities.
To help fight against tax evasion and protect the integrity of tax systems, governments around the world are introducing reporting and information-gathering requirements for financial institutions. Find out more
