    Corporate Governance




Primero is committed to creating sustainable long-term value for the benefit of all stakeholders, achieved through strong adherence to good governance practices. As Primero grows in size and diversity, our governance practices and policies have evolved to provide increased transparency, integrity, principled action, risk oversight, and stakeholder engagement.



Primero has developed several policies, not only to maintain compliance with evolving regulatory requirements, but to exceed current market views of governance best practices. These policies include, but are not limited to, an executive compensation claw-back policy, a diversity policy, and a share ownership guideline for directors and officers.

All-in sustaining costs3,4
(per gold ounce)
$1,110 – $1,300
$1,150 – $1,250
$1,200 – $1,400





(1) “Gold equivalent ounces” include silver ounces produced at San Dimas, and converted to a gold equivalent based on a ratio of the average commodity prices realized for each period.   The ratio used for the 2017 guidance projection is 291:1 based on estimated average prices of $1,250 per ounce of gold and $4.30 per ounce of silver.
(2) Total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce and total cash costs on a by-product basis are non-GAAP measures. Total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce are defined as cost of production (including refining costs) divided by the total number of gold equivalent ounces produced. Total cash costs on a by-product basis are calculated by deducting the by-product silver credits from operating costs. The Company reports total cash costs on a production basis. In the gold mining industry, these are common performance measures but do not have any standardized meaning, and are non-GAAP measures. The Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute standard. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures, prepared in accordance with GAAP, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See the first quarter 2017 MD&A for a reconciliation of total cash costs to reported operating expenses (the nearest GAAP measure).
(3) The Company, in conjunction with an initiative undertaken within the gold mining industry, has adopted an all-in sustaining cost non-GAAP performance measure that the Company believes more fully defines the total cost associated with producing gold; however, this performance measure has no standardized meaning. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company reports this measure on a gold ounces produced basis. For the purposes of calculating all-in sustaining costs at individual mine sites, the Company does not include corporate general and administrative expenses. Corporate general and administrative expenses are included in the computation of all-in sustaining costs per consolidated gold ounce. Refer to the Company's first quarter 2017 MD&A for a reconciliation of all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce.
(4) According to the silver purchase agreement between the Company and Silver Wheaton Corp., until August 6, 2015 Primero delivered to Silver Wheaton a per annum amount equal to the first 3.5 million ounces of silver produced at San Dimas and 50% of any excess at $4.12 per ounce (increasing by 1% per year). Thereafter Primero will deliver to Silver Wheaton a per annum amount equal to the first 6.0 million ounces of silver produced at San Dimas and 50% of any excess at $4.20 per ounce (increasing by 1% per year). The Company will receive silver spot prices only after the annual threshold amount has been delivered.

 Company News



Primero Mining Corporation operates as Canadian-based precious metals producer with operations in Mexico. It owns 100% of the San Dimas gold-silver mine in Mexico that consists of three underground gold-silver mines located in Mexico's San Dimas district. Primero Mining Corp. is based in Toronto, Canada.[1]
Primero Mining Corporation is a member of the World Gold Council.[2]

History
The company was formerly known as Mala Noche Resources Corp. and changed its name to Primero Mining Corp. in August 2010.

Products and Services
Primero owns the Ventanas property in the Ventanas Mining District or southern part of the San Dimas District along the western flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range in Durango State, Mexico. The Sierra Madre Occidental is one of the largest volcanic belts in the world and most prospective in terms of gold and silver, and polymetallic (Pb-Zn-Au-Ag) deposits. The Ventanas property is composed of 28 near-contiguous mining concessions covering approximately 3,470 hectares or 35 square kilometres, near the border of Sinaloa and Durango states and 120 kilometres west of the city of Durango, the capital of Durango State.
The Ventanas property is considered to be a mid-stage exploration project containing multiple low to intermediate sulphidation epithermal veins systems. The property is divided into three vein areas: the Mala Noche, Ventanas and San Cayetano areas. Each has numerous previously explored and worked veins that have a style of mineralization that is similar to the productive Tayoltita District 32 kilometres to the north. The property contains 17 old mines and workings.
In addition to gold, San Dimas is also a significant low-cost producer of silver, having produced over 580 million ounces of silver in its long history. 
A silver purchase agreement with Silver Wheaton Corp. was entered into by Goldcorp Inc. in 2004. The agreement originally included 100% of the silver produced by San Dimas. Primero renegotiated this silver purchase agreement so it now shares in selling silver at spot prices.  The revised agreement includes only the first 3.5 million ounces plus 50% of the excess silver produced until 2014, and then the first 6 million ounces plus 50% of the excess produced thereafter. The silver purchase agreement is based on the anniversary of the agreement, August 6 each year, not the calendar year.  
With an estimated average 7.1 million ounces of silver produced at San Dimas between 2011 and 2014, this increases Primero’s exposure to an estimated 1.8 million ounces of silver at spot prices, or an approximately $20 million extra cash flow per year.[3]

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
