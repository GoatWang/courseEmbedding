Early life and education[edit]
The son of an autoworker,[3] Morell is a native of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio,[4] and went to Saint Joseph's School and Cuyahoga Falls High School there. His formal education includes a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Akron and an Master of Arts from Georgetown University, both in economics.[5] He joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 1980.[3]
Career[edit]
Most of Morell's early work in the agency was devoted to Asian projects.[5] Later in his career, he managed the staff that produced the President's Daily Brief and he was the Executive Assistant to DCI George Tenet. Morell was also Bush’s briefer during the September 11, 2001, attacks, and, when asked by Bush who was responsible, Morell said "I would bet my children's future that the trail would lead to the doorstep of Usama bin Ladin and al Qa'ida". Later, as deputy director, Morell would be a trusted advisor to President Barack Obama in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011.[5][6] Before his 2010 nomination as Deputy Director, he served as Director for Intelligence, a position he had held since 2008. He served as the CIA's Associate Deputy Director from 2006 to 2008.[7]

In May 2010, Morell was sworn in as the deputy director of the CIA, succeeding Stephen Kappes.[8] From July 1, 2011, to September 6, 2011, he served his first stint as acting director of the Central Intelligence Agency, replacing Leon Panetta who was named as Secretary of Defense.[9] On November 9, 2012, Morell once again became acting director after the resignation of David Petraeus, following a sex scandal.[10] President Obama chose John Brennan as Director; he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by 63 to 34 vote on March 5, 2013.[11]
Morell announced his retirement from the CIA on June 12, 2013.[12] In November, 2013, he joined Beacon Global Strategies as a Senior Counselor.[13]
In the wake of Edward Snowden's 2013 unlawful leak of documents on international espionage conducted by the National Security Agency, Morell was appointed as a member of President Obama's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies. By the end of 2013, the group presented a report to the White House. Nearly all the Review Group's recommendations were accepted. Morell has been a regular critic of Snowden, saying that ISIS benefitted from Snowden's disclosures, adding that "Americans may well die at the hands of terrorists because of Edward Snowden's action".[14]
Meanwhile, in January 2014, Morell joined CBS News as an on-air contributor in intelligence and national security.[15]
In May 2015, Morell's book entitled The Great War of Our Time: The CIA's Fight Against Terrorism—From al Qa'ida to ISIS was released. It traces his three-decades-long career at the CIA, with a focus on the agency's counterterrorism missions after the September 11th attacks, and the related public controversies.[16] In the book, Morell defends targeted killings by drones.[2][17] He also criticizes the Senate Intelligence Committee’s analysis of CIA torture.[16][18]
On 19 May 2015, Morell, a former intelligence briefer to President George W. Bush before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, stated on Meet the Press that Vice President Dick Cheney lied about Iraq's nuclear weapons program before the war in 2003.[19][20] MSNBC host Chris Matthews said: " ... here on HARDBALL last night, the top CIA official, the man who briefed President Bush on a daily basis, said that what Cheney said was not true. ... I've been doing this business for a long time, rarely do you get that Perry Mason moment. When the guy comes and just says, You know what? I'm the top briefer from the CIA for the president. I'm deputy DCI. I'm right there telling them all we knew, and we never knew and never said he had a nuclear weapon. And yet we went into war with that argument."[21]
Also in his book, Morell apologized to former Secretary of State Colin Powell for the CIA’s erroneous assessments of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programs.[22]
In an August 2016 op-ed for The New York Times, Morell endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. Stating that he was registered with neither the Democratic nor Republican parties, and had always been silent about his political preferences, Morell stated that Donald Trump was "not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security."[23][24][25] Morell left his job as a CBS News analyst before making the endorsement.[26] In a subsequent Q&A article with the NY Times, he responded to allegations that his current employer, Beacon Global Strategies, "was co-founded by former associates of Mrs. Clinton", by saying it was a non-partisan firm and that he had spoken out "entirely on [my] own, with no other consideration given any thought."[27]
In an interview with Charlie Rose in August 2016, Morell blamed Syrian President Assad, Russia, and Iran for the death toll in Syria.[28] He called on the moderate opposition in Syria to make Russia and Iran "pay a price" for their involvement in Syria, in part by targeting their military personnel in the country.[29] He also called on the US to begin bombing Syrian government targets in order to bring Assad to the negotiating table.[30] Regarding President Bashar al-Assad, Morell argued "I want to go after those things that Assad sees as his personal power base. I want to scare Assad."[29]
In December 2016, Morell suggested the interference of Russia in the 2016 United States presidential election was "the political equivalent of 9/11."[31] He added that President Obama should retaliate imminently, in spite of president-elect Donald Trump's doubts about the allegations of Russian influence.[32] In March 2017, Morell said: “On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians here, there is smoke, but there is no fire at all. There’s no little campfire, there’s no little candle, there’s no spark. And there’s a lot of people looking for it.”[33]
Personal life[edit]
By his wife Mary Beth, Morell has two sons, Luke and Peter, and a daughter, Sarah.[34]

Early life and education[edit]
The son of an autoworker,[3] Morell is a native of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio,[4] and went to Saint Joseph's School and Cuyahoga Falls High School there. His formal education includes a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Akron and an Master of Arts from Georgetown University, both in economics.[5] He joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 1980.[3]
Career[edit]
Most of Morell's early work in the agency was devoted to Asian projects.[5] Later in his career, he managed the staff that produced the President's Daily Brief and he was the Executive Assistant to DCI George Tenet. Morell was also Bush’s briefer during the September 11, 2001, attacks, and, when asked by Bush who was responsible, Morell said "I would bet my children's future that the trail would lead to the doorstep of Usama bin Ladin and al Qa'ida". Later, as deputy director, Morell would be a trusted advisor to President Barack Obama in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011.[5][6] Before his 2010 nomination as Deputy Director, he served as Director for Intelligence, a position he had held since 2008. He served as the CIA's Associate Deputy Director from 2006 to 2008.[7]




Morell, Leon Panetta, Hillary Clinton and other members of Obama's national security team in May 2011


In May 2010, Morell was sworn in as the deputy director of the CIA, succeeding Stephen Kappes.[8] From July 1, 2011, to September 6, 2011, he served his first stint as acting director of the Central Intelligence Agency, replacing Leon Panetta who was named as Secretary of Defense.[9] On November 9, 2012, Morell once again became acting director after the resignation of David Petraeus, following a sex scandal.[10] President Obama chose John Brennan as Director; he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by 63 to 34 vote on March 5, 2013.[11]
Morell announced his retirement from the CIA on June 12, 2013.[12] In November, 2013, he joined Beacon Global Strategies as a Senior Counselor.[13]
In the wake of Edward Snowden's 2013 unlawful leak of documents on international espionage conducted by the National Security Agency, Morell was appointed as a member of President Obama's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies. By the end of 2013, the group presented a report to the White House. Nearly all the Review Group's recommendations were accepted. Morell has been a regular critic of Snowden, saying that ISIS benefitted from Snowden's disclosures, adding that "Americans may well die at the hands of terrorists because of Edward Snowden's action".[14]
Meanwhile, in January 2014, Morell joined CBS News as an on-air contributor in intelligence and national security.[15]
In May 2015, Morell's book entitled The Great War of Our Time: The CIA's Fight Against Terrorism—From al Qa'ida to ISIS was released. It traces his three-decades-long career at the CIA, with a focus on the agency's counterterrorism missions after the September 11th attacks, and the related public controversies.[16] In the book, Morell defends targeted killings by drones.[2][17] He also criticizes the Senate Intelligence Committee’s analysis of CIA torture.[16][18]
On 19 May 2015, Morell, a former intelligence briefer to President George W. Bush before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, stated on Meet the Press that Vice President Dick Cheney lied about Iraq's nuclear weapons program before the war in 2003.[19][20] MSNBC host Chris Matthews said: " ... here on HARDBALL last night, the top CIA official, the man who briefed President Bush on a daily basis, said that what Cheney said was not true. ... I've been doing this business for a long time, rarely do you get that Perry Mason moment. When the guy comes and just says, You know what? I'm the top briefer from the CIA for the president. I'm deputy DCI. I'm right there telling them all we knew, and we never knew and never said he had a nuclear weapon. And yet we went into war with that argument."[21]
Also in his book, Morell apologized to former Secretary of State Colin Powell for the CIA’s erroneous assessments of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programs.[22]
In an August 2016 op-ed for The New York Times, Morell endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. Stating that he was registered with neither the Democratic nor Republican parties, and had always been silent about his political preferences, Morell stated that Donald Trump was "not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security."[23][24][25] Morell left his job as a CBS News analyst before making the endorsement.[26] In a subsequent Q&A article with the NY Times, he responded to allegations that his current employer, Beacon Global Strategies, "was co-founded by former associates of Mrs. Clinton", by saying it was a non-partisan firm and that he had spoken out "entirely on [my] own, with no other consideration given any thought."[27]
In an interview with Charlie Rose in August 2016, Morell blamed Syrian President Assad, Russia, and Iran for the death toll in Syria.[28] He called on the moderate opposition in Syria to make Russia and Iran "pay a price" for their involvement in Syria, in part by targeting their military personnel in the country.[29] He also called on the US to begin bombing Syrian government targets in order to bring Assad to the negotiating table.[30] Regarding President Bashar al-Assad, Morell argued "I want to go after those things that Assad sees as his personal power base. I want to scare Assad."[29]
In December 2016, Morell suggested the interference of Russia in the 2016 United States presidential election was "the political equivalent of 9/11."[31] He added that President Obama should retaliate imminently, in spite of president-elect Donald Trump's doubts about the allegations of Russian influence.[32] In March 2017, Morell said: “On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians here, there is smoke, but there is no fire at all. There’s no little campfire, there’s no little candle, there’s no spark. And there’s a lot of people looking for it.”[33]
Personal life[edit]
By his wife Mary Beth, Morell has two sons, Luke and Peter, and a daughter, Sarah.[34]

Morell announced his retirement from the CIA on June 12, 2013.[12] In November, 2013, he joined Beacon Global Strategies as a Senior Counselor.[13]
In the wake of Edward Snowden's 2013 unlawful leak of documents on international espionage conducted by the National Security Agency, Morell was appointed as a member of President Obama's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies.

During a 33-year career at the Central Intelligence Agency, I served presidents of both parties — three Republicans and three Democrats. I was at President George W. Bush’s side when we were attacked on Sept. 11; as deputy director of the agency, I was with President Obama when we killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.I am neither a registered Democrat nor a registered Republican. In my 40 years of voting, I have pulled the lever for candidates of both parties. As a government official, I have always been silent about my preference for president.No longer. On Nov. 8, I will vote for Hillary Clinton. Between now and then, I will do everything I can to ensure that she is elected as our 45th president.Two strongly held beliefs have brought me to this decision. First, Mrs. Clinton is highly qualified to be commander in chief. I trust she will deliver on the most important duty of a president — keeping our nation safe. Second, Donald J. Trump is not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security.

I spent four years working with Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state, most often in the White House Situation Room. In these critically important meetings, I found her to be prepared, detail-oriented, thoughtful, inquisitive and willing to change her mind if presented with a compelling argument. Continue reading the main story

I also saw the secretary’s commitment to our nation’s security; her belief that America is an exceptional nation that must lead in the world for the country to remain secure and prosperous; her understanding that diplomacy can be effective only if the country is perceived as willing and able to use force if necessary; and, most important, her capacity to make the most difficult decision of all — whether to put young American women and men in harm’s way.Mrs. Clinton was an early advocate of the raid that brought Bin Laden to justice, in opposition to some of her most important colleagues on the National Security Council. During the early debates about how we should respond to the Syrian civil war, she was a strong proponent of a more aggressive approach, one that might have prevented the Islamic State from gaining a foothold in Syria.I never saw her bring politics into the Situation Room. In fact, I saw the opposite. When some wanted to delay the Bin Laden raid by one day because the White House Correspondents Dinner might be disrupted, she said, “Screw the White House Correspondents Dinner.”In sharp contrast to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump has no experience on national security. Even more important, the character traits he has exhibited during the primary season suggest he would be a poor, even dangerous, commander in chief.These traits include his obvious need for self-aggrandizement, his overreaction to perceived slights, his tendency to make decisions based on intuition, his refusal to change his views based on new information, his routine carelessness with the facts, his unwillingness to listen to others and his lack of respect for the rule of law.The dangers that flow from Mr. Trump’s character are not just risks that would emerge if he became president. It is already damaging our national security.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was a career intelligence officer, trained to identify vulnerabilities in an individual and to exploit them. That is exactly what he did early in the primaries. Mr. Putin played upon Mr. Trump’s vulnerabilities by complimenting him. He responded just as Mr. Putin had calculated.

Mr. Putin is a great leader, Mr. Trump says, ignoring that he has killed and jailed journalists and political opponents, has invaded two of his neighbors and is driving his economy to ruin. Mr. Trump has also taken policy positions consistent with Russian, not American, interests — endorsing Russian espionage against the United States, supporting Russia’s annexation of Crimea and giving a green light to a possible Russian invasion of the Baltic States.In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.

Mr. Trump has also undermined security with his call for barring Muslims from entering the country. This position, which so clearly contradicts the foundational values of our nation, plays into the hands of the jihadist narrative that our fight against terrorism is a war between religions.In fact, many Muslim Americans play critical roles in protecting our country, including the man, whom I cannot identify, who ran the C.I.A.’s Counterterrorism Center for nearly a decade and who I believe is most responsible for keeping America safe since the Sept. 11 attacks.My training as an intelligence officer taught me to call it as I see it. This is what I did for the C.I.A. This is what I am doing now. Our nation will be much safer with Hillary Clinton as president.

"On Nov. 8, I will vote for Hillary Clinton. Between now and then, I will do everything I can to ensure she is elected as our 45th president," Morell wrote.The former CIA chief said that "Donald J.

"I never saw her bring politics into the Situation Room," he wrote.Trump later responded in a statement issued by his campaign, though he did not refer to Morell by name."It should come as no surprise that her campaign would push out another Obama-Clinton pawn (who is not independent) to try to change the subject in a week when Clinton's role in putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and this administration being called out for sending $400 million in cash to the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism is on every front page in the country," Trump said. "Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President."And Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, criticized Morell in an interview on NBC's "Today" Friday. "Honestly, the comment by the former CIA official, I suppose this is the same CIA that told the President that ISIS was the JV team," Pence said. He disputed Morell's characterization of Trump as unwittingly doing Russia's bidding. "People that know Donald Trump know that he knows how to stand up and he knows how to stand strong, and standing up to Russian aggression is going to be really different under a Trump-Pence administration, and everybody knows that," Pence said.

Michael J. Morell








Michael Morell, the recently retired Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, is one of the country’s most prominent national security professionals, with extensive experience in intelligence and foreign policy. During his 33-year career at CIA, Michael served as deputy director for over three years, a position from which he managed the Agency’s day-to-day operations, represented the Agency at the White House and Congress, and maintained the Agency’s relationships with intelligence services and foreign leaders around the world. Michael also served twice as Acting Director, leading CIA when Leon Panetta was named Secretary of Defense and again after David Petraeus left government. Michael’s senior assignments at CIA included serving for two years as the Director of Intelligence, the Agency’s chief analyst, and for two years as Executive Director, the CIA’s top administrator—managing human resources, the budget, security, and information technology for an agency the size of a Fortune 200 firm.

Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in an opinion piece today in the New York Times. 
Morell worked for both Republican and Democrat presidents and he recently testified in Congress on the Benghazi attacks on U.S. Marines. In his opinion piece, Morell said GOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump is unfit for office and points to Russian President Vladimir Putin “recruited” Trump as an agent of the Russian Federation.
Here is what you need to know about Morell’s endorsement.

1. Morell Has Traditionally Been Mum on Political Positions

Morell claims he is neither a registered Republican nor registered Democrat. 
“In my 40 years of voting, I have pulled the lever for candidates of both parties. As a government official, I have always been silent about my preference for president,” he wrote.
He served under both President George W. Bush during the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and under President Barack Obama when Osama bin Laden was killed.

2. Morell Is ‘No Longer’ Quiet About His Presidential Preference, Endorsing Clinton

This election cycle is different. Morell wrote in the Times that he will “do everything” to ensure Clinton will be elected. 
“No longer. On Nov. 8, I will vote for Hillary Clinton. Between now and then, I will do everything I can to ensure that she is elected as our 45th president,” Morell penned.
 

 
While it’s a rarity for intelligence officials to endorse candidates, once they’re out of their bureaucratic positions, they have announced their support. This year, former CIA Director Michael Hayden endorsed John Kasich.

3. There Are 2 Reasons Why Morell Is Endorsing Clinton
(Getty Images)
Morell outlined two reasons why Clinton is a better candidate than Trump: The first, he said, Clinton is “highly qualified” for the post. Secondly, Trump “is not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security.”
Morell points to the four years he worked with Clinton during her tenure as state secretary. “I found her to be prepared, detail-oriented, thoughtful, inquisitive and willing to change her mind if presented with a compelling argument,” he writes.
 

 
The former CIA operative said Clinton was “an early advocate” for the raid that led to bin Laden’s death and she never brought “politics” into the Situation Room.

Morell wasn’t so kind to Trump and his bid for the White House. The former CIA deputy director explains that Russian President Putin was a former intelligence agent “trained to identify vulnerabilities in an individual and to exploit them.” Putin played into Trump’s vulnerabilities in the primaries, Morell claims.
Trump has taken foreign policy positions “consistent with Russian” interests — not American, Morell claims. 
 

 
“In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation,” he ended the piece.

5. Trump Is Calling Morell ‘Another Obama-Clinton Pawn’


Trump sent this statement to NBC in response to questions about Michael Morell's column: pic.twitter.com/pzLh77yjdJ
— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) August 5, 2016



The Trump campaign responded to Morell’s claims by sending out a press release calling Clinton “unfit” to serve as president. 
“Hillary Clinton and President Obama bear the direct responsibility of destabilizing the Middle East,” the release states. “…it should come as no surprise that her campaign would push out another Obama-Clinton pawn (who is not independent) to try to change the subject…”
 

 
Trump’s tweets have mirrored that claim:


Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS, rise of Iran, and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!

Morell is a democrat .. He is part of the New World Order foreign policy ! He obviously supports the way that the democrats are fighting terrorism. Which is a NO WIN STRATEGY.  Morell is the dangerous one as well as Obama and Hillary  and their buddies in the Muslimbrotherhood who are advising their foreign policy ..by arming Sunni -fundamentalist rebels in Libya and Syria against Assad and Quaddaffi who both were fighting terrorism to begin with !  Obama and Hillary supported the Muslimbrotherhood candidates in both elections in Egypt and Turkey ! The US foreign policy has much innocent blood on our hands by siding with and arming Sunni-Rebels all over the middle east and allowing the GITMO military leaders to go free and who are running ISIS right now AS THEY COMMIT MASS GENOCIDE OF Christians and all Muslims who are against Shariah Law as well as all people who do not want to convert to Radical Islam !!

I truly feel the same way at times, as he is torn to shreds and his words twisted at every turn and we are pulverized with all of their lies and accusations; However, I sincerely hope that he doesn’t, as we all need him desperately. We all need to stand behind him and talk the truth to our friends and neighbors that believe the crap that Hillary and Obama crap out every day. And, we can’t give up on Trump. Stand behind him……….
Go Trump!!!!!!

But a corrupt and unethical lair is, don’t you get it she can’t be trusted her long time record shows that.  Do some research on the woman it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out she’s doesn’t give a damm about the American people.  That’s the problem you liberals and all the left wing politicians in Washington they think it’s alright to deceive the American people for personal profit and personal gain, there motto is F them all I only care about myself.    Maybe in your world this is normal and that’s why you don’t see Hillary for what she is, but there’s a vast majority of people in this country that believe in honesty, integrity, ethics and doing the right thing for all American’s and people that want to be an legal American

Michael Morell Elected to Goodyear Board









January 9, 2014










AKRON, Ohio, January 9, 2014 – Michael J. Morell, retired deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has been elected to the board of directors of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company.
“We are pleased to have Michael Morell join the Goodyear Board of Directors,” said Goodyear Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard J. Kramer. “He brings to our board outstanding leadership skills and a global perspective gained during the course of three decades of distinguished service to the United States. We look forward to adding his skills and expertise to our board.” 
Morell served as deputy director of the CIA from May 2010 to August 2013. A career officer, he held a variety of senior leadership positions with the agency, including serving as acting director twice, director of intelligence and executive director. He also served as a deputy director at the National Counterterrorism Center.
He joined the CIA in 1980 as an analyst covering international energy issues. Morell later worked on East Asia for 14 years, holding a number of jobs in analysis and in management before his selection in 1999 as director of Asian Pacific and Latin American analysis.
A native of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, Morell earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of Akron and a master’s degree in economics from Georgetown University.
Morell, 55, served on President Barack Obama’s Review Group on Intelligence and Telecommunications. He is a senior fellow at Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, a counselor at Beacon Global Strategies, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
Throughout his career, Morell received a number of awards, including the Presidential Rank Award for exceptional performance, the Distinguished Intelligence Medal for his role in the 2011 operation against Osama Bin Laden, the Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal, the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal, the Department of Defense Service Medal, and four CIA Director’s Awards.
The election of Morell brings the size of Goodyear’s board to 13 members.
Goodyear is one of the world’s largest tire companies. It employs approximately 69,000 people and manufactures its products in 52 facilities in 22 countries around the world. Its two Innovation Centers in Akron, Ohio and Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg strive to develop state-of-the-art products and services that set the technology and performance standard for the industry.

Former CIA chief: Putin recruited Trump as an 'unwitting agent' of Russia





 Share on Facebook
 Share on Twitter


For former acting CIA Director Michael Morell, Donald Trump does not have what it takes to be commander in chief.
In a New York Times op-ed published Friday, the 33-year agency veteran notes that he has been heretofore private with his political preferences and is registered as neither a Democrat nor a Republican.Story Continued Below






"No longer. On Nov. 8, I will vote for Hillary Clinton. Between now and then, I will do everything I can to ensure that she is elected as our 45th president," wrote Morell.
Morell also suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin has successfully co-opted Trump's message in complimenting the political neophyte and getting exactly what he wanted in return with more praise even in light of his strongman tendencies toward journalists and dissidents.
"In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation," Morell wrote.
Morell laid out "two strongly held beliefs" that led him to the conclusion that Clinton should be president. The first of those, Morell explained, is that Clinton is "highly qualified" for the job and "will deliver on the most important duty of a president — keeping our nation safe."
"Second, Donald J. Trump is not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security," he continued, noting his work with Clinton in her capacity of secretary of state and her resolute advocacy of the raid that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011.
Trump "has no experience on national security," Morell wrote.
"Even more important, the character traits he has exhibited during the primary season suggest he would be a poor, even dangerous, commander in chief," Morell said, naming Trump's "obvious need for self-aggrandizement, his overreaction to perceived slights, his tendency to make decisions based on intuition, his refusal to change his views based on new information, his routine carelessness with the facts, his unwillingness to listen to others and his lack of respect for the rule of law. The dangers that flow from Mr. Trump’s character are not just risks that would emerge if he became president. It is already damaging our national security."
Trump's evolving proposal to ban Muslim immigrants from the U.S. has also undermined national security, playing "into the hands of the jihadist narrative that our fight against terrorism is a war between religions," he continued.
"My training as an intelligence officer taught me to call it as I see it. This is what I did for the C.I.A. This is what I am doing now," Morell concluded. "Our nation will be much safer with Hillary Clinton as president."
The forceful words from the former top official represent only the latest denouncement of Trump from within the intelligence community. Former CIA Director Michael Hayden, for example, has expressed strong reservations about Trump leading the nation's armed forces.
Clinton's campaign featured Hayden and other conservative voices criticizing Trump's temperament and preparedness in a new 30-second ad out Friday titled "Unfit."
Trump responded to the latest attack on his foreign policy chops with a statement directly blaming both Clinton and President Barack Obama for "destabilizing the Middle East, having let ISIS take firm hold in Iraq, Libya and Syria, not to mention their allowing Americans to be slaughtered at Benghazi."
"Clinton’s home email server that she lied to the American people about was a profound national security risk, and it should come as no surprise that her campaign would push out another Obama-Clinton pawn (who is not independent) to try to change the subject in a week when Clinton’s role in putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and this Administration being called out for sending $400 million in cash to the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism is on every front page in the country," Trump said in a statement, in reference to the amount of money paid in cash to Iran earlier this year on the same day four American prisoners were freed. "Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President,' he added.
A slew of Republicans have either said they will not support Trump or outright defected to supporting Clinton, including Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman, New York Rep. Richard Hanna, former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson.
Frank Lavin, who served as director of the Office of Political Affairs under Ronald Reagan and ambassador to Singapore under George W. Bush, also endorsed Clinton in a statement provided to POLITICO.
“Having served under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, I’ve seen what it takes to be commander-in-chief, and to make split second decisions under extreme pressure – Donald Trump doesn’t have that," Lavin said, calling Trump “temperamentally unfit to be president of the United States, and just the thought of him having access to nuclear codes is unnerving.
"I simply can’t support someone as erratic as Donald Trump," Lavin continued. “That's why for the first time in my life, I am voting for a Democrat for president, I’m voting for Hillary Clinton because she has what it takes to keep our country safe from threats here at home and abroad."

Morell, who cast Trump as an unwitting agent of Putin in a New York Times op-ed last week, said on ABC's "This Week" that he's comfortable with Clinton after seeing her in action in President Barack Obama's administration. "I worked with her for four years very closely when she was secretary of state and I was at the CIA. I provided her -- personally provided her some of the most sensitive information that the Central Intelligence Agency has," he said. "She never misused it. She always protected it." He added: "I would trust her with the crown jewels of the United States government. And, more importantly, I would trust her with the future security of the country and the future security of my kids."His endorsement could help Clinton amid renewed criticism over her use of a private email server. Read MoreMorell also said he believes Putin -- "a trained intelligence officer, worked for the KGB, very talented, manipulated people much smarter than Donald Trump" -- has intentionally been using Trump's ego as a way in with the Republican nominee. "He played this perfectly, right. He saw that Donald Trump wanted to be complimented," Morell said. "He complimented him. That led Donald Trump to then compliment Vladimir Putin and to defend Vladimir Putin's actions in a number of places around the world.""And Donald Trump didn't even understand, right, that Putin was playing him. So, in Putin's mind, I have no doubt that Putin thinks that he's an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation, although Putin would never say that," he said. "From Mr. Trump's perspective, right, he simply heard Putin compliment him. He then responded by complimenting him.

Michael Joseph Morell (born September 4, 1958) is an American intelligence analyst. He served as the deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency as well as its acting director twice, first in 2011 and then from 2012 to 2013. Since November 2013, he has been a Senior Counselor to Beacon Global Strategies LLC. He is a critic of the Senate Intelligence Committee's 2014 report on the CIA's use of enhanced interrogation techniques, which many consider to be torture, and is also a proponent of the CIA's targeted killings by drones.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
The son of an autoworker,[3] Morell is a native of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio,[4] and went to Saint Joseph's School and Cuyahoga Falls High School there. His formal education includes a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Akron and an Master of Arts from Georgetown University, both in economics.[5] He joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 1980.[3]
Career[edit]
Most of Morell's early work in the agency was devoted to Asian projects.[5] Later in his career, he managed the staff that produced the President's Daily Brief and he was the Executive Assistant to DCI George Tenet. Morell was also Bush’s briefer during the September 11, 2001, attacks, and, when asked by Bush who was responsible, Morell said "I would bet my children's future that the trail would lead to the doorstep of Usama bin Ladin and al Qa'ida". Later, as deputy director, Morell would be a trusted advisor to President Barack Obama in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011.[5][6] Before his 2010 nomination as Deputy Director, he served as Director for Intelligence, a position he had held since 2008. He served as the CIA's Associate Deputy Director from 2006 to 2008.[7]




Morell, Leon Panetta, Hillary Clinton and other members of Obama's national security team in May 2011


In May 2010, Morell was sworn in as the deputy director of the CIA, succeeding Stephen Kappes.[8] From July 1, 2011, to September 6, 2011, he served his first stint as acting director of the Central Intelligence Agency, replacing Leon Panetta who was named as Secretary of Defense.[9] On November 9, 2012, Morell once again became acting director after the resignation of David Petraeus, following a sex scandal.[10] President Obama chose John Brennan as Director; he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by 63 to 34 vote on March 5, 2013.[11]
Morell announced his retirement from the CIA on June 12, 2013.[12] In November, 2013, he joined Beacon Global Strategies as a Senior Counselor.[13]
In the wake of Edward Snowden's 2013 unlawful leak of documents on international espionage conducted by the National Security Agency, Morell was appointed as a member of President Obama's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies. By the end of 2013, the group presented a report to the White House. Nearly all the Review Group's recommendations were accepted. Morell has been a regular critic of Snowden, saying that ISIS benefitted from Snowden's disclosures, adding that "Americans may well die at the hands of terrorists because of Edward Snowden's action".[14]
Meanwhile, in January 2014, Morell joined CBS News as an on-air contributor in intelligence and national security.[15]
In May 2015, Morell's book entitled The Great War of Our Time: The CIA's Fight Against Terrorism—From al Qa'ida to ISIS was released. It traces his three-decades-long career at the CIA, with a focus on the agency's counterterrorism missions after the September 11th attacks, and the related public controversies.[16] In the book, Morell defends targeted killings by drones.[2][17] He also criticizes the Senate Intelligence Committee’s analysis of CIA torture.[16][18]
On 19 May 2015, Morell, a former intelligence briefer to President George W. Bush before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, stated on Meet the Press that Vice President Dick Cheney lied about Iraq's nuclear weapons program before the war in 2003.[19][20] MSNBC host Chris Matthews said: " ... here on HARDBALL last night, the top CIA official, the man who briefed President Bush on a daily basis, said that what Cheney said was not true. ... I've been doing this business for a long time, rarely do you get that Perry Mason moment. When the guy comes and just says, You know what? I'm the top briefer from the CIA for the president. I'm deputy DCI. I'm right there telling them all we knew, and we never knew and never said he had a nuclear weapon. And yet we went into war with that argument."[21]
Also in his book, Morell apologized to former Secretary of State Colin Powell for the CIA’s erroneous assessments of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programs.[22]
In an August 2016 op-ed for The New York Times, Morell endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. Stating that he was registered with neither the Democratic nor Republican parties, and had always been silent about his political preferences, Morell stated that Donald Trump was "not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security."[23][24][25] Morell left his job as a CBS News analyst before making the endorsement.[26] In a subsequent Q&A article with the NY Times, he responded to allegations that his current employer, Beacon Global Strategies, "was co-founded by former associates of Mrs. Clinton", by saying it was a non-partisan firm and that he had spoken out "entirely on [my] own, with no other consideration given any thought."[27]
In an interview with Charlie Rose in August 2016, Morell blamed Syrian President Assad, Russia, and Iran for the death toll in Syria.[28] He called on the moderate opposition in Syria to make Russia and Iran "pay a price" for their involvement in Syria, in part by targeting their military personnel in the country.[29] He also called on the US to begin bombing Syrian government targets in order to bring Assad to the negotiating table.[30] Regarding President Bashar al-Assad, Morell argued "I want to go after those things that Assad sees as his personal power base. I want to scare Assad."[29]
In December 2016, Morell suggested the interference of Russia in the 2016 United States presidential election was "the political equivalent of 9/11."[31] He added that President Obama should retaliate imminently, in spite of president-elect Donald Trump's doubts about the allegations of Russian influence.[32] In March 2017, Morell said: “On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians here, there is smoke, but there is no fire at all. There’s no little campfire, there’s no little candle, there’s no spark. And there’s a lot of people looking for it.”[33]
Personal life[edit]
By his wife Mary Beth, Morell has two sons, Luke and Peter, and a daughter, Sarah.[34]

Morell has been a regular critic of Snowden, saying that ISIS benefitted from Snowden's disclosures, adding that "Americans may well die at the hands of terrorists because of Edward Snowden's action".[14]
Meanwhile, in January 2014, Morell joined CBS News as an on-air contributor in intelligence and national security.[15]
In May 2015, Morell's book entitled The Great War of Our Time: The CIA's Fight Against Terrorism—From al Qa'ida to ISIS was released. It traces his three-decades-long career at the CIA, with a focus on the agency's counterterrorism missions after the September 11th attacks, and the related public controversies.[16] In the book, Morell defends targeted killings by drones.[2][17] He also criticizes the Senate Intelligence Committee’s analysis of CIA torture.[16][18]
On 19 May 2015, Morell, a former intelligence briefer to President George W. Bush before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, stated on Meet the Press that Vice President Dick Cheney lied about Iraq's nuclear weapons program before the war in 2003.[19][20] MSNBC host Chris Matthews said: " ... here on HARDBALL last night, the top CIA official, the man who briefed President Bush on a daily basis, said that what Cheney said was not true. ... I've been doing this business for a long time, rarely do you get that Perry Mason moment. When the guy comes and just says, You know what? I'm the top briefer from the CIA for the president. I'm deputy DCI. I'm right there telling them all we knew, and we never knew and never said he had a nuclear weapon. And yet we went into war with that argument."[21]
Also in his book, Morell apologized to former Secretary of State Colin Powell for the CIA’s erroneous assessments of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programs.[22]
In an August 2016 op-ed for The New York Times, Morell endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. Stating that he was registered with neither the Democratic nor Republican parties, and had always been silent about his political preferences, Morell stated that Donald Trump was "not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security."[23][24][25] Morell left his job as a CBS News analyst before making the endorsement.[26] In a subsequent Q&A article with the NY Times, he responded to allegations that his current employer, Beacon Global Strategies, "was co-founded by former associates of Mrs. Clinton", by saying it was a non-partisan firm and that he had spoken out "entirely on [my] own, with no other consideration given any thought."[27]
In an interview with Charlie Rose in August 2016, Morell blamed Syrian President Assad, Russia, and Iran for the death toll in Syria.[28] He called on the moderate opposition in Syria to make Russia and Iran "pay a price" for their involvement in Syria, in part by targeting their military personnel in the country.[29] He also called on the US to begin bombing Syrian government targets in order to bring Assad to the negotiating table.[30] Regarding President Bashar al-Assad, Morell argued "I want to go after those things that Assad sees as his personal power base. I want to scare Assad."[29]
In December 2016, Morell suggested the interference of Russia in the 2016 United States presidential election was "the political equivalent of 9/11."[31] He added that President Obama should retaliate imminently, in spite of president-elect Donald Trump's doubts about the allegations of Russian influence.[32] In March 2017, Morell said: “On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians here, there is smoke, but there is no fire at all. There’s no little campfire, there’s no little candle, there’s no spark. And there’s a lot of people looking for it.”[33]

By his wife Mary Beth, Morell has two sons, Luke and Peter, and a daughter, Sarah.[34]

He served as the deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency as well as its acting director twice, first in 2011 and then from 2012 to 2013. Since November 2013, he has been a Senior Counselor to Beacon Global Strategies LLC.

Early life and education[edit]
The son of an autoworker,[3] Morell is a native of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio,[4] and went to Saint Joseph's School and Cuyahoga Falls High School there. His formal education includes a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Akron and an Master of Arts from Georgetown University, both in economics.[5] He joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 1980.[3]
Career[edit]
Most of Morell's early work in the agency was devoted to Asian projects.[5] Later in his career, he managed the staff that produced the President's Daily Brief and he was the Executive Assistant to DCI George Tenet. Morell was also Bush’s briefer during the September 11, 2001, attacks, and, when asked by Bush who was responsible, Morell said "I would bet my children's future that the trail would lead to the doorstep of Usama bin Ladin and al Qa'ida". Later, as deputy director, Morell would be a trusted advisor to President Barack Obama in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011.[5][6] Before his 2010 nomination as Deputy Director, he served as Director for Intelligence, a position he had held since 2008. He served as the CIA's Associate Deputy Director from 2006 to 2008.[7]




Morell, Leon Panetta, Hillary Clinton and other members of Obama's national security team in May 2011


In May 2010, Morell was sworn in as the deputy director of the CIA, succeeding Stephen Kappes.[8] From July 1, 2011, to September 6, 2011, he served his first stint as acting director of the Central Intelligence Agency, replacing Leon Panetta who was named as Secretary of Defense.[9] On November 9, 2012, Morell once again became acting director after the resignation of David Petraeus, following a sex scandal.[10] President Obama chose John Brennan as Director; he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by 63 to 34 vote on March 5, 2013.[11]
Morell announced his retirement from the CIA on June 12, 2013.[12] In November, 2013, he joined Beacon Global Strategies as a Senior Counselor.[13]
In the wake of Edward Snowden's 2013 unlawful leak of documents on international espionage conducted by the National Security Agency, Morell was appointed as a member of President Obama's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies. By the end of 2013, the group presented a report to the White House. Nearly all the Review Group's recommendations were accepted. Morell has been a regular critic of Snowden, saying that ISIS benefitted from Snowden's disclosures, adding that "Americans may well die at the hands of terrorists because of Edward Snowden's action".[14]
Meanwhile, in January 2014, Morell joined CBS News as an on-air contributor in intelligence and national security.[15]
In May 2015, Morell's book entitled The Great War of Our Time: The CIA's Fight Against Terrorism—From al Qa'ida to ISIS was released. It traces his three-decades-long career at the CIA, with a focus on the agency's counterterrorism missions after the September 11th attacks, and the related public controversies.[16] In the book, Morell defends targeted killings by drones.[2][17] He also criticizes the Senate Intelligence Committee’s analysis of CIA torture.[16][18]

Also in his book, Morell apologized to former Secretary of State Colin Powell for the CIA’s erroneous assessments of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programs.[22]
In an August 2016 op-ed for The New York Times, Morell endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. Stating that he was registered with neither the Democratic nor Republican parties, and had always been silent about his political preferences, Morell stated that Donald Trump was "not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security."[23][24][25] Morell left his job as a CBS News analyst before making the endorsement.[26] In a subsequent Q&A article with the NY Times, he responded to allegations that his current employer, Beacon Global Strategies, "was co-founded by former associates of Mrs. Clinton", by saying it was a non-partisan firm and that he had spoken out "entirely on [my] own, with no other consideration given any thought."[27]
In an interview with Charlie Rose in August 2016, Morell blamed Syrian President Assad, Russia, and Iran for the death toll in Syria.[28] He called on the moderate opposition in Syria to make Russia and Iran "pay a price" for their involvement in Syria, in part by targeting their military personnel in the country.[29] He also called on the US to begin bombing Syrian government targets in order to bring Assad to the negotiating table.[30] Regarding President Bashar al-Assad, Morell argued "I want to go after those things that Assad sees as his personal power base. I want to scare Assad."[29]
In December 2016, Morell suggested the interference of Russia in the 2016 United States presidential election was "the political equivalent of 9/11."[31] He added that President Obama should retaliate imminently, in spite of president-elect Donald Trump's doubts about the allegations of Russian influence.[32] In March 2017, Morell said: “On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians here, there is smoke, but there is no fire at all.

Michael Joseph Morell (born September 4, 1958) is an American intelligence analyst. He served as the deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency as well as its acting director twice, first in 2011 and then from 2012 to 2013. Since November 2013, he has been a Senior Counselor to Beacon Global Strategies LLC. He is a critic of the Senate Intelligence Committee's 2014 report on the CIA's use of enhanced interrogation techniques, which many consider to be torture, and is also a proponent of the CIA's targeted killings by drones.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
The son of an autoworker,[3] Morell is a native of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio,[4] and went to Saint Joseph's School and Cuyahoga Falls High School there. His formal education includes a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Akron and an Master of Arts from Georgetown University, both in economics.[5] He joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 1980.[3]
Career[edit]
Most of Morell's early work in the agency was devoted to Asian projects.[5] Later in his career, he managed the staff that produced the President's Daily Brief and he was the Executive Assistant to DCI George Tenet. Morell was also Bush’s briefer during the September 11, 2001, attacks, and, when asked by Bush who was responsible, Morell said "I would bet my children's future that the trail would lead to the doorstep of Usama bin Ladin and al Qa'ida". Later, as deputy director, Morell would be a trusted advisor to President Barack Obama in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011.[5][6] Before his 2010 nomination as Deputy Director, he served as Director for Intelligence, a position he had held since 2008. He served as the CIA's Associate Deputy Director from 2006 to 2008.[7]




Morell, Leon Panetta, Hillary Clinton and other members of Obama's national security team in May 2011


In May 2010, Morell was sworn in as the deputy director of the CIA, succeeding Stephen Kappes.[8] From July 1, 2011, to September 6, 2011, he served his first stint as acting director of the Central Intelligence Agency, replacing Leon Panetta who was named as Secretary of Defense.[9] On November 9, 2012, Morell once again became acting director after the resignation of David Petraeus, following a sex scandal.[10] President Obama chose John Brennan as Director; he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by 63 to 34 vote on March 5, 2013.[11]
Morell announced his retirement from the CIA on June 12, 2013.[12] In November, 2013, he joined Beacon Global Strategies as a Senior Counselor.[13]
In the wake of Edward Snowden's 2013 unlawful leak of documents on international espionage conducted by the National Security Agency, Morell was appointed as a member of President Obama's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies. By the end of 2013, the group presented a report to the White House. Nearly all the Review Group's recommendations were accepted. Morell has been a regular critic of Snowden, saying that ISIS benefitted from Snowden's disclosures, adding that "Americans may well die at the hands of terrorists because of Edward Snowden's action".[14]
Meanwhile, in January 2014, Morell joined CBS News as an on-air contributor in intelligence and national security.[15]
In May 2015, Morell's book entitled The Great War of Our Time: The CIA's Fight Against Terrorism—From al Qa'ida to ISIS was released. It traces his three-decades-long career at the CIA, with a focus on the agency's counterterrorism missions after the September 11th attacks, and the related public controversies.[16] In the book, Morell defends targeted killings by drones.[2][17] He also criticizes the Senate Intelligence Committee’s analysis of CIA torture.[16][18]
On 19 May 2015, Morell, a former intelligence briefer to President George W. Bush before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, stated on Meet the Press that Vice President Dick Cheney lied about Iraq's nuclear weapons program before the war in 2003.[19][20] MSNBC host Chris Matthews said: " ... here on HARDBALL last night, the top CIA official, the man who briefed President Bush on a daily basis, said that what Cheney said was not true. ... I've been doing this business for a long time, rarely do you get that Perry Mason moment. When the guy comes and just says, You know what? I'm the top briefer from the CIA for the president. I'm deputy DCI. I'm right there telling them all we knew, and we never knew and never said he had a nuclear weapon. And yet we went into war with that argument."[21]
Also in his book, Morell apologized to former Secretary of State Colin Powell for the CIA’s erroneous assessments of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programs.[22]
In an August 2016 op-ed for The New York Times, Morell endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. Stating that he was registered with neither the Democratic nor Republican parties, and had always been silent about his political preferences, Morell stated that Donald Trump was "not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security."[23][24][25] Morell left his job as a CBS News analyst before making the endorsement.[26] In a subsequent Q&A article with the NY Times, he responded to allegations that his current employer, Beacon Global Strategies, "was co-founded by former associates of Mrs. Clinton", by saying it was a non-partisan firm and that he had spoken out "entirely on [my] own, with no other consideration given any thought."[27]
In an interview with Charlie Rose in August 2016, Morell blamed Syrian President Assad, Russia, and Iran for the death toll in Syria.[28] He called on the moderate opposition in Syria to make Russia and Iran "pay a price" for their involvement in Syria, in part by targeting their military personnel in the country.[29] He also called on the US to begin bombing Syrian government targets in order to bring Assad to the negotiating table.[30] Regarding President Bashar al-Assad, Morell argued "I want to go after those things that Assad sees as his personal power base. I want to scare Assad."[29]
In December 2016, Morell suggested the interference of Russia in the 2016 United States presidential election was "the political equivalent of 9/11."[31] He added that President Obama should retaliate imminently, in spite of president-elect Donald Trump's doubts about the allegations of Russian influence.[32] In March 2017, Morell said: “On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians here, there is smoke, but there is no fire at all. There’s no little campfire, there’s no little candle, there’s no spark. And there’s a lot of people looking for it.”[33]
Personal life[edit]
By his wife Mary Beth, Morell has two sons, Luke and Peter, and a daughter, Sarah.[34]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
