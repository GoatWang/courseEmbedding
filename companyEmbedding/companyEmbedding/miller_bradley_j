                Brad is a very upfront guy and a great loan officer. We were able to schedule an appointment to go over a 5 year loan.He was able to review with me clearly the options I had with different payment plans and explained the loans in detail about interest rates. He gave me honest feedback and guided me to the correct loan which suited my financial needs.Brad did not give me the impression of any signs of deceit and allowed me to get the product I needed to help me in a financial distressful time.I have referred many friends to Brad over the years. I have also worked with Brad for loans within my family a few times as well.… read more

An Argument Against GMOs As The Solution To Global Food Security






My debate team had to debate the topic of whether or not
GMOs were the answer to global food security issues. Here's the opening
statement I wrote for my team, followed by the essay I wrote on the topic. We
had to argue against GMOs as an answer to food security. I personally am of the
opinion that is argued in the following:



We believe that GMOs are not the solution to increasing food
security or reducing

hunger and starvation on the basis of current distribution
models, negative socioeconomic

health impacts. While genetic engineering is a marvel
technology, it is one that 

has evolved to be operated by a few privately owned
multinational corporations, 

whose motives are not directly involved with ending hunger
and starvation in 

poverty ridden regions of the world. The current food crisis
is merely an artifact of 

financial inequality between nations, that is, GMOs are sold
to generate the highest 

financial return for those who sell them, being the
stakeholders and investors in the 

corporation. The buyers of these products are those with a
strong, stable economy 

such as the US, Canada, and Europe, and not those that are
impoverished. 


Not only are GMOs not needed to increase food security, they actually decrease
food 

security and can potentially increase poverty. This can
occur because as northern 

countries are able to offer higher prices for GM crops than
the impoverished, hungry 

nations of the world, the privately owned corporation, as
any business would do, 

sells and distributes their product to the customers who are
willing to pay the most 

for them. Furthermore, a large proportion of the value of GM
crops produced in 

the US are subsidized by the federal government, which
undermines the ability 

of traditional, non-GM, unsubsidized farmers in the US and
abroad, of adequately 

charging a fair price for their yield. Also, if privately
owned GM seed is sold to the 

hungry nations, they have to continue to rebuy the seed each
year, and are unable to 

save their seed due to private ownership rights. If seed is
saved, unintentionally or 

intentionally grows in a field not under licensed use of the
product, or a hybrid that 

develops from cross pollination that contains the patented
genes, the responsible 

farmer may become liable in court and may face settlement
payments which they 

may not be able to afford, further decreasing the economic
viability of their farming 

operation. GM crops are also often sold with herbicides or
pesticides as a specialized 

package, which are necessary for their maintenance, but come
at an additional cost 

to the farmer. There is also large uncertainty as to the
long-term environmental and 

human health effects. 


Again, we believe that GMOs are not needed, nor intended, to be a solution to
the 

growing issue of food security where food is unnecessarily
scarce.  The issue of 

food scarcity cannot be helped with a product that under US
patent law is under 

the sole ownership of a capitalist, for-profit corporation,
operating in a free-market 

economy.



And now the rest of the essay on the topic by Bradley
Miller.



Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are living, modified
organisms that have had artificial alterations or additions performed on their
genetic material. This is often performed using techniques including in
vitro nucleic acid modifications by means of recombinant deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) and direct injection of nucleic acids into cells or organelles. The
fusion of cells that are not taxonomically related is often employed to allow
the recombination of DNA that is not typically possible through natural
processes such as reproduction and traditional breeding or artificial selection
(Beardmore & Porter, 2003).



According to Beardmore & Porter, (2003), the intention
of creating and producing GMOs is to: increase growth, metabolism efficiency,
and yield of crops; increase product appearance for commercial competitiveness;
control reproductive and phenotypic characteristics; increase resistance to
pathogenic species; increase resiliency to a variety of environmental
conditions; modify animal behavior, and to control reproductive capacity or
viability of offspring.



There is much controversy surrounding the economic,
environmental, and social aspects surrounding GMOs, particularly genetically
modified (GM) seed. These issues include impacts on biodiversity;
socio-economic impacts; impacts on human health; and adapting to climate
change. It is my directive to provide substantiated arguments and evidence
against the use of GMOs, due to the negative environmental, economic, and
social implications.



Widely debated is the safety of GMOs for consumption
(Olster, 2013). Due to the unnatural nature (ie. they are intentionally
engineered) of GMOs, there is fear that the modification of genetic material
may lead to harmful side effects upon consumption. It has been argued that the
available evidence suggests that there are harmful side effects from consuming
GMOs, but the peer-reviewed literature suggests there is still a high level of
uncertainty as to the long-term impacts on human health (Olster, 2013). Some of
the fears surrounding the consumption of GMOs include the perception that GMOs
may increase sensitivity to certain allergens or the incorporation of certain
genes into pathogenic microorganisms making them resistant to antibiotics
(Olster, 2013). A large increase in pesticide and herbicide application has
occurred since the implementation of GMO crops due to their required
specialized control products such as Monsanto’s Round-Up seed/weed control
packages (Center For Food Safety, n.d.). Long-term studies on the effects of
chronic exposure to such products are currently lacking. 



The safety concerns surrounding GMO products lies in the
effect that expressed proteins by the genetic modification may have upon human
health, and not the genetic (DNA) material itself (Altieri & Rosset, 1999).
There are concerns regarding the potential for these proteins to act as
allergens once ingested depending on the individual. The only way to remove
uncertainty about a protein’s allergenicity is “through human consumption by
affected peoples, which may have ethical considerations”, according to Louis
Pribyl, a microbiologist with the FDA.



In 2002, the Canadian government set forth a plan to monitor
the health of citizens to identify how GMO products are affecting allergic
individuals, but cancelled the plan because the study was admitted to be too difficult.
While it is not feasible to perform an adequate study focused specifically on
the allergic potential of GMOs, the U.K. performs annual evaluations of food
allergies, and in 1999, the year after a large increase is soy imports from the
US, researchers saw a rise of over 50% in allergic reactions than the year
before. In the 1990’s, a soybean that was given a gene from a Brazil nut to
increase its nutritional value ended up turning the soy variety into one that
caused allergic reactions in people sensitive to Brazil nuts.



There is also concern about how GMO varieties intended for
feedstock and not human consumption may become mixed with GMO varieties that
are for human consumption. An example of this is the StarLink maize (FAO,
2013). StarLink maize was only approved for industrial/commercial use, and not
for human consumption due to the uncertainty of the allergenicity of the Cry9C
protein, which gives the plant its pesticidal properties. Within two years,
StarLink corn was detected in taco shells indicating it has entered the food
supply (US EPA, 2012).



Additionally, Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is also thought
to be possible, as the techniques used for inserting the genes into GMOs may
increase the likelihood of HGT to occur. HGT has been seen to occur from GM
food to gut microorganisms. This may potentially put people with allergic
sensitivity to certain proteins that result from the foreign DNA to be
incorporated directly into their gut microorganisms (Smith, 2007). Similarly,
DNA from plant material in the soil may be taken up by normal soil bacteria or
incorporated into the target species, rendering products such as glyphosate
(Round Up) or Bt sprays useless.



Genetic regulatory pathways are very complex and the
insertion of a new promoter gene may cause unregulated control of other genes
either causing them to be expressed or repressed, threatening their normal
physiology, potentially negatively impacting biodiversity. GMOs may similarly
be capable of out-competing native or wild populations such as farmed fish.
Enhanced GMOs may have the potential to eliminate varieties that have been bred
and adapted to certain local climates and growing conditions that would reduce
genetic diversity. This may increase susceptibility of a crop to a disease
epidemic. There is also a lack of evidence about the risks of GMOs to
non-target species such as birds, and pollinators, including the applied
weed/pest control products. An increase in resistant pest and plant species
will further threaten non-GMO crops, making it harder to protect them (Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2013).



A misconception exists that GMOs may be global the solution
for hunger. The concept is that GMO crops produce higher yields, thereby
providing more food for those in need. However, most GMO crops are used for
animal feed, such as in the UK, or are incorporated into low nutritional value
foods such as cereals and processed, pre-packaged foods (Olster, 2013; Center
For Food Safety, n.d.). They also largely used for the production of biofuels
(Center For Food Safety, n.d.). These types of foods typically are distributed
in first world countries to the supermarkets and convenience stores, and not to
the needy. With an ever-increasing population and expanding arid and semi-arid
climates, it is widely believed that increased yields and drought tolerant GM
crops are the solution. Some evidence suggests that GM crops do not have higher
yields than a well managed crop and are not more resilient than native, local
varieties that have developed adaptive capacities to such conditions naturally
over time (Olster, 2013). It is understood by the United Nations that it is not
a shortage of food that is causing starvation in poorer parts of the world, but
how and where it is distributed (Olster, 2013).



Evidently, enough grain is produced on earth to provide each
individual with at least 3500 calories per day. This figure does not account
for other vegetable and fruit crops. Estimates suggest that nearly 4.3lbs of
food per day is available to each person including 2.5lbs of grains, beans, and
nuts; ~1lb of fruits and vegetables, and ~1lb of meat, milk, and eggs. Growth
in food production over the last 30 years has exceeded population growth by
about 16%, suggesting food is abundant, not scarce. The FAO found that in every
region, growth in food production has kept ahead of population growth except
Africa. The American Association for the Advancement of Science found, in 1997,
that 78 percent of malnourished children under the age of 5 live in countries
with a surplus of food. Due to the high prices northern countries can afford to
pay for imported food, southern countries export most of what they grow, having
imported only 5% of their food compared to the 75% imported by northern
countries (1992). The real causes of hunger are poverty, inequality, and a lack
of access to food and land. Forcing these poor countries to have to buy
patented GMO seed will only further impoverish them (Altieri & Rosset,
1999).



This is further exemplified by the fact that biotechnology
advancements are most likely profit-driven and do not have a directive of
feeding the hungry or preserving the natural environment. The purpose of
genetically engineering food crops, like any business, is to generate profits
in an untapped market. Two main commercial applications of GMO crops widely in
use today include Monsanto’s “Roundup Ready” soybeans and “Bt” crops that have
insecticides incorporated into their expressed genome. Due to intellectual
property rights, farmers are no longer allowed to save, store, sell and replant
these types of seeds, thereby forcing them to repurchase seed and weed control
packages each season from these corporations.  Since GMOs are
privately owned, public sector funded research on them is largely prohibited.
Developing nations do not have significant patent protection measures for GMOs
(FAO, 2013).

Social Capital











Throughout my life, I have established several diverse
social networks. Most of the social networks I developed prior to the age of 14
or 15 have mostly dissolved as people move away, go to different schools, and
develop their own more specific social networks based on their values and
interests. 





Playing in a band throughout the majority of my high school
years allowed me to meet a lot of people within my own school, but also from
other high schools in Red Deer, Alberta. This soon expanded to include a large
group of people from Rocky Mountain House to Stettler and Edmonton to Calgary,
literally Central Alberta. These relationships formed as a result of a common
interest of playing and performing punk rock music in the local community halls
that we could talk into letting a bunch of underage kids rent to play loud punk
rock music. After high school, I spent three years at two different post-secondary
institutions studying music. This expanded my music loving social network
hugely, nearly encompassing all populated areas throughout Alberta and into
Saskatchewan. This network allowed for an expansion of places to find work
playing shows, and likewise allowed me to offer the same to others. Shortly after school, I returned to Red Deer to work in the
local music store, Parkland Audio. For 2 years I spent 44 hours a week
communicating and making friendships with like-minded people. These
relationships added value to my life in that I was able to find more work, make
more money, play more music, and learn about new music. 



Alternatively, I have made a new social network by pursing
an education in natural science. This social network is still in its infancy as
I am currently meeting new people with interests in the same field. In the
future, these connections may lead to future careers and knowledge acquisition,
which will further enhance the quality of my life. 



These networks both expanded the opportunities I have had to
gain new experiences, and increased my exposure to new insightful ideas.
Through social networks like this, my social capital has increased. 



My interpretation of Social Capital is that it refers to the
enhancement of the quality of ones life through trusted relationships. Quality of life referring to the opportunities to pursue employment options and hobbies, and to
have time and money available to be with those you love in the places you love.
Through social networks, such opportunities can emerge. This short clip is
silly, but explains simply the concept of Social Capital. 











The example of the man with the flooding house demonstrates
exactly how having social capital can increase sustainability. The man did not
have to go purchase a new pump, therefore avoiding all the impacts associated
with the production of a new one and ultimately mitigating some of his
potential ecological footprint. He also performed maintenance of other
relationships with several other individuals before finding a pump. Often
benefits we may gain from social capital may not be through direct
relationships, but indirectly through people we may know. I always felt the
same way about lawnmowers. Why does every person on the street have to own
their own lawnmower when it spends all but an hour or two every week sitting in
shed? In cases like this, the sharing of material goods can increase the
sustainability of a community by establishing or building upon current
relationships with those who may add to the quality of your life.




From The CRC - Social Capital plays a vital role in sustainability


Having local social capital may increase the opportunity for the local trade of services or goods. For example, a mechanic may need to file his
taxes, so perhaps he could offer his expertise in trade for the expertise of
another, like an accountant. This eliminates the need to exchange hard currency, and emphasizes the
importance of social diversity of skills and how it may be used to reduce
reliance on the dollar, which could be tied into the concept of Slow Money. I
continually seek out services that support this notion. Craigslist is an
obvious one for local ads, and I also found this skills bartering one too but
it seems to be based more in the USA. 



This website, Klout.com, accesses your social media accounts to attempt to calculate your influence on your social media world, with a higher score indicating you have a higher influence. It analyses the amount of likes, comments, etc you receive on your posts to evaluate your digital social influence, and thus may be an indicator of social capital in your own life. Once registered, it follows your activity and provides stats. I just signed up so I don't have any results yet. 



Through maintaining and investing in ones social capital,
communities and social networks alike can become more sustainable and
interconnected. The challenge now is to ensure investment in social capital
is positive, and not negative, "like the Mafia, KKK, or fascism".

Community Vitality











What is Community Vitality? Well lets break it down.
Wikipedia defines vitality as referring to health, or ability to live or exist, even youthfulness. It is
further defined as being something that is dynamic and progressive, ever
changing. Something that is not observable from the outside, but can be
witnessed from within. Obviously community refers to a social unit of some
type, be it a nation, a city, a neighborhood, or a group of friends. 



So in my own words what this means to me is that community
vitality refers to the ability of a social unit to work and progress together
into the future while being dynamic, adaptable, and resilient to change through
a high degree of social health and youthfulness. Youthfulness in the context
makes me think about the acceptance children have of each other, and their
inhibition to interact with one another. 





Well how can this be measured? How can we know if we as a
society or community are increasing our vitality, or if it is decreasing? To
really have an idea of whether or not the vitality of a community is increasing
or decreasing, it is necessary to have some sort of indicators to measure this.
The University of Waterloo has release a report looking at possible indicators,
referred to as The Canadian Index of Wellbeing.
The index describes community vitality as a “measure of strength, activity and
inclusiveness of relationships between residents, private sector, public sector
and civil society organizations that fosters individual and collective
wellbeing”. In my eyes, this is essentially what my own definition is saying
but from a more socio-economic point of view.



To measure this, the indicators used by the index are:



- Participation in
Group Activities

Percentage of people reporting
participation in organized activities



- Volunteering,
Providing Assistance to, & Caring for Others

Percentage who provide unpaid
help to other on their own



- Number of Close Relatives

Percentage of people with six or
more close friends



- Property &
Violence Crimes

Property crime rater per 100, 000
population

Violent crime rate per 100, 000
population



- Walking Alone After Dark

Percentage of people who feel safe
walking alone after dark



- Trust

Percentage of people who feel
that most or many people can be trusted



- Belonging to a Community

Percentage of people reporting a very
strong sense of belonging to the community





In Canada, the overall community vitality was found to be
increasing. 2003 to 2008 saw a 4% increase in people joining voluntary
organizations or groups, B.C. alone saw a 6% increase in volunteering, and
there was a 10% increase in people nationwide reporting six or more substantial
relationships with close relatives. Rate of helping other directly also
increased, property and violence crimes have gone done, safety at night has
increased. These all indicate increase in community vitality nationwide. The
same patterns follow for B.C. but not for all provinces. Some saw a rise in
crime, or decrease in safety, etc., but overall things are getting better with
respect to the figures mentions for Canada as a whole. The percentage of people
who feel that others can be trusted has decreased for every province and for
the country as a whole. From 2005 to 2008 the amount of people who felt they
could trust others dropped by 10% nationwide, and in a similar time frame the
amount of people reporting discrimination based on ethnicity, race, or likewise
rose 5%, 7% increase in B.C. alone. There are a few indicators, which may
suggest some areas of the community vitality spectrum are dimming, while others
are getting brighter. 



Obviously these figures are over a very broad data set and
look at national and provincial communities, but the same basic principles
apply for the local community. You could even look at your own life as I have
and consider how often do you volunteer? How often do you feel discriminated
against? Have you been subject to criminal activity? Do you have more
substantial relationships? Do you talk to you neighbors?



By asking yourself questions like these, you may get some
insight to the level of community vitality you experience in your daily lives.
Trying to increase or decrease some of these aspects in your life, or by
contributing to them negatively in other peoples lives, is the first step to
increase your own personal vitality which will play a key role in increasing
the vitality of those around you and thus the vitality of the community as a
whole. Through the measure of social relationships, norms and values, the
domains of community vitality can be broken down and assessed on a many
different levels.

Rustic Cherry finish on select hardwoods and veneers is heavily distressed with deep dents, gouges, and worm holes for an aged app...earance. An heirloom-style floor clock with a distressed finish, designed by Chris Bergelin. A carved shell and leaf design draws the eye up to the arched pediment, which is embellished with decorative overlays on the canted corners. The brushed satin brass-finished dial is set off by cast corner and center ornaments, a silver chapter ring with applied brass Arabic numerals, and an astrological blue moon phase with a pierced star pattern. Mirroring the dial, the lyre pendulum is finished in brushed antique brass with a decorative antique gold-finished center disk. A high-precision, German-made, Kieninger cable-driven, triple-chime movement plays choice of Westminster, St. Michael, or Whittington 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 chimes accordingly with full chime and strike on the hour. read more
