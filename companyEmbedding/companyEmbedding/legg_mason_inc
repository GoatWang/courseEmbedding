The Importance of Working with a Trusted Financial Professional
A financial professional, also known as a broker, can help you achieve your goals by providing valuable insight and guidance on economic issues, the markets, specific investment and strategies. FINRA, The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, oversees the professionals and firms that sell stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other securities. We encourage you to seek out additional information on your current or prospective broker by going to BrokerCheck.

IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. For performance data including the effects of sales charges, Class A and A2 shares reflect the maximum front-end sales charge of 5.75% for equity funds, 4.25% for most fixed-income funds and 2.5% for the following funds: Western Asset Adjustable Rate Income Fund, Western Asset Intermediate Maturity California Municipals Fund, Western Asset Intermediate Maturity New York Municipals Fund, Western Asset Intermediate-Term Municipals Fund, Western Asset Short Duration High Income Fund, and Western Asset Short-Term Bond Fund. One-year returns for Class C shares reflect a CDSC of 1.0%, except for ClearBridge Value Trust which reflects a CDSC of 0.95%. Due to market volatility, current performance may be higher or lower than performance shown. Class FI, I and IS shares are sold at net asset value with no initial or contingent deferred sales charge, but higher initial minimum investment requirements apply. Effective July 1, 2011, Class B shares are closed to new purchases; however Class B exchange privileges will remain in effect. Royce Funds are sold at net asset value with no initial or contingent deferred sales charge.
Performance for other share classes will vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. All classes of shares are not available through all distribution channels. Total returns assume the reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all Fund expenses. Total return figures are based on the NAV per share applied to shareholder subscriptions and redemptions, which may differ from the NAV per share disclosed in Fund shareholder reports. Performance shown excluding sales charges would have been lower, if the applicable sales charge been reflected. Had fees not been waived in various periods performance would have been lower. All classes of shares may not be available to all investors or through all distribution channels.
A Fund's 30-day SEC Yield is based on yield to maturity of a Fund's investments over a 30-day period and not on the dividends paid by the Fund, which may differ; and is subject to change.
Different minimums may apply to clients of certain service agents. See the Fund's prospectus for additional information.
For further information on Fund expenses, see the individual Fund page or the Fund's prospectus. Please go to the end of this page for additional performance related information regarding Legg Mason BW Alternative Credit Fund Class IS, Legg Mason BW Dynamic Large Cap Value Fund Class IS, and certain Royce funds.  
An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
Daily Change($) indicates change in the net asset value from the previous business day.
Effective June 1, 2017, the following Funds changed their security pricing methodology to now use the mean value of the bid and ask prices (of underlying fund holdings) to calculate the NAV: Western Asset Core Bond Fund, Western Asset Core Plus Bond Fund, Western Asset High Yield Fund, Western Asset Inflation Indexed Plus Bond Fund, Western Asset Intermediate Bond Fund, Western Asset Macro Opportunities Fund and Western Asset Total Return Unconstrained Fund.  Funds may show a one-time increase of the NAV, which is due to this change in pricing methodology.































IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
Carefully consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. Please view the prospectus or summary prospectus for this and other information. Read it carefully.
FINANCIAL ADVISORS: Please note that not all share classes may be available for sale at your firm. Please call the Legg Mason Sales Desk 1-800-822-5544 or your Legg Mason Sales contact for more information.





IMPORTANT PREDECESSOR PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Each share class is invested in the same portfolio of securities, therefore annual total returns for newer share classes would differ from those returns for older share classes only to the extent of fees and charges associated with that share class. For an indication of a Fund's fees and charges, see the Fund's expense ratio and maximum sales charge disclosures or the fee table provided in a Fund's prospectus. 
ClearBridge Real Estate Opportunities Fund Class O: This fund is the successor to a closed-end fund (the "Predecessor"). The performance shown prior to the fund’s inception is that of the Predecessor and has not been adjusted for the Class O fund expenses. On June 10, 2016, the Predecessor transferred its assets to the fund in exchange for the fund's Class O shares. The Predecessor and the fund have similar investment policies and strategies. In addition, the Predecessor's portfolio managers are the current portfolio managers of the fund.  For information regarding the differences between the Predecessor and the fund, see the fund's prospectus. A redemption fee of 1.00% applies only to shareholders who received their Class O shares in connection with LMP Real Estate Income Fund Inc.’s (“RIT”) merger with and into the fund (the “Merger”) and redeem such shares within 12 months following the closing date of the Merger.
Legg Mason BW Alternative Credit Fund Class IS: This fund is the successor to an institutional account (the "Predecessor"). The performance in the accompanying chart and table is that of the Predecessor. On December 2, 2013, the Predecessor transferred its assets to the fund in exchange for the fund's Class IS shares. The investment policies, portfolio managers objectives, guidelines and restrictions of the fund are in all material respects equivalent to those of the Predecessor. As a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is subject to certain restrictions to which the Predecessor was not subject. Had the Predecessor been registered under the 1940 Act, its investment performance may have been adversely affected. The performance information reflects the gross expenses of the Predecessor adjusted to reflect the higher fees and expenses of Class IS of the fund. The performance is shown net of annual management fees and other expenses which reflects the application of the Class IS expense limitation agreement. If the expense limitation agreement were not applicable, expenses would be higher and performance lower.
Legg Mason BW Dynamic Large Cap Value Fund Class IS: This fund is the successor to a private fund (the "Predecessor"). The performance in the accompanying bar chart and table is that of the Predecessor. On October 31, 2014, the Predecessor transferred its assets to the fund in exchange for the fund's Class IS shares. The investment policies, objectives, guidelines and restrictions of the fund are in all material respects equivalent to those of the Predecessor. In addition, the Predecessor's portfolio managers are the current portfolio managers of the fund. As a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is subject to certain restrictions under the 1940 Act and the Internal Revenue Code to which the Predecessor was not subject. Had the Predecessor been registered under the 1940 Act and been subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act and the Code, its investment performance could have been adversely affected, but these restrictions are not expected to have a material effect on the fund's investment program. The performance information reflects the gross expenses of the Predecessor adjusted to reflect the higher fees and expenses of Class IS of the fund.

The Importance of Working with a Trusted Financial Professional
A financial professional, also known as a broker, can help you achieve your goals by providing valuable insight and guidance on economic issues, the markets, specific investment and strategies. FINRA, The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, oversees the professionals and firms that sell stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other securities. We encourage you to seek out additional information on your current or prospective broker by going to BrokerCheck.

Pricing & Performance
















MUTUAL FUNDS - IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. For performance data including the effects of sales charges, Class A and A2 shares reflect the maximum front-end sales charge of 5.75% for equity funds, 4.25% for most fixed-income funds and 2.5% for the following funds: Western Asset Adjustable Rate Income Fund, Western Asset Intermediate Maturity California Municipals Fund, Western Asset Intermediate Maturity New York Municipals Fund, Western Asset Intermediate-Term Municipals Fund, Western Asset Short Duration High Income Fund, and Western Asset Short-Term Bond Fund. One-year returns for Class C shares reflect a CDSC of 1.0%, except for ClearBridge Value Trust which reflects a CDSC of 0.95%. Due to market volatility, current performance may be higher or lower than performance shown. Class FI, I and IS shares are sold at net asset value with no initial or contingent deferred sales charge, but higher initial minimum investment requirements apply. Effective July 1, 2011, Class B shares are closed to new purchases; however Class B exchange privileges will remain in effect. Royce Funds are sold at net asset value with no initial or contingent deferred sales charge.

							Performance for other share classes will vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. All classes of shares are not available through all distribution channels. Total returns assume the reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all Fund expenses. Total return figures are based on the NAV per share applied to shareholder subscriptions and redemptions, which may differ from the NAV per share disclosed in Fund shareholder reports. Performance shown excluding sales charges would have been lower, if the applicable sales charge been reflected. Had fees not been waived in various periods performance would have been lower. All classes of shares may not be available to all investors or through all distribution channels.

							A Fund's 30-day SEC Yield is based on yield to maturity of a Fund's investments over a 30-day period and not on the dividends paid by the Fund, which may differ; and is subject to change.
Different minimums may apply to clients of certain service agents. See the Fund's prospectus for additional information.
For further information on Fund expenses, see the individual Fund page or the Fund's prospectus. Please go to the end of this page for additional performance related information regarding Legg Mason BW Alternative Credit Fund Class IS, Legg Mason BW Dynamic Large Cap Value Fund Class IS, and certain Royce funds.  
An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
Daily Change($) indicates change in the net asset value from the previous business day.
MONEY MARKET FUNDS - IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION:
The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results, and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown.  Average annual total returns and calendar year returns assuming reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all fund expenses. Performance would have been lower if fees had not been reimbursed or waived in various periods. Performance for other share classes will vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. All classes of shares are not available through all distribution channels.
The Current SEC 7-day yield represents net interest income generated by the investments for the past 7 days and assumes that the same income is generated each week over a 365-day period. The 7-day yield more closely reflects current fund earnings than does total returns. Yields for other share classes may vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. The Fund's yields reflect expense reimbursements or fee waivers, if any, absent these expense reimbursements and/or fee waivers, performance would have been lower.
Please see each fund's individual page for more information regarding fees and expenses.
Daily Change indicates change in the net asset value from the previous business day.
An investment in a money market fund is neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks, performance and other important information.

For an indication of a Fund's fees and charges, see the Fund's expense ratio and maximum sales charge disclosures or the fee table provided in a Fund's prospectus. 
Legg Mason BW Alternative Credit Fund Class IS: This fund is the successor to an institutional account (the "Predecessor"). The performance in the accompanying chart and table is that of the Predecessor. On December 2, 2013, the Predecessor transferred its assets to the fund in exchange for the fund's Class IS shares. The investment policies, portfolio managers objectives, guidelines and restrictions of the fund are in all material respects equivalent to those of the Predecessor. As a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is subject to certain restrictions to which the Predecessor was not subject. Had the Predecessor been registered under the 1940 Act, its investment performance may have been adversely affected. The performance information reflects the gross expenses of the Predecessor adjusted to reflect the higher fees and expenses of Class IS of the fund. The performance is shown net of annual management fees and other expenses which reflects the application of the Class IS expense limitation agreement. If the expense limitation agreement were not applicable, expenses would be higher and performance lower.
Legg Mason BW Dynamic Large Cap Value Fund Class IS: This fund is the successor to a private fund (the "Predecessor").

The investment policies, objectives, guidelines and restrictions of the fund are in all material respects equivalent to those of the Predecessor. In addition, the Predecessor's portfolio managers are the current portfolio managers of the fund. As a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is subject to certain restrictions under the 1940 Act and the Internal Revenue Code to which the Predecessor was not subject. Had the Predecessor been registered under the 1940 Act and been subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act and the Code, its investment performance could have been adversely affected, but these restrictions are not expected to have a material effect on the fund's investment program. The performance information reflects the gross expenses of the Predecessor adjusted to reflect the higher fees and expenses of Class IS of the fund. The performance is shown net of an annual management fee of 0.55% and other expenses of 0.10% which reflects the application of the Class IS expense limitation agreement. If the expense limitation agreement were not applicable, expenses would be higher and performance lower.
Royce Funds: Performance prior to the date of commencement of certain Fund's Investment Class shares (Royce Small-Cap Leaders Fund - 3/15/2007, Royce Low-Priced Stock Fund - 3/15/2007, Royce Heritage Fund - 3/15/2007, Royce Small-Cap Value Fund - 3/15/2007, Royce Smaller-Companies Growth Fund - 3/15/2007, Royce Dividend Value Fund - 9/14/2007 and Royce Global Value Fund - 8/31/10) reflects Service Class results; Service Class shares (Royce Pennsylvania Mutual Fund - 11/08/05, Royce Micro-Cap Fund - 8/30/02, Royce Micro-Cap Opportunity Fund - 5/22/00, Royce Premier Fund - 9/3/02, Royce Special Equity Fund - 10/2/03, Royce Total Return Fund - 1/3/02) reflects Investment Class results; Consultant Class shares (Royce Pennsylvania Mutual Fund - 6/17/97, Royce Micro-Cap Fund - 5/1/98, Royce Total Return Fund - 10/16/01, Royce Heritage Fund - 12/7/01, Royce Premier Fund - 6/2/03, Royce Special Equity Fund - 6/2/03, Royce Small-Cap Value - 3/30/06, Royce Small-Cap Value Fund- 3/30/06 and Royce Global Value Fund - 4/29/11) reflects Investment/Service Class results; Institutional Class shares (Royce Micro-Cap Opportunity Fund - 12/12/01, Royce Premier Fund - 9/17/02, Royce Special Equity Fund - 7/25/03, Royce Total Return Fund - 3/4/03, Royce Small-Cap Value Fund - 6/1/06, Royce Smaller-Companies Growth Fund - 5/10/06 and Royce Low-Priced Stock Fund - 1/3/06) reflects Investment/Service Class results. Service Class shares bear an annual distribution expense that is not borne by Investment Class shares. Consultant Class have higher expenses than Investment/Service Class shares.

Legg Mason Appoints Matthew Schiffman Head of Product and Marketing for the U.S.

                            Company Release - 11/6/2008 2:06 PM ET



BALTIMORE, Nov. 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Legg Mason Inc. (NYSE: LM) today announced the appointment of Matthew Schiffman, a 27-year industry veteran, as Head of Product and Marketing for its U.S. Operations.  In this role, Mr. Schiffman will be responsible for directing the firm's product development and product marketing strategy across all distribution channels.  He will be based in Stamford, CT.

Mr. Schiffman has deep experience in sales, product development and marketing strategy across distribution channels and asset classes.  Most recently, he was National Sales Manager at Lincoln Financial.  Prior to that, he was Director of Sales and Marketing for Prudential Annuities from 2003-2006 where he was responsible for setting the strategic direction for growth of the division across the independent, wirehouse, bank and agency channels.  From 2002-2003, he was National Sales Manager for Dreyfus Corporation, focused on separately managed accounts, mutual funds, variable annuities and investment-only 401Ks.  From 1994 to 2002, he held senior positions at Manulife Financial, where he had responsibility for product development, marketing and sales strategies for the firm's annuity, life and pension products and the firm's Section 529 platform.  He has also held senior positions at Nicholas-Applegate, and Paine Webber.  He has a B.A. in Economics from Franklin & Marshall and has completed executive programs at Harvard Business School and the Wharton School. 

At Prudential Annuities, Mr. Schiffman led the effort to develop the division's highly successful "Retirement Red Zone" campaign, an initiative that was ultimately adopted by the parent company as a corporate branding effort.   He also championed the development of alternative asset class portfolios for the Prudential annuity investment platform.   At Manulife, he spearheaded the entry into the Section 529 plan market, creating the first multi-manager broker-dealer sold College Savings Plan in 2001. 

David R. Odenath, Head of the Americas for Legg Mason, commented, "Matt has a proven track record in identifying trends in the marketplace early and in creating strategies to build innovative products that serve investor needs.  Now that Legg Mason has expanded into new distribution channels, Matt will lead an aggressive, focused campaign to identify ways in which we can serve this expanded client base."

Mr. Schiffman said, "Legg Mason's investment subsidiaries collectively have a breadth of capability across a wide variety of asset classes, and I believe that there is tremendous potential to grow our business.  I am looking forward to working with the teams to strategically identify innovative opportunities to build out our product offering to serve our clients and achieve strong results for the company."

It operates in three divisions: Managed Investments, Institutional, and Wealth Management.

Legg Mason offers its products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries. The company was founded in 1899 and is headquartered in Baltimore, MD.


Legg Mason's IT operations are located in Baltimore, MD within the corporate headquarters. The IT department is responsible for IT infrastructure and capacity development for Legg Mason as well as most of its affiliates and subsidiaries an exception being the IT operations of Western Asset Management. The Chief Technology Officer, ClearBridge Advisors collaborates with the department and is responsible for IT development related to client-facing business applications, investment systems/platforms and related enterprising IT functions.

In March 2012, the company outsourced its infrastructure, data center, and IT security functions to Navisite. Additionally, the company has partially outsourced its application development to Hexaware and has closed both its Connecticut and Maryland data center operations having replaced them with Cloud service providers. As a result of these outsourcing agreements, Legg Mason has eliminated the majority of its IT positions at the company. Following the outsourcing of IT support services the remaining IT personnel are responsible for providing leadership, direction strategy, engineering and architecture specifications to be executed by the outsourced vendors.

The security and governance team currently leads all data security developments and deployments. The systems and operations team leads development of investing platforms in collaboration with the systems team, responsible for analytics, database and CRM components and the application development team. The company is planning to deploy the Salesforce.com platform during Q2, 2013, once required testing is complete. The company has a bring your own device (BYOD) program that supports Apple and Blackberry personal devices. 

The infrastructure engineering team is responsible for the network infrastructure, infrastructure technology, storage, and for developing and administering the help desk services, workspace/user environment. The company is currently virtualizing its desktop environment using Citrix technology, this project will continue through 2013. The company has also been looking into Desktop as a Service (DaaS) as a possible alternative. The compeny is currently planning an enterprise wide PC refresh, which will involve upgrading to new desktops for all employees, and the implementation of Windows 7, Internet Explorer 9, and Microsoft Office 2010 on all PC's. This project will likely be completed in 2014. 

IT Intelligence Snippets
2013:
•1-10 tb data volume company-wide across 2 to 5 data centers, and expects an annual data growth of 6-10%. 
•75-90% of its servers are to be virtualized by the end of 2013. 
•Over 45 mobile devices are not managed by corporate IT
•Corporate IT manages 45 desktops.
•Standardized on 1-2 product vendors with a limited set of hardware. 
•Data center strategy is centered on virtualizing x86 servers for most applications; standalone servers or mainframes for business critical applications, standardizing on rack-mount x86 systems and virtualized servers, and minimizing cost. 
•Long term plan for running new applications is to add servers and virtualize, but no new facilities are scheduled.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.

The Importance of Working with a Trusted Financial Professional
A financial professional, also known as a broker, can help you achieve your goals by providing valuable insight and guidance on economic issues, the markets, specific investment and strategies. FINRA, The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, oversees the professionals and firms that sell stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other securities. We encourage you to seek out additional information on your current or prospective broker by going to BrokerCheck.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
