Sherman Introduces Article of Impeachment Against Trump

Rep. Brad Sherman (D., Calif.) / AP










BY:  Jack Heretik Follow
					@JackHeretik
July 12, 2017 2:29 pmRep. Brad Sherman (D., Calif.) announced on Wednesday that he introduced an article of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
Sherman was joined by Rep. Al Green (D., Texas) as a co-sponsor on the measure. They have both publicly called for Trump's impeachment in the past, as has Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.). House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has cautioned against impeachment talk, despite her own criticism of Trump.
Republicans control the House of Representatives and many Democrats are hesitant to go as far as calling anything done by Trump "impeachable," fearing political backlash.
Sherman's argument of impeachment is focused on claiming Trump has committed obstruction of justice regarding the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
"I am pleased that Congressman Al Green has joined me in filing Articles of Impeachment against Donald J. Trump," Sherman said in a statement. "We now begin the effort to force the House Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on Obstruction of Justice and Russian interference in our election."
"As the investigations move forward, additional evidence supporting additional Articles of Impeachment may emerge," Sherman's statement said. "However, as to Obstruction of Justice, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1512 (b)(3), the evidence we have is sufficient to move forward now.  And the national interest requires that we do so."
He added:
Introducing Articles of Impeachment will have two possible outcomes.  First, I have slight hope it will inspire an ‘intervention’ in the White House.  If Impeachment is real, if they actually see Articles, perhaps we will see incompetency replaced by care.  Perhaps uncontrollable impulses will be controlled. And perhaps the danger our nation faces will be ameliorated.
Second, and more likely, filing Articles of Impeachment is the first step on a very long road.  But if the impulsive incompetency continues, then eventually—many, many months from now—Republicans will join the impeachment effort.
I author Articles of Impeachment not to change our national policy.  I served with Mike Pence in Congress for twelve years and I disagree with him on just about everything.  I never dreamed I would author a measure that would put him in the White House.  I am introducing Articles of Impeachment to begin a long process to protect our country from abuse of power, obstruction of justice, and impulsive, ignorant incompetence."​
Sherman's legislation is H. Res. 438.
