Customer Questions & Answers








            Can a standard power strip (like used with electronic eq) be used w/this cord to run multiple devices?
        

            Want to connect household items such as a refrigerator, lamps, space heaters, cell phones, etc to my new Generac 7500 generator via this cord. Would like to use a standard power strip with about 8 outlets and connect it to this cord. Any problem with that? Will I overload generator?
        
Asked by: Jo

            Unfortunately, we are unfamiliar with the power output requirements of your desired loads. However, we can confirm that Generac&rsquo;s GP7500E portable generator, model number 5943, will feature a maximum running wattage of 7,500 watts, and a VAC rating of 62.5 amps at 120v 31.3 amps at 240v. Moreover, the unit will feature one 120/240v 30A L14-30R twist lock receptacle (protected by two 30A circuit breakers), and two 120v 20A 5-20R duplex outlets (protected by two 20A 1-pole circuit breakers). We would recommend ensuring that any load that you intend to power with the generator not exceed these ratings. Also, please note that the GP7500E does not feature our True Power Technology, where the unit&rsquo;s total harmonic distortion is limited to less than 5%. This particular feature makes the units compatible with most sensitive electronics. If any of the items you intend to run are a sensitive item, we would recommend considering our XP Series generators to properly power those loads. For further information regarding these particular products, please feel free to contact us directly at 888-GENERAC (436-3722) at your earliest convience. Lastly, if you are unsure if a particular load is a sensitive item, we would recommend contacting the product&rsquo;s manufacturer for that particular information.

            Does this product carry the prop 65 warning? I'd like to find an extension cord that does not contain any harmful chemicals while being handled.
        


Asked by: Brian

            Generac&rsquo;s 50 ft., 30 Amp, 7500 watt generator cord does not carry any detectable amounts of chemicals if/when it is utilized in conjunction with a portable generator. If you have any other product-related inquiries, please contact us directly at 888-GENERAC (436-3722

            Is this cord Copper or Alunimun
        


Asked by: Anonymous

            Hi Tightwad,

Thank you for your question.

This is a rubber cord.

These rubber power cords are the connecting link between the generator and a transfer switch via a power inlet box. All rubber cord stays flexible even in subzero temperatures. 50 ft. cord, 4 conductor, 10-Gauge wire with L14-30 male + female ends. UL Listed.

Hope this information helps.

            Regarding the 50 foot, 30 amp cord, Model #6329. Does the 7500 watt rating mean that I can run the cord from the generator to the house and then conn
        

            ect extensions to power the items I want to run (lights, TV, sump pump, etc.) as long as the total wattage does not exceed 7500? - Thanks,- WD
        
Asked by: Anonymous

            The 50 foot, 30 amp 7500 watt generator cord is designated as 7500 watts as that is the Generac generator that is the largest unit that features a 30 amp twist-lock receptacle as its largest receptacle; other smaller generators may also feature the 30 amp twist-lock, but units larger than 7500 watts feature a 50 amp receptacle.
When utilizing a 30 amp cord connected to a 30 amp receptacle, the maximum wattage draw available from that receptacle will be 7200 running watts.
This cord is most often utilized between the generator and a power inlet box, which connects the generator to a manual transfer switch, however, the cord can also be used as an extension to connect corded appliances directly to the generator. Hard wired appliances, such as a furnace, hot water heater, sump pumps, etc. would require the use of a manual transfer switch, or other safe means of disconnect per National Electric Code.

        Just what I wanted!
My genedrator came with a 10' cord and was dangerous to use because of carbon monoxide poisoning. My 50" cord should put the generator far from the house.

I was about to purchase the pieces to build it myself, than I saw that I had to pay a lot more than one already built, ready to be shipped to my home for no shipping charge.
When I received it, it was exactly what I want.

        Economical Way to Tie into the Main Panel
The cord is being used to connect the generator to the panel while keeping it a safe distance away from the house. You will need a qualified electrician to upgrade your panel if it is not configured or sized to accept a portable genrator. My only negative critique is that it looks like the cord I received was returned and repackaged since it was not in a factory sealed bag. It also took longer than expected to be delivered.
