For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.

Biography




                                                        Michael J. Goldberg, MD is the Director of the Skeletal Health Program at Seattle Children's Hospital and Clinical Professor of Orthopaedics at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Most of his professional career was spent in Boston where he was the Henry H. Banks Distinguished Professor of Orthopaedics at Tufts University School of Medicine, and Chairman of the Department of Orthopaedics at Tufts Medical Center. Dr. Goldberg's major areas of clinical interest have been in the diagnosis and management of children with syndromes, complex birth defects, and skeletal dysplasias. He has been a vocal advocate for measuring outcomes and functional performance of children undergoing orthopaedic treatments and helped develop some of the tools now in common usage.

                                                    

                                                          Born in Brooklyn, New York, Dr. Goldberg was educated at Cornell University, State University of New York College of Medicine, Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, and the Combined Harvard Orthopaedic Program. He has published widely, including the textbook "The Dysmorphic Child"; and currently sits on the editorial boards of the Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics and the Journal of Childrens Orthopaedics. He has lectured both nationally and internationally, and was awarded Honorary Membership in the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of Argentina; of Brazil; and of Italy; and the Sonia Machanic Fellowship in the College of Medicine of South Africa. He has received recognition awards from POSNA, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Arthritis Foundation. Dr. Goldberg has served in leadership positions and elected office at the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the AMA, and the ACGME. Believing that a physician's responsibility is to comfort and heal in addition to attempting cure, Dr. Goldberg has emphasized the importance of art, music, and literature as a way to understand patients and their diseases. Married to Fran, they have two daughters and two grandchildren and continue to live bicoastal in Boston, MA and Seattle, WA.

My family and I moved to Boston in 1986 after multiple botched surgeries on a "club foot". I can not begin to describe how much Dr. Goldberg has impacted my life. I remember waiting to be seen at NEMC and hearing his deep soothing voice in the next room, and getting excited to be next. I am certain that without his expertise that I never would have walked, let alone play sports and get a chance to lead a normal life . I am forever grateful to you and the staff at NEMC. I hope my message finds you and finds you well.

Dr Goldberg performed surgery on myself at age six for leg perthes. I had seen multiple surgeons and the only other option at the time was a long term brace. The new method he advocated allowed myself to heal and lead a normal athletic life! Now at age 45 I am so thankful my mother dragged me to boston for that consult!

Dr. Goldberg's wise, caring and comprehensive care for our daughter's health and well-being is such a gift to our family. In fact, since our first meeting, Dr. Goldberg welcomed us to the skeletal dysplasia clinic and made us feel like his family--making sure Mimi was signed up for camp, introducing us to so many supportive people and always being so focused on what is best for her well-being. While it was a commitment to chose a doctor located three hours away, Dr. Goldberg and the skeletal dysplasia team are the best and we are grateful for their fine service.
