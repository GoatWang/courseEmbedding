Do You Remember The First Time? 
December 23, 2013September 5, 2015pcharbonneau 2 Comments



The Pill, the epicenter of Boston Britpop, mod, soul and indie subculture and home to Boston’s ambitious outsiders, misshapes and beautiful ones, took its final bow after 16 improbable but mostly glorious years at Great Scott this past Friday night. I was 430 miles away. A part, yet apart.

Hotel Morrissey – the marketing 
January 31, 2011April 14, 2013pcharbonneau 2 Comments



The other day I wrote about my dream involving the Hotel Morrissey, which naturally housed a Cafe Morrissey in its lobby. How this respite for weary travelers existed only in my dream no one can really know, but that was no excuse to not formulate marketing and product strategies!
A Facebook post followed, and thanks to some truly ace ideas from a couple of friends, it cemented in my mind that this was perhaps the single greatest idea I had ever had!
What follows are the fruits of our labors. Special thanks to Brian, Mario, Marc, Steve, Marya and Lauren for fueling the fire. Please feel free to add your own ideas so that some day the Hotel Morrissey will become the reality it was meant to be. Morrissey is such the lyricist that this could go on forever (in which case I’m doomed). Continue reading “Hotel Morrissey – the marketing” →




Hotel Morrissey 
January 29, 2011January 29, 2011pcharbonneau 3 Comments



I was dreaming.
In my dream, I stumbled around a corner of a large building and noticed the art deco sign, cast in shiny aluminium on the wall: The Hotel Morrissey.  That’s pretty cool, I thought.
From there, I jumped a railing into the hotel (it’s a dream, if you have to ask), and ended up alone in a lobby cafe. Glancing up at the menu hanging from a wooden beam at the counter, I saw the familiar silhouette of Steven Patrick Morrissey, highlighting a house specialty, The Last of The Famous International Cappucinos. Brilliant.

Discovering Terry Hall 
April 14, 2010April 16, 2010pcharbonneau Leave a comment



You’d think someone who’s worked with artists and bands ranging from Blur’s Damon Albarn, Tricky, The Lightning Seeds, Sinead O’Connor, Lily Allen, Gorillaz and a personal guilty pleasure of mine, Bananarama, would have made their way onto my musical radar some time ago, but it is only within the last week or so that I’ve been diving deep into the career of Terry Hall. He is my stumble upon artist of the moment. A dry, witty British singer whose best-known band, Coventry ska punk legends The Specials, have reformed for a 30th anniversary tour that sees them playing the opening day of the Coachella festival today, April 16 (Only founding member and chief songwriter Jerry Dammers is absent from this reunion).

Glastonburied 
April 12, 2010pcharbonneau 3 Comments



This morning at 9 am GMT, the final batch of tickets went back on sale for Glastonbury 2010. It was a mad scramble with a crashed server, confusion and confirmation issues, but after 67 frantic minutes, the festival was sold out. I did not land a ticket, despite my best efforts.

I Confess-tival 
April 2, 2010April 3, 2010pcharbonneau 1 Comment



We are blessed with many berries on this green earth. Blueberries, blackberries, boysenberries, raspberries, even Frankenberry. But all these pale in comparison with my fervent interest in what currently remains a bit of forbidden fruit: Glastonbury.

What Does It Take To Turn You On?

After two warmup gigs at London’s 100 Club and the Manchester Ritz, a re-formed Suede played the Royal Albert Hall last night (March 24) as part of the Teenage Cancer Trust Series. I know, I know. Another Suede post? I will not proselytize but I will not apologize.
The set list was as follows:

Forever Young 
March 1, 2010March 2, 2010pcharbonneau Leave a comment



When my blood was a bit younger, I used to think about how much cooler it would have been to have come of age five years earlier. While I grew up during that glossy decade known as the 1980s, I was just a little young to truly appreciate the bands I came to know and love, bands borne of the late 70s-early 80s post punk movement, until later. Now that I’m 37, I’m quite thankful to have that extra five years ahead of me. Still, my nostalgia and appreciation for many things 80s remains intact, so all it took was a phone call from my cousin Abby about an 80s prom party in New York City for me to dive headfirst into my closet in search of my long-lost parachute pants.

All Choked Up 
January 22, 2010February 4, 2010pcharbonneau Leave a comment



I’m just going to say up front that this post has it all. Violence, celebrities and a killer soundtrack. Plus it takes place in the big city. Do I smell the makings of a cult indie film? I think I… oh wait. No, that’s just my socks. Continue reading “All Choked Up” →

Hotel Morrissey – the marketing | Peter Charbonneau Design




























































Skip to content


 Peter Charbonneau Design
creating creativity creatively








Hotel Morrissey – the marketing 
January 31, 2011April 14, 2013pcharbonneau 


The other day I wrote about my dream involving the Hotel Morrissey, which naturally housed a Cafe Morrissey in its lobby. How this respite for weary travelers existed only in my dream no one can really know, but that was no excuse to not formulate marketing and product strategies!
A Facebook post followed, and thanks to some truly ace ideas from a couple of friends, it cemented in my mind that this was perhaps the single greatest idea I had ever had!
What follows are the fruits of our labors. Special thanks to Brian, Mario, Marc, Steve, Marya and Lauren for fueling the fire. Please feel free to add your own ideas so that some day the Hotel Morrissey will become the reality it was meant to be. Morrissey is such the lyricist that this could go on forever (in which case I’m doomed).
Hotel Morrissey
‘At the Hotel Morrissey, There Is A Light That Never Goes Out’
The Customer Rewards Program: You Just Haven’t Earned It Yet, Baby
Room Service Slogan: Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want
Gift Shop signage: Shoplifters of the World Will Be Prosecuted
Concierge Desk signage: Ask Me, Ask Me, Ask Me…
Elevator signage: In the event of an emergency, ‘Panic’
Amenities service: ‘Excuse me front desk? How soon can I get an iron brought up to Room 223?’ ‘How soon is now, sir?’
Amenities service: Stretch Out and Wait at the Hotel Morrissey spa and salon
Amenities service: Join the lazy sunbathers are our newly renovated, state-of-the-art outdoor pool
Sample the Meat Is Murder vegan menu at Dagenham Dave’s Restaurant, conveniently located in the lobby
and don’t forget the ‘I’ve Come To Wish You an Unhappy Birthday’ ballroom and lounge
Need room service? Just dial a cliche, stretch out and wait, and find out for yourself why we are the last of the famous international hotels.

Cafe Morrissey

Beverage Items: Last of the Famous International Cappucinos, Hot Chocolate with whipped cream pompadour, pashernate latte, Alsatian cappucino
Slogan: At the Cafe Morrissey, All You Need is Tea
Slogan: The More You Ignore Tea, The Closer It Gets
Slogan: Now My Mug Is Full
Employee of the Month: Ringleader of the Baristas
