	Forward Looking Statements




	This report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We intend such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are included in this statement for purposes of these safe harbor provisions. Forward looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” or similar expressions. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to, changes in: interest rates, general economic conditions, monetary and fiscal policy, the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios, demand for loan products, fluctuation in the value of collateral securing our loan portfolio, deposit flows, competition, demand for financial services in our market area, and accounting principles, policies and guidelines. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

	General




	Isabella Bank Corporation is a registered financial services holding company that was incorporated in September 1988 under Michigan law. The Corporation's sole subsidiary, Isabella Bank, has


	29


	 banking offices located throughout


	Clare, Gratiot, Isabella, Mecosta, Midland, Montcalm, and Saginaw counties


	 and a loan production office located in Saginaw county. The area includes significant agricultural production, manufacturing, retail, gaming and tourism, and several colleges and universities.




	As used in


	Item 7.


	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


	 as well as in


	Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data


	, references to


	 "the Corporation," “Isabella,” “we,” “our,” “us,” and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of Isabella Bank Corporation and its subsidiary. Isabella Bank Corporation refers solely to the parent holding company, and Isabella Bank or the “Bank” refer to Isabella Bank Corporation’s subsidiary, Isabella Bank.






	Our reportable segments are based on legal entities that account for at least


	10%


	 of net operating results. Retail banking operations for


	2016


	,


	2015


	, and


	2014


	 represent approximately


	90%


	 or greater of total assets and operating results. As such, we have only one reportable segment.




	We are a community bank with a focus on providing high quality, personalized service at a fair price. We offer a broad array of banking services to businesses, institutions, and individuals. We compete with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage brokers, finance companies, credit unions, and retail brokerage firms.




	Lending activities include loans for commercial and agricultural operating and real estate purposes, residential real estate loans, and consumer loans. We limit lending activities primarily to local markets and have not purchased any loans from the secondary market. We do not make loans to fund leveraged buyouts, have no foreign corporate or government loans, and have limited holdings of corporate debt securities. Our general lending philosophy is to limit concentrations to individuals and business segments. For additional information related to our lending strategies and policies, see “


	Note 5 –


	Loans and ALLL

	Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data


	.




	Deposit services offered include checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, direct deposits, cash management services, mobile and internet banking, electronic bill pay services, and automated teller machines. We also offer full service trust and brokerage services.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had


	372


	 full-time equivalent employees. We provide group life, health, accident, disability, and other insurance programs as well as a number of other employee benefit programs. None of our workforce is subject to collective bargaining agreements.

	Supervision and Regulation




	The earnings and growth of the banking industry and, therefore, our earnings are affected by the credit policies of monetary authorities, including the


	FRB


	. An important function of the


	FRB


	 is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to combat recessions and respond to inflationary pressures. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the


	FRB


	 to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Agency securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. The monetary policies of the


	FRB


	 have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and related financial service providers in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effect of such policies upon our future business and earnings cannot be predicted.




	We, as a financial holding company, are regulated under the


	BHC Act


	, and are subject to the supervision of the


	FRB


	. We are registered as a financial services holding company with the


	FRB


	 and are subject to annual reporting requirements and








	 4









	Table of Contents









	inspections and audits. Under


	FRB


	 policy, we are expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support its subsidiaries. This support may be required at times when, in the absence of such


	FRB


	 policy, it would not otherwise be required to provide support.




	Under Michigan law, if the capital of a Michigan state chartered bank has become impaired by losses or otherwise, the Commissioner of the


	DIFS


	 may require that the deficiency in capital be met by assessment upon the bank’s shareholders pro rata on the amount of capital stock held by each, and if any such assessment is not paid by any shareholder within 30 days of the date of mailing of notice thereof to such shareholder, cause the sale of the stock of such shareholder to pay such assessment and the costs of sale of such stock.




	Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. This priority would apply to guarantees of capital plans under the


	FDIC


	 Improvement Act of 1991.




	SOX


	 contains important requirements for public companies in the area of financial disclosure and corporate governance. In accordance with Section 302(a) of


	SOX


	, written certifications by our principal executive, financial, and accounting officers are required. These certifications attest that our quarterly and annual reports filed with the


	SEC


	 do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact (see the certifications filed as Exhibits 31 (a) and (b) to this Form 10-K for such certification of consolidated financial statements and other information for this


	2016


	 Form 10-K). We have also implemented a program designed to comply with Section 404 of


	SOX


	, which included the identification of significant processes and accounts, documentation of the design of control effectiveness over process and entity level controls, and testing of the operating effectiveness of key controls. See


	Item 9A. Controls and Procedures


	 for our evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.




	Certain additional information concerning regulatory guidelines for capital adequacy and other regulatory matters is presented herein under the caption “


	Capital


	” in

	Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data


	.




	Isabella Bank




	The Bank is supervised and regulated by


	DIFS


	 and the


	FRB


	. The agencies and federal and state laws extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business including, among other things, permissible types and amounts of loans, investments and other activities, capital adequacy, branching, interest rates on loans and deposits, and the safety and soundness of banking practices.




	Our deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the


	DIF


	 of the


	FDIC


	 and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the


	DIF


	. The


	FDIC


	 assesses insurance premiums based upon a financial ratios method that takes into account assets and capital levels and supervisory ratings.




	Banking laws and regulations restrict transactions by insured banks owned by a bank holding company, including loans to and certain purchases from the parent holding company, non-bank and bank subsidiaries of the parent holding company, principal shareholders, officers, directors and their affiliates, and investments by the subsidiary bank in the shares or securities of the parent holding company (or any of the other non-bank or bank affiliates), or acceptance of such shares or securities as collateral security for loans to any borrower.




	The Bank is subject to legal limitations on the frequency and amount of dividends that can be paid to Isabella Bank Corporation. For example, a Michigan state chartered bank may not declare a cash dividend or a dividend in kind except out of net profits then on hand after deducting all losses and bad debts, and then only if it will have a surplus amounting to not less than


	20%


	 of its capital after the payment of the dividend. Moreover, a Michigan state chartered bank may not declare or pay any cash dividend or dividend in kind until the cumulative dividends on its preferred stock, if any, have been paid in full. Further, if the surplus of a Michigan state chartered bank is at any time less than the amount of its capital, before the declaration of a cash dividend or dividend in kind, it must transfer to surplus not less than


	10%


	 of its net profits for the preceding six months (in the case of quarterly or semi-annual dividends) or the preceding two consecutive six month periods (in the case of annual dividends).




	The payment of dividends by Isabella Bank Corporation and the Bank is also affected by various regulatory requirements and policies, such as the requirement to keep adequate capital in compliance with regulatory guidelines. Federal laws impose further restrictions on the payment of dividends by insured banks that fail to meet specified capital levels. The


	FDIC


	 may








	 5









	Table of Contents









	prevent an insured bank from paying dividends if the bank is in default of payment of any assessment due to the


	FDIC


	. In addition, payment of dividends by a bank may be prevented by the applicable federal regulatory authority if such payment is determined, by reason of the financial condition of such bank, to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The


	FRB


	 and the


	FDIC


	 have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Additionally, the


	FRB


	 Board of Governors requires a bank holding company to notify the


	FRB


	 prior to increasing its cash dividend by more than


	10%


	 over the prior year.




	The aforementioned regulations and restrictions may limit our ability to obtain funds from the Bank for our cash needs, including payment of dividends and operating expenses.




	The activities and operations of the Bank are also subject to various federal and state laws and regulations.








	Item 1A. Risk Factors


	.




	In the normal course of business we are exposed to various risks. These risks, if not managed correctly, could have a significant impact on our earnings, capital, share price, and ability to pay dividends. In order to effectively monitor and control the following risks, we utilize an enterprise risk model. We balance our strategic goals, including revenue and profitability objectives, with associated risks through the use of policies, systems, and procedures which have been adopted to identify, assess, control, monitor, and manage each risk area. We continually review the adequacy and effectiveness of these policies, systems, and procedures.




	Our enterprise risk process covers each of the following areas.




	Changes in credit quality and required allowance for loan and lease losses




	To manage the credit risk arising from lending activities, our most significant source of credit risk, we maintain sound underwriting policies and procedures. We continuously monitor asset quality in order to manage our credit risk to determine the appropriateness of valuation allowances. These valuation allowances take into consideration various factors including, but not limited to, local, regional, and national economic conditions.




	We maintain an


	ALLL


	 to reserve for estimated incurred loan losses and risks within our loan portfolio. The level of the


	ALLL


	 reflects our evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; loan portfolio quality; and economic, political and regulatory conditions. The determination of the appropriate level of the


	ALLL


	 inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates, all of which may undergo material changes.




	Changes in economic conditions




	An economic downturn within our local markets, as well as downturns in the state, national, or global markets, could negatively impact household and corporate incomes. This could lead to decreased demand for both loan and deposit products and lead to an increase of customers who fail to pay interest or principal on their loans. We continually monitor key economic indicators in an effort to anticipate the possible effects of downturns in the local, regional, and national economies.




	Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the State of Michigan and the specific local markets in which we operate. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers located primarily in the




	Clare, Gratiot, Isabella, Mecosta, Midland, Montcalm, and Saginaw counties


	 in Michigan. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services, as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans, and the stability of our deposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.




	Interest rate risk




	IRR


	 results from the timing differences in the maturity or repricing frequency of a financial institution’s interest earning assets and its interest bearing liabilities. We monitor the potential effects of changes in interest rates through simulations and gap analyses. To help mitigate the effects of changes in interest rates, we make significant efforts to stagger projected cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities.








	 6









	Table of Contents









	Liquidity risk




	Liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from our inability to meet our obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable costs. Liquidity risk includes the inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources, or failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value. We have significant borrowing capacity through correspondent banks and the ability to sell certain investments to fund potential cash shortages, which we may use to help mitigate this risk.




	The value of investment securities may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in the market




	A volatile, illiquid market or decline in credit quality could require us to recognize an


	OTTI


	 loss related to the investment securities held in our portfolio. We consider many factors in determining whether an


	OTTI


	 exists including the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than cost, the investment credit rating, and the probability that the issuer will be unable to pay the amount when due. The presence of these factors could lead to impairment charges. These risks are mitigated by the fact that we do not intend to sell the security in an unrealized loss position and it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis.




	Operational risk




	Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or external events and includes reputation risk and transaction risk. Reputation risk is developing and retaining marketplace confidence in handling customers’ financial transactions in an appropriate manner and protecting our safety and soundness. Transaction risk includes losses from fraud, error, the inability to deliver products or services, and loss or theft of information. Transaction risk also encompasses product development and delivery, transaction processing, information technology systems, and the internal control environment.




	To minimize potential losses due to operational risks, we have established a robust system of internal controls that is regularly tested by our internal audit department in conjunction with the services of certified public accounting firms who assist in performing such internal audit work. The focus of these internal audit procedures is to verify the validity and appropriateness of various transactions, processes, and controls. The results of these procedures are reported to our Audit Committee.




	The adoption of, violations of, or nonconformance with laws, rules, regulations, or prescribed practices




	The financial services industry and public companies are extensively regulated and must meet regulatory standards set by the


	FDIC


	,


	DIFS


	,


	FRB


	,


	FASB


	,


	SEC


	,


	PCAOB


	, the


	CFPB


	, and other regulatory bodies. Federal and state laws and regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, and not necessarily to benefit our shareholders. The nature, extent, and timing of the adoption of significant new laws, changes in existing laws, or repeal of existing laws may have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, the effect of which is impossible to predict at this time.




	Our compliance department annually assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of our processes for controlling and managing our principal compliance risks.




	We may not adjust to changes in the financial services industry




	Our financial performance depends in part on our ability to maintain and grow our core deposit customer base and expand our financial services to our existing and new customers. The increasingly competitive environment is, in part, a result of changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. New competitors may emerge to increase the degree of competition for our products and services. Financial services and products are also constantly changing. Our financial performance is also dependent upon customer demand for our products and services and our ability to develop and offer competitive financial products and services.




	We may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill




	Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts paid to acquire subsidiaries over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. The majority of the recorded goodwill is related to acquisitions of other banks, which were subsequently merged into Isabella Bank. If it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, we must


	write-down


	 the goodwill by the amount of the impairment.








	 7









	Table of Contents









	We may face pressure from purchasers of our residential mortgage loans to repurchase loans sold or reimburse purchasers for losses related to such loans




	We generally sell the fixed rate long term residential mortgage loans we originate to the secondary market. In response to the recent economic downturn, the purchasers of residential mortgage loans, such as government sponsored entities, increased their efforts to require sellers of residential mortgage loans to either repurchase loans previously sold, or reimburse the purchasers for losses incurred on foreclosed loans due to actual or alleged failure to strictly conform to the terms of the contract.




	Consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions




	Technology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions without the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries in financial transactions could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits.




	Changes to the financial services industry as a result of regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation




	The financial services industry is extensively regulated by state and federal regulation that governs almost all aspects of our operations. Laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, and the deposit insurance fund. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact us or our ability to increase the value of our business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution, and the appropriateness of an institution’s


	ALLL


	. Future regulatory changes or accounting pronouncements may increase our regulatory capital requirements or adversely affect our regulatory capital levels. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against us could require the dedication of significant time and resources to defending our business and may lead to penalties.




	Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through cyber attacks, breach of computer systems or other means




	As part of our business, we collect and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information on our behalf and on behalf of other third parties. Despite the security measures we have in place for our facilities and systems, and the security measures of our third party service providers, we may be vulnerable to cyber attacks, security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, human errors or other similar events. Risks related to cybersecurity continue to evolve within the industry. We continually review and monitor information and data related to cybersecurity to detect and mitigate attacks. A cyber attack could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information, whether by us or by our vendors, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.




	Our estimates and assumptions may be incorrect




	Our


	consolidated financial statements


	 conform with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the


	consolidated financial statements


	. These estimates are based on information available to us at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ from those estimates. For further discussion regarding significant accounting estimates, see “


	Note 1 –


	Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies


	” of the


	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


	 in


	Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data


	.




	Disruption of infrastructure




	Our operations depend upon our technological and physical infrastructure, including our equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of our vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, computer hacking and viruses, or other events outside of our control, could have a significant impact on our operations. We have developed and tested disaster recovery plans, which provide detailed instructions covering all significant aspects of our operations.




	Anti-takeover provisions




	Our articles of incorporation include anti-takeover provisions that require a two-thirds majority vote to approve a sale of the Corporation. Additionally, changes to our articles of incorporation must be approved by a two-thirds majority vote of our shareholders. These provisions may make our stock less attractive to potential shareholders.

	Our executive offices are located at 401 North Main Street in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. In addition to this location, we own


	29


	 branches, an operations center, a mortgage operations center, and our previous main office building. We also lease property in Saginaw, Michigan which serves as a loan production office. Our facilities' current, planned, and best use is for conducting our current activities, with the exception of approximately 75% of our previous main office location. We continually monitor and assess the need for expansion and/or improvement for all facilities. In our opinion, each facility has sufficient capacity and is in good condition.

We are involved in ordinary, routine litigation incidental to our business; however, no such routine proceedings are expected to result in any material adverse effect on our consolidated operations, earnings, financial condition, or cash flows.

	200,000


	 shares of common stock after that date. These authorizations do not have expiration dates. As shares are repurchased under this plan, they are retired and revert back to the status of authorized, but unissued shares.

	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


	.










	ISABELLA BANK CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW




	(


	Dollars in thousands


	 except per share amounts)




	The following is management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations. This discussion and analysis is intended to provide a better understanding of the


	consolidated financial statements


	 and statistical data included elsewhere in this


	Annual Report on Form 10-K


	.




	Executive Summary




	We reported net income of


	$13,799


	 and earnings per common share of


	$1.77


	 for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	. Our earnings have primarily been the result of increased interest income driven by outstanding loan growth during 2016. Our strong credit quality resulted in a decline in the level of the ALLL in both amount and as a percentage of gross loans, resulting in a reversal of provision for loan losses of


	$135


	 for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	. Net loan recoveries during


	2016


	 were


	$135


	 as compared to net loan recoveries of


	$71


	 in


	2015


	.




	During the year, total assets grew by


	3.84%


	 to


	$1,732,151


	, and assets under management increased to


	$2,432,726


	 which includes loans sold and serviced and assets managed by our Investment and Trust Services Department of


	$700,575


	. In


	2016


	, we had total loan growth of


	$160,123


	 which was driven by commercial and agricultural loan growth of


	$137,864


	. Also contributing to this growth in 2016 were increases in both residential real estate and consumer loans of


	$22,259


	.




	Our net yield on interest earning assets of


	3.00%


	 remains at historically low levels. While the


	FRB


	 increased short term interest rates in December 2016 and projects increases in 2017, we do not anticipate significant improvements in our net yield on interest earning assets as the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities will likely increase faster than those of interest earning assets. Net interest income will increase only through continued strategic growth in loans, investments, and other income earning assets. We are committed to increasing earnings and shareholder value through growth in our loan portfolio, growth in our investment and trust services, and increasing our geographical presence while managing operating costs.




	Recent Legislation




	The Health Care and Education Act of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the


	Dodd-Frank Act


	, and the


	JOBS Act


	, have already had, and are expected to continue to have, a negative impact on our operating results. Of these four acts, the


	Dodd-Frank Act


	 has had the most significant impact. The


	Dodd-Frank Act


	 established the


	CFPB


	 which has made significant changes in the regulation of financial institutions aimed at strengthening the oversight of the federal government over the operation of the financial services sector and increasing the protection of consumers. New regulations issued by the


	CFPB


	 regarding consumer lending, including residential mortgage lending, have increased our compensation and outside advisor costs and this trend is expected to continue.




	On July 2, 2013, the FRB published revised BASEL III Capital standards for banks. The rules redefine what is included or deducted from equity capital, changes risk weighting for certain on and off-balance sheet assets, increases the minimum required equity capital to be considered well capitalized, and introduces a capital cushion buffer. The rules, which will be gradually phased in between 2015 and 2019, are not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation but will require us to hold more capital than we have historically.




	Reclassifications




	Certain amounts reported in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for


	2015


	 and


	2014


	 have been reclassified to conform with the


	2016


	 presentation.




	Other




	We have not received any notices of regulatory actions as of


	February 23, 2017


	.

	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	Our significant accounting policies are set forth in “


	Note 1 –


	Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies


	” of the


	“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”


	 in


	Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data


	. Of these significant accounting policies, we consider our policies regarding the


	ALLL


	, acquisition intangibles and goodwill, and the determination of the fair value and assessment of


	OTTI


	 of investment securities to be our most critical accounting policies.




	The


	ALLL


	 requires our most subjective and complex judgment. Changes in economic conditions can have a significant impact on the


	ALLL


	 and, therefore, the provision for loan losses and results of operations. We have developed policies and procedures for assessing the appropriateness of the


	ALLL


	, recognizing that this process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to our loan portfolio. Our assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions, and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers which is not known to us at the time of the issuance of the


	consolidated financial statements


	. For additional discussion concerning our


	ALLL


	 and related matters, see the detailed discussion to follow under the caption “


	Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses


	” and “


	Note 5 –


	Loans and ALLL


	” of the


	“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”


	 in


	Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data


	.




	U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we determine the fair value of the assets and liabilities of an acquired entity, and record their fair value on the date of acquisition. We employ a variety of measures in the determination of the fair value, including the use of discounted cash flow analysis, market appraisals, and projected future revenue streams. For certain items that we believe we have the appropriate expertise to determine the fair value, we may choose to use our own calculations of the value. In other cases, where the value is not easily determined, we consult with outside parties to determine the fair value of the identified asset or liability. Once valuations have been adjusted, the net difference between the price paid for the acquired entity and the net value of assets acquired on our balance sheet, including identifiable intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition intangibles and goodwill are qualitatively evaluated to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying balance is impaired on at least an annual basis.




	AFS securities


	 are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value included as a component of other comprehensive income. Declines in the fair value of


	AFS securities


	 below their cost that are


	other-than-temporary


	 are reflected as realized losses in the consolidated statements of income. We evaluate


	AFS securities


	 for indications of losses that are considered


	other-than-temporary


	, if any, on a regular basis. The market values for most


	AFS


	 investment securities are typically obtained from outside sources and applied to individual securities within the portfolio. Municipal securities for which no readily determinable market values are available are priced using fair value curves which most closely match the security's credit ratings and maturities.

	Table of Contents









	Net Interest Income




	Net interest income is the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expenses on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income, which includes loan fees, is influenced by changes in the balance and mix of assets and liabilities and market interest rates. We exert some control over these factors; however,


	FRB


	 monetary policy and competition have a significant impact. For analytical purposes, net interest income is adjusted to an


	FTE


	 basis by adding the income tax savings from interest on tax exempt loans, and nontaxable investment securities, thus making year to year comparisons more meaningful.








	Volume and Rate Variance Analysis




	The following table sets forth the effect of volume and rate changes on interest income and expense for the periods indicated. For the purpose of this table, changes in interest due to volume and rate were determined as follows:




	Volume—change in volume multiplied by the previous period's


	FTE


	 rate.




	Rate—change in the


	FTE


	 rate multiplied by the previous period's volume.




	The change in interest due to both volume and rate has been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.

	Our net yield on interest earning assets remains at historically low levels. The persistent low interest rate environment coupled with a high concentration of


	AFS securities


	 as a percentage of earning assets has also placed downward pressure on net interest margin. While the


	FRB


	 increased short term interest rates in late 2016, we do not expect any significant change in our net yield on interest earning assets as the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities will likely increase faster than those of interest earning assets. Net interest income will increase only through continued balance sheet growth.

	Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses




	The viability of any financial institution is ultimately determined by its management of credit risk. Loans represent our single largest concentration of risk. The


	ALLL


	 is our estimation of incurred losses within the existing loan portfolio. We allocate the


	ALLL


	 throughout the loan portfolio based on our assessment of the underlying risks associated with each loan segment. Our assessments include allocations based on specific impairment valuation allowances, historical


	charge-off


	s, internally assigned credit risk ratings, and past due and


	nonaccrual


	 balances. A portion of the


	ALLL


	 is not allocated to any one loan segment, but is instead a reflection of other qualitative risks that reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.




	The following table summarizes our


	charge-offs


	, recoveries, provisions for loan losses, and


	ALLL


	 balances as of, and for the unaudited three month periods ended:

	As the level of net loans charged-off declines and credit quality indicators remain stable, we have reduced the ALLL in both amount and as a percentage of loans. While they can be more volatile, loans individually evaluated for impairment have been steadily declining since December 31, 2015. The decline in loans collectively impaired illustrates the downward trend we are experiencing in our overall level of ALLL to gross loans. The following table illustrates our changes within the two main components of the ALLL.

	Fluctuations in past due and

	 status loans can have a significant impact on the


	ALLL


	. To determine the potential impact, and corresponding estimated losses, we analyze our historical loss trends on loans past due greater than 30 days and


	nonaccrual


	 status loans. We monitor all loans that are past due and in


	nonaccrual


	 status for indications of additional deterioration.

	Troubled Debt Restructurings




	We have taken a proactive approach to avoid foreclosures on borrowers who are willing to work with us in modifying their loans, thus making them more affordable. While this approach has allowed certain borrowers to develop a payment structure that will allow them to continue making payments in lieu of foreclosure, it has contributed to a significant level of loans classified as


	TDRs


	. The modifications have been successful for us and our customers as very few of the modified loans have resulted in foreclosures. At the time of the


	TDR


	, the loan is reviewed to determine whether or not to classify the loan as accrual or


	nonaccrual


	 status. The majority of new modifications result in terms that satisfy our criteria for continued interest accrual.


	TDRs


	 that have been placed on


	nonaccrual


	 status may be placed back on accrual status after


	six months


	 of continued performance.




	We restructure debt with borrowers who due to temporary financial difficulties are unable to service their debt under the original terms. We may extend the amortization period, reduce interest rates, forgive principal, forgive interest, or a combination of these modifications. Typically, the modifications are for a period of five years or less. There were no


	TDRs


	 that were Government sponsored as of


	December 31, 2016


	 or


	December 31, 2015


	.




	Losses associated with


	TDRs


	, if any, are included in the estimation of the


	ALLL


	 in the quarter in which a loan is identified as a


	TDR


	, and we review the analysis of the


	ALLL


	 estimation each reporting period to ensure its continued appropriateness.

	After a loan is 90 days past due, it is placed on


	nonaccrual


	 status unless it is well secured and in the process of collection. Upon transferring a loan to


	nonaccrual


	 status, we perform an evaluation to determine the net realizable value of the underlying collateral. This evaluation is used to help determine if any


	charge-offs


	 are necessary. Loans may be placed back on accrual status after six months months of continued performance. Current levels of nonperforming loans continue to reflect historic lows.

	We continue to devote considerable attention to identifying impaired loans and adjusting the net carrying value of these loans to their current net realizable values through the establishment of a specific reserve or the recording of a


	charge-off


	. We believe that we have identified all impaired loans as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	We believe that the level of the


	ALLL


	 is appropriate as of


	December 31, 2016


	. We will continue to closely monitor overall credit quality indicators and our policies and procedures related to the analysis of the

	 to ensure that the


	ALLL


	 remains at the appropriate level.

	Significant changes in


	noninterest


	 income are detailed below:













	•






	ATM and debit card fees fluctuate from period-to-period based on usage of ATM and debit cards. While we do not anticipate significant changes to our ATM and debit card fees, we do expect that fees will continue to increase in 2017 as the usage of ATM and debit cards continues to increase.
















	•






	NSF and overdraft fees fluctuate from period-to-period based on customer activity as well as the number of business days in the period. We anticipate NSF and overdraft fees in 2017 to approximate 2016 levels.
















	•






	Offering rates on residential mortgage loans and increased prepayment speeds have been the most significant drivers behind the fluctuations in net


	OMSR


	 income (loss). We anticipate increases in our originations in purchase money mortgage activity as a result of our various initiatives to drive growth. Additionally, we anticipate increased mortgage rates; therefore, we anticipate net OMSR income to improve into 2017.
















	•






	We are continually analyzing our


	AFS securities


	 for potential sale opportunities. Securities with unrealized gains and less than desirable yields may be sold for funding and profitability purposes. During the second quarter of 2016, we identified several mortgage-backed securities that were desirable to be sold and recognized gains with these sales. We will continue to analyze our


	AFS securities


	 portfolio for potential sale opportunities in 2017 and sell


	AFS securities


	 when appropriate.
















	•






	In recent periods, we have invested considerable efforts to increase our market share in trust and brokerage advisory services. These efforts have translated into increases in trust fees and brokerage and advisory fees. We anticipate that these fees in 2017 will approximate 2016 levels.
















	•






	Included in other income in 2016 is a $469 gain on a redemption of a bank owned life insurance policy. All other fluctuations in all other income is spread throughout various categories, none of which are individually significant.

	Significant changes in


	noninterest


	 expenses are detailed below:













	•






	We acquired two branches in mid-2015 which resulted in increased expenses in 2016 for most of the categories presented above. None of the increases are individually significant.
















	•






	Consulting fees


	 in 2016 increased as a result of outsourced operational functions related to our investment and trust services, consulting services to streamline processes, and talent recruitment services. Fees in 2017 are expected to approximate 2016 levels.
















	•






	During the fourth quarter of 2016, we identified an AFS security that was impaired which resulted in an OTTI expense of $770.
















	•






	We have consistently been a strong supporter of the various communities, schools, and charities in the markets we serve. Included in donations and community relations were discretionary donations to The Isabella Bank Foundation, a non-controlled affiliated entity, of $258 and $500 for the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Donations and community relations fluctuate from period-to-period with 2017 expenses expected to approximate 2016 levels.
















	•






	We place a strong emphasis on employee development through continuous education. Education and travel expenses vary from year to year based on the timing of various programs that our employees attend. Expenses in 2017 are expected to approximate 2016 levels.
















	•






	The increase in loan underwriting fees is related to the increase in loan volume throughout 2016. Loan underwriting fees are expected to approximate 2016 levels in 2017.
















	•






	Legal fees


	 in 2015 include approximately $133 of legal service expense incurred as a result of two branch acquisitions during the third quarter of that year. Legal fees are expected to approximate 2016 levels in 2017.
















	•






	The fluctuations in all other expenses are spread throughout various categories, none of which are individually significant.

	As shown above, total assets have increased


	$64,039


	 since


	December 31, 2015


	 which was primarily driven by loan growth of


	$160,123


	. This growth was funded by the sale of AFS securities and increases in both deposits and borrowed funds. While generating quality loans will continue to be competitive, we expect that loans will continue to grow in


	2017


	.




	A discussion of changes in balance sheet amounts by major categories follows:




	Cash and cash equivalents




	Included in cash and cash equivalents are funds held with


	FRB


	 which fluctuate from period-to-period.




	AFS


	 investment securities




	The primary objective of our investing activities is to provide for safety of the principal invested. Secondary considerations include the need for earnings, liquidity, and our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. The current interest rate environment has made it almost impossible to increase net interest income without increasing earning assets. As loan demand outpaced deposit growth in recent periods, we sold AFS securities to provide funding. We anticipate that future increases in our AFS securities will be in the form of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations.

	Excluding those holdings in government sponsored enterprises and municipalities within the State of Michigan, there were


	no


	 investments in securities of any one issuer that exceeded 10% of shareholders’ equity. We have a policy prohibiting investments in securities that we deem are unsuitable due to their inherent credit or market risks. Prohibited investments include stripped mortgage backed securities, zero coupon bonds, nongovernment agency asset backed securities, and structured notes. Our holdings in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations include only government agencies and government sponsored agencies as we hold no investments in private label mortgage-backed securities or collateralized mortgage obligations.




	The following is a schedule of maturities of


	AFS


	 investment securities and their weighted average yield as of


	December 31, 2016


	. Weighted average yields have been computed on an


	FTE


	 basis using a tax rate of


	34%


	. Our auction rate money market preferred is a long term floating rate instrument for which the interest rate is set at periodic auctions. At each successful auction, we have the option to sell the security at par value. Additionally, the issuers of auction rate securities generally have the right to redeem or refinance the debt. Because of their lack of contractual maturities, auction rate money market preferred and preferred stocks are not reported by a specific maturity group. Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are not reported by a specific maturity group due to their variable monthly payments. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.

	Loans




	Loans are the largest component of earning assets. The proper management of credit and market risk inherent in the loan portfolio is critical to our financial well-being. To control these risks, we have adopted strict underwriting standards which include lending limits to a single borrower, strict loan to collateral value limits, and a defined market area. We also monitor and limit loan concentrations to specific industries. We have no foreign loans and there were no concentrations greater than 10% of total loans that are not disclosed as a separate category in the following table.

	While competition for commercial loans continues to be strong, we experienced significant growth in this segment of the portfolio during 2016 and anticipate strong growth in 2017. Residential real estate and consumer loans increased during 2016 and we anticipate continued growth in 2017 as a result of initiatives implemented during 2016 designed to increase loan volume.

	Deposit demand continues to be driven by non-contractual deposits, such as demand and savings deposits, while certificates of deposit and Internet certificates of deposit have gradually declined. Our significant growth in savings deposits during 2015 was the result of branch acquisitions. We look to retain and attract new customers with the recent branch acquisitions to provide growth in deposits in future periods. Brokered certificates of deposit offer another source of funding and fluctuate from period-to-period based on our funding needs, including changes in assets such as loans and investments.

	Capital




	Capital consists solely of common stock, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We are authorized to raise capital through dividend reinvestment, employee and director stock purchases, and shareholder stock purchases. Pursuant to these authorizations, we issued


	179,903


	 shares or


	$5,023


	 of common stock during


	2016


	, and


	216,700


	 shares or


	$5,201


	 of common stock in


	2015


	. We also offer the


	Directors Plan


	 in which participants either directly purchase stock or purchase stock units through deferred fees, in lieu of cash payments. Pursuant to this plan, we increased shareholders’ equity by


	$573


	 and


	$550


	 during


	2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.




	We have a publicly announced common stock repurchase plan. Pursuant to this plan, we repurchased


	158,701


	 shares or


	$4,440


	 of common stock during


	2016


	 and


	193,107


	 shares or


	$4,590


	 during


	2015


	. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we were authorized to repurchase up to an additional


	199,957


	 shares of common stock.




	The FRB has established minimum risk based capital guidelines. Pursuant to these guidelines, a framework has been established that assigns risk weights to each category of on and off-balance-sheet items to arrive at risk adjusted total assets. Regulatory capital is divided by the risk adjusted assets with the resulting ratio compared to the minimum standard to determine whether a corporation has adequate capital. On July 2, 2013, the FRB published revised BASEL III Capital standards for banks. The final rules redefine what is included or deducted from equity capital, changes risk weighting for certain on and








	 30









	Table of Contents









	off-balance sheet assets, increases the minimum required equity capital to be considered well capitalized, and introduces a capital conservation buffer. The rules, which are being gradually phased in between 2015 and 2019, are not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation but will require us to hold more capital than we have historically.









	There are no significant regulatory constraints placed on our capital. The


	FRB


	’s current recommended minimum primary capital to assets requirement is 6.00%. Our primary capital to adjusted average assets, or tier 1 leverage ratio, was


	8.56%


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	Effective January 1, 2015, the minimum standard for primary, or Tier 1, capital increased from 4.00% to


	6.00%


	. The minimum standard for total capital remained at


	8.00%


	. Also effective January 1, 2015 was the new common equity tier 1 capital ratio which had a minimum requirement of


	4.50%


	. Beginning on January 1, 2016, the capital conservation buffer went into effect which further increased the required levels. The following table sets forth the percentages required under the Risk Based Capital guidelines and our values as of

	Tier 2 capital, or secondary capital, includes only the

	The


	FRB


	 and


	FDIC


	 also prescribe minimum capital requirements for Isabella Bank. At


	December 31, 2016


	, the Bank exceeded these minimum capital requirements. For further information regarding the Bank’s capital requirements, see “


	Note 16 –


	Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements

	“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”


	 in

	.








	Fair Value




	We utilize fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.


	AFS


	 securities and certain liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from


	time-to-time


	, we may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as mortgage loans


	AFS


	, impaired loans, foreclosed assets,


	OMSR


	, and certain other assets and liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of lower of cost or market accounting or


	write-downs


	 of individual assets.




	For further information regarding fair value measurements, see “


	Note 1 –


	Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies


	” and “


	Note 20 –


	Fair Value


	” of the


	“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”


	 in


	Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data


	.








	Interest Rate Sensitivity




	Interest rate sensitivity is determined by the amount of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repricing within a specific time period, and their relative sensitivity to a change in interest rates. We strive to achieve reasonable stability in the net interest margin through periods of changing interest rates. One tool we use to measure interest rate sensitivity is gap analysis. As shown in the following table, the gap analysis depicts our position for specific time periods and the cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets.




	Fixed interest rate


	AFS securities


	 are scheduled according to their contractual maturity. Fixed rate loans are included in the appropriate time frame based on their scheduled amortization. Variable rate loans, which totaled


	$212,240


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	, are included in the time frame of their earliest repricing. Time deposit liabilities are scheduled based on their contractual maturity except for variable rate time deposits in the amount of


	$2,988


	 that are included in the 0 to 3 month time frame.




	Savings and


	NOW


	 accounts have no contractual maturity date and are believed by us to be predominantly


	noninterest


	 rate sensitive. These accounts have been classified in the gap table according to their estimated withdrawal rates based upon our analysis of deposit decay over the past five years. We believe this decay experience is consistent with our expectation for the future. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had a positive cumulative gap within one year. A positive gap position results when more assets, within a specified time frame, have the potential to mature or reprice than liabilities.

	The following table shows the time periods and the amount of assets and liabilities available for interest rate repricing as of

	Liquidity




	Liquidity is monitored regularly by our Market Risk Committee, which consists of members of senior management. The committee reviews projected cash flows, key ratios, and liquidity available from both primary and secondary sources.




	Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered


	AFS


	 securities. These categories totaled


	$307,112


	 or


	17.73%


	 of assets as of


	December 31, 2016


	 as compared to


	$387,707


	 or


	23.24%


	 as of


	December 31, 2015


	. Liquidity is important for financial institutions because of their need to meet loan funding commitments, depositor withdrawal requests, and various other commitments including expansion of operations, investment opportunities, and payment of cash dividends. Liquidity varies significantly daily, based on customer activity.




	Our primary source of funds is deposit accounts. We also have the ability to borrow from the


	FHLB


	, the


	FRB


	, and through various correspondent banks in the form of federal funds purchased and a line of credit. These funding methods typically carry a higher interest rate than traditional market deposit accounts. Some borrowed funds, including


	FHLB


	 advances,


	FRB


	 Discount Window advances, and repurchase agreements, require us to pledge assets, typically in the form of


	AFS securities


	 or loans as collateral. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had available lines of credit of


	$99,118


	.

	Market Risk






	Our primary market risks are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. We have no significant foreign exchange risk, except for interest rate locks and forward loan commitments, in the management of


	IRR


	. Any changes in foreign exchange rates or commodity prices would not have a significant impact on our interest income and cash flows.




	IRR


	 is the exposure of our net interest income to changes in interest rates.


	IRR


	 results from the difference in the maturity or repricing frequency of a financial institution's interest earning assets and its interest bearing liabilities.


	IRR


	 is the fundamental method by which financial institutions earn income and create shareholder value. Excessive exposure to


	IRR


	 could pose a significant risk to our earnings and capital.




	The


	FRB


	 has adopted a policy requiring us to effectively manage the various risks that can have a material impact on our safety and soundness. The risks include credit, interest rate, liquidity, operational, and reputational. We have policies, procedures, and internal controls for measuring and managing these risks. Specifically, our Funds Management policy and procedures include defining acceptable types and terms of investments and funding sources, liquidity requirements, limits on investments in long term assets, limiting the mismatch in repricing opportunity of assets and liabilities, and the frequency of measuring and reporting to our Board.




	The primary technique to measure


	IRR


	 is simulation analysis. Simulation analysis forecasts the effects on the balance sheet structure and net interest income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in interest rates, the shape of yield curves, interest rate relationships, loan prepayments, and changes in funding sources. These forecasts are compared against net interest income projected in a stable interest rate environment. While many assets and liabilities reprice either at maturity or in accordance with their contractual terms, several balance sheet components demonstrate characteristics that require an evaluation to more accurately reflect their repricing behavior. Key assumptions in the simulation analysis include prepayments on loans, probable calls of investment securities, changes in market conditions, loan volumes and loan pricing, deposit sensitivity, and customer preferences. These assumptions are inherently uncertain as they are subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment. As a result, the simulation analysis cannot precisely forecast the impact of rising and falling interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to many other factors, including changes in balance sheet components, interest rate changes, changes in market conditions, and management strategies.

	Our interest rate sensitivity is estimated by first forecasting the next 12 and 24 months of net interest income under an assumed environment of a constant balance sheet and constant market interest rates (base case). We then compare the results of various simulation analyses to the base case. At


	December 31, 2016


	, we projected the change in net interest income during the next 12 and 24 months assuming market interest rates were to immediately decrease by 100 basis points and increase by 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve during the same time period. We did not project scenarios showing decreases in interest rates beyond 100 basis points as this is considered extremely unlikely given current interest rate levels. These projections were based on our assets and liabilities remaining static over the next 12 and 24 months, while factoring in probable calls and prepayments of certain investment securities and real estate residential and consumer loans. While it is extremely unlikely that interest rates would immediately increase to these levels, we feel that these extreme scenarios help us identify potential gaps and mismatches in the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. We regularly monitor our projected net interest income sensitivity to ensure that it remains within established limits. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our interest rate sensitivity results were within Board approved limits.

	Gap analysis, the secondary method to measure


	IRR


	, measures the cash flows and/or the earliest repricing of our interest bearing assets and liabilities. This analysis is useful for measuring trends in the repricing characteristics of the balance sheet. Significant assumptions are required in this process because of the embedded repricing options contained in assets and liabilities. Residential real estate and consumer loans allow the borrower to repay the balance prior to maturity without penalty, while commercial and agricultural loans have prepayment penalties. The amount of prepayments is dependent upon many factors, including the interest rate of a given loan in comparison to the current offering rates, the level of sales of used homes, and the overall availability of credit in the market place. Generally, a decrease in interest rates will result in an increase in cash flows from these assets. A significant portion of our securities are callable or have prepayment options. The call and prepayment options are more likely to be exercised in a period of decreasing interest rates. Savings and demand accounts may generally be withdrawn on request without prior notice. The timing of cash flows from these deposits is estimated based on historical experience.


	Certificates of deposit


	 have penalties that discourage early withdrawals.

	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm




	Shareholders and Board of Directors




	Isabella Bank Corporation




	Mount Pleasant, Michigan




	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of


	Isabella Bank Corporation


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, and the related consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity, income, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended


	December 31, 2016


	. We also have audited


	Isabella Bank Corporation’s


	 internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	, based on criteria established in the


	Internal Control-Integrated Framework


	 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).


	Isabella Bank Corporation’s


	 management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the effectiveness of


	Isabella Bank Corporation


	’s


	 internal control over financial reporting, based on our audits.




	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material misstatement exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	A corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A corporation’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the corporation; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the corporation’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.




	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.




	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of


	Isabella Bank Corporation


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended


	December 31, 2016


	 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion


	Isabella Bank Corporation


	 maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	, based on the COSO criteria.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(


	Dollars in thousands


	 except per share amounts)








	Note 1 –


	Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




	BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION:


	 The


	consolidated financial statements


	 include the accounts of Isabella Bank Corporation, a financial services holding company, and its wholly owned subsidiary, Isabella Bank. All intercompany balances and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. References to "the Corporation," “Isabella,” “we,” “our,” “us,” and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of Isabella Bank Corporation and its subsidiary. Isabella Bank Corporation refers solely to the parent holding company, and Isabella Bank or the “Bank” refer to Isabella Bank Corporation’s subsidiary, Isabella Bank.




	For additional information, see “


	Note 19 –


	Related Party Transactions


	.”




	NATURE OF OPERATIONS:


	 Isabella Bank Corporation is a financial services holding company offering a wide array of financial products and services in several mid-Michigan counties. Our banking subsidiary, Isabella Bank, offers banking services through


	29


	 locations and a loan production office, 24 hour banking services locally and nationally through shared automatic teller machines, 24 hour online banking, mobile banking, and direct deposits to businesses, institutions, and individuals. Lending services offered include commercial loans, agricultural loans, residential real estate loans, and consumer loans. Deposit services include interest and


	noninterest


	 bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit. Other related financial products include trust and investment services, safe deposit box rentals, and credit life insurance. Active competition, principally from other commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions, exists in all of our principal markets. Our results of operations can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates and changes in the local economic environment.




	USE OF ESTIMATES:


	 In preparing


	consolidated financial statements


	 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the


	ALLL


	, the fair value of


	AFS


	 investment securities, and the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets.




	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS


	: Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts such sales or transfers based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. Assumptions are developed based on prioritizing information within a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data, such as the reporting entity’s own data. We may choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates.




	For assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, it is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those financial instruments for which there is an active market. In cases where the market for a financial asset or liability is not active, we include appropriate risk adjustments that market participants would make for nonperformance and liquidity risks when developing fair value measurements. Fair value measurements for assets and liabilities for which limited or no observable market data exists are accordingly based primarily upon estimates, are often calculated based on the economic and competitive environment, the characteristics of the asset or liability and other factors. Therefore, the results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability. Additionally, there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results of current or future values.




	We utilize fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. Investment securities


	AFS


	 are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from


	time-to-time


	, we may be required to record other assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as mortgage loans


	AFS


	, impaired loans, foreclosed assets,


	OMSR


	, goodwill, and certain other assets and liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of lower of cost or market accounting or


	write-downs


	 of individual assets.








	 44









	Table of Contents









	Fair Value Hierarchy




	Under fair value measurement and disclosure authoritative guidance, we group assets and liabilities measured at fair value into three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded, and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value, based on the prioritization of inputs in the valuation techniques. These levels are:

















	Level 1:






	Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.








	Level 2:






	Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.








	Level 3:






	Valuation is generated from model based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.









	The asset’s or liability’s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Transfers between measurement levels are recognized at the end of reporting periods.




	For further discussion of fair value considerations, refer to “


	Note 20 –


	Fair Value


	.”




	SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK


	: Most of our activities conducted are with customers located within the central Michigan area. A significant amount of our outstanding loans are secured by commercial and residential real estate. Other than these types of loans, there is no significant concentration to any other industry or any one customer.




	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:


	 For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances due from banks, federal funds sold, and other deposit accounts. Generally, federal funds sold are for a


	one day


	 period. We maintain deposit accounts in various financial institutions which generally exceed federally insured limits or are not insured. We do not believe we are exposed to any significant interest, credit or other financial risk as a result of these deposits.




	AFS SECURITIES:


	 Purchases of investment securities are generally classified as


	AFS


	. However, we may elect to classify securities as either held to maturity or trading. Securities classified as


	AFS


	 are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of the effect of deferred income taxes, excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income. Included in


	AFS securities


	 are auction rate money market preferreds and preferred stocks. These investments are considered equity securities for federal income tax purposes, and as such, no estimated federal income tax impact is expected or recorded. Auction rate money market preferred securities and preferred stocks are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. Realized gains and losses on the sale of


	AFS securities


	 are determined using the specific identification method.




	AFS securities


	 are reviewed quarterly for possible


	OTTI


	. In determining whether an


	OTTI


	 exists for debt securities, we assert that: (a) we do not have the intent to sell the security; and (b) it is more likely than not we will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. If these conditions are not met, we recognize an


	OTTI


	 charge through earnings for the difference between the debt security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value, and such amount is included in


	noninterest


	 income. For debt securities that do not meet the above criteria, and we do not expect to recover the security’s amortized cost basis, the security is considered


	other-than-temporarily


	 impaired. For these debt securities, we separate the total impairment into the credit risk loss component and the amount of the loss related to market and other risk factors. In order to determine the amount of the credit loss for a debt security, we calculate the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the current cash flows and future cash flows we expect to recover. The amount of the total


	OTTI


	 related to the credit risk is recognized in earnings and is included in


	noninterest


	 income. The amount of the total


	OTTI


	 related to other risk factors is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. For debt securities that have recognized an


	OTTI


	 through earnings, if through subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in the cash flow expected, the difference between the amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as interest income.




	AFS


	 equity securities are reviewed for


	OTTI


	 at each reporting date. This evaluation considers a number of factors including, but not limited to, the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, and our ability and intent to hold the securities until fair value recovers. If it is determined that we do not have the ability and intent to hold the securities until recovery or that there are conditions that indicate that a security may not recover in value then the difference between the fair value and the cost of the security is recognized in earnings and is included in


	noninterest


	 income.

	LOANS:


	 Loans that we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any


	charge-offs


	, the


	ALLL


	, and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans. Interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loan based on the principal amount outstanding. Loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are capitalized and recognized as a component of interest income over the term of the loan using the level yield method.




	The accrual of interest on agricultural, commercial and mortgage loans is discontinued at the time the loan is


	90 days


	 or more past due unless the credit is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically


	charged-off


	 no later than


	180 days


	 past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on


	nonaccrual


	 or


	charged-off


	 at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. For loans that are placed on


	nonaccrual


	 status or


	charged-off


	, all interest accrued in the current calendar year, but not collected, is reversed against interest income while interest accrued in prior calendar years, but not collected is charged against the


	ALLL


	. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis, until qualifying for return to accrual status. Loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. For impaired loans not classified as


	nonaccrual


	, interest income continues to be accrued over the term of the loan based on the principal amount outstanding.




	ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES:


	 The


	ALLL


	 is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the


	uncollectability


	 of the loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.




	We evaluate the


	ALLL


	 on a regular basis which is based upon our periodic review of the


	collectability


	 of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.




	The


	ALLL


	 consists of specific, general, and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are deemed to be impaired. For such loans that are also analyzed for specific allowance allocations, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that we believe affect our estimate of probable losses based on qualitative factors. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.




	Loans may be classified as impaired if they meet one or more of the following criteria:













	1.






	There has been a


	charge-off


	 of its principal balance;
















	2.






	The loan has been classified as a


	TDR


	; or
















	3.






	The loan is in


	nonaccrual


	 status.







	Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, less cost to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment.




	LOANS HELD FOR SALE:


	 Mortgage loans held for sale on the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by aggregating outstanding commitments from investors or current investor yield requirements. Net unrealized losses, if any, would be recognized as a component of other


	noninterest


	 expenses.




	Mortgage loans held for sale are sold with the mortgage servicing rights retained by us. The carrying value of mortgage loans sold is reduced by the cost allocated to the associated mortgage servicing rights. Gains or losses on sales of mortgage loans are recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the related mortgage loans sold.




	TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS:


	 Transfers of financial assets, including mortgage loans and participation loans, are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is determined to be surrendered when 1) the assets have been legally isolated from us, 2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of the right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and 3) we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity. Other than servicing, we have no substantive continuing involvement related to these loans.




	SERVICING:


	 Servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or through sale of financial assets. We have


	no


	 purchased servicing rights. For sales of mortgage loans, a portion of the cost of originating the








	 46









	Table of Contents









	loan is allocated to the servicing right based on relative fair value. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as the cost to service, the discount rate, the custodial earnings rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds and default rates and losses.




	Servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into tranches based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type, and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual tranche, to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount for the tranche. If we later determine that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular tranche, a reduction of the valuation allowance may be recorded as an increase to income. Capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into


	noninterest


	 income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets. The unpaid principal balance of mortgages serviced for others was


	$272,882


	 and


	$287,029


	 with capitalized servicing rights of


	$2,306


	 and


	$2,505


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.




	Servicing fee income is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans for others. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal; or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. We recorded servicing fee revenue of


	$696


	,


	$712


	, and


	$720


	 related to residential mortgage loans serviced for others during


	2016


	,


	2015


	, and


	2014


	, respectively, which is included in other


	noninterest


	 income.




	FORECLOSED ASSETS:


	 Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at the lower of our carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of transfer, establishing a new cost basis. Any


	write-downs


	 based on the asset’s fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the


	ALLL


	. After foreclosure, property held for sale is carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on property to be held and used are measured at the amount by which the carrying amount of property exceeds its fair value. Costs relating to holding these assets are expensed as incurred. We periodically perform valuations and any subsequent


	write-downs


	 are recorded as a charge to operations, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of a property to the lower of our carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Foreclosed assets of


	$231


	 and


	$421


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively, are included in other assets.




	PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT:


	 Land is carried at cost. Buildings and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation which is computed principally by the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from


	3


	 to


	40


	 years. Major improvements are capitalized and appropriately amortized based upon the useful lives of the related assets or the expected terms of the leases, if shorter, using the straight-line method. Maintenance, repairs and minor alterations are charged to current operations as expenditures occur. We annually review these assets to determine whether carrying values have been impaired.




	EQUITY SECURITIES WITHOUT READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES:


	 Included in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are our holdings in


	FHLB


	 stock and


	FRB


	 stock as well as our ownership interests in


	Corporate Settlement Solutions, LLC


	 and


	Valley Financial Corporation


	. Our investment in


	Corporate Settlement Solutions, LLC


	, a title insurance company, was made in the 1st quarter of 2008. We are not the managing entity of


	Corporate Settlement Solutions, LLC


	, and account for our investment in that entity under the equity method of accounting.


	Valley Financial Corporation


	 is the parent company of 1st State Bank in Saginaw, Michigan, which is a bank that opened in 2005. We made investments in


	Valley Financial Corporation


	 in


	2004


	 and in


	2007


	. In 2016, we sold all shares of


	Valley Financial Corporation


	 common stock.

	EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN:


	 At


	December 31, 2016


	, the


	Directors Plan


	 had


	213,470


	 shares eligible to be issued to participants, for which the


	Rabbi Trust


	 held


	26,042


	 shares. We had


	200,017


	 shares to be issued in


	2015


	, with


	19,401


	 shares held in the


	Rabbi Trust


	. Compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions are recognized as the services are

	rendered, with the cost measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued (see “


	Note 17 –


	Benefit Plans


	”). We have no other equity-based compensation plans.




	CORPORATE OWNED LIFE INSURANCE:


	 We have purchased life insurance policies on key members of management. In the event of death of one of these individuals, we would receive a specified cash payment equal to the face value of the policy. Such policies are recorded at their cash surrender value, or the amount that can be realized on the balance sheet dates. Increases in cash surrender value in excess of single premiums paid are reported as other


	noninterest


	 income.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, the present value of the post retirement benefits payable by us to the covered employees was estimated to be


	$2,174


	 and


	$2,853


	, respectively, and is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities. The periodic policy maintenance costs were


	$(8)


	,


	$71


	, and


	$83


	 for


	2016


	,


	2015


	, and


	2014


	, respectively and are included in other


	noninterest


	 expenses.




	ACQUISITION INTANGIBLES AND GOODWILL:


	 We previously acquired branch facilities and related deposits in business combinations accounted for as a purchase. The acquisitions included amounts related to the valuation of customer deposit relationships (core deposit intangibles). Core deposit intangibles arising from acquisitions are included in goodwill and other intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated lives and evaluated for potential impairment on at least an annual basis. Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over identifiable assets, is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. Acquisition intangibles and goodwill are typically qualitatively evaluated to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying balance is impaired. If it is determined that the carrying balance is more likely than not to be impaired, we perform a cash flow valuation to determine the extent of the potential impairment. This valuation method requires a significant degree of our judgment. In the event the projected undiscounted net operating cash flows for these intangible assets are less than the carrying value, the asset is recorded at fair value as determined by the valuation model.




	OFF BALANCE SHEET CREDIT RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:


	 In the ordinary course of business, we have entered into commitments to extend credit, including commitments under credit card arrangements, home equity lines of credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded only when funded.




	FEDERAL INCOME TAXES:


	 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax assets or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax basis on the various balance sheet assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. Valuation allowances are established, where necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the year plus or minus the change during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities.




	We analyze our filing positions in the jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. We have also elected to retain our existing accounting policy with respect to the treatment of interest and penalties attributable to income taxes, and continue to reflect any charges for such, to the extent they arise, as a component of our


	noninterest


	 expenses.




	DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN:


	 We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, which was curtailed effective March 1, 2007. Defined benefit pension plan expenses are included in “compensation and benefits" on the consolidated statements of income and are funded consistent with the requirements of federal laws and regulations. The current benefit obligation is included in "accrued interest payable and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets. Inherent in the determination of defined benefit pension costs are assumptions concerning future events that will affect the amount and timing of required benefit payments under the plan. These assumptions include demographic assumptions such as mortality, a discount rate used to determine the current benefit obligation and a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. Net periodic benefit cost includes interest cost based on the assumed discount rate, an expected return on plan assets based on an actuarially derived market-related value of assets, and amortization of unrecognized net actuarial gains or losses. Actuarial gains and losses result from experience different from that assumed and from changes in assumptions (excluding asset gains and losses not yet reflected in market-related value). Amortization of actuarial gains and losses is included as a component of net periodic defined benefit pension cost.

	Computation of Earnings Per Common Share




	Basic earnings per common share represents income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflects additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued. Potential common shares that may be issued relate solely to outstanding shares in the

	Accounting Standards Updates




	Pending Accounting Standards Updates




	ASU No. 2016-01:


	“


	Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities”




	In January 2016, ASU No. 2016-01 set forth the following: 1) requires equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; 2) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment and when an impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value; 3) for public entities, eliminates the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; 4) for public entities, requires the use of exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; 5) requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income, the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; 6) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and 7) clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets. The new authoritative guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our operations or financial statement disclosures.




	ASU No. 2016-02: “Leases (Topic 842)”




	In February 2016, ASU No. 2016-02 was issued to create


	Topic 842 - Leases


	 which will require recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases previously classified as operating leases. Accounting guidance is set forth for both lessee and lessor accounting. Under lessee accounting, a lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.




	For finance leases, a lessee is required to do the following: 1) recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position; 2) recognize interest on the lease liability separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset in the statement of comprehensive income; and 3) classify repayments of the principal portion of the lease liability within financing activities and payments of interest on the lease liability and variable lease payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. For operating leases, a lessee is required to do the following: 1) recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in the statement of financial position; 2) recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is








	 49









	Table of Contents









	allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis; and 3) classify all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows.




	The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous GAAP. The new authoritative guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our operations or financial statement disclosures.




	ASU No. 2016-05: “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships”




	In March 2016, ASU No. 2016-05 was issued to clarify designation of a hedging instrument when there is a change in counterparty. A change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The new authoritative guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our operations or financial statement disclosures.




	ASU No. 2016-07: “Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition of the Equity Method of Accounting”




	In March 2016, ASU No. 2016-07 was issued and eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. Additionally, the update requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor’s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The new authoritative guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our operations or financial statement disclosures.




	ASU No. 2016-09: “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”




	In March 2016, ASU No. 2016-09 updated several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new authoritative guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our operations or financial statement disclosures.




	ASU No. 2016-13: “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”




	In June 2016, ASU No. 2016-13 updated the measurement for credit losses for AFS debt securities and assets measured at amortized cost which include loans, trade receivables, and any other financial assets with the contractual right to receive cash. Current GAAP requires an “incurred loss” methodology for recognizing credit losses that delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Under the incurred loss approach, entities are limited to a probable initial recognition threshold when credit losses are measured under GAAP; an entity generally only considers past events and current conditions in measuring the incurred loss.




	In the new guidance, the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP is replaced with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses. This methodology requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to calculate credit loss estimates. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances which applies to assets measured either collectively or individually.




	The update allows an entity to revert to historical loss information that is reflective of the contractual term (considering the effect of prepayments) for periods that are beyond the time frame for which the entity is able to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts. In addition, the disclosures of credit quality indicators in relation to the amortized cost of financing receivables, a current disclosure requirement, are further disaggregated by year of origination (or vintage). The vintage information will be useful for financial statement users to better assess changes in underwriting standards and credit quality trends in asset portfolios over time and the effect of those changes on credit losses.













	 50









	Table of Contents









	Overall, the update will allow entities the ability to measure expected credit losses without the restriction of incurred or probable losses that exist under current GAAP. For users of the financial statements, the update provides decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The new authoritative guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and is expected to have a significant impact on our operations and financial statement disclosures as well as that of the banking industry as a whole.




	ASU No. 2016-15: “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”




	In August 2016, ASU No. 2016-15 was issued to provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues: 1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; 2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; 3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; 4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; 5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies; 6) including bank-owned life insurance policies; 7) distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and 8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The new authoritative guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our operations or financial statement disclosures.




	ASU No. 2016-16: “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory”




	In October 2016, ASU No. 2016-16 was issued to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The new guidance eliminates the requirement of the sale of the asset to recognize current and deferred income taxes. Instead, current and deferred income taxes will be recognized on an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The new authoritative guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is not expected to have a significant impact on our operations or financial statement disclosures.




	ASU No. 2016-17: “Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control”




	In October 2016, ASU No. 2016-17 was issued to amend the previous consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity (VIE) should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. In the amendment, a single decision maker is not required to consider indirect interests held through related parties that are under common control with the single decision maker to be the equivalent of direct interests in their entirety. Instead, a single decision maker is required to include those interests on a proportionate basis consistent with indirect interests held through other related parties. The new authoritative guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is not expected to have an impact on our operations or financial statement disclosures.




	ASU No. 2016-18: “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash”




	In November 2016, ASU No. 2016-18 was issued to provide guidance on the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows under Topic 230. The new guidance requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Additionally, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new authoritative guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is not expected to have an impact on our operations or financial statement disclosures.

	Expected maturities for government sponsored enterprises and states and political subdivisions may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.




	As the auction rate money market preferred and preferred stocks have continual call dates, they are not reported by a specific maturity group. Because of their variable monthly payments, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are not reported by a specific maturity group.

	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, we conducted an analysis to determine whether any securities currently in an unrealized loss position, should be


	other-than-temporarily


	 impaired. Such analyses considered, among other factors, the following criteria:













	•






	Has the value of the investment declined more than what is deemed to be reasonable based on a risk and maturity adjusted discount rate?
















	•






	Is the investment credit rating below investment grade?
















	•






	Is it probable the issuer will be unable to pay the amount when due?
















	•






	Is it more likely than not that we will have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis?
















	•






	Has the duration of the investment been extended?







	During the fourth quarter of 2016, we identified one municipal bond as


	other-than-temporarily


	 impaired. While management estimated the OTTI to be realized, we also engaged the services of an independent investment valuation firm to estimate the








	 53









	Table of Contents









	amount of impairment as of


	December 31, 2016


	. The valuation calculated the estimated market value utilizing two different approaches:




	1) Market - Appraisal and Comparable Investments




	2) Income - Discounted Cash Flow Method




	The two methods were then weighted, with a higher weighting applied to the Market approach, to determine the estimated impairment. As a result of this analysis, we recognized an OTTI of $770 in earnings for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	. The following table provides a


	roll-forward

	Based on our analyses, the fact that we have asserted that we do not have the intent to sell


	AFS securities


	 in an unrealized loss position, and considering it is unlikely that we will have to sell any


	AFS securities


	 in an unrealized loss position before recovery of their cost basis, we do not believe that the values of any other


	AFS securities


	 are


	other-than-temporarily


	 impaired as of


	December 31, 2016


	, or


	December 31, 2015


	, with the exception of the one municipal bond discussed above.








	Note 5 –


	Loans and ALLL




	We grant commercial, agricultural, residential real estate, and consumer loans to customers situated primarily in


	Clare, Gratiot, Isabella, Mecosta, Midland, Montcalm, and Saginaw counties


	 in Michigan. The ability of the borrowers to honor their repayment obligations is often dependent upon the real estate, agricultural, manufacturing, retail, gaming, tourism, higher education, and general economic conditions of this region. Substantially all of our consumer and residential real estate loans are secured by various items of property, while commercial loans are secured primarily by real estate, business assets, and personal guarantees; a portion of loans are unsecured.




	Loans that we have the intent and ability to hold in our portfolio are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any


	charge-offs


	, the


	ALLL


	, and any deferred fees or costs. Interest income is accrued over the term of the loan based on the principal amount outstanding. Loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are capitalized and recognized as a component of interest income over the term of the loan using the level yield method.




	The accrual of interest on commercial, agricultural, and residential real estate loans is discontinued at the time the loan is


	90 days


	 or more past due unless the credit is


	well-secured


	 and in the process of collection. Upon transferring the loans to


	nonaccrual


	 status, we perform an evaluation to determine the net realizable value of the underlying collateral. This evaluation is used to help determine if any


	charge-offs


	 are necessary. Consumer loans are typically


	charged-off


	 no later than


	180 days


	 past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on


	nonaccrual


	 status or


	charged-off


	 at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.




	For loans that are placed on


	nonaccrual


	 status or


	charged-off


	, all interest accrued in the current calendar year, but not collected, is reversed against interest income while interest accrued in prior calendar years, but not collected, is charged against the


	ALLL


	. Loans may be returned to accrual status after


	six months


	 of continuous performance.




	Commercial and agricultural loans include loans for commercial real estate, commercial operating loans, advances to mortgage brokers, farmland and agricultural production, and states and political subdivisions. Repayment of these loans is dependent upon the successful operation and management of a business. We minimize our risk by limiting the amount of direct credit exposure to any one borrower to


	$15,000


	. Borrowers with direct credit needs of more than


	$15,000


	 are serviced through the use of loan participations with other commercial banks. Commercial and agricultural real estate loans commonly require


	loan-to-value


	 limits of


	80%


	 or less. Depending upon the type of loan, past credit history, and current operating results, we may require the borrower to pledge accounts receivable, inventory, and property and equipment. Personal guarantees are generally required from the owners of closely held corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships. In addition, we require annual financial statements, prepare cash flow analyses, and review credit reports.




	We entered into a mortgage purchase program in 2016 with a financial institution where we participate in advances to mortgage brokers ("advances"). The mortgage brokers originate residential mortgage loans with the intent to sell on the secondary market. We participate in the advance to the mortgage broker, which is secured by the underlying mortgage loan, until it is ultimately sold on the secondary market. As such, the average life of each participated advance is approximately 20-30 days.








	 54









	Table of Contents









	Funds from the sale of the loan are used to payoff our participation in the advance to the mortgage broker. We classify these advances as commercial loans and include the outstanding balance in commercial loans on our balance sheet. Under the participation agreement, we committed to a maximum outstanding aggregate amount of $30,000. The difference between our outstanding balances and the maximum outstanding aggregate amount are classified as “


	Unfunded commitments under lines of credit


	” in the “


	Contractual Obligations and Loan Commitments


	” section of the


	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


	 of this report.




	We offer adjustable rate mortgages, construction loans, and fixed rate residential real estate loans which have amortization periods up to a maximum of


	30


	 years. We consider the anticipated direction of interest rates, balance sheet duration, the sensitivity of our balance sheet to changes in interest rates, and overall loan demand to determine whether or not to sell fixed rate loans to


	Freddie Mac


	.




	Our lending policies generally limit the maximum


	loan-to-value


	 ratio on residential real estate loans to


	97%


	 of the lower of the appraised value of the property or the purchase price, with the condition that private mortgage insurance is required on loans with


	loan-to-value


	 ratios in excess of


	80%


	.




	 Underwriting criteria for residential real estate loans include:













	•






	Evaluation of the borrower’s ability to make monthly payments.
















	•






	Evaluation of the value of the property securing the loan.
















	•






	Ensuring the payment of principal, interest, taxes, and hazard insurance does not exceed


	28%


	 of a borrower’s gross income.
















	•






	Ensuring all debt servicing does not exceed


	36%


	 of income.
















	•






	Verification of acceptable credit reports.
















	•






	Verification of employment, income, and financial information.







	Appraisals are performed by independent appraisers and reviewed for appropriateness. All mortgage loan requests are reviewed by our mortgage loan committee or through a secondary market underwriting system; loans in excess of


	$500


	 require the approval of our Internal Loan Committee, the Executive Loan Committee, the Board of Directors’ Loan Committee, or the Board of Directors.




	Consumer loans include secured and unsecured personal loans. Loans are amortized for a period of up to


	12


	 years based on the age and value of the underlying collateral. The underwriting emphasis is on a borrower’s perceived intent and ability to pay rather than collateral value.


	No


	 consumer loans are sold to the secondary market.




	The


	ALLL


	 is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the


	ALLL


	 when we believe the


	uncollectability


	 of the loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the


	ALLL


	.




	The appropriateness of the


	ALLL


	 is evaluated on a quarterly basis and is based upon a periodic review of the


	collectability


	 of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.




	The primary factors behind the determination of the level of the


	ALLL


	 are specific allocations for impaired loans, historical loss percentages, as well as unallocated components. Specific allocations for impaired loans are primarily determined based on the difference between the loan’s outstanding balance to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, less cost to sell. Historical loss allocations are calculated at the loan class and segment levels based on a migration analysis of the loan portfolio, with the exception of advances to mortgage brokers, over the preceding


	five


	 years. With no historical losses on advances to mortgage brokers, there is no allocation in the commercial segment displayed below based on historical loss factors. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio.

	Internally assigned credit risk ratings are reviewed, at a minimum, when loans are renewed or when management has knowledge of improvements or deterioration of the credit quality of individual credits. Descriptions of the internally assigned credit risk ratings for commercial and agricultural loans are as follows:




	1. EXCELLENT – Substantially Risk Free




	Credit has strong financial condition and solid earnings history, characterized by:













	•






	High liquidity, strong cash flow, low leverage.
















	•






	Unquestioned ability to meet all obligations when due.
















	•






	Experienced management, with management succession in place.
















	•






	Secured by cash.







	2. HIGH QUALITY – Limited Risk




	Credit with sound financial condition and a positive trend in earnings supplemented by:













	•






	Favorable liquidity and leverage ratios.
















	•






	Ability to meet all obligations when due.
















	•






	Management with successful track record.
















	•






	Steady and satisfactory earnings history.











	 57









	Table of Contents


















	•






	If loan is secured, collateral is of high quality and readily marketable.
















	•






	Access to alternative financing.
















	•






	Well defined primary and secondary source of repayment.
















	•






	If supported by guaranty, the financial strength and liquidity of the guarantor(s) are clearly evident.







	3.




	HIGH SATISFACTORY – Reasonable Risk




	Credit with satisfactory financial condition and further characterized by:













	•






	Working capital adequate to support operations.
















	•






	Cash flow sufficient to pay debts as scheduled.
















	•






	Management experience and depth appear favorable.
















	•






	Loan performing according to terms.
















	•






	If loan is secured, collateral is acceptable and loan is fully protected.







	4. LOW SATISFACTORY – Acceptable Risk




	Credit with bankable risks, although some signs of weaknesses are shown:













	•






	Would include most start-up businesses.
















	•






	Occasional instances of trade slowness or repayment delinquency – may have been


	10


	-


	30


	 days slow within the past year.
















	•






	Management’s abilities are apparent, yet unproven.
















	•






	Weakness in primary source of repayment with adequate secondary source of repayment.
















	•






	Loan structure generally in accordance with policy.
















	•






	If secured, loan collateral coverage is marginal.
















	•






	Adequate cash flow to service debt, but coverage is low.







	To be classified as less than satisfactory, only one of the following criteria must be met.




	5. SPECIAL MENTION – Criticized




	Credit constitutes an undue and unwarranted credit risk but not to the point of justifying a classification of substandard. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitute an unwarranted risk in light of the circumstances surrounding a specific loan:













	•






	Downward trend in sales, profit levels, and margins.
















	•






	Impaired working capital position.
















	•






	Cash flow is strained in order to meet debt repayment.
















	•






	Loan delinquency (


	30


	-


	60


	 days) and overdrafts may occur.
















	•






	Shrinking equity cushion.
















	•






	Diminishing primary source of repayment and questionable secondary source.
















	•






	Management abilities are questionable.
















	•






	Weak industry conditions.
















	•






	Litigation pending against the borrower.
















	•






	Collateral or guaranty offers limited protection.
















	•






	Negative debt service coverage, however the credit is well collateralized and payments are current.







	6. SUBSTANDARD – Classified




	Credit where the borrower’s current net worth, paying capacity, and value of the collateral pledged is inadequate. There is a distinct possibility that we will implement collection procedures if the loan deficiencies are not corrected. In addition, the following characteristics may apply:













	•






	Sustained losses have severely eroded the equity and cash flow.
















	•






	Deteriorating liquidity.











	 58









	Table of Contents


















	•






	Serious management problems or internal fraud.
















	•






	Original repayment terms liberalized.
















	•






	Likelihood of bankruptcy.
















	•






	Inability to access other funding sources.
















	•






	Reliance on secondary source of repayment.
















	•






	Litigation filed against borrower.
















	•






	Collateral provides little or no value.
















	•






	Requires excessive attention of the loan officer.
















	•






	Borrower is uncooperative with loan officer.







	7.




	VULNERABLE – Classified




	Credit is considered “Substandard” and warrants placing on


	nonaccrual


	 status. Risk of loss is being evaluated and exit strategy options are under review. Other characteristics that may apply:













	•






	Insufficient cash flow to service debt.
















	•






	Minimal or no payments being received.
















	•






	Limited options available to avoid the collection process.
















	•






	Transition status, expect action will take place to collect loan without immediate progress being made.







	8. DOUBTFUL – Workout




	Credit has all the weaknesses inherent in a “Substandard” loan with the added characteristic that collection and/or liquidation is pending. The possibility of a loss is extremely high, but its classification as a loss is deferred until liquidation procedures are completed, or reasonably estimable. Other characteristics that may apply:













	•






	Normal operations are severely diminished or have ceased.
















	•






	Seriously impaired cash flow.
















	•






	Original repayment terms materially altered.
















	•






	Secondary source of repayment is inadequate.
















	•






	Survivability as a “going concern” is impossible.
















	•






	Collection process has begun.
















	•






	Bankruptcy petition has been filed.
















	•






	Judgments have been filed.
















	•






	Portion of the loan balance has been


	charged-off


	.

	Impaired Loans




	Loans may be classified as impaired if they meet one or more of the following criteria:













	1.






	There has been a


	charge-off


	 of its principal balance (in whole or in part);
















	2.






	The loan has been classified as a


	TDR


	; or
















	3.






	The loan is in


	nonaccrual


	 status.







	Impairment is measured on a


	loan-by-loan


	 basis for commercial and agricultural loans by comparing the loan’s outstanding balance to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, less cost to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Impairment is measured on a


	loan-by-loan


	 basis for residential real estate and consumer loans by comparing the loan’s unpaid principal balance to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate.

	2015


	, respectively.




	Troubled Debt Restructurings




	Loan modifications are considered to be


	TDRs


	 when the modification includes terms outside of normal lending practices to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulties.




	Typical concessions granted include, but are not limited to:













	•






	Agreeing to interest rates below prevailing market rates for debt with similar risk characteristics.
















	•






	Extending the amortization period beyond typical lending guidelines for loans with similar risk characteristics.
















	•






	Forgiving principal.
















	•






	Forgiving accrued interest.







	To determine if a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, factors we consider include:













	•






	The borrower is currently in default on any of their debt.


















	•






	The borrower would likely default on any of their debt if the concession was not granted.
















	•






	The borrower’s cash flow was insufficient to service all of their debt if the concession was not granted.

















	•






	The borrower has declared, or is in the process of declaring, bankruptcy.
















	•






	The borrower is unlikely to continue as a going concern (if the entity is a business).

	We did not restructure any loans by forgiving principal or accrued interest during

	 or

	TDRs


	, including

	no


	 investment securities that are restricted to be pledged for specific purposes.




	Derivative Instruments






	During the second quarter of 2016, we began to enter into interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate risk and variability in cash flows. The interest rate swaps, associated with our variable rate borrowings, are designated upon inception as cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments. We enter into LIBOR-based interest rate swaps that involve the receipt of variable amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments, in effect converting variable rate debt to fixed rate debt.




	Cash flow hedges are assessed for effectiveness using regression analysis. The effective portion of changes in fair value are recorded in OCI and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period in which the related interest on the variable rate borrowings affects earnings. In the event that a portion of the changes in fair value were determined to be ineffective, the ineffective amount would be recorded in earnings.




	The following table provides information on derivatives related to variable rate borrowings as of


	December 31, 2016

	Derivatives contain an element of credit risk which arises from the possibility that we will incur a loss as a result of a counterparty failing to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk is minimized through counterparty collateral, transaction limits and monitoring procedures. We also manage dealer credit risk by entering into interest rate derivatives only with primary and highly rated counterparties, the use of


	ISDA


	 master agreements and counterparties limits. We do not anticipate any losses from failure of interest rate derivative counterparties to honor their obligations.

	Off-Balance-Sheet Activities




	Credit-Related Financial Instruments




	We are party to credit related financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk. These financial instruments are entered into in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments, which include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and


	IRR


	 in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in a particular class of financial instrument.




	The following table summarizes our credit related financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk as of:































	 






	December 31








	 






	2016

	915















	Commitments to grant loans






	29,339













	 






	53,946

















	Unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Advances to mortgage brokers are also included in unfunded commitments under lines of credit. The balance is the difference between our outstanding balances and maximum outstanding aggregate amount.




	Commitments to grant loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The amount of collateral obtained, if we deem necessary, is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Commitments to grant loans include residential mortgage loans with the majority being loans committed to be sold to the secondary market.




	Commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. These commitments to extend credit and letters of credit generally mature within


	one year


	. The credit risk involved in these transactions is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. We evaluate each customer’s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if we deem necessary upon the extension of credit, is based on our credit evaluation of the borrower. While we consider standby letters of credit to be guarantees, the amount of the liability related to such guarantees on the commitment date is not significant and a liability related to such guarantees is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets.




	Our exposure to credit-related loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit could be up to the contractual notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in deciding to make these commitments as we do for extending loans to customers. No significant losses are anticipated as a result of these commitments.

	On-Balance Sheet Activities




	Derivative Loan Commitments




	Mortgage loan commitments are referred to as derivative loan commitments if the loan that will result from exercise of the commitment will be held for sale upon funding. We enter into commitments to fund residential mortgage loans at specific times in the future, with the intention that these loans will subsequently be sold in the secondary market. A mortgage loan commitment binds us to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specified interest rate within a specified period of time, generally up to


	60 days


	 after inception of the rate lock.








	 70









	Table of Contents









	Outstanding derivative loan commitments expose us to the risk that the price of the loans arising from the exercise of the loan commitment might decline from the inception of the rate lock to funding of the loan due to increases in mortgage interest rates. If interest rates increase, the value of these loan commitments decreases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, the value of these loan commitments increase. The notional amount of undesignated interest rate lock commitments was $


	750


	 and $


	234


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.




	Forward Loan Sale Commitments




	To protect against the price risk inherent in derivative loan commitments, we utilize both “mandatory delivery” and “best efforts” forward loan sale commitments to mitigate the risk of potential decreases in the values of loan that would result from the exercise of the derivative loan commitments.




	With a “mandatory delivery” contract, we commit to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price on or before a specified date. If we fail to deliver the amount of mortgages necessary to fulfill the commitment by the specified date, we are obligated to pay a “pair-off” fee, based on then current market prices, to the investor to compensate the investor for the shortfall.




	With a “best efforts” contract, we commit to deliver an individual mortgage loan of a specified principal amount and quality to an investor if the loan to the underlying borrower closes. Generally, the price the investor will pay the seller for an individual loan is specified prior to the loan being funded (e.g. on the same day the lender commits to lend funds to a potential borrower).




	We expect that these forward loan sale commitments will experience changes in fair value opposite to the change in fair value of derivative loan commitments. The notional amount of undesignated forward loan sale commitments was $


	1,877


	 and $


	1,421


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.




	The fair values of the rate lock loan commitments related to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale and the forward loan sale commitments are deemed insignificant by management and, accordingly, are not recorded in our


	consolidated financial statements


	.

	Commitments and Other Matters




	Banking regulations require us to maintain cash reserve balances in currency or as deposits with the


	FRB


	. At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, the reserve balances amounted to $


	1,273


	 and $


	1,169


	, respectively.




	Banking regulations limit the transfer of assets in the form of dividends, loans, or advances from the Bank to the Corporation. At


	December 31, 2016


	, substantially all of the Bank’s assets were restricted from transfer to the Corporation in the form of loans or advances. Consequently, Bank dividends are the principal source of funds for the Corporation. Payment of dividends without regulatory approval is limited to the current year’s retained net income plus retained net income for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to common stock. At


	January 1, 2017


	, the amount available to the Corporation for dividends from the Bank, without regulatory approval, was approximately $


	25,600


	.








	Note 16 –


	Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements




	The Corporation (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the


	FRB


	 and the


	FDIC


	. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the


	FRB


	 and the


	FDIC


	 that if undertaken, could have a material effect on our financial statements. Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific capital guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, capital, and certain off-balance-sheet items, as calculated under regulatory accounting standards. Our capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the


	FRB


	 and the


	FDIC


	 about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies.




	Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of total, tier 1 capital, and common equity tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined). We believe, as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, that we met all capital adequacy requirements.




	The FRB has established minimum risk based capital guidelines. Pursuant to these guidelines, a framework has been established that assigns risk weights to each category of on and off-balance-sheet items to arrive at risk adjusted total assets. Regulatory capital is divided by the risk adjusted assets with the resulting ratio compared to the minimum standard to determine whether a corporation has adequate capital. On July 2, 2013, the FRB published revised BASEL III Capital standards for banks. The final rules redefine what is included or deducted from equity capital, changes risk weighting for certain on and








	 71









	Table of Contents









	off-balance sheet assets, increases the minimum required equity capital to be considered well capitalized, and introduces a capital cushion buffer. The rules, which are being gradually phased in between 2015 and 2019, are not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation but will require us to hold more capital than we have historically.




	Effective January 1, 2015, the minimum standard for primary, or tier 1, capital increased from 4.00% to


	6.00%


	. The minimum standard for total capital remained at


	8.00%


	. Also effective January 1, 2015 was the new common equity tier 1 capital ratio which had a minimum requirement of


	4.50%


	. The capital conservative buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016 which required a 0.625% addition to the tier 1, minimum, and common equity tier 1 capital ratio. The capital conservative buffer will continue to increase capital ratios each year through 2019.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, the most recent notifications from the


	FRB


	 and the


	FDIC


	 categorized us as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, an institution must maintain total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, Common Equity Tier 1, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following tables. There are no conditions or events since the notifications that we believe have changed our categories. Our actual capital amounts and ratios are also presented in the table.

	Benefit Plans




	401(k) Plan




	We have a 401(k) plan in which substantially all employees are eligible to participate. Employees may contribute up to


	100%


	 of their compensation subject to certain limits based on federal tax laws. The plan was amended in 2013 to provide a matching safe harbor contribution for all eligible employees equal to


	100%


	 of the first


	5.0%


	 of an employee's compensation contributed to the Plan during the year. Employees are


	100%


	 vested in the safe harbor matching contributions.




	For 2012, we made a


	3.0%


	 safe harbor contribution for all eligible employees and matching contributions equal to


	50%


	 of the first


	4.0%


	 of an employee’s compensation contributed to the Plan during the year. Employees were

	Defined Benefit Pension Plan




	We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, which was curtailed effective


	March 1, 2007


	. As a result of the curtailment, future salary increases are no longer considered (the projected benefit obligation is equal to the accumulated benefit obligation), and plan benefits are based on years of service and the individual employee’s


	five


	 highest consecutive years of compensation out of the last


	ten


	 years of service through


	March 1, 2007

	During 2016, 2015 and 2014, additional settlement loss of


	$0


	,


	$250


	 and


	$260


	 were recognized in connection with lump-sum benefits distributions. Many plan participants elect to receive their retirement benefit payments in the form of lump-sum settlements. Pro rata settlement losses, which can occasionally occur as a result of these lump sum distributions, are recognized only in years when the total of such distributions exceed the sum of the service and interest expense components of net periodic benefit cost.

	As a result of the curtailment of the Plan, there is


	no


	 rate of compensation increase considered in the above assumptions.




	The expected long term rate of return is an estimate of anticipated future long term rates of return on plan assets as measured on a market value basis. Factors considered in arriving at this assumption include:













	•






	Historical long term rates of return for broad asset classes.
















	•






	Actual past rates of return achieved by the plan.
















	•






	The general mix of assets held by the plan.
















	•






	The stated investment policy for the plan.







	The selected rate of return is net of anticipated investment related expenses.




	Plan Assets




	Our overall investment strategy is to moderately grow the portfolio by investing


	50%


	 of the portfolio in equity securities and


	50%


	 in fixed income securities. This strategy is designed to generate a long term rate of return of


	6.00%


	.  Equity securities primarily consist of the S&P 500 Index with a smaller allocation to the Small Cap and International Index.  Fixed income securities are invested in the Bond Market Index.  The Plan has appropriate assets invested in short term investments to meet near-term benefit payments.




	The asset mix and the sector weighting of the investments are determined by our pension committee, which is comprised of members of our management. To manage the Plan, we retain a third party investment advisor to conduct consultations. We review the performance of the advisor at least annually.

	•






	Short-term

	•






	Common collective trusts: These investments are public investment securities valued using the


	NAV


	 provided by a third party investment advisor. The


	NAV


	 is quoted on a private market that is not active; however, the unit price is based on underlying investments which are traded on an active market.

	Equity Compensation Plan




	Pursuant to the terms of the


	Directors Plan


	, our directors are required to invest at least


	25%


	 of their board fees in our common stock. These stock investments can be made either through deferred fees or through the purchase of shares through the


	Dividend Reinvestment Plan


	. Deferred fees, under the


	Directors Plan


	, are converted on a quarterly basis into shares of our common stock based on the fair value of a share of common stock as of the relevant valuation date. Stock credited to a participant’s account is eligible for stock and cash dividends as declared.


	Dividend Reinvestment Plan


	 shares are purchased on a monthly basis pursuant to the


	Dividend Reinvestment Plan


	.




	Distribution of deferred fees from the


	Directors Plan


	 occurs when the participant retires from the Board or upon the occurrence of certain other events. The participant is eligible to receive a lump-sum, in-kind, distribution of all of the stock that is then in his or her account, and any unconverted cash will be converted to and rounded up to whole shares of stock and distributed, as well. The


	Directors Plan


	 does not allow for cash settlement, and therefore, such


	share-based


	 payment awards qualify for classification as equity. We may use authorized but unissued shares or purchase shares of common stock on the open market to meet our obligations under the


	Directors Plan


	.




	We maintain the


	Rabbi Trust


	 to fund the


	Directors Plan


	. The


	Rabbi Trust


	 is an irrevocable grantor trust to which we may contribute assets for the limited purpose of funding a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Although we may not reach the








	 76









	Table of Contents









	assets of the


	Rabbi Trust


	 for any purpose other than meeting our obligations under the


	Directors Plan


	, the assets of the


	Rabbi Trust


	 remain subject to the claims of our creditors and are included in the


	consolidated financial statements


	. We may contribute cash or common stock to the


	Rabbi Trust


	 from


	time-to-time


	 for the sole purpose of funding the


	Directors Plan


	. The


	Rabbi Trust


	 will use any cash that we contributed to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market through our brokerage services department. Shares held in the


	Rabbi Trust


	 are included in the calculation of earnings per share.

	Other Employee Benefit Plans




	We maintain


	two


	 nonqualified supplementary employee retirement plans to provide supplemental retirement benefits to specified participants. Expenses related to these programs for


	2016


	,


	2015

	2014


	 were $

	, $


	379


	, and $


	372


	, respectively, and are being recognized over the participants’ expected years of service.




	We maintain a non-leveraged


	ESOP


	 which was frozen to new participants on December 31, 2006. Contributions to the plan are discretionary and are approved by the Board of Directors and recorded as compensation expense. We made


	no


	 contributions to the


	ESOP


	 in


	2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	. Compensation cost related to the plan for


	2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	 was


	$33


	, $


	32


	, and $


	23


	, respectively. Total allocated shares outstanding related to the


	ESOP


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	, and


	2014


	 were


	204,669


	,


	217,064


	, and


	241,958


	, respectively. Such shares are included in the computation of dividends and earnings per share in each of the respective years. On December 21, 2016, the Board approved the termination of the ESOP effective December 31, 2016. Actual dissolution of the ESOP is anticipated to occur in mid-2017.




	We maintain a self-funded medical plan under which we are responsible for the first $


	75


	 per year of claims made by a covered family. Expenses are accrued based on estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and our experience. Expenses were $


	2,150


	 in


	2016


	, $


	1,695

	Fair Value






	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies, key inputs, and an indication of the level of the fair value hierarchy in which the assets or liabilities are classified.




	Cash and cash equivalents


	:


	 The carrying amounts of cash and demand deposits due from banks and interest bearing balances due from banks approximate fair values. As such, we classify cash and cash equivalents as Level 1.




	AFS


	 securities:




	AFS


	 securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Level 1 fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments. Level 2 fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security’s credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss and liquidity assumptions. The values for Level 1 and Level 2 investment securities are generally obtained from an independent third party. On a quarterly basis, we compare the values provided to alternative pricing sources.




	Mortgage loans AFS


	:




	Mortgage loans AFS


	 are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The fair value of mortgage loans AFS are based on the price secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. As such, we classify mortgage loans AFS subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as Level 2.




	Loans


	:


	 For variable rate loans with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. Fair values for fixed rate loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The resulting amounts are adjusted to estimate the effect of changes in the credit quality of borrowers since the loans were originated. As such, we classify loans as Level 3 assets.




	We do not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from


	time-to-time


	, loans are classified as impaired and a specific allowance for loan losses may be established. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will be significantly different than the contractual terms of the original loan agreement are considered impaired. Once a loan is








	 80









	Table of Contents









	identified as impaired, we measure the estimated impairment. The fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, less cost to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent. Those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans.




	We review the net realizable values of the underlying collateral for collateral dependent impaired loans on at least a quarterly basis for all loan types.  To determine the collateral value, we utilize independent appraisals, broker price opinions, or internal evaluations.  We review these valuations to determine whether an additional discount should be applied given the age of market information that may have been considered as well as other factors such as costs to sell an asset if it is determined that the collateral will be liquidated in connection with the ultimate settlement of the loan. We use these valuations to determine if any specific reserves or


	charge-offs


	 are necessary. We may obtain new valuations in certain circumstances, including when there has been significant deterioration in the condition of the collateral, if the foreclosure process has begun, or if the existing valuation is deemed to be outdated.




	The following tables list the quantitative fair value information about impaired loans as of

	Discount factors with ranges are based on the age of the independent appraisal, broker price opinion, or internal evaluation.




	Accrued interest receivable


	:


	 The carrying amounts of accrued interest receivable approximate fair value. As such, we classify accrued interest receivable as Level 1.




	Equity securities without readily determinable fair values


	:


	 Included in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are


	FHLB


	 stock and


	FRB


	 stock as well as our minority ownership interests in


	Corporate Settlement Solutions, LLC


	 and


	Valley Financial Corporation


	. The investment in


	Corporate Settlement Solutions, LLC


	, a title insurance company, was made in the first quarter 2008 and we account for our investment under the equity method of accounting.


	Valley Financial Corporation


	 is the parent company of 1st State Bank in Saginaw, Michigan, which is a community bank that opened in 2005. We made investments in


	Valley Financial Corporation


	 in


	2004


	 and in


	2007


	 and sold all shares in 2016. We accounted for our investment under the equity method of accounting.




	The lack of an active market, or other independent sources to validate fair value estimates coupled with the impact of future capital calls and transfer restrictions, is an inherent limitation in the valuation process. As the fair values of these investments are not readily determinable, they are not disclosed under a specific fair value hierarchy; however, they are reviewed quarterly for impairment. If we were to record an impairment adjustment related to these securities, it would be classified as a nonrecurring Level 3 fair value adjustment. During


	2016


	 and


	2015


	, there were


	no


	 impairments recorded on equity securities without readily determinable fair values.

	Table of Contents









	Foreclosed assets


	: Upon transfer from the loan portfolio, foreclosed assets (which are included in other assets) are adjusted to and subsequently carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Net realizable value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral, or management’s estimation of the value of the collateral. Due to the inherent level of estimation in the valuation process, we classify foreclosed assets as nonrecurring Level 3.




	The table below lists the quantitative fair value information related to foreclosed assets as of:

	Discount factors with ranges are based on the age of the independent appraisal, broker price opinion, or internal evaluations.




	Goodwill and other intangible assets


	:


	 Acquisition intangibles and goodwill are evaluated for potential impairment on at least an annual basis. Acquisition intangibles and goodwill are typically qualitatively evaluated to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying balance is impaired. If it is determined that the carrying balance of acquisition intangibles or goodwill is more likely than not to be impaired, we perform a cash flow valuation to determine the extent of the potential impairment. If the testing resulted in impairment, we would classify goodwill and other acquisition intangibles subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as Level 3. During


	2016


	 and


	2015


	, there were


	no


	 impairments recorded on goodwill and other acquisition intangibles.




	OMSR


	:




	OMSR


	 (which are included in other assets) are subject to impairment testing. To test for impairment, we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates and prepayment speed assumptions currently quoted for comparable instruments and discount rates. If the valuation model reflects a value less than the carrying value,


	OMSR


	 are adjusted to fair value through a valuation allowance as determined by the model. As such, we classify


	OMSR


	 subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as Level 2.




	Deposits


	:


	 The fair value of demand, savings, and money market deposits are equal to their carrying amounts and are classified as Level 1. Fair values for variable rate certificates of deposit approximate their carrying value. Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits. As such, fixed rate certificates of deposit are classified as Level 2.




	Borrowed funds


	:


	 The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, borrowings under overnight repurchase agreements, and other


	short-term


	 borrowings maturing within


	ninety days


	 approximate their fair values. The fair values of other borrowed funds are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on current incremental borrowing arrangements. As such, borrowed funds are classified as Level 2.




	Accrued interest payable:


	The carrying amounts of accrued interest payable approximate fair value. As such, we classify accrued interest payable as Level 1.




	Derivative instruments:


	 Derivative instruments, consisting solely of interest rate swaps, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges, when highly effective, are reported at fair value in other assets or other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in value recorded in OCI. Should the hedge no longer be considered effective, the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded directly in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. The fair value of a derivative is determined by quoted market prices and model based valuation techniques. As such, we classify derivative instruments as Level 2.




	Commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and undisbursed loans:


	 Our commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and undisbursed funds have no carrying amount and are estimated to have no realizable fair value. Historically, a majority of the unused commitments to extend credit have not been drawn upon and, generally, we do not receive fees in connection with these commitments other than standby letter of credit fees, which are not significant.








	 82









	Table of Contents









	The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Although we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement.




	Estimated Fair Values of Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value in their Entirety on a Recurring Basis




	Disclosure of the estimated fair values of financial instruments, which differ from carrying values, often requires the use of estimates. In cases where quoted market values in an active market are not available, we use present value techniques and other valuation methods to estimate the fair values of our financial instruments. These valuation methods require considerable judgment and the resulting estimates of fair value can be significantly affected by the assumptions made and methods used.




	The carrying amount and estimated fair value of financial instruments not recorded at fair value in their entirety on a recurring basis were as follows as of

	Due to the characteristics of equity securities without readily determinable fair values, they are not disclosed under a specific fair value hierarchy. If we were to record an impairment adjustment related to these securities, such amount would be classified as a nonrecurring Level 3 fair value adjustment.

	Item 9A. Controls and Procedures


	.




	DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the


	Exchange Act


	) as of


	December 31, 2016


	, pursuant to


	Exchange Act


	 Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of


	December 31, 2016


	, were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the


	Exchange Act


	 are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in


	SEC


	 rules and forms.




	CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING




	We also conducted an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter ended


	December 31, 2016


	, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, we have concluded that there have been no such changes during the quarter ended


	December 31, 2016


	.




	Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting




	We are responsible for the preparation and integrity of our published


	consolidated financial statements


	. The


	consolidated financial statements


	 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, accordingly, include amounts based on judgments and estimates. We also prepared the other information included in the


	Annual Report on Form 10-K


	 and are responsible for the accuracy and consistency with the


	consolidated financial statements


	.




	We are responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal control over financial reporting, which is intended to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of our


	consolidated financial statements


	. The system includes but is not limited to:













	•






	A documented organizational structure and division of responsibility;


















	•






	Established policies and procedures, including a code of conduct to foster a strong ethical climate which is communicated throughout our Corporation;
















	•






	Internal auditors that monitor the operation of the internal control system and report findings and recommendations to management and the Audit Committee;
















	•






	Procedures for taking action in response to an internal audit finding or recommendation;
















	•






	Regular reviews of our


	consolidated financial statements


	 by qualified individuals; and

















	•






	The careful selection, training and development of our people.







	There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Also, the effectiveness of an internal control system may change over time. We have implemented a system of internal control that was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of


	consolidated financial statements


	 for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.




	We have assessed our internal control system in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in


	“Internal Control-Integrated Framework


	” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (2013 framework) of the Treadway Commission.




	Based upon these criteria, we believe that, as of


	December 31, 2016


	, our system of internal control over financial reporting was effective.




	Our independent registered public accounting firm, Rehmann Robson LLC ("Rehmann"), has audited our


	2016




	consolidated financial statements


	 and internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	. Rehmann was given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of stockholders, the Board of Directors and committees of the Board. Rehmann has issued an unqualified audit opinion on our


	2016




	consolidated financial statements


	 as a result of the integrated audit and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls as of


	December 31, 2016


	.

	Pursuant to the terms of the


	Directors Plan


	, our directors are required to invest at least 25% of their board fees in our common stock. These stock investments can be made either through deferred fees or through the purchase of shares through the


	Dividend Reinvestment Plan


	. Deferred fees, under the


	Directors Plan


	, are converted on a quarterly basis into stock units of our common stock based on the fair value of a share of common stock as of the relevant valuation date. Stock credited to a participant’s account is eligible for stock and cash dividends as declared.


	Dividend Reinvestment Plan


	 shares are purchased on a monthly basis pursuant to the


	Dividend Reinvestment Plan


	.







	Distribution of deferred fees from the Directors Plan occurs when the participant retires from the board or upon the occurrence of certain other events. The participant is eligible to receive a lump-sum, in-kind, distribution of all of the stock that is then in his or her account, and any unconverted cash will be converted to and rounded up to whole shares of stock and distributed, as well. The


	Directors Plan


	 does not allow for cash settlement, and therefore, such share based payment awards qualify for classification as equity. We may use authorized but unissued shares or purchase shares of common stock on the open market to meet our obligations under the


	Directors Plan


	. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the


	Directors Plan


	 had


	213,470


	 shares eligible to be distributed under the


	Directors Plan


	.

WHY CHOOSE RESEARCH AND MARKETS?



WORLD'S LARGEST SELECTION




TRUSTED BY THE BEST




CUSTOMER FOCUSED




SAFE & SECURE







I recently ordered a book from Research and Markets via their website. Shortly after ordering the book

                         I received a message from the Research and Markets Orders Department stating that payment had not been received for the book. My first thought was credit card fraud. I called Orders Department and was connected immediately with Maria O’Toole. Maria was extremely helpful in resolving the payment question. Maria suggested that since Research and Markets is located in Dublin, Ireland and I am located in Seattle, Washington, my credit card company might have placed a hold on the payment. I checked with my card company and this was indeed the case. I corrected the hold on the payment and informed Maria. Maria confirmed that the payment transaction had been completed and assured me that the book would be delivered in a timely manner. 

I truly appreciate the ease with which I was able to contact a live person quickly and resolve the issue easily. I highly recommend Research and Markets for their depth and breadth of research materials and their excellent customer service.
