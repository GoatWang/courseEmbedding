Product Description:

A former cop goes to work at a mafia strip club after being released from prison, and races to solve a vicious crime before he takes the fall in this hard-hitting action thriller starring WWF brawler Dave Bautista (aka Batista). Ray (Bautista) used to uphold the law; now he's fallen on the wrong side of it. But he's served his sentence, and he's content just taking things one day at a time. In order to earn a little extra income, Ray takes a job as the head of security at The House of the Rising Sun, an underworld strip club that also houses an illicit gambling den. When a savage gang of thieves strike fast and hard, the police finger Ray as the mastermind of the violent robbery. Now, in order to regain his honor and avoid ending up back in prison, Ray must catch the real culprits, before the police catch up with him.
