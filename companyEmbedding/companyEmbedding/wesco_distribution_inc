Network and communication closets are dynamic areas within a business. Constant moves, additions, and changes occur and often there may not be the proper equipment in place to streamline configurations to ensure maximum availability. The assessment team examines environmental and critical infrastructure conditions and provides recommendations to increase overall closet effectiveness.
New Construction Lighting Review
When designing a new building, it's important to understand the specific lighting requirements for all spaces. WESCO and our supplier partners can help customers design an optimal new construction lighting system to save energy, reduce maintenance, inventory, procurement costs, improve productivity and meet environmental standards. WESCO also provides LEED and green strategy expertise to new construction projects.
Power Distribution Services
When clients need scalable, customized solutions for power distribution, this set of services can meet their requirements. WESCO experts design and integrate electrical distribution equipment, low voltage and data assemblies, energy management and lighting control systems into a single Integrated Facility Systems (IFS) assembly. This expertise can extend into retrofit applications when new equipment is preferred or required.  
Power Quality
Process and administrative computer requirements today demand high quality power with few, if any interruptions in service. With increased costs for electrical service a complete system power factor and power quality audit is a wise solution. WESCO can provide enhanced power quality solutions through Eaton Engineering Services, Eaton Electrical, and Powerware. As partners, WESCO and Eaton meet with the customer to discuss how this solution for power quality can improve system efficiency, lower repair and operation costs, and improve equipment life. After meeting to determine all elements and scope of work, a complete power factor and quality audit is performed. This includes work on the electrical system and equipment to enhance system quality and efficiency. We will not only provide a report of recommendations, but also provide the equipment and service to implement recommended improvements!
Process Streamlining
Applying LEAN concepts such as value stream mapping, cost/time studies, process value assessments, space utilization and error-proofing to existing processes helps customers identify opportunities and potential solutions for quality and productivity improvements. A customized supply chain strategy for addressing existing barriers and waste within a process flow is delivered to customers, helping them achieve their goals and objectives.
Product Standardization
Using the customer's inventory data, WESCO learns more about the manufacturers currently involved throughout their supply chain to prepare a complete comparative analysis. A dozen different types/styles of an item may be reduced to two or three choices. Details of the study are submitted to the customer for review and ultimate selection of the most appropriate manufacturer to meet their specification and value requirements.
Turnkey LIghting Services
An experienced team of WESCO Lighting Specialists partner with Energy Services Contractors to coordinate a detailed lighting assessment of the customer's facility. Once audit data is collected, a comprehensive retrofit lighting solution proposal is delivered. Included in the proposal is a complete lighting system analysis with energy and cash flow projections.
