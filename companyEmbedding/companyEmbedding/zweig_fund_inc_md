	PROXY STATEMENT






	ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS






	MAY 14, 2013




	 



	 




	This Joint Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Board of Directors (each a Board) of The Zweig Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation
	(ZF), and The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation (ZTR), for use at the Joint Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held at the offices of Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, 34



	th



	Floor, New York, NY 10019-6099, on Tuesday, May 14, 2013 at
	9:00 A.M. Eastern Time, and at any and all adjournments or postponements thereof (the Meeting), for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting dated April 10, 2013.




	The Meeting is scheduled as a joint meeting of the respective shareholders of ZF and ZTR (collectively, the Funds and each a
	Fund) because the shareholders of both Funds are expected to consider and vote on similar proposals with respect to the election of Directors. The Board of Directors of the Funds have determined that the use of a joint proxy
	statement for the Meeting is in the best interest of the shareholders of both Funds. In the event that any shareholder of a Fund present at the Meeting objects to the holding of a joint meeting and moves for adjournment of such Funds Meeting
	to immediately after the Meeting, so that such Funds meeting may be held separately, the persons named as proxies will vote in favor of such adjournment. Shareholders of each Fund will vote separately on the proposal(s) relating to their
	respective Fund, and an unfavorable vote on a proposal by the shareholders of one Fund will not affect the implementation by the other Fund of such proposal if the shareholders of such other Fund approve the proposal.




	If the accompanying form of proxy is properly executed and returned in time to be voted at the Meeting, the shares will be voted in
	accordance with the instructions marked by the shareholder. Except for broker non-votes (as discussed below), executed proxies that are unmarked will be voted FOR any proposal for which no instruction is given. A shareholder can revoke
	the proxy prior to its use by appearing at the Meeting and voting in person, by giving written notice of such revocation to the Secretary of the respective Fund prior to the Meeting, or by returning a subsequently dated proxy prior to the Meeting.




	 




	1








	Shareholders may be able to vote their shares by touchtone telephone or by Internet by
	following the instructions on the proxy card accompanying this Joint Proxy Statement. The Internet procedures are designed to authenticate a shareholders identity to allow shareholders to vote their shares and confirm that their instructions
	have been properly recorded. To vote by Internet or by touchtone telephone, shareholders can access the website or call the toll-free number listed on the proxy card. To vote by touchtone telephone or by Internet, shareholders will need to input a
	control number, which appears on the proxy card.




	The Board of Directors of each Fund has fixed the close of business on
	March 19, 2013 as the record date for the determination of shareholders of that Fund entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting. This Proxy Statement and the accompanying form of proxy will be first sent to shareholders on or about
	April 10, 2013. In accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are advising our shareholders of the availability on the Internet of our proxy materials related to the Meeting. These rules allow
	companies to provide access to proxy materials in one of two ways. Because we have elected to utilize the full set delivery option, we are delivering to all shareholders paper copies of all of the proxy materials, as well as providing
	access to those proxy materials on a publicly accessible website.





	Important Notice Regarding the
	Availability of Proxy Materials for the Shareholder Meeting to be held on Tuesday, May 14, 2013, at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time, at the offices of Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, 34


	th



	Floor, New York, N.Y. 10019-6099. The Notice of Annual Meeting of
	Shareholders, Proxy Statement, form of proxy card and annual report to shareholders are available at www.edocumentview.com/zweig.






	As of the record date, 22,071,859 shares of ZFs common stock were outstanding, and 34,806,575 shares of ZTRs common stock were outstanding. To the best of each Funds knowledge, no person
	beneficially owns more than five percent of the outstanding shares of that Funds common stock other than as listed in the below table. This information is based on publicly available Schedule 13D and 13G disclosures filed with the SEC.

	PROPOSAL 1






	ELECTION OF DIRECTORS





	The members of the Board of Directors of ZF and ZTR
	are divided into three classes, with the term of office of one class expiring each year. At the forthcoming Meeting, two ZF and two ZTR Directors will be elected to serve a three-year term (until the third succeeding Annual Meeting in 2016 and until
	their successors are elected and duly qualify). Unless authority to vote for the election of Directors is withheld, the enclosed proxy will be voted for the election of the nominees named below, who have indicated their intention to serve if
	elected. While management has no reason to believe that the nominees will not be available as candidates, should such a situation arise, proxies may be voted for the election of such other persons as a Director as the holders of the proxies may, in
	their discretion, determine.




	Each Funds Board of Directors has appointed a Nominating Committee which makes annual
	recommendations as to the individuals to be nominated by the Funds Board of Directors for election as Directors at the next annual meeting and recommends to the Board candidates for election by the Board of Directors to fill any vacancies in
	the Board of Directors, including those resulting from an increase in the number of Directors. Each Funds Nominating Committee consists of five Directors (Independent Directors) who are not interested persons (as
	defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act)) of the Fund or the Adviser.




	Based
	on the recommendations made by ZFs Nominating Committee at its meeting held on February 5, 2013, the Board of Directors of ZF has nominated George R. Aylward for re-election and William H. Wright II for election, to serve until the third
	succeeding Annual Meeting in 2016 and until their successors are elected and duly qualify. Mr. Aylward is presently a Director of ZF. Alden C. Olson, who is currently a Director of ZF, will not be standing for re-election due to having
	reached retirement age pursuant to the Board of Directors retirement policy. Mr. Wright, who is not currently a director, has been nominated to replace Mr. Olson.




	Based on the recommendations made by ZTRs Nominating Committee at its meeting held on February 5, 2013, the Board of Directors of ZTR has nominated George R. Aylward for re-election and William
	H. Wright II for election, to serve until the third succeeding Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2016 and until their successors are elected and duly qualify. Mr. Aylward is presently a Director of ZTR. Mr. Olson, who is currently a
	Director of ZTR, will not be standing for re-election due to having reached retirement age pursuant to the Board of Directors retirement policy. Mr. Wright, who is not currently a director, has been nominated to replace Mr. Olson.

	the year ended December 31, 2012, each Fund paid each Independent Director an annual fee of $11,000 and a fee of $1,500 for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and each meeting of the Audit Committee and the Nominating
	Committee. Each Fund pays its Audit Committee Chairman a $5,000 annual retainer. Each Fund also pays its Nominating Committee Chairman a $2,500 annual retainer. The members of the Executive Committee of each Fund are Wendy Luscombe and R. Keith
	Walton, who also function as the co-lead Independent Directors of each Fund. They do not receive any Executive Committee meeting fees, but are each paid an additional annual fee of $10,000 by each Fund for acting as a co-lead Independent Director.
	Each Fund also reimburses its Directors for their actual out-of-pocket expenses relating to attendance at such meetings.




	Set
	forth below is the compensation paid by ZF and ZTR to current Directors for the year ended December 31, 2012. The Funds do not pay any pension or retirement benefits to Directors.

	Committees; Board of Directors and Standing Committees Meetings







	Audit Committee






	Each Funds Board of Directors has appointed a standing Audit Committee and adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee. Each
	Funds Audit Committee Charter is available on the Advisers website:




	ZF Audit Committee Charter:




	http://www.virtus.com/vSiteManager/Upload/Docs/ClosedEndFunds/ZF/Governance/ZF_Audit_Committee_Charter.pdf




	ZTR Audit Committee Charter:




	http://www.virtus.com/vSiteManager/Upload/Docs/ClosedEndFunds/ZTR/Governance/ZTR_Audit_Committee_Charter.pdf




	The purposes of each Boards Audit Committee are set forth in the Audit Committee Charter. In brief, the role of each Boards
	Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its oversight of the respective Funds financial reporting process, including internal controls and the performance of the independent registered public accounting firm. As set forth in the
	Charter of each Boards Audit Committee, it is not the responsibility of the Audit Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that each Funds financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles, which duties are the responsibility of the Adviser and each Funds independent registered public accounting firm. The independent registered public accounting firm for each Fund is responsible for auditing that
	Funds financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.




	In the performance of its oversight function, each Audit Committee has considered and discussed the audited financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm of
	the Fund. Each Audit Committee also has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 114, The Auditors Communication With Those Charged
	With Governance, as currently in effect. Each Audit Committee also has considered whether the provision by the Funds independent registered public accounting firm of non-audit services to the Fund, and of professional services to the
	Adviser and affiliates of the Adviser that provide services to the Fund, is compatible with maintaining the independent registered public accounting firms independence. Finally, each Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the
	letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the Public Company Accounting




	 




	21








	Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firms communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent
	registered public accounting firm the independence of that independent registered public accounting firm.




	The members of each
	Audit Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not experts in the fields of accounting or auditing or evaluating auditor independence. The Board of Directors of each Fund has determined that Wendy
	Luscombe is an audit committee financial expert, as defined under SEC Regulation S-K, Item 407(d)(5). The SEC has stated that the designation or identification of a person as an audit committee financial expert does not impose on
	such person any duties, obligations or liability that are greater than the duties, obligations and liability imposed on such person as a member of the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors in the absence of such designation or identification.
	Each Audit Committee is in compliance with the New York Stock Exchange requirements applicable to closed-end fund audit committees, including the requirement that all members of the audit committee be financially literate and that at
	least one member of the audit committee have accounting or related financial management expertise, as determined by the Board. Members of each Audit Committee rely without independent verification on the information provided to them and
	on the representations made by management and the independent registered public accounting firm. Accordingly, each Audit Committees oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate
	accounting and financial reporting principles or appropriate internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, an Audit Committees considerations and
	discussions referred to above do not assure that the audit of a Funds financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles or that the Funds independent registered public accounting firm is in fact independent.










	Audit Committee Report







	Based upon the reports and discussions described in this report, and subject to the limitations on the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committees referred to above and in the Audit Committee
	Charters, each Audit Committee recommended to its Board of Directors that the audited financial statements of the applicable Fund be included in the Funds annual report to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2012. The members of
	each Audit Committee, Messrs. Brunie, Olson, Rogers and Walton, and Ms. Luscombe, are independent within the meaning of the 1940 Act and the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards for audit committees applicable to
	closed-end funds.

	Wendy Luscombe




	James B. Rogers, Jr.




	R. Keith Walton






	Nominating Committee






	Messrs. Brunie, Olson, Rogers and Walton, and Ms. Luscombe, each of whom is an Independent Director, are members of the Nominating
	Committee of each Board of Directors. Each Funds Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for its Nominating Committee. Each Funds Nominating Committee Charter is available on the Advisers website at
	https://www.virtus.com/vSiteManager/Upload/Docs/ClosedEndFunds/Nominating_Committee_Charter.pdf. Each Nominating Committee considers candidates for election to fill vacancies on the respective Funds Board of Directors.




	Director nominees are identified based on persons known to the Board of Directors or the Nominating Committees and any persons
	recommended to the Nominating Committees by shareholders or industry sources. Any recommendations made by shareholders or industry sources must be accompanied by a biography of the recommended candidate and should be submitted in writing to the
	principal executive office of the Funds, located at 101 Munson Street, Greenfield, MA 01301-9683, addressed to the Secretary of the Funds. For more information, see Additional Information: Proposals for 2014 Meeting.




	Nominees are identified and evaluated based on the criteria and through the process described below. Members of the Nominating Committee
	as well as other Board members may identify potential candidates. Shareholders also may propose nominees pursuant to each Funds Bylaws. The evaluation process does not depend on the source of the recommendation. It is expected that all
	candidates for the Board will possess the following minimum qualifications: (i) unquestioned personal integrity; (ii) sound business judgment; and (iii) the commitment required to be an effective director, including, without
	limitation, the ability to attend meetings regularly. The Nominating Committee takes into consideration such other factors as it deems appropriate. Except as provided above, in nominating candidates, each Nominating Committee does not believe that
	certain qualifications are controlling or paramount or that specific qualifications or skills are necessary for a candidate to possess. Pursuant to policies and procedures contained in the Nominating Committee Charter, when assessing the
	qualifications of a potential nominee or Independent Director, the Nominating Committee considers such factors as it may deem relevant, including whether the candidates background,




	 




	23








	skills and experience will complement the background, skills and experience of other nominees and contribute to the diversity of the Board. These policies and procedures for identifying and
	evaluating candidates are implemented through discussion among Nominating Committee members. Each Nominating Committee may determine that a candidate who does not have all the qualifications referred to above should nevertheless be considered as a
	nominee if the Nominating Committee finds that the candidates qualifications, taken as a whole, demonstrate an equivalent level of qualification to serve as a director. Each Fund has adopted a policy requiring that any person whose
	seventy-fifth (75th) birthday would occur during such persons term of service as a Director may not stand for election for such term; provided, however, that the Directors in office as of September 1, 2011 shall not be required to
	retire pursuant to the foregoing policy and shall be eligible to be nominated for re-election as a Director for one or more additional terms so long as the Directors eighty-fifth (85th) birthday is not to occur during any such additional
	term. In assessing the effectiveness of its Nominating Committee Charter, each Nominating Committee shall recommend to its Funds Board any revisions or modifications to its Nominating Committee Charter that the Committee deems necessary or
	appropriate to the effective exercise of its responsibilities.






	Executive Committee






	Each Funds Board of Directors also has an Executive Committee consisting of Wendy Luscombe and R. Keith Walton, each of whom is an
	Independent Director of the Funds. The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of each Fund, in the intervals between meetings of the Board of Directors, has all the authority of such Board of Directors, except as otherwise provided by that
	Funds Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or applicable law; provided, however, that the Executive Committee shall not exercise its authority in a manner inconsistent with any action, direction, or instruction of the Board of Directors.






	Meetings of the Board of Directors and Standing Committees






	Each Funds Board of Directors held nine meetings during the year ended December 31, 2012. Each Funds Nominating
	Committee held seven meetings during the year ended December 31, 2012, and met on February 5, 2013, at which time each Nominating Committee recommended the nominees for election to the Board. Each Funds Audit Committee held three
	meetings during the year ended December 31, 2012. Each Funds Executive Committee held no meetings during the year ended December 31, 2012. All of the Directors attended at least 75% of the total number of Board meetings, and his or
	her respective committee meetings, held during the year ended December 31, 2012.

	Board Role in Risk Oversight






	Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational and valuation risks, among others. Risk oversight
	forms part of each Boards general oversight of the respective Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. Day-to-day risk management functions are subsumed within the responsibilities of the Adviser and other
	service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), who carry out the Funds investment management and business affairs. Each of the Adviser and other service providers have their own, independent interest in risk management, and their
	policies and methods of risk management will depend on their functions, business model and compliance structure. As a result, the Board recognizes that it is not possible to identify all of the risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes
	and controls to eliminate or mitigate the occurrence or effects of all of such risks. As part of its regular oversight of the Funds, the respective Board, directly or through a committee, interacts with and reviews reports from, among others, the
	Adviser (and its officers and employees), each Funds Chief Compliance Officer, and the independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund, as appropriate, that include risks faced by the Fund and applicable risk functions. The Board
	may, at any time and in its discretion, change the manner in which it conducts risk oversight.






	The Board Leadership Structure






	George R. Aylward, an interested person of each Fund, serves as each Funds Chairman of the Board, Chief
	Executive Officer and President. Mr. Aylwards combined role as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President promotes unified leadership and direction for each Funds Board of Directors and executive management and allows for a
	single, clear focus for the chain of command to execute each Funds initiatives and plans.




	The Independent Directors
	have designated two co-lead Independent Directors of each Fund, Wendy Luscombe and R. Keith Walton. The co-lead Independent Directors roles are defined as follows:



	 





	 




	




	 





	Chair meetings or executive sessions of the Independent Directors;









	 




	




	 





	Review and comment on each Boards meeting agendas;









	 




	




	 





	Represent the views of the Independent Directors to management; and









	 




	




	 





	Facilitate communication among the Independent Directors and their counsel.







	As noted, each Board has established an Executive Committee, a Nominating Committee and an Audit Committee to assist each Board in the
	oversight and




	 




	25








	direction of the business and affairs of each Fund, and from time to time may establish informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of each Fund with respect to
	certain specified matters.




	The Board of each Fund has determined that the Boards leadership structure is appropriate
	for that Fund, taking into account that Funds specific characteristics and circumstances, in light of the fact that: (i) all of the directors, except the Chairman, are independent; (ii) it provides for oversight of the business
	operations of the Fund by experienced Independent Directors, with two co-lead Independent Directors and separate committee chairmen; (iii) by having Mr. Aylward in the combined role as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, it
	allows for unified leadership and direction for each Funds Board of Directors and executive management; (iv) by having two co-lead Independent Directors, it helps to ensure timely communication between management and the Independent
	Directors and among the Independent Directors; (v) it allows the Board to exercise informed and independent judgment over the matters under its purview and specific to that Fund; (vi) it strikes an effective balance between management and
	Independent Director participation in the Board process; and (vii) it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of each Boards members and the full Board in a manner that enhances effective oversight.






	Shareholder Communications






	Any shareholder that wishes to communicate with the Board of Directors or a specific Director may do so by submitting correspondence in writing to the principal executive office of the Funds, located at
	101 Munson Street, Greenfield, MA 01301-9683, specifying the intended addressee. Shareholder communications addressed to the Board of Directors will be forwarded promptly after receipt to George R. Aylward, President of the Funds, for review.
	Mr. Aylward will review each such communication in order to determine whether the communication should be relayed directly to each Board member. Shareholder communications that Mr. Aylward determines to involve routine matters will be
	forwarded to the Funds Administrator and/or officers of the Funds for review and response, and Mr. Aylward will report to the full Board, as appropriate, on the nature and substance of such communications. Shareholder communications that
	Mr. Aylward determines involve non-routine matters will be forwarded to each member of the Board for review. Shareholder communications addressed to a specific Director will be forwarded to the addressee promptly upon receipt.




	It is the Funds policy that all Directors attend the annual shareholders meeting, if reasonably possible. All of the Directors
	attended the joint annual meeting of ZF and ZTR in 2012.

	THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF ZF AND ZTR UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE

	FOR

	THE RE-ELECTION AND ELECTION, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE NOMINEES.






	ADMINISTRATOR





	Virtus Fund Services, LLC (the Administrator or Virtus Fund Services), serves as the administrator for ZF and
	ZTR. The Administrators principal business office is located at 100 Pearl Street, Hartford, CT 06103. All of the Administrators outstanding equity interests are owned by Virtus. Virtus Fund Services, LLC became the administrator of ZF
	and ZTR on January 1, 2013, as assignee of VP Distributors, LLC (VP Distributors), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Virtus. Virtus Fund Services was established to carry on the fund administration business previously conducted
	by VP Distributors, which now conducts exclusively a broker-dealer and fund distribution business. In addition, Virtus Fund Services utilizes the same personnel and systems previously used by VP Distributors to perform administrative services for ZF
	and ZTR, and the administration fee remains the same.





	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance





	Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) and Section 30(h) of
	the 1940 Act require, among other persons, the officers and Directors of the Funds and the Adviser to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of the shares of common stock of the Funds with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. The
	SECs regulations also require such reporting persons to furnish each Fund with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based on its review of these reports and on written representations from the reporting persons that no other
	reports were required, each Fund believes that, during the year ended December 31, 2012, such reporting persons were in compliance with all Section 16(a) and Section 30(h) reporting requirements applicable to them.





	INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	At the recommendation of the Audit Committees of the Funds, the Board of Directors of each Fund, including a majority of the Independent Directors, has selected the firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
	(PwC) to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm of each Fund for the year ending December 31, 2013. A representative of PwC is expected to be present at the Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a
	statement if he or she so desires and to respond to questions from shareholders.




	 




	27








	The aggregate fees billed for services rendered by PwC during the years ended
	December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, respectively, are described below.





	Audit Fees





	The aggregate fees billed by PwC to ZF in connection with the annual audit of ZFs financial statements for the fiscal years ended
	December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 were $28,800 and $32,000, respectively. The aggregate fees billed by PwC to ZTR in connection with the annual audit of ZTRs financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31,
	2011 and December 31, 2012 were $31,300 and $32,000, respectively.





	Audit-Related Fees





	The fees billed by PwC to ZF for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 for any audit-related services
	were $2,740 and $2,962, respectively. The fees billed by PwC to ZTR for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 for any audit-related services were $2,740 and $2,962, respectively. These fees are related to the
	review of the Funds semi-annual financial statements, interim audit testing and out of pocket expenses.





	Tax Fees





	The aggregate fees billed by PwC to ZF for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 in connection with tax
	review, compliance and advice were approximately $4,600 and $5,900, respectively. The aggregate fees billed by PwC to ZTR for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 in connection with tax review, compliance and
	advice were approximately $4,600 and $7,800, respectively. These fees were related to the determination of federal income and excise taxes for the Funds.





	All Other Fees





	Neither Fund paid any fees for other services for the
	fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 or 2012.





	Aggregate Non-Audit Fees Billed to Funds and Affiliate





	The aggregate non-audit fees billed by PwC for services rendered to the Funds, the Adviser, and any entity controlling, controlled by, or
	under common control with the Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Funds for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 were $327,554 and $418,361, respectively.




	 




	28








	Each Audit Committee considered whether the non-audit services rendered to the Adviser or an
	affiliate of the Adviser that provides ongoing services to either Fund were compatible with maintaining the independence of PwC. The Audit Committees pre-approve: (i) all audit and non-audit services to be rendered to the respective Fund by
	PwC; and (ii) all non-audit services relating to the operations and financial reporting of the respective Fund provided by PwC to the Adviser or any affiliate thereof that provides ongoing services to the respective Fund (collectively,
	Covered Services). Each Audit Committee has adopted pre-approval procedures authorizing a member of the Audit Committee to pre-approve from time to time, on behalf of the Audit Committee, all Covered Services to be provided by PwC which
	are not otherwise pre-approved at a meeting of the Audit Committee, provided that such delegate reports to the full Audit Committee at its next meeting. The pre-approval procedures do not include delegation of the Audit Committees
	responsibilities to management. All Covered Services were pre-approved in accordance with the above procedures. Pre-approval has not been waived with respect to any of the services described above since the date on which the Audit Committee adopted
	its current pre-approval procedures.





	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION









	Other Matters





	The Board of Directors of the Funds know of no matters to be
	presented at the meeting other than those specified in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting. However, if any other matter is properly presented before the Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies to vote in accordance with
	their best judgment.





	Expenses





	The Funds will bear the expense of the Meeting, including preparation, printing and mailing of the enclosed form of proxy and accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting and this Proxy Statement. Each Fund will
	bear one half of such expenses, except for mailing expenses, which are paid by each Fund based on its actual mailing expenses to its shareholders, and its own respective legal expenses. Each Fund, upon request, will reimburse banks, brokers and
	others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding proxy solicitation material to the beneficial owners of that Funds common stock. In order to obtain the necessary quorum at the Meeting, supplementary solicitation may be made by mail,
	telephone or personal interviews by officers or employees of the Funds and/or Adviser, or their affiliates.




	 




	29








	We do not currently plan to hire a proxy solicitor to help us solicit proxies, although we
	reserve the right to do so. Proxies are expected to be solicited principally by mail, but the Funds may also solicit proxies by telephone, facsimile or personal interview. The Funds officers will not receive any additional compensation for any
	such solicitation. The Funds will bear 100% of these solicitation costs.





	Vote Required





	The following principles of Maryland law and the 1940 Act apply to the voting of shares of common stock at the Meeting. The presence in
	person or by proxy of shareholders entitled to vote a majority of the outstanding shares will constitute a quorum. Shares represented by proxy or in person at the Meeting, including shares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions and broker
	non-votes (hereinafter defined), will be counted as present in the determination of a quorum.




	The vote required for the
	election of Directors (Proposal 1) for each Fund requires a plurality of the votes cast at the Meeting by the shareholders of such Fund.




	An abstention does not constitute a vote and will be disregarded in calculating the votes cast as to such matter, and broker non-votes (

	i.e.,

	where a broker or nominee submits a proxy
	specifically indicating the lack of discretionary authority to vote on a matter) will be treated in the same manner as abstentions. It is anticipated that votes will be tabulated by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the Funds transfer
	agent.





	Adjournments and Postponements





	The Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Funds authorize the Chairman of the Meeting to adjourn or postpone the Meeting to a later date (whether or not a quorum is present) without notice other than
	announcement at the Meeting for such purposes as the Chairman shall deem appropriate, including further solicitation of proxies. In the absence of a quorum, the Chairman may (but shall not be required to) allow the shareholders present (in
	person or by proxy) to adjourn the Meeting to a later date by majority vote of those present. Adjournments or postponements may occur in order to defer action on any Proposal. The Meeting may be adjourned up to 120 days after the record date
	without further notice other than announcement at the Meeting. If the Meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the original record date upon at least 10 days notice, a new record date must be established for voting at such
	adjourned Meeting, and any unrevoked proxies submitted by any shareholder of record as of the original record date, with respect




	 




	30








	to shares that such shareholder continues to hold of record on the new record date, may be voted at the adjourned Meeting and any subsequent adjourned Meeting, provided that any adjourned Meeting
	is not more than 120 days after the new record date. At any adjourned Meeting at which a quorum is present, any action may be taken that could have been taken at the Meeting originally called.





	No Dissenters Rights





	Shareholders have no rights under Maryland law or each Funds Articles of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated Bylaws to exercise dissenters rights of appraisal with respect to any of the
	matters to be voted upon at the Meeting.





	Proposals for 2014 Meeting





	Each Funds Amended and Restated Bylaws contains an advance notice provision, which requires that the respective
	Fund be given advance notice of shareholder nominations for election to the Board of Directors and of other matters which shareholders wish to present for action at an annual meeting of shareholders, other than matters included in that Funds
	proxy statement in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Any notice of shareholder nominations for election to a Funds Board of Directors or notice of other matters which shareholders wish to present at the Funds 2014 Annual
	Meeting of Shareholders must be received at such Funds principal executive office not earlier than the
	150



	th



	day nor later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the
	120



	th



	day prior to the first anniversary of the date of
	the proxy statement for the preceding years annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the first anniversary of the date of the preceding
	years annual meeting, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the
	150



	th



	day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not
	later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the later of the
	120



	th



	day prior to the date of such annual meeting or the
	tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.




	The notice by the
	shareholder must also set forth specific information, and provide certain representations, the details of which are set forth in the respective Funds Amended and Restated Bylaws. Any shareholder proposal must also comply with all other legal
	requirements in order to be included in the Funds proxy statement and form of proxy for that meeting. A copy of ZFs Bylaws is available on the website of the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. A copy of ZTRs Bylaws is available on the
	website of the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.




	 




	31








	The persons named as proxies for the Funds 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will,
	with respect to the proxies in effect at such meeting, have discretionary authority to vote on any matter presented by a shareholder for action at that meeting unless the respective Fund receives notice of the matter by not less than one hundred and
	twenty (120) days before the date in the then current year corresponding to the date of such Funds proxy statement for the annual meeting held in the prior year. If the respective Fund receives such timely notice, these persons will not
	have this authority except as provided in the applicable rules of the SEC.

	PROXY STATEMENT

	JOINT ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

	JUNE 10, 2016



	 



	This Combined Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Boards of Directors (each a “Board”) of The Zweig Fund, Inc. ("ZF") and The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (“ZTR”), each a Maryland corporation, for use at the Joint Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held at the offices of Virtus Investment Partners, Inc., 100 Pearl Street, 2nd Floor, Hartford, Connecticut 06103, on Friday, June 10, 2016 at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time, and at any and all adjournments or postponements thereof (the “Meeting”), for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting dated April 28, 2016.


	The Meeting is scheduled as a joint meeting of the respective shareholders of ZF and ZTR (collectively, the “Funds” and each a “Fund”) because the shareholders of both Funds are expected to consider and vote on similar proposals.  Each Board has determined that the use of a combined proxy statement for the Meeting is in the best interest of the shareholders of both Funds.  In the event that any shareholder of a Fund present at the Meeting objects to the holding of a joint meeting and moves for adjournment of such Fund’s meeting to immediately after the other Fund's meeting, so that such Fund’s meeting may be held separately, the persons named as proxies will vote in favor of such adjournment.  Shareholders of each Fund will vote separately on the proposals relating to their respective Fund, and an unfavorable vote on a proposal by the shareholders of one Fund will not affect the implementation by the other Fund of such proposal if the shareholders of such other Fund approve the proposal. 


	If the accompanying form of proxy is properly executed and returned in time to be voted at the Meeting, the shares represented will be voted in accordance with the instructions marked by the shareholder. Except for broker non-votes (as discussed below under the caption, "Additional Information - Quorum and Vote Required"), executed proxies that are unmarked will be voted “FOR” the Board’s nominees and “AGAINST” any shareholder proposal for which no instruction is given. A shareholder can revoke the proxy prior to its use by appearing at the Meeting and voting in person, by giving written notice of such revocation to the Secretary of the respective Fund prior to the Meeting, or by returning a subsequently dated proxy prior to the Meeting.


	Shareholders may vote their shares by telephone or by Internet by following the instructions on the proxy card accompanying this Combined Proxy Statement. The Internet procedures are designed to authenticate a shareholder’s identity, to allow shareholders to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. To vote by Internet or by telephone, shareholders can access the website or call the toll-free number listed on the proxy card. To vote by telephone or by Internet, shareholders will need to input a control number, which appears on the proxy card.


	The Board of each Fund has fixed the close of business on April 18, 2016 as the record date for the determination of shareholders of that Fund entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting. This Proxy Statement and the accompanying form of proxy are being first sent to shareholders on or about April 28, 2016. In accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), we are advising our shareholders of the availability on the Internet of our proxy materials related to the Meeting. These rules allow companies to provide access to proxy materials in one of two ways. Because we have elected to utilize the “full set delivery” option, we are delivering to all shareholders paper copies of all of the proxy materials, as well as providing access to those proxy materials on a publicly accessible website.


	Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Shareholder Meeting to be held on Friday, June 10, 2016, at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time, at the offices of Virtus Investment Partners, Inc., 100 Pearl Street, 2nd Floor, Hartford, Connecticut 06103. The Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, Proxy Statement, form of proxy card and annual report to shareholders are available at www.edocumentview.com/zweig.


	As of the record date, 20,078,593 shares of ZF’s common stock were outstanding, and 31,792,834 shares of ZTR’s common stock were outstanding.


	The annual report of each Fund for the year ended December 31, 2015, including financial statements, has been mailed to shareholders, and each Fund will furnish, without charge, a copy of the Fund’s 2014 Annual Report to any shareholder who requests it by contacting Shareholder Services, 101 Munson Street, Greenfield, MA 01301-9683; Toll-free telephone number 1-800-272-2700; or by E-Mail: Zweig@Virtus.com.

	PROPOSAL 1

	ELECTION OF DIRECTORS


	The Boards of ZF and ZTR are divided into three classes, with the term of office of one class expiring each year. At the forthcoming Meeting, shareholders are being asked to elect two Directors to serve a three-year term until the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2019, or until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Unless authority to vote for the election of Directors is withheld, the enclosed proxy will be voted FOR the election of the nominees named below, who have indicated their intention to serve if elected. While management has no reason to believe that the nominees will not be available as candidates, should such a situation arise, proxies may be voted for the election of such other persons as Directors as the holders of the proxies may, in their discretion, determine. 


	Each Fund’s Board has appointed a Nominating Committee which makes annual recommendations as to the individuals to be nominated by the Fund’s Board for election as Directors at the next annual meeting and recommends to the Board candidates for election by the Board to fill any vacancies in the Board, including those resulting from an increase in the number of Directors. Each Fund’s Nominating Committee consists of the five current Directors who are not “interested persons” (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)) of the Funds (the “Independent Directors”).


	Based on the recommendations made by each Fund's Nominating Committee at its meeting held on March 3, 2016, the Boards of ZF and ZTR have nominated William H. Wright II and George R. Aylward for election, to serve until the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2019, or until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Messrs. Wright and Aylward are presently Directors of ZF and ZTR and were last elected by shareholders in 2013 to serve until this Meeting. Messrs. Wright and Aylward have consented to be named in this Combined Proxy Statement and to serve as Directors of the Funds if elected.

	The term “Fund Complex” means two or more registered investment companies that: (a) hold themselves out to

	investors as related companies for purposes of investment and investor services; or (b) have a common investment


	adviser or have an investment adviser that is an affiliated person of the investment adviser of any of the other


	registered investment companies.







	**




	Mr. Aylward is considered an “interested person,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, of each Fund.





	Director and Director Nominee Qualifications


	Each Board has determined that each continuing Director and Director Nominee should serve as a Director of each Fund based on several factors (none of which alone is decisive). Among the factors the Boards considered when concluding that an individual should serve as a Director were the following: (i) personal and professional background, (ii) educational background, (iii) financial expertise, (iv) ability, judgment, attributes and expertise, and (v) availability and commitment to attend meetings and perform the responsibilities of a Director. In respect of each Director and Director Nominee, the individual’s professional accomplishments and prior experience, including, in some cases, in fields related to the operations of the Funds, were a significant factor in the determination that the individual should serve as a Director of the Funds.


	The following is a summary of each continuing Director and Director Nominee's experience, qualifications, attributes or skills (in addition to business experience during the past five years as set forth in the table above) that contributed to each Board's conclusion that each individual should serve on the Boards. References to the experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of each continuing Director and Director Nominee do not constitute the holding out of any continuing Director or Director Nominee as being an expert under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the SEC.


	George R. Aylward

	. (Nominee) In addition to his positions with the Funds, Mr. Aylward is a Director and the


	president and chief executive officer of Virtus, the ultimate parent company of Zweig Advisers LLC (the “Adviser”). He


	also holds various executive positions with the Adviser, and previously held such positions with the former parent


	company of Virtus. He therefore has experience in all aspects of the development and management of registered


	investment companies, and the responsibility for various financial, staffing, regulatory and operational issues. Mr.


	Aylward is a certified public accountant and holds an MBA, and he also serves as an officer and director of other


	closed-end funds managed by the affiliates of the Adviser.



	James B. Rogers, Jr

	.  Mr. Rogers brings significant financial and economic experience to each Board, and


	provides innovative business insight to assist each Board and its committees.



	Christopher Ruddy

	.  Mr. Ruddy's entrepreneurial experience as the founder and chief executive officer of a news


	media organization brings both managerial skills and valuable insight to each Board and its committees.



	R. Keith Walton

	.  Mr. Walton’s business and legal background, and his extensive service with other Boards,


	provide valuable insight to each Board and its committees regarding corporate governance and best practices.



	William H. Wright II

	. (Nominee) Mr. Wright’s years of service as a director of various organizations, his extensive


	financial experience and training and managerial skills bring valuable skills and knowledge of best practices to each


	Board and its committees.



	Brian T. Zino

	.  Mr. Zino's extensive mutual fund, financial and business background and years of service as a


	director of a large non-affiliated family of both open- and closed-end funds bring valuable skills and business judgment


	to each Board and its committees.



	EACH FUND'S BOARD, INCLUDING THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, RECOMMEND THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH DIRECTOR NOMINEE.

	The information as to beneficial ownership is based on statements furnished to each Fund by its continuing

	Directors. Except as otherwise indicated, each person has sole voting and investment power with respect to the


	shares owned by him.







	**




	The term, "Family of Registered Investment Companies", means any two or more registered investment companies

	that share the same investment adviser or principal underwriter or hold themselves out to investors as related


	companies for purposes of investment and investor services.






	As of April 18, 2016, the continuing Directors and Officers of the Funds, as a group, beneficially owned less than 1% of the outstanding shares of each Fund.


	Committees of the Boards


	Audit Committee


	Each Fund's Board has appointed a standing Audit Committee and adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee. Each Fund's Audit Committee Charter is available on the Adviser's website:


	ZF Audit Committee Charter:


	http:/​/​www.virtus.com/​vSiteManager/​Upload/​Docs/​ClosedEndFunds/​ZF/​Governance/​ZF_​Audit_​Committee_​Charter.pdf


	ZTR Audit Committee Charter:


	http:/​/​www.virtus.com/​vSiteManager/​Upload/​Docs/​ClosedEndFunds/​ZTR/​Governance/​ZTR_​Audit_​Committee_​Charter.pdf


	Messrs. Rogers, Ruddy, Walton, Wright and Zino, each of whom is an Independent Director under the 1940 Act and New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") regulations, currently serve as members of each Fund's Audit Committee. Mr. Zino is the Chair of the Audit Committees.


	The purposes of each Board's Audit Committee are set forth in the Audit Committee Charter. In brief, the role of each Board's Audit Committee is to assist the Board in its oversight of the respective Fund's financial reporting process, including internal controls and the performance of the independent registered public accounting firm. As set forth in the Charter of each Board's Audit Committee, it is not the responsibility of the Audit Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that each Fund's financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with generally
















	8


























	accepted accounting principles, which duties are the responsibility of the Adviser and each Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. The independent registered public accounting firm for each Fund is responsible for auditing that Fund's financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 


	In the performance of its oversight function, each Audit Committee has considered and discussed the audited financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm of the Fund. Each Audit Committee also has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Public Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standards No. 16, "Communications With Audit Committees," as currently in effect. Each Audit Committee also has considered whether the provision by the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm of non-audit services to the Fund, and of professional services to the Adviser and affiliates of the Adviser that provide services to the Fund, is compatible with maintaining the independent registered public accounting firm's independence.  Finally, each Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the independence of that independent registered public accounting firm. 


	The members of each Audit Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not experts in the fields of accounting or auditing or evaluating auditor independence.  The Board of each Fund has determined that Brian T. Zino is an "audit committee financial expert," as defined under SEC Regulation S-K, Item 407(d)(5). The SEC has stated that the designation or identification of a person as an audit committee financial expert does not impose on such person any duties, obligations or liability that are greater than the duties, obligations and liability imposed on such person as a member of the Fund's audit committee and board of directors in the absence of such designation or identification. Each Audit Committee is in compliance with the NYSE requirements applicable to closed-end fund audit committees, including the requirement that all members of the audit committee be "financially literate" and that at least one member of the audit committee have "accounting or related financial management expertise," as determined by the Board. Members of each Audit Committee rely without independent verification on the information provided to them and on the representations made by management and the independent registered public accounting firm. Accordingly, each Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or appropriate internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, each Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not assure that the audit of the Fund's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or that the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm is in fact "independent." 


	Nominating Committee


	Each Fund’s Board has adopted a written charter for its Nominating Committee. Each Fund’s Nominating Committee Charter is available on the Adviser’s website at https:/​/​www.virtus.com/​vSiteManager/​Upload/​Docs/​ClosedEndFunds/​Nominating_​Committee_​Charter.pdf.


	Messrs. Rogers, Ruddy, Walton, Wright and Zino, each of whom is an Independent Director, currently serve as members of each Fund's Nominating Committee. Each Nominating Committee considers candidates for election to fill vacancies on the respective Fund’s Board.


	Among other responsibilities, the purpose of the Nominating Committees is to identify individuals qualified to become Board members and to recommend that the Board select particular director nominees. The Nominating Committees will consider nominees recommended by a shareholder if such recommendation is in writing and received by the Funds by the deadline specified below under “Additional Information: Proposals for the 2017 Annual Meeting,” is accompanied by a biography of the recommended candidate and otherwise complies with the requirements for such proposals contained in each Fund’s Amended and Restated By-Laws.  Any such recommendations should be submitted in writing to the principal executive office of the Funds, located at 101 Munson Street, Greenfield, MA 01301-9683, to the attention of the Secretary of the Fund.


	It is expected that all candidates for the Boards will possess the following minimum qualifications: (i) unquestioned personal integrity; (ii) sound business judgment; and (iii) the commitment required to be an effective director, including, without limitation, the ability to attend meetings regularly. The Nominating Committees take into consideration such other factors as they deem appropriate. Except as provided above, in nominating candidates, each Nominating Committee does not believe that certain qualifications are controlling or paramount or that specific qualifications or skills
















	9


























	are necessary for a candidate to possess. Pursuant to policies and procedures contained in the Nominating Committee Charter, when assessing the qualifications of a potential nominee or Independent Director, the Nominating Committees consider such factors as it may deem relevant, including whether the candidate’s background, skills and experience will complement the background, skills and experience of other nominees and contribute to the diversity of the Boards. These policies and procedures for identifying and evaluating candidates are implemented through discussion among the Nominating Committee members. Each Nominating Committee may determine that a candidate who does not have all the qualifications referred to above should nevertheless be considered as a nominee if the Nominating Committee finds that the candidate’s qualifications, taken as a whole, demonstrate an equivalent level of qualification to serve as a director. Each Fund has adopted a policy requiring that any person whose 75th birthday would occur during such person’s term of service as a Director may not stand for election for such term; provided, however, that the Directors in office as of September 1, 2011 shall not be required to retire pursuant to the foregoing policy and shall be eligible to be nominated for election as a Director for one or more additional terms so long as the Director’s 85th birthday is not to occur during any such additional term. In assessing the effectiveness of the Nominating Committee Charter, each Nominating Committee shall recommend to its Fund’s Board any revisions or modifications to the Nominating Committee Charter that the Committee deems necessary or appropriate to the effective exercise of its responsibilities. 


	Meetings of the Boards of Directors and Standing Committees


	Each Fund’s Board held 6 meetings during the year ended December 31, 2015. Each Fund’s Nominating Committee held 1 meeting during the year ended December 31, 2015, and met on March 3, 2016, at which time each Nominating Committee recommended that each Board nominate the individuals set forth in this proxy statement to stand for election to the Board. Each Fund’s Audit Committee held 5 meetings during the year ended December 31, 2015. All of the Directors attended at least 75% of the total number of Board meetings, and his respective committee meetings, held during the year ended December 31, 2015.


	The Boards' Role in Risk Oversight


	Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational and valuation risks, among others. Risk oversight forms part of each Board’s general oversight responsibilities and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. Day-to-day risk management functions are subsumed within the responsibilities of the Adviser and other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), who carry out the Funds’ investment management and business affairs. Each of the Adviser and other service providers have their own, independent interest in risk management, and their policies and methods of risk management will depend on their functions, business model and compliance structure.  As a result, the Boards recognize that it is not possible to identify all of the risks that may affect the Funds or to develop processes and controls to eliminate or mitigate the occurrence or effects of all of such risks. As part of its regular oversight of the Funds, the Boards, directly or through a committee, interact with and review reports from, among others, the Adviser (and its officers and employees), each Fund’s Chief Compliance Officer, and the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm, as appropriate, regarding the risks faced by the Fund and applicable risk functions. The Boards may, at any time and in its discretion, change the manner in which it conducts risk oversight.


	The Boards' Leadership Structure


	George R. Aylward, an "interested person" of each Fund, serves as each Fund’s Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President. Each Board believes that Mr. Aylward’s combined role as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President promotes unified leadership and direction for each Fund’s Board and executive management and allows for a single, clear focus for the chain of command to execute each Fund’s initiatives and plans.


	The Independent Directors have designated a Lead Independent Director of each Fund, R. Keith Walton. The Lead Independent Director's role is defined as follows:



	•




	Chair meetings or executive sessions of the Independent Directors;






	•




	Review and comment on each Board’s meeting agendas;






	•




	Represent the views of the Independent Directors to management; and






	•




	Facilitate communication among the Independent Directors and their counsel.





	As noted, each Board has established a Nominating Committee and an Audit Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of each Fund, and from time to time may establish informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of each Fund with respect to certain specified matters.
















	10


























	The Board of each Fund has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate, in light of the specific characteristics and circumstances of each Fund, including, but not limited to: (i) all of the directors, except the Chairman, are independent; (ii) the business operations of the Fund are overseen by experienced Independent Directors, with a Lead Independent Director and separate committee chairmen; (iii) Mr. Aylward serves in the combined role as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, promoting unified leadership and direction for each Fund’s Board and executive management; (iv) the Lead Independent Director helps ensure timely communication between management and the Independent Directors and among the Independent Directors; (v) the effective balance between management and Independent Director participation in the Board process; and (vi) the allocation of areas of responsibility among committees of each Board’s members and the full Board.


	Shareholder Communications


	Any shareholder wishing to communicate with the Boards or a specific Director may do so by submitting correspondence in writing to the principal executive office of the Funds, located at 101 Munson Street, Greenfield, MA 01301-9683, specifying the intended addressee. Shareholder communications addressed to the Boards will be forwarded promptly after receipt to George R. Aylward, President of the Funds. Mr. Aylward will review each such communication in order to determine whether the communication should be relayed directly to each Board member. Shareholder communications that Mr. Aylward determines to involve routine matters will be forwarded to Virtus Fund Services, LLC (the "Administrator or "Virtus Fund Services") and/or officers of the Funds for review and response, and Mr. Aylward will report to the full Board, as appropriate, on the nature and substance of such communications. Shareholder communications that Mr. Aylward determines involve non-routine matters will be forwarded to each member of the Board for review. Shareholder communications addressed to a specific Director will be forwarded to the addressee promptly upon receipt.


	It is the Funds’ policy that all Directors attend the Joint Annual Meeting, if reasonably possible. All of the Directors attended the Joint Annual Meeting of ZF and ZTR in 2015.

	ADMINISTRATOR


	Virtus Fund Services, serves as the administrator of ZF and ZTR. The Administrator’s principal business office is located at 100 Pearl Street, Hartford, CT 06103. All of the Administrator’s outstanding equity interests are owned by Virtus. Virtus Fund Services became the administrator of ZF and ZTR on January 1, 2013, as assignee of VP
















	11


























	Distributors, LLC (“VP Distributors”), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Virtus. Virtus Fund Services was established to carry on the fund administration business previously conducted by VP Distributors, which now conducts exclusively a broker-dealer and fund distribution business. In addition, Virtus Fund Services utilizes the same personnel and systems previously used by VP Distributors to perform administrative services for ZF and ZTR, and the administration fee remains the same.


	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance


	Section 16(a)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and Section 30(h)of the 1940 Act require, among other persons, the officers and Directors of the Funds and the Adviser to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of the shares of common stock of the Funds with the SEC and the NYSE. The SEC’s regulations also require such reporting persons to furnish each Fund with copies of all Section 16(a)forms they file. Based on its review of these reports and on representations from the reporting persons that no other reports were required, each Fund believes that during the year ended December 31, 2015, such reporting persons were in compliance with all Section 16(a) and Section 30(h) reporting requirements applicable to them.


	Audit Committee Report


	In connection with the audit of each Fund’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the Audit Committees: (1) reviewed and discussed each Fund’s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 with management, (2) discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 16, (3) received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm communications with the Audit Committees concerning independence, and (4) discussed with the independent accountant its independence. Based on the foregoing reviews and discussions, the Audit Committees recommended to the Boards that each Fund’s audited financial statements be included in each Fund’s Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2015.

	SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	The 1940 Act requires that each Fund’s independent registered public accounting firm be selected by a majority of the Independent Directors of the Fund. One of the purposes of each Fund’s Audit Committee is to recommend to the Fund’s Board the appointment, retention, evaluation and termination of the independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund. At a joint meeting held on March 3, 2016, each Fund’s Audit Committee recommended and each Fund’s Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors, approved the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) as each Fund’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. PwC also served as the Funds’ independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. A representative of PwC is expected to be present at the Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement, if he or she so desires, and to respond to questions from shareholders.

	Aggregate Non-Audit Fees Billed to Funds and Their Affiliates


	The aggregate non-audit fees billed by PwC for services rendered to the Funds, the Adviser, and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Funds for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 were $430,462 and $550,983, respectively. 


	Each Audit Committee considered whether the non-audit services rendered to the Adviser or an affiliate of the Adviser that provides ongoing services to either Fund were compatible with maintaining the independence of PwC. The Audit Committees pre-approve: (i) all audit and non-audit services to be rendered to the respective Fund by PwC; and (ii) all non-audit services relating to the operations and financial reporting of the respective Fund provided by PwC to the Adviser or any affiliate thereof that provides ongoing services to the respective Fund (collectively, “Covered Services”). Each Audit Committee has adopted pre-approval procedures authorizing a member of the Audit Committee to pre-approve from time to time, on behalf of the Audit Committee, all Covered Services to be provided by PwC which are not otherwise pre-approved at a meeting of the Audit Committee, provided that such delegate reports to the full Audit Committee at its next meeting. The pre-approval procedures do not include delegation of the Audit Committee’s responsibilities to management. All Covered Services were pre-approved in accordance with the above procedures. Pre-approval has not been waived with respect to any of the services described above since the date on which the Audit Committee adopted its current pre-approval procedures.


	Principal Shareholders


	To the best of each Fund’s knowledge, no person beneficially owns more than five percent of the outstanding shares of that Fund’s common stock, other than as listed in the below table. This information is based on publicly available Schedule 13D and 13G disclosures filed with the SEC.

	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION


	Other Matters


	The Boards of the Funds know of no matters to be presented at the meeting other than those specified in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting. However, if any other matter is properly presented before the Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies to vote in accordance with their best judgment.


	Expenses


	The Funds will bear the expense of the Meeting, including preparation, printing and mailing of the enclosed form of proxy and accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting and this Proxy Statement. Each Fund will bear one half of such expenses, except for mailing expenses, which are paid by each Fund based on its actual expenses of mailing to its shareholders, and its own respective legal expenses. Each Fund, upon request, will reimburse banks, brokers and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding proxy solicitation material to the beneficial owners of that Fund’s common stock. In order to obtain the necessary quorum at the Meeting, supplementary solicitation may be made by mail, telephone or personal interviews by officers or employees of the Funds and/or Adviser, or their affiliates. 


	Quorum and Vote Required


	The following principles of Maryland law and the 1940 Act apply to the voting of shares of common stock at the Meeting.


	The presence in person or by proxy of shareholders entitled to vote a majority of the outstanding shares will constitute a quorum. Shares represented by proxy or in person at the Meeting, including shares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions and broker non-votes (hereinafter defined), will be counted as present in the determination of a quorum. 


	The vote required for Proposal 1, the election of Directors for each Fund, requires a plurality of the votes cast at the Meeting by the shareholders of such Fund. Each whole share shall be entitled to one vote and each fractional share shall be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote.


	Abstentions and “broker non-votes” (i.e., where a broker or nominee submits a proxy specifically indicating the lack of discretionary authority to vote on a matter) are considered shares present or represented by a proxy at the meeting but do not constitute votes cast. Because Proposal 1 requires a plurality of only the votes actually cast, abstentions and broker non-votes have no effect on the voting outcome of the proposal. It is anticipated that votes will be tabulated by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the Funds’ transfer agent.
















	14


























	Adjournments and Postponements


	The Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Funds authorize the Chairman of the Meeting, in his or her discretion, to adjourn or postpone the Meeting to a later date (whether or not a quorum is present) without notice other than announcement at the Meeting for such purposes as the Chairman shall deem appropriate, including further solicitation of proxies. In the absence of a quorum, the Chairman may adjourn the Meeting to a later date. Adjournments or postponements may occur in order to defer action on any Proposal. The Meeting may be adjourned up to 120 days after the record date without further notice other than announcement at the Meeting. If the Meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the original record date upon at least 10 days’ notice, a new record date must be established for voting at such adjourned Meeting, and any unrevoked proxies submitted by any shareholder of record as of the original record date, with respect to shares that such shareholder continues to hold of record on the new record date, may be voted at the adjourned Meeting and any subsequent adjourned Meeting, provided that any adjourned Meeting is not more than 120 days after the new record date. At any adjourned Meeting at which a quorum is present, any action may be taken that could have been taken at the Meeting originally called.


	No Dissenters’ Rights


	Shareholders have no rights under Maryland law or each Fund’s Articles of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated Bylaws to exercise dissenters’ rights of appraisal with respect to any of the matters to be voted upon at the Meeting.


	Proposals for the 2017 Annual Meeting


	Each Fund’s Amended and Restated Bylaws contains an advance notice provision, which requires that the respective Fund be given advance notice of shareholder nominations for election to the Board and of other matters which shareholders wish to present for action at an annual meeting of shareholders, other than matters included in that Fund’s proxy statement in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Any notice of shareholder nominations for election to a Fund’s Board or notice of other matters not submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 which shareholders wish to present at the Funds’ 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must be received at such Fund’s principal executive office not earlier than November 30, 2016 nor later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 30, 2016; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year’s annual meeting, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 150th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the later of the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. 


	The notice by the shareholder must also set forth specific information, and provide certain representations, the details of which are set forth in the respective Fund’s Amended and Restated Bylaws. Any shareholder proposal must also comply with all other legal requirements in order to be included in the Fund’s proxy statement and form of proxy for that meeting. A copy of each Fund's Bylaws is available on the website of the SEC at http:/​/​www.sec.gov.

PROXY STATEMENTANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERSMAY 9, 2007
This Joint Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Boards of Directors of The Zweig Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("ZF"), and The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("ZTR"), for use at the Joint Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held at 575 Madison Avenue (between 56th and 57th Streets), 11th Floor, New York, New York, on Wednesday, May 9, 2007 at 10:00 a.m., and at any and all adjournments or postponements thereof (the "Meeting"), for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting dated April 3, 2007.
The Meeting is scheduled as a joint meeting of the respective shareholders of ZF and ZTR (the "Funds") because the shareholders of both Funds are expected to consider and vote on a similar proposal with respect to the election of Directors. The Boards of Directors of the Funds have determined that the use of a joint proxy statement for the Meeting is in the best interest of the shareholders of both Funds. In the event that any shareholder of a Fund present at the Meeting objects to the holding of a joint meeting and moves for adjournment of such Fund's meeting to immediately after the Meeting, so that such Fund's meeting may be held separately, the persons named as proxies will vote in favor of such adjournment. Shareholders of each Fund will vote separately on each of the proposals relating to their respective Fund, and an unfavorable vote on a proposal by the shareholders of one Fund will not
affect the implementation by the other Fund of such proposal if the shareholders of such other Fund approve the proposal.
If the accompanying form of proxy is properly executed and returned in time to be voted at the Meeting, the shares will be voted in accordance with the instructions marked by the shareholder. Executed ZF proxies that are unmarked will be voted for the election of the two nominees of the ZF Board of Directors as Directors of ZF and in favor of the proposed amendment to ZF's Articles of Incorporation. Executed ZTR proxies that are unmarked will be voted for the election of the two nominees of the ZTR 
1


Board of Directors as Directors of ZTR. A shareholder can revoke the proxy prior to its use by appearing at the Meeting and voting in person, by giving written notice of such revocation to the Secretary of the respective Fund, or by returning a subsequently dated proxy.
The Board of Directors of each Fund has fixed the close of business on March 14, 2007 as the record date for the determination of shareholders of that Fund entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting. This Proxy Statement and the accompanying form of proxy will be first sent to shareholders on or about April 3, 2007.
As of the record date, 72,233,013 shares of ZF's common stock were outstanding, and 93,448,955 shares of ZTR's common stock were outstanding. To the best of each Fund's knowledge, no person beneficially owns more than five percent of the outstanding shares of that Fund's common stock.
The Annual Report of each Fund for the year ended December 31, 2006, including financial statements, has been mailed to shareholders of record of that Fund at the close of business on that date, and to persons who became shareholders of record between that time and the close of business on March 14, 2007.
Each Fund will furnish, without charge, a copy of the Fund's December 31, 2006 Annual Report to any shareholder who requests it by contacting the Fund's Administrator, Phoenix Equity Planning Corporation, 56 Prospect Street, P.O. Box 150480, Hartford, Connecticut 06115-0480, Attention: Shareholder Services; Toll-free telephone number 1-800-272-2700.
PROPOSAL 1ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The members of the Board of Directors of ZF and ZTR are divided into three classes, with the term of office of one class expiring each year. At the forthcoming Annual Meeting, two ZF and two ZTR Directors will be elected to serve a three-year term (until the third succeeding Annual Meeting in 2010 and until their successors are elected and duly qualify). Unless authority to vote for the election of Directors is withheld, the enclosed proxy will be voted for the election of the nominees named below, who have indicated their intention to serve if elected. While management has no reason to believe that the nominees will not be available as candidates, should such a situation arise, proxies may be voted for the election of such other persons as a Director as the holders of the proxies may, in their discretion, determine.
Each Fund's Board of Directors has appointed a Nominating Committee which makes annual recommendations as to the individuals to 
2


be nominated by the Fund's Board of Directors for election as Directors at the forthcoming Annual Meeting and selects candidates for election by the Board of Directors to fill any vacancies in the Board of Directors, including those resulting from an increase in the number of Directors. Each Fund's Nominating Committee consists of three Directors who are not "interested persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act")) of the Fund, Phoenix/Zweig Advisers LLC, the Funds' investment adviser (the "Adviser") or Zweig Consulting LLC (the "Sub-Adviser").
Based on the recommendations made by ZF's Nominating Committee at its meeting held on February 20, 2007, the Board of Directors of ZF has nominated George R. Aylward and Alden C. Olson, who are presently Directors of ZF, for re-election to the ZF Board, to serve until the third succeeding Annual Meeting in 2010 and until their successors are elected and duly qualify. Based on the recommendations made by ZTR's Nominating Committee at its meeting held on February 20, 2007, the Board of Directors of ZTR has nominated George R. Aylward and Alden C. Olson, who are presently Directors of ZTR, for re-election to the ZTR Board, to serve until the third succeeding Annual Meeting in 2010 and until their successors are elected and duly qualify.

Aylward whose ownership is as of March 14, 2007. Except as otherwise indicated, each person has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares owned by him or her. The Directors and officers of the Funds, as a group, beneficially own less than 1% of the outstanding shares of each Fund.
Committees and Board of Directors' Meetings
Audit Committee Report
Each Fund's Board of Directors has appointed a standing Audit Committee. Each Fund has adopted a written charter for the Fund's Audit Committee which is attached hereto as Exhibit A. The purposes of each Fund's Audit Committee are set forth in the Audit Committee Charter. In brief, the role of each Fund's Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its oversight of the respective Fund's financial reporting process. As set forth in the Charter of each Fund's Audit Committee, management of each Fund is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Fund's financial statements, the Fund's accounting 
9


and financial reporting principles and internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The independent registered public accounting firm for each Fund is responsible for auditing that Fund's financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee of each Fund has considered and discussed the audited financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm of the Fund. Each Audit Committee also has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, "Communication with Audit Committees," as currently in effect. Each Audit Committee also has considered whether the provision by the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm of non-audit services to the Fund, and of professional services to the Adviser and affiliates of the Adviser that provide services to the Fund, is compatible with maintaining the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. Finally, each Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter
from the independent registered public accounting firm required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1, "Independence Discussions with Audit Committees," and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the independence of that independent registered public accounting firm.
The members of each Fund's Audit Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not experts in the fields of accounting or auditing or evaluating auditor independence. The Board of Directors of each Fund has determined that the Fund does not have an "audit committee financial expert," as defined under Regulation S-K, Item 407(d), at this time because none of the Fund's Directors meets the New York Stock Exchange definition of such an expert set forth in Regulation S-K. Each Audit Committee of the Board is in compliance with applicable rules of the listing requirements for closed-end fund audit committees, including the requirement that all members of the audit committee be "financially literate" and that at least one member of the audit committee have "accounting or related financial management expertise," as determined by the Board. Members
of each Fund's Audit Committee rely without independent verification on the information provided to them and on the representations made by management and the independent registered public accounting firm. Accordingly, each Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or appropriate internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable 
10


laws and regulations. Furthermore, each Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not assure that the audit of the Fund's financial statements have been carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or that the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm is in fact "independent."
Based upon the reports and discussions described in this report, and subject to the limitations on the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committees referred to above and in the Audit Committee Charters, each Audit Committee recommended to its Board of Directors that the audited financial statements of the Fund be included in the Fund's annual report to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2006. The members of each Audit Committee, Messrs. Brunie, Olson, Rogers and Walton and Ms. Luscombe, are "independent" within the meaning of the Act and the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards for audit committees applicable to closed-end funds.
Alden C. OlsonCharles H. BrunieWendy LuscombeJames B. Rogers, Jr.R. Keith Walton
Nominating Committee
Messrs. Brunie, Olson and Rogers, each of whom is not an interested person of the Funds, are members of each Nominating Committee of the Boards of Directors of the Funds. Each Fund's Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Fund's Nominating Committee, which is attached hereto as Exhibit B. Each Fund's Nominating Committee considers candidates for election to fill vacancies on the Fund's Board of Directors.
Director nominees are identified based on persons known to the Boards of Directors or the Nominating Committees and any persons recommended to the Nominating Committees by shareholders or industry sources. Any recommendations made by shareholders and industry sources must be accompanied by a biography of the recommended candidate and should be submitted in writing to the principal executive office of the Funds, located at 900 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022, addressed to the Secretary of the Funds. For more information, see "Additional Information: Proposals for 2008 Meeting."
Nominees are evaluated based on the criteria described below. The evaluation process does not depend on the source of the recommendation. It is expected that all candidates for the Board will possess the following 
11


minimum qualifications: (i) unquestioned personal integrity; (ii) sound business judgment; and (iii) the commitment required to be an effective director, including, without limitation, the ability to attend meetings regularly. Each Nominating Committee may determine that a candidate who does not have the experience or knowledge referred to above should nevertheless be considered as a nominee if the Nominating Committee finds that the candidate's qualifications, taken as a whole, demonstrate an equivalent level of qualification to serve as a director.
Board of Directors' and Standing Committees' Meetings
Each Fund's Board of Directors held six meetings during the year ended December 31, 2006. Each Fund's Nominating Committee held one meeting during the year ended December 31, 2006 and met on February 20, 2007, at which time each Nominating Committee recommended the nominees for election to the Board. Each Fund's Audit Committee held four meetings during the year ended December 31, 2006. All of the Directors, other than Mr. Brunie, attended at least 75% of the total number of Board meetings, and his or her respective committee meetings, held during the year ended December 31, 2006.
Shareholders Communications
Any shareholder that wishes to communicate with the Boards of Directors or a specific Director may do so by submitting correspondence in writing to the principal executive office of the Funds, located at 900 Third Avenue, New York, New York 10022, specifying the intended addressee. Shareholder communications addressed to the Boards of Directors will be forwarded promptly after receipt to George R. Aylward, President of the Funds, for review. Mr. Aylward will review each such communication in order to determine whether the communication should be relayed directly to each Board member. Shareholder communications that Mr. Aylward determines
involve routine matters will be forwarded to the Funds' Administrator and/or officers of the Funds for review and response, and Mr. Aylward will report to the full Board, as appropriate, on the nature and substance of such communications. Shareholder communications that Mr. Aylward determines involve non-routine matters will be forwarded to each member of the Board for review. Shareholder communications addressed to a specific Director will be forwarded to the addressee promptly upon receipt.
It is the Funds' policy that all Directors attend the annual shareholders meeting, if reasonably possible. All of the directors attended the joint annual meeting of ZF and ZTR in 2006.
The Boards of Directors of ZF and ZTR recommend that shareholders vote FOR the re-election of the nominees.

PROPOSAL 2TO APPROVE AN AMENDMENT TO ZF'S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO PERMIT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FROM TIME TO TIME TO INCREASE OR DECREASE THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF ZF
At a meeting held on February 20, 2007, ZF's Board of Directors considered and approved a proposed amendment to ZF's Articles of Incorporation (the "Articles") authorizing the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, to amend the Articles from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of common stock of ZF, and recommended the submission of the amendment to the Articles (the "Amendment") to shareholders for their approval. The affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the shareholders of ZF is required to approve the Amendment. If the Amendment is approved by ZF's shareholders, the Articles will be amended by adding a new sentence to the end of paragraph (1) of Article V of the Articles. Article V, paragraph (1) would be restated as follows:
"(1) The total number of shares of capital stock that the Corporation shall have authority to issue is One Hundred Million (100,000,000) shares, of the par value of ten cents ($.10) per share and of the aggregate par value of Ten Million dollars ($10,000,000), all of which One Hundred Million (100,000,000) shares are designated Common Stock. The Board of Directors, with the approval of a majority of the entire Board, and without action by the stockholders, may amend the charter of the Corporation to increase or decrease, from time to time, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that the Corporation has authority to issue."
In approving the proposed Amendment, the Board of Directors considered the expressed concern of Phoenix/Zweig Advisers LLC (the "Adviser") that in certain circumstances a change in the number of ZF's authorized shares of common stock may be necessary or desirable (e.g., in order to issue shares under ZF's Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan or to issue shares in the event of a rights offering) but that since currently the Articles could not be amended to increase or decrease the authorized shares of common stock without shareholder approval, this could result in delays that are not consistent with the best interests of shareholders. In addition, satisfying the requirement for shareholder approval could involve the significant expense of a special meeting of shareholders, including the costs of preparing, printing and mailing proxy materials to shareholders.
ZF has one class of common stock, par value $.10 per share, of which 100,000,000 shares are authorized and 73,233,013 shares are outstanding.
13


If the shareholders of ZF approve the Amendment, the Board of Directors may cause the issuance of additional shares of common stock of ZF without further action by the shareholders, unless shareholder approval is required by applicable law or by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or any other exchange upon which ZF's stock is then listed. If this Proposal is approved by shareholders, any increase or decrease in the number of ZF's authorized shares of common stock will be determined by ZF's Board of Directors.
ZF'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS OF ZF VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT TO ZF'S ARTICLES TO AUTHORIZE THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO AMEND THE ARTICLES FROM TIME TO TIME TO INCREASE OR DECREASE THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF ZF.

Directors of the Funds and the Adviser to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of the shares of common stock of the Funds with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange. The Securities and Exchange Commission's regulations also require such reporting persons to furnish each Fund with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based on its review of these reports and on written representations from the reporting persons that no other reports were required, each Fund believes that, during the year ended December 31, 2006, such reporting persons were in compliance with all Section 16(a) and Section 30(h) reporting requirements applicable to them.

A representative of PwC is expected to be present at the Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she so desires and to respond to questions from shareholders.
The aggregate fees billed for services rendered by PwC during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively, are described below.

Aggregate Non-Audit Fees
The aggregate non-audit fees billed by PwC for services rendered to the Funds, the Adviser, and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Funds for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 were $15,623 and $13,863, respectively.
Each Audit Committee considered whether the services described above, including all non-audit services rendered to the respective Fund, the Adviser or an affiliate of the Adviser that provides ongoing services to either Fund, were compatible with maintaining the independence of PwC. The Audit Committees pre-approve: (i) all audit and non-audit services to be rendered to the respective Fund by PwC; and (ii) all non-audit services relating to the operations and financial reporting of the respective Fund provided by PwC to the Adviser or any affiliate thereof that provides ongoing services to the respective Fund (collectively, "Covered Services"). Each Audit Committee has adopted pre-approval procedures authorizing a member of the Audit Committee to pre-approve from time to time, on behalf of the Audit Committee, all Covered Services to be provided by PwC which are not otherwise pre-approved at a meeting
of the Audit Committee, provided that such delegate reports to the full Audit Committee at its next meeting. The pre-approval procedures do not include delegation of the Audit Committee's responsibilities to management. Pre-approval has not been waived with respect to any of the services described above since the date on which the Audit Committee adopted its current pre-approval procedures.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Other Matters
The Boards of Directors of the Funds know of no matters to be presented at the Meeting other than those specified in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting. However, if any other matter is properly 
16


presented before the Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies to vote in accordance with their best judgment.
Expenses
The Funds will bear the expense of the Meeting, including preparation, printing and mailing of the enclosed form of proxy and accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting and this Proxy Statement. Each Fund will bear one half of such expenses. Each Fund, upon request, will reimburse banks, brokers and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding proxy solicitation material to the beneficial owners of that Fund's common stock. In order to obtain the necessary quorum at the Meeting, supplementary solicitation may be made by mail, telephone or personal interviews by officers or employees of the Funds and/or Adviser, or their affiliates.
Vote Required
The election of Directors for each Fund requires a plurality of the votes cast at the Meeting by the shareholders of such Fund. The affirmative vote of two-thirds of ZF's outstanding shares is required to approve the Amendment to ZF's Articles of Incorporation. The following principles of Maryland law apply to the voting of shares of common stock at the Meeting. The presence in person or by proxy of shareholders entitled to vote a majority of the outstanding shares will constitute a quorum. Shares represented by proxy or in person at the Meeting, including shares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions and broker non-votes (hereinafter defined), will be counted as present in the determination of a quorum. With respect to the election of directors, an abstention does not constitute a vote "for" or "against" and will be disregarded in calculating the votes cast as to such matter, and
"broker non-votes" (i.e., where a broker or nominee submits a proxy specifically indicating the lack of discretionary authority to vote on a matter) will be treated in the same manner as abstentions. With respect to the Amendment to ZF's Articles, the adoption of which requires the two-thirds affirmative vote of ZF's outstanding shares, an abstention or "broker non-vote" will have the effect of a vote "against" the matter. It is anticipated that votes will be tabulated by Computershare Trust Company, NA, the Funds' transfer agent.
Proposals for 2008 Meeting
Each Fund's Amended and Restated Bylaws contains an advance notice provision, which requires that the respective Fund be given advance notice of shareholder nominations for election to the Board of Directors and of other matters which shareholders wish to present for action at an annual meeting of shareholders, other than matters included in that Fund's proxy statement in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Any notice of shareholder nominations for election to the Board of Directors or notice of other matters which 
17


shareholders wish to present at the ZF or ZTR 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must be received at such Fund's principal executive offices not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days before the date in the then current year corresponding to the date on which such Fund first mailed its proxy materials for the annual meeting held in the prior year; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting for such Fund is advanced by more than thirty (30) days or delayed by more than sixty (60) days from the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by such shareholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the
day on which notice or public announcement of the date of such meeting was given or made.
The notice by the shareholder must also set forth specific information, and provide certain representations, the details of which are set forth in the respective Fund's Amended and Restated Bylaws. Any shareholder proposal must also comply with all other legal requirements in order to be included in the Fund's proxy statement and form of proxy for that meeting. A copy of ZF's By-Laws is available on the SEC's Web site at http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/812090/000088731804000088/zfbylaws.txt. A copy of ZTR's By-Laws is available on the SEC's Web site at http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/836412/000088731804000089/ztrbylaws.txt.
The persons named as proxies for the Funds' 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will, with respect to the proxies in effect at such meeting, have discretionary authority to vote on any matter presented by a shareholder for action at that meeting unless the respective Fund receives notice of the matter by not less than ninety (90) days before the date in the then current year corresponding to the date on which such Fund first mailed its proxy materials for the annual meeting held in the prior year. If the respective Fund receives such timely notice, these persons will not have this authority except as provided in the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

EXHIBIT B
THE ZWEIG FUND, INC.THE ZWEIG TOTAL RETURN FUND, INC.NOMINATING COMMITTEE CHARTER
Purpose
The purposes of the Committee are to identify individuals qualified to become Board members and to recommend that the Board select particular director nominees.
Committee Composition
The Committee shall be composed of three (3) or more members of the Board of Directors of the Fund, each of whom shall be an Independent Director and not an interested person (as such term is defined by section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")). The Board shall select the members of the Committee. Other directors of the Fund, while not serving as members of the Committee, nonetheless may have a role in the nominating process by identifying and recommending potential candidates to the Committee for its consideration, and by otherwise assisting the Committee in the discharge of its responsibilities.
Board Nominations
1.  The Committee shall recommend to the Board director nominees for election at the Stockholders' annual meeting. Additionally, in the event of any vacancies on or additions to the Board, the Committee shall evaluate the qualifications of candidates and make nominations for membership on the Board. The Committee may also recommend that a vacancy in the membership of the Board not be filled based on the then current Board's size, composition and structure. In carrying out its responsibilities under this paragraph, the Committee shall have sole authority to retain and terminate any search firm to be used to identify director candidates, including sole authority to approve the search firm's fees and other retention terms.
2.  Persons nominated as Independent Directors may not be "interested persons" of the Fund as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. With respect to such nominees, the Committee shall carefully evaluate their independence from any investment adviser or other principal service provider to the Fund. The Committee shall also consider the effect of any relationships beyond those delineated in the 1940 Act that might impair the independence of a prospective Independent Director.
B-1


3.  In assessing the qualifications of a potential candidate for Independent Director membership on the Board, the Committee shall consider such other factors, as it may deem relevant.
Committee Nominations
1.  The Committee shall review and make recommendations from time to time to the Board regarding the nature and duties of Board committees, including: (i) committee member qualifications; (ii) committee member appointment, removal or replacement in the event of a vacancy; (iii) committee structure and operations (including authority to delegate to subcommittees); and (iv) committee reporting to the Board.
2.  The Committee shall make recommendations to the Board concerning the responsibilities or establishment of Board committees.
Other Powers and Responsibilities
1.  The Committee shall meet as necessary in connection with any vacancy on or addition to the Board and otherwise from time to time as it deems appropriate to perform its responsibilities.
3.  The Committee shall have the resources and authority appropriate to discharge its responsibilities. It shall consult with counsel to the Fund concerning the requirements of the 1940 Act applicable to the selection and qualification of Independent Directors.
3.  The Committee shall recommend to the Board any revisions or modifications to this Charter that the Committee deems necessary or appropriate to the effective exercise of its responsibilities.
4.  The Committee shall prepare and maintain minutes of the resolutions adopted at all meetings and provide copies thereof to the Board within a reasonable period of time following each meeting.

FUND DISTRIBUTIONS AND MANAGED DISTRIBUTION PLAN



The Fund has a Managed Distribution Plan to pay 10% of the Fund's net asset
value on an annualized basis. Distributions may represent earnings from net
investment income, realized capital gains, or, if necessary, return of capital.
The board believes that regular quarterly, fixed cash payouts will enhance
shareholder value and serve the long-term interests of shareholders. You should
not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the
amount of the distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Managed
Distribution Plan.


The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net
realized capital gains in the fiscal year to date; therefore, a portion of your
distributions may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for
example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid
back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the
Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with "yield" or
"income".


The amounts and sources of distributions reported in Section 19(a) notices
of the 1940 Act are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting
purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting
purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder
of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The
Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will
tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.


The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Managed Distribution Plan at
any time, without prior notice to shareholders if it deems such action to be in
the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.


Information on the Zweig funds is available at www.Virtus.com. Section 19(a)
notices are posted on the website at:.

DEAR FELLOW ZWEIG FUND SHAREHOLDER:



I am pleased to share with you the manager's report and commentary for the
Zweig Fund, Inc. for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.


The Zweig Fund's net asset value increased 10.40% for the quarter ending
December 31, 2011, including $0.087 in re-invested distributions. During the
same period, the S&P 500 Index gained 11.82%, including re-invested dividends.
The Fund's average equity exposure for the quarter was approximately 84% in
stock and 5% in bonds.


For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, the Fund's net asset value
declined 1.18%, including $0.365 in re-invested distributions. For the same
period, the S&P 500 Index rose 2.11%, including re-invested dividends. The
Fund's average exposure for the year was 79% in equities, and 2% in bonds.


Sincerely,






/s/ George R. Aylward

George R. Aylward
President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The Zweig Fund, Inc.








MARKET OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK



After a tumultuous year that was among the most volatile on record, the
domestic stock markets survived a sluggish U.S. economy, a spreading euro debt
crisis, and a gridlocked Washington to end 2011 virtually where they started.


Propelled by a fourth-quarter boost of 11.9%/(1)/, the blue-chip Dow Jones
Industrial Average closed the year at 12,217.56, an increase of 5.6%/(1)/, the
third consecutive positive year for the Dow. The S&P 500, a broader gauge of
market activity, climbed 11.1%/(1)/ in the final quarter and ended at 1,251.60,
almost dead even with last year's 1,251.64 close. The technical 0.003%/(1)/
difference was its smallest annual move since 1970. The technology heavy Nasdaq
Composite gained 7.8%/(1)/ in the fourth quarter but closed at 2,605.16, down
1.80%/(1)/ for the year.


The lack-luster domestic stock markets still outperformed the major
international markets. The Dow Jones Global Index, excluding the U.S., tumbled
16.3%/(1)/ in 2011 while the STOXX Europe 600 Index fell 11.34%/(1)/. U.K.'s
FTSE 100 Index dipped 5.6%/(1)/; Germany's DAX Index lost 15%/(1)/, its first
annual decline since 2008. France's CAC 40 dropped 17%/(1)/ and Italy's FTSE
MIB Index, down 26%/(1)/, was the biggest loser.


Back home, the Federal Reserve ("Fed") reduced its forecasts for U.S.
economic growth. It predicted that the economy would grow 2.7% in 2012, well
below its June projections of 3.3% to 3.7%. For 2013, the Fed now expects
expansion of 3.2% down from its previous estimates of 3.5% to 4.2%. The Fed
projected a gain of up to 4% in 2014.


/(1)/ Return excludes reinvested dividends.


For information regarding the indexes cited and key investment terms used in
this report see page 6.

The Central Bank also predicts that the U.S. unemployment rate will still be
at least 8.5% at the end of this year, at least 7.8% at the end of 2013 and at
least 6.7% to 7.6% by the fourth quarter of 2014.


There were several bright spots on the economic horizon. For one thing, the
Labor Department reported that the private sector added 200,000 jobs in
December, marking the sixth consecutive month of gains topping 100,000. As a
result, the unemployment rate dipped to 8.5% from November's 8.7%, to its
lowest level in nearly three years.


Another positive note was the report by the Institute of Supply Management
("ISM") that U.S. manufacturing expanded in December at its fastest pace in six
months. ISM's closely watched gauge of factory activity climbed to 53.9 in
December, up from 52.7 in November and its best reading since last June. Scores
over 50 indicate expansion. The trade group also reported that its index of
non-manufacturing or service industries rose to 52.6 in December from 52 in
November, which was the lowest reading in nearly two years.


Housing, a vital factor in the economy, is showing signs of recovery. The
Commerce Department reported that housing starts in November reached 685,000
units, up 9.3% from October and the highest level since April 2010. Building
permits increased 5.7% to an annual rate of 681,000. The agency also reported
that sales of new single-family homes rose 1.8% in November to a
seasonally-adjusted 315,000 units, the highest total in seven months.


The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index spurted 10
points in December to just above the level of a year ago. Consumer spending,
however, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, inched up only
0.1% in November compared with October, according to the Commerce Department.
Spending was restrained because disposable personal income was flat in November
after increasing 0.3% in October.


Indications that inflation is slowing came from the Labor Department report
that its consumer price index was unchanged in November from October. Deleting
volatile food and energy prices, the index was up 2.7% in November. For the
year to date, the rise was 2.2%, slightly above the Fed's preferred range of
2%. The agency also reported that its producer price index grew at a
seasonally-adjusted 0.3% in November. Removing energy and food prices, the
index was up by just 0.1%.


With U.S. imports declining more than exports, the trade deficit narrowed to
$43.5 billion in October against $44.2 billion in September, according to the
Commerce Department. Exports of goods totaled $127 billion in October against
$129.3 billion in September. Service exports of $51.4 billion were unchanged
from the prior month. Imports of goods came to $186.6 billion for October
against $188.8 billion in September. Imports for services inched up to $36.1
billion from $36.0 billion. U.S. import prices, which had fallen 0.5% in
October, grew 0.7% in November, the highest increase since April 2011.


Compared with most major market currencies, the dollar ended 2011 within
roughly 3% of where it began the year. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which
measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies, increased 1.5% in
the year. Hitting a new low in the final days of the year, the euro closed at
$1.2960. The chief exception to the strong dollar was the yen. Despite a year
of deep trouble in Japan, the yen ended more than 5% higher against the dollar.
Climbing from 81.25 yen at the start of the year, the dollar fell to a record
low near 75.8 yen in April and completed the year at 76.92 yen.


Last year was a disappointment for deal makers, with mergers and
acquisitions declining

after a strong start, according to Thomson Reuters. In the first six months of
2011, announced global deals came to $1.3 trillion, the highest level since the
financial crisis. However, deals slumped 14% in the second half, bringing the
2011 dollar volume to $2.6 trillion, slightly below the 2010 figure of $2.66
trillion.


The number of initial public offerings ("IPOs") and dollars raised was the
lowest since 2009, according to Dealogic. Globally, there were 240 deals,
raising $25.3 billion, in the fourth quarter, the lowest deal volume since the
third quarter of 2009 and the lowest dollar volume since the second quarter of
2009. For all of 2011, there were 1,243 IPOs, raising $160 billion, again the
lowest figures since 2009. For the third consecutive year, the world's leading
exchange for IPOs was Hong Kong, with $31 billion in deals. The volume of deals
on the Chinese mainland slightly topped the combined total of Nasdaq and the
New York Stock Exchange.


Based on current earnings estimates, Bloomberg News reported that stocks on
the S&P 500 were trading at a price/earnings ratio of 13.24 on December 30,
2011. This compares with 11.94 on September 30 and 14.88 on December 30 last
year. The P/Es for trailing twelve - month earnings were reported by S&P at
12.96 on December 30, 13.01 on September 30 and 15.01 on December 30, 2010. As
we see it, the P/E's are neither terribly high nor terribly low. Given present
market conditions, they appear to be in the normal range as far as valuations
are concerned.


The current consensus among Wall Street research analysts is that S&P
fourth-quarter earnings will climb 8.3% in 2011 to $24.40, according to Thomson
Reuters. In October the analysts were expecting 15% gains in the quarter. For
all of 2012, the S&P earnings are projected to increase 10% to $107.20.


Looking to the future, both analysts and investors were more bullish at the
year's end, with analysts the most optimistic. Surveyed by Investors
Intelligence, analysts stood at 50% bulls and 29% bears on December 30, a
reversal of their position on September 30, which saw 37% bulls and 41% bears.
At the end of 2011, analysts came to 56% bulls and 20% bears. Reported by the
American Institute of Investors, their members totaled 41% bulls and 31% bears
on December 30, 32% bulls and 47% bears on September 30, and 52% bulls and 20%
bears at the end of 2010.


Since the market had risen since early October, the increased optimism is no
surprise. They may be right. From August to October, our sentiment indicators
registered a lot of pessimism. While some of our current indicators still
include some pretty bad numbers, our sentiment model reading overall is now
neutral.


Among our other models, the monetary reading is bullish. That's because the
Fed has driven interest rates to zero and is buying securities. However, we
wonder how bullish it can really be when rates are at zero. As far as the tape
is concerned, we consider the current action quite positive. It's difficult to
know the tape's actual performance because of the distortions caused by the
computer traders who account for more than half of the volume. There are far
more unusual up and down days than we have seen in the past. Taking a long
view, the tape is acting reasonably well.


Our stance on the market at this writing is somewhat bullish and we are
about 82% to 83% long. For our Fund any investment figure over 80% is bullish.


Sincerely,

(2)Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of a share of the

day and a sale at the closing NYSE share price on the last business day of
each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
the purpose of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
the Fund's Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan. Generally, total
investment return based on net asset value will be higher than total
investment return based on market value in periods where there is an
increase in the discount or a decrease in the premium of the market value to
the net assets from the beginning to the end of such years. Conversely,
total investment return based on net asset value will be lower than total
investment return based on market value in periods where there is a decrease
in the discount or an increase in the premium of the market value to the net
asset value from the beginning to the end of such periods.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



DECEMBER 31, 2011






NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION



The Zweig Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a closed-end, diversified management
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the
"Act"). The Fund was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland on
June 18, 1986. The Fund's investment objective is capital appreciation,
primarily through investment in equity securities, consistent with the
preservation of capital and reduction of risk.



NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principals
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of increases and decreases in
net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates and those differences could be significant.



A. SECURITY VALUATION:



Security Valuation procedures for the funds have been approved by the Board
of Trustees. All internally fair valued securities referred to below are
approved by a valuation committee appointed under the direction of the Board of
Trustees.


The Fund utilizes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.


.   Level 1 -- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities


.   Level 2 -- prices determined using other significant observable inputs
(including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates,
prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)


.   Level 3 -- prices determined using significant unobservable inputs
(including the valuation committee's own assumptions in determining the
fair value of investments)


A description of the valuation techniques applied to the Fund's major
categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis is as follows:


Equity securities are valued at the official closing price (typically last
sale) on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded, or if no
closing price is available, at the last bid price and are categorized as Level
1 in the hierarchy. Restricted equity securities and private placements that
are not widely traded, are illiquid or are internally fair valued by the
valuation committee, are generally categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy.


18





Certain foreign securities may be fair valued in cases where closing prices
are not readily available or are deemed not reflective of readily available
market prices. For example, significant events (such as movement in the U.S.
securities market, or other regional and local developments) may occur between
the time that foreign markets close (where the security is principally traded)
and the time that the Fund calculates its net asset value (generally, the close
of the NYSE) that may impact the value of securities traded in these foreign
markets. In such cases the Fund fair values foreign securities using an
external pricing service which considers the correlation of the trading
patterns of the foreign security to the intraday trading in the U.S. markets
for investments such as American Depositary Receipts, financial futures,
exchange-traded funds, and certain indexes as well as prices for similar
securities. Such fair valuations are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy.
Because the frequency of significant events is not predictable, fair valuation
of certain foreign common stocks may occur on a frequent basis.


Debt securities, including restricted securities, are valued based on
evaluated quotations received from independent pricing services or from dealers
who make markets in such securities. For most bond types, the pricing service
utilizes matrix pricing which considers yield or price of bonds of comparable
quality, coupon, maturity, current cash flows, type, and current day trade
information, as well as dealer supplied prices. These valuations are generally
categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Structured debt instruments such as
mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities may also incorporate collateral
analysis and utilize cash flow models for valuation and are generally
categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Pricing services do not provide
pricing for all securities and therefore dealer supplied prices are utilized
representing indicative bids based on pricing models used by market makers in
the security and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Debt
securities that are not widely traded, are illiquid, or are internally fair
valued by the valuation committee are generally categorized as Level 3 in the
hierarchy.


Listed derivatives, such as options, that are actively traded are valued
based on quoted prices from the exchange and are categorized as Level 1 in the
hierarchy. Over the counter (OTC) derivative contracts, which include forward
currency contracts and equity linked instruments, are valued based on inputs
observed from actively quoted markets and are categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy.


Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at their closing net asset
value determined as of the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange
(generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) each business day and are categorized as
Level 1 in the hierarchy.


Short-term notes having a remaining maturity of 60 days or less are valued
at amortized cost, which approximates market and are generally categorized as
Level 2 in the hierarchy.


A summary of the inputs used to value the Fund's major categories of assets
and liabilities, which primarily include investments of the Fund, by each major
security type is disclosed at the end of the Schedule of Investments for the
Fund. The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily
an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.



B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED INCOME:



Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date, or in the case of certain foreign securities,
as soon as the Fund is notified. Interest income is recorded on the accrual
basis. The Fund amortizes premiums and accretes discounts using the effective
interest method. Realized gains and losses are determined on the identified
cost basis.


19






C. INCOME TAXES:



The Fund is treated as a separate taxable entity. It is the Fund's intention
to comply with the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes or excise taxes has been made.


The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on investments or
currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable. The Fund will
accrue such taxes and recoveries as applicable based upon current
interpretations of the tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.


The Fund has adopted the authoritative guidance on accounting for and
disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions, which requires the Fund to
determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon
examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation
processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The Fund has
determined that there was no effect on the financial statements from the
adoption of this authoritative guidance. The Fund files tax returns as
prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate. In the
normal course of business, the Fund is subject to examination by federal, state
and local jurisdictions, where applicable. As of December 31, 2011, the tax
years that remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions under
the statute of limitations is from the year 2008 forward (with limited
exceptions).



D. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:



Distributions are recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These differences may include the treatment of
non-taxable dividends, market premium and discount, non-deductible expenses,
expiring capital loss carryovers, foreign currency gain or loss, operating
losses and losses deferred due to wash sales. Permanent book and tax basis
differences relating to shareholder distributions will result in
reclassifications to capital paid in on shares of beneficial interest.


The Fund has a Managed Distribution Plan to pay 10 percent of the Fund's net
asset value ("NAV") on an annualized basis. Distributions may represent
earnings from net investment income, realized capital gains, or, if necessary,
return of capital. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the
Fund's investment performance from the terms of the Fund's Managed Distribution
Plan.



E. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION:



Foreign securities and other assets and liabilities are valued using the
foreign currency exchange rate effective at the end of the reporting period.
Cost of investments is translated at the currency exchange rate effective at
the trade date. The gain or loss resulting from a change in currency exchange
rates between the trade and settlement dates of a portfolio transaction is
treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. Likewise, the gain or loss
resulting from a change in currency exchange rates between the date income is
accrued and paid is treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. The Fund
does not isolate that portion of the results of operations arising from changes
in exchange rates and that portion arising from changes in the market prices of
securities.


20






F. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:



Disclosures on derivatives instruments and hedging activities are intended
to improve financial reporting for derivative instruments by enhanced
disclosure that enables the investors to understand how and why a fund uses
derivatives, how derivatives are accounted for, and how derivative instruments
affect a fund's results of operations and financial position. Summarized below
is a specific type of derivative instrument used by the Fund.



OPTIONS CONTRACTS



An options contract provides the purchaser with the right, but not the
obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a financial instrument at
an agreed upon price. The Fund may purchase or write listed covered and
uncovered put and call options on portfolio securities for hedging purposes or
to facilitate the rapid implementation of investment strategies if the Fund
anticipates a significant market or market sector advance. The Fund is subject
to equity price risk in the normal course of pursuing its investment
objectives. The Fund may use options contracts to hedge against changes in the
values of equities.


When the Fund purchases an option, it pays a premium and an amount equal to
that premium is recorded as an asset. When the Fund writes an option, it
receives a premium and an amount equal to that premium is recorded as a
liability. The asset or liability is adjusted daily to reflect the current
market value of the option. Holdings of the Fund designated to cover
outstanding written options are noted in the Schedules of Investments.
Purchased options are reported as an asset within "Investment securities at
value before written options" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Options written are reported as a liability within "Written options outstanding
at value". Changes in value of the purchased option is included in unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) on investments on the Statement of Investments.
Changes in value of written options is included in unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) on written options.


If an option expires unexercised, the Portfolio realizes a gain or loss to
the extent of the premium received or paid. If an option is exercised, the
premium received or paid is recorded as an adjustment to the proceeds from the
sale or the cost basis of the purchase. The difference between the premium and
the amount received or paid on effecting a closing purchase or sale transaction
is also treated as a realized gain or loss. Gain or loss on purchased options
is included in net realized gain/(loss) on investment transactions on the
Statement of Operations. Gain or loss on written options is presented
separately as net realized gain/(loss) on written options transactions.


The risk in writing call options is that the Fund gives up the opportunity
for profit if the market price of the security increases and the option is
exercised. The risk in writing put options is that the Fund may incur a loss if
the market price of the security decreases and the option is exercised. The
risk in buying options is that the Fund pays a premium whether or not the
option is exercised. The use of such instruments may involve certain additional
risks as a result of unanticipated movements in the market. Writers (sellers)
of options are subject to unlimited risk of loss, as the seller will be
obligated to deliver or take delivery of the security at a predetermined price
which may, upon exercise of the option, be significantly different from the
then-market value.



G. SECURITY LENDING ($ REPORTED IN THOUSANDS):



The Fund may loan securities to qualified brokers through an agreement with
The Bank of New York Mellon ("BNY Mellon"). Under the terms of the agreement,
the Fund is required to maintain collateral with a market value not less than
100% of the market value of loaned securities. Collateral is ad-


21





justed daily in connection with changes in the market value of securities on
loan. Collateral may consist of cash and U.S. Government Securities. Cash
collateral is invested in a short-term money market fund. Dividends earned on
the collateral and premiums paid by the broker are recorded as income by the
Fund net of fees and rebates charged by BNY Mellon for its services in
connection with this securities lending program. Lending portfolio securities
involves a risk of delay in the recovery of the loaned securities or in the
foreclosure on collateral.


At December 31, 2011, the Fund had no securities on loan.

NOTE 6 -- INDEMNIFICATIONS



Under the Fund's organizational documents and related agreements, its
directors and officers are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out
of the performance of their duties to the Fund. In addition, the Fund enters
into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these arrangements.



NOTE 7 -- CAPITAL STOCK AND REINVESTMENT PLAN



At December 31, 2011, the Fund had one class of common stock, par value $.10
per share, of which 200,000,000 shares are authorized and 91,955,558 shares are
outstanding.


Registered shareholders may elect to have all distributions paid by check
mailed directly to the shareholder by Computershare as dividend paying agent.
Pursuant to the Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"),
shareholders not making such election will have all such amounts automatically
reinvested by Computershare, as the Plan agent, in whole or fractional shares
of the Fund, as the case may be. During the periods ended December 31, 2011 and
December 31, 2010, there were no shares issued pursuant to the Plan.


On January 3, 2012, the Fund announced a distribution of $0.082 per share to
shareholders of record on December 30, 2011. This distribution has an
ex-dividend date of January 5, 2012, and is payable on January 9, 2012. Please
see inside front cover for more information on fund distributions.



NOTE 8 -- CREDIT RISK AND ASSET CONCENTRATIONS



In countries with limited or developing markets, investments may present
greater risks than in more developed markets and the prices of such investments
may be volatile. The consequences of political, social or economic changes in
these markets may have disruptive effects on the market prices of these
investments and the income they generate, as well as the Fund's ability to
repatriate such amounts.


The Fund may invest a high percentage of its assets in specific sectors of
the market in its pursuit of a greater investment return. Fluctuations in these
sectors of concentration may have a greater impact on the Fund, positive or
negative, than if the Fund did not concentrate its investments in such sectors.



NOTE 9 -- REGULATORY EXAMS



Federal and state regulatory authorities from time to time make inquiries
and conduct examinations regarding compliance by Virtus and its subsidiaries
(collectively "the Company") with securities and other laws and regulations
affecting their registered products.


There are currently no such matters which the Company believes will be
material to these financial statements.

NOTE 10 -- FEDERAL INCOME TAX INFORMATION



($ REPORTED IN THOUSANDS)


At December 31, 2011, federal tax cost and aggregate gross unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) of securities held by the Fund were as follows:






                                                     NET UNREALIZED
                 FEDERAL    UNREALIZED   UNREALIZED   APPRECIATION
                 TAX COST  APPRECIATION DEPRECIATION (DEPRECIATION)
-                --------  ------------ ------------ --------------
Investments..... $296,536    $31,258      $(18,045)     $13,213
Written Options.     (870)        80           (25)          55








The Fund has capital loss carryover, which may be used to offset future
capital gains as follows:








              EXPIRATION YEAR
--------------------------------------------
    2016            2017            TOTAL
-------------   -------------   -------------
   $2,219          $20,780         $22,999








Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the
"Act"), net capital losses recognized for tax years beginning after December
22, 2010 may be carried forward indefinitely, and their character is retained
as short-term and/or long-term losses. Previously, net capital losses were
carried forward for eight years and treated as short-term losses. As a
transition rule, the Act requires that post-enactment net capital losses be
used before pre-enactment net capital losses.


The Fund may not realize the benefit of these losses to the extent it does
not realize gains on investments prior to the expiration of the capital loss
carryovers. In addition, under certain conditions, the Fund may lose the
benefit of these losses to the extent that distributions to shareholders exceed
required distribution amounts as defined under the Internal Revenue Code.
Shareholders may also pay additional taxes on these excess distributions.


For the period ended December 31, 2011, the Fund utilized losses of $6,615
deferred in prior years against current year capital gains. The Fund had
capital loss carryovers of $20,187 which expired in 2011.


Capital losses realized after October 31 and certain late year losses (e.g.
foreign currency) may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of
the following fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, the
Fund deferred ordinary losses of $41.


The components of distributable earnings on a tax basis (excluding
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) which is disclosed in the table above)
consist of undistributed ordinary income of $0 and undistributed long-term
capital gains of $0.


The differences between the book and tax basis components of distributable
earnings relate principally to the timing of recognition of income and gains
for federal income tax purposes. Short-term gain distributions reported in the
Statement of Changes in Net Assets, if any, are reported as ordinary income for
federal tax purposes. Distributions are determined on a tax basis and may
differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for financial
reporting purposes.


25






NOTE 11 -- RECLASSIFICATION OF CAPITAL ACCOUNTS



As of December 31, 2011, the Fund decreased undistributed net investment
income by $39, decreased the accumulated net realized loss by $28,042, and
decreased capital paid in on shares of beneficial interest by $28,003.






NOTE 12 -- RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT



In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting
Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011-04 "Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value
Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs". ASU 2011-04
includes common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value
between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011-04 will require reporting entities to
disclose quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in the
fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
In addition, ASU 2011-04 will require reporting entities to make disclosures
about amounts and reasons for all transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2
fair value measurements. The new and revised disclosures are effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. At this
time, management is evaluating the implications of ASU No. 2011-04 and its
impact on the financial statements has not been determined.



NOTE 13 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENT EVALUATIONS



Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Fund
through the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that
the following events require recognition or disclosure in these financial
statements.


On March 1, 2012, the current investment services agreement with Zweig
Consulting expired and was replaced with a new consulting agreement wherein
Zweig Consulting would provide consulting services to the Adviser including the
provision of general market and economic research, the provision of additional
information based on Zweig Consulting's proprietary models and continued
interaction with, and access to, Dr. Zweig and Zweig Consulting personnel.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Zweig Fund, Inc.:



In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of The Zweig Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") at December 31, 2011, the results of its operations for the year then
ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the
period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. These financial statements and financial
highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of securities at December 31, 2011 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

AUTOMATIC REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN



The Zweig Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") allows you to conveniently reinvest
distributions quarterly in additional Fund shares thereby enabling you to
compound your returns from the Fund. By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to
invest money regularly and automatically, and watch your investment grow.


It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure
a profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.



ENROLLMENT IN THE REINVESTMENT PLAN



It is the policy of the Fund to automatically reinvest distributions payable
to shareholders. A "registered" shareholder automatically becomes a participant
in the Fund's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the
"Plan"). The Plan authorizes the Fund to credit all shares of common stock to
participants upon a distribution regardless of whether the shares are trading
at a discount or premium to the net asset value. Registered shareholders may
terminate their participation and receive distributions in cash by contacting
Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator"). The termination
will become effective with the next distribution if the Plan Administrator is
notified at least 7 business days prior to the distribution payment date.
Registered shareholders that wish to change their distribution option from cash
payment to reinvest may do so by contacting the Plan Administrator at
1-800-272-2700.


In the case of banks, brokers, or other nominees which hold your shares for
you as the beneficial owner, the Plan Administrator will administer the Plan
based on the information provided by the bank, broker or nominee. To the extent
that you wish to participate in the Plan, you should contact the broker, bank
or nominee holding your shares to ensure that your account is properly
represented. If necessary, you may have your shares taken out of the name of
the broker, bank or nominee and register them in your own name.



HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED THROUGH THE REINVESTMENT PLAN



When a distribution is declared, nonparticipants in the plan will receive
cash. Participants in the plan will receive shares of the Fund valued as
described below:


If on the payable date of the distribution, the market price of the Fund's
common stock is less than the net asset value, the Plan Administrator will buy
Fund shares on behalf of the Participant in the open market, on the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) or elsewhere. The price per share will be equal to the
weighted average price of all shares purchased, including commissions.
Commission rates are currently $0.02 per share, although the rate is subject to
change and may vary. If, following the commencement of purchases and before the
Plan Administrator has completed its purchases, the trading price equals or
exceeds the most recent net asset value of the common shares, the Plan
Administrator may cease purchasing shares on the open market and the Fund may
issue the remaining shares at a price equal to the greater of (a) the net asset
value on the last day the Plan Administrator purchased shares or (b) 95% of the
market price on such day. In the case where the Plan Administrator has
terminated open market purchases and the Fund has issued the remaining shares,
the number of shares received by the Participant in respect of the cash
distribution will be based on the weighted average of prices paid for shares
purchased in the open market and the price at which the Fund issued the
remaining shares. Under certain circumstances, the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission may require


32





limitation or temporary suspension of market purchases of shares under the
Plan. The Plan Administrator will not be accountable for its inability to make
a purchase during such a period.


If on the payable date of the distribution, the market price is equal to or
exceeds the net asset value, Participants will be issued new shares by the Fund
at the greater of the (a) the net asset value on the payable date or (b) 95% of
the market price on such date.


The automatic reinvestment of distributions will not relieve Participants of
any income tax which may be payable on such distributions. A Participant in the
Plan will be treated for federal income tax purposes, as having received on a
payment date, a distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant
could have received instead of shares. If you participate in the Plan, you will
receive a Form 1099-DIV concerning the Federal tax status of distributions paid
during the year.



VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN



Participants in the Plan have the option of making additional cash payments
for investment in shares of the Fund. Such payments can be made in any amount
from $100 per payment to $3,000 per month. The Plan Administrator will use the
funds received to purchase Fund shares in the open market on the 15/th/ of each
month or the next business day if the 15/th/ falls on a weekend or holiday (the
"Investment Date"). The purchase price per share will be equal to the weighted
average price of all shares purchased on the Investment Date, including
commissions. There is no charge to shareholders for Cash Purchases. The plan
administrator's fee will be paid by the Fund. However, each participating
shareholder will pay pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred
(currently $0.02 per share, but may vary and is subject to change) with respect
to the Plan Administrator's open market purchases in connection with all cash
investments. Voluntary cash payments should be sent to Computershare Trust
Company, N.A., PO Box 43078, Providence, RI 02940-3078.


Participants have an unconditional right to obtain the return of any cash
payment if the Plan Administrator receives written notice at least 5 business
days before such payment is to be invested.



AUTOMATIC MONTHLY INVESTMENT



Participants in the Plan may purchase additional shares by means of an
Automatic Monthly Investment of not less than $100 nor more than $3,000 per
month by electronic funds transfer from a predesignated U.S. bank account. If a
Participant has already established a Plan account and wishes to initiate
Automatic Monthly Investments, the Participant must complete and sign an
automatic monthly investment form and return it to the Plan Administrator
together with a voided check or deposit slip for the account from which funds
are to be withdrawn. Automatic monthly investment forms may be obtained from
the Plan Administrator by calling 1-800-272-2700.



TERMINATION OF SHARES



Shareholders wishing to liquidate shares held with the Plan Administrator
must do so in writing or by calling 1-800-272-2700. The Plan Administrator does
not charge a fee for liquidating your shares; however, currently a brokerage
commission of $0.02 will be charged. This charge may vary and is subject to
change.


Once terminated, you may re-enroll in the Plan (provided you still have
shares registered in your name) by contacting the Plan Administrator at
1-800-272-2700.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION



For more information regarding the Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase
Plan, please contact the Plan Administrator at 1-800-272-2700 or visit our
website at Virtus.com.


The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
voluntary cash payments made and any distribution paid subsequent to written
notice of the change sent to the members of the Plan at least 90 days before
the record date for such distribution. The Plan also may be amended or
terminated by the Plan Administrator with at least 90 days written notice to
participants in the Plan.

Audit Fees

professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit
of the registrant's annual financial statements or services that are
normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and
regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years are $28,800 for
2011 and $32,000 for 2010.



Audit-Related Fees

assurance and related services by the principal accountant that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit of the registrant's
financial statements and are not reported under paragraph (a) of this

professional services rendered by the principal accountant for tax
compliance, tax advice, and tax planning are $4,600 for 2011 and $4,600

"Tax Fees" are those primarily associated with review of the Trust's tax
provision and qualification as a regulated investment company (RIC) in
connection with audits of the Trust's financial statement, review of
year-end distributions by the Fund to avoid excise tax for the Trust,

procedures with regard to the pre-approval of services provided by PwC.
The Audit Committee pre-approves: (i) all audit and non-audit services
to be rendered to the Fund by PwC; and (ii) all non-audit services to be
rendered to the Fund, financial reporting of the Fund provided by PwC to
the Adviser or any affiliate thereof that provides ongoing services to
the Fund (collectively, "Covered Services"). The Audit Committee has
adopted pre-approval procedures authorizing a member of the Audit
Committee to pre-approve from time to time, on behalf of the Audit
Committee, all Covered Services to be provided by PwC which are not
otherwise pre-approved at a meeting of the Audit committee, provided
that such delegate reports to the full Audit Committee at its next
meeting. The pre-approval procedures do not include delegation of the
Audit committee's responsibilities to management. Pre-approval has not
been waived with respect to any of the services described above since
the date on which the Audit Committee adopted its current pre-approval
procedures.





(e)(2) The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b) through

(d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant to
paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X are as follows:


(b)0% for 2011 and 2010


(c)0% for 2011 and 2010


(d)Not applicable


(f)The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most

less than fifty percent.


(g)The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for
services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by,
or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services
to the registrant for each of the last two fiscal years of the
registrant was $327,554 for 2011 and $398,818 for 2010.


(h)The registrant's audit committee of the board of directors has
considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were
rendered to the registrant's investment adviser (not including any
sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any
entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the
investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant that
were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence.

this Statement of Policy.





III Factors to consider when voting.


A.  A Delegate may abstain from voting when it concludes that the effect
on shareholders' economic interests or the value of the Portfolio
Holding is indeterminable or insignificant.


B.  In analyzing ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES, the Delegate shall vote on a
case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as overall
long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its
industry competition. Key measures which shall be considered include,

case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as long-term
financial performance of the target company relative to its industry;
management's track record; background to the proxy contest;
qualifications of director nominees (both slates); evaluation of what

proposed objectives and goals can be met; and stock ownership
positions.


G.  A Delegate shall generally vote against shareholder SOCIAL MATTERS
proposals.



IV  Delegation.



A.  In the absence of a specific direction to the contrary from the Board
of Trustees of the Fund, the Adviser will be responsible for voting
proxies for all Portfolio Holdings in accordance with this Statement
of Policy, or for delegating such responsibility as described below.





B. The Adviser delegated with authority to vote proxies for Portfolio
Holdings shall be deemed to assume a duty of care to safeguard the best
interests of the Fund and its shareholders. No Delegate shall accept
direction or inappropriate influence from any other client, director or
employee of any affiliated company and shall not cast any vote
inconsistent with this Statement of Policy without obtaining the prior
approval of the Fund or its duly authorized representative(s).


C. With regard to each Series for which there is a duly appointed
Subadviser acting pursuant to an investment advisory agreement
satisfying the requirements of Section 15(a) of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules thereunder, the Subadviser may,
pursuant to delegated authority from the Adviser, vote proxies for
Portfolio Holdings with regard to the Series or portion of the assets
thereof for which the Subadviser is responsible. In such case, the
Subadviser shall vote proxies for the Portfolio Holdings in accordance
with Sections II, III and V of this Statement of Policy, provided,
however, that the Subadviser may vote proxies in accordance with its own
proxy voting policy/procedures ("Subadviser Procedures") if the
following two conditions are satisfied: (1) the Adviser must have
approved the Subadviser Procedures based upon the Adviser's
determination that the Subadviser Procedures are reasonably designed to
further the best economic interests of the affected Fund shareholders,
and (2) the Subadviser Procedures are reviewed and approved annually by
the Board of Trustees. The Subadviser will promptly notify the Adviser
of any material changes to the Subadviser Procedures. The Adviser will
periodically review the votes by the Subadviser for consistency with
this Statement of Policy.



V. Conflicts of Interest



A. The Fund and its Delegate(s) seek to avoid actual or perceived conflicts
of interest in the voting of proxies for Portfolio Holdings between the
interests of Fund shareholders, on one hand, and those of the Adviser,
Delegate, principal underwriter, or any affiliated person of the Fund,
on the other hand. The Board of Trustees may take into account a wide
array of factors in determining whether such a conflict exists, whether
such conflict is material in nature, and how to properly address or
resolve the same.


B. While each conflict situation varies based on the particular facts
presented and the requirements of governing law, the Board of Trustees
or its delegate(s) may take the following actions, among others, or
otherwise give weight to the following factors, in addressing material
conflicts of interest in voting (or directing Delegates to vote) proxies
pertaining to Portfolio Holdings: (i) rely on the recommendations of an
established, independent third party with qualifications to vote proxies
such as Institutional Shareholder Services; (ii) vote pursuant to the
recommendation of the proposing Delegate; (iii) abstaining; or

(iv) where two or more Delegates provide conflicting requests, vote
shares in proportion to the assets under management of the each
proposing Delegate.


C. The Adviser shall promptly notify the President of the Fund once any
actual or potential conflict of interest exists and their
recommendations for protecting the best interests of Fund's
shareholders. No Adviser shall waive any conflict of interest or vote
any conflicted proxies without the prior written approval of the Board
of Trustees or the President of the Fund pursuant to section D of this
Article.





D. In the event that a determination, authorization or waiver under this
Statement of Policy is requested at a time other than a regularly
scheduled meeting of the Board of Trustees, the President of the Fund
shall be empowered with the power and responsibility to interpret and
apply this Statement of Policy and provide a report of his or her
determinations at the next following meeting of the Board of Trustees.


VI.Miscellaneous.


A. A copy of the current Statement of Policy with Respect to Proxy Voting
and the voting records for the Fund reconciling proxies with Portfolio
Holdings and recording proxy voting guideline compliance and
justification, shall be kept in an easily accessible place and available
upon request.


B. The Adviser shall present a report of any material deviations from this
Statement of Policy at every regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of
Trustees and shall provide such other reports as the Board of Trustees
may request from time to time. The Adviser shall provide to the Fund or
any shareholder a record of its effectuation of proxy voting pursuant to
this Statement of Policy at such times and in such format or medium as
the Fund shall reasonably request. The Adviser shall be solely
responsible for complying with the disclosure and reporting requirements
under applicable laws and regulations, including, without limitation,
Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Adviser
shall gather, collate and present information relating to the its proxy
voting activities of those of each Delegate in such format and medium as
the Fund shall determine from time to time in order for the Fund to
discharge its disclosure and reporting obligations pursuant to Rule
30b1-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.


C. The Adviser shall pay all costs associated with proxy voting for
Portfolio Holdings pursuant to this Statement of Policy and assisting
the Fund in providing public notice of the manner in which such proxies
were voted.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS



There may be certain inherent conflicts of interest that arise in
connection with the Mr. Neel's and Mr. Dickerson's management of each
Fund's investments and the investments of any other accounts they manage
individually or together. Such conflicts could arise from the
aggregation of orders for all accounts managed by a particular portfolio
manager, the allocation of purchases across all such accounts, the
allocation of IPOs and any soft dollar arrangements that the Adviser may
have in place that could benefit the Funds and/or such other accounts.
The Board of Trustees/Directors has adopted on behalf of the Funds
policies and procedures designed to address any such conflicts of
interest to ensure that all transactions are executed in the best
interest of the Funds' shareholders. The Advisers and Sub adviser are
required to certify their compliance with these procedures to the Board
of Trustees on a quarterly basis. There have been no material compliance
issues with respect to any of these policies and procedures during the
Funds' most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2011. Additionally,
there are no material conflicts of interest between the investment
strategy of a Fund and the investment strategy of other accounts managed
by Mr. Neel and Mr. Dickerson since portfolio managers generally manage
funds and other accounts having similar investment strategies.


(A)(3) COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM


MEMBERS



For the most recently completed fiscal year ended December 31, 2011,
following is a description of Mr. Neel's and Mr. Dickerson's
compensation structure as portfolio managers of ZA.


Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. and its affiliated investment
management firms (collectively, "Virtus"), believe that the firm's
compensation program is adequate and competitive to attract and retain
high-caliber investment professionals. Investment professionals at
Virtus receive a competitive base salary, an incentive bonus opportunity
and a benefits package. Portfolio managers may also have the opportunity
to participate in long-term equity programs, including potential awards
of Virtus restricted stock units ("RSUs") with multi-year vesting,
subject to Virtus board approval.


Following is a more detailed description of the compensation structure
of the Fund's portfolio managers.


Base Salary. Each Portfolio Manager is paid a fixed base salary, which
is designed to be competitive in light of the individual's experience
and responsibilities. Base salary is determined using compensation
survey results of investment industry compensation conducted by an
independent third party in evaluating competitive market compensation
for its investment management professionals.


Incentive Bonus. Annual incentive payments are based on targeted
compensation levels, adjusted based on profitability, investment
performance factors and a subjective assessment of





contribution to the team effort. The short-term incentive payment is
generally paid in cash, but a portion may be made in Virtus RSUs.
Individual payments are assessed using comparisons of actual investment
performance with specific peer group or index measures. Performance of
the funds managed is generally measured over one-, three- and five year
periods and an individual manager's participation is based on the
performance of each fund/account managed.


While portfolio manager compensation contains a performance component,
this component is further adjusted to reward investment personnel for
managing within the stated framework and for not taking unnecessary
risk. This approach ensures that investment management personnel remain
focused on managing and acquiring securities that correspond to a Fund's
mandate and risk profile and are discouraged from taking on more risk
and unnecessary exposure to chase performance for personal gain. We
believe we have appropriate controls in place to handle any potential
conflicts that may result from a substantial portion of portfolio
manager compensation being tied to performance


Other Benefits. Portfolio managers are also eligible to participate in
broad-based plans offered generally to employees of Virtus and its
affiliates, including 401(k), health and other employee benefit plans.


In summary, the Investment Manager believes that overall compensation is
both fair and competitive while rewarding employees for not taking
unnecessary risks to chase personal performance.

EX-99.CODE ETH




THE ZWEIG FUND, INC.

THE ZWEIG TOTAL RETURN FUND, INC.

SENIOR MANAGEMENT CODE OF ETHICS




I  Background



Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that each registered
investment company disclose whether or not it has adopted a code of ethics that
applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the fund or
a third party (collectively, "Senior Management"). If a fund has not adopted
such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so in certain
regulatory filings.


Pursuant to various management agreements between The Zweig Fund, Inc. and
The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Funds") and Phoenix subsidiaries,
Phoenix employees currently serve as Senior Management to the Funds. As
employees of Phoenix they are subject to the Phoenix Code of Ethics (the
"PCE"). The PCE complies with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other relevant
requirements. The Boards of Directors of the Funds, on October 1, 2003, adopted
the Phoenix Code of Ethics for the Senior Management of the Funds.


II Board Resolution adopted on October 1, 2003


WHEREAS, that Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that
each registered investment company publicly disclose whether or not it has
adopted a code of ethics that applies to its principal executive officer,
principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or
persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these individuals
are employed by the fund or a third party (collectively, "Senior Management");
and


WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has reviewed the Phoenix Code of Conduct, as
presented at this meeting, as the same may be amended from time to time (the
"Senior Management Code") and has determined the same to provide written
standards that are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote the
types of conduct by Senior Management that are contemplated by regulations
promulgated pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; now, therefore, be it


RESOLVED, that the Fund does hereby approve and adopt the Senior Management
Code as the written code of ethics that applies to its principal executive
officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether
these individuals are employed by the Fund or a third party;


FURTHER RESOLVED, the Chairman of the Fund, with the advice of counsel and
subject to the terms and conditions specified in the Phoenix Code of Conduct,
shall be appointed and directed to oversee the consideration and granting of
any waivers of the Senior Management Code with respect to Senior Management
other than the Chairman provided however that the Chairman shall provide notice
of any such waiver to the Board of Directors at the next succeeding regularly
scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors and provided further that any
requested waivers involving the Chairman shall be presented to the Board for
approval; and


FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Chief Compliance Officer of The Phoenix
Companies, Inc. be, and she or he hereby is, authorized and directed to
implement, and oversee compliance with, and administration of the Senior
Management Code and to take such further action and





deliver and execute any and all instruments, certificates and documents as she
or he may deem necessary or appropriate, with the advice of counsel, to fully
carry out the purposes and intent of the Senior Management Code.



Commitment to Shareholders



Phoenix is committed to providing shareholder value. One way we do this is by
observing the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct in all of our
business dealings.



Conflicts of Interest



Phoenix expects each of its employees and directors to maintain the highest
moral and ethical standards and to avoid conflicts of interest in conducting
business activities. A "conflict of interest" occurs when an individual's
private interest interferes, or even appears to interfere, in any way with the
interests of the Company as a whole. A conflict situation can arise when an
employee or director takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult
to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and effectively.
Conflicts of interest also arise when an employee or director, or a member of
his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or
her position in the Company.


An employee requested by Phoenix to serve on the board of directors of another
company owes a fiduciary duty to Phoenix as well as to the company on whose
board of directors he or she serves. Where conflicts of interest arise between
the interests of Phoenix and the other company, the employee should consult
Phoenix's General Counsel for guidance. Moreover, no employee requested by
Phoenix to serve on the board of directors of another company may accept fees
or other compensation for board service. In the event the company for which an
employee serves as a director requires directors to receive fees, any
remuneration received by the employee must be donated to a charitable
organization. The Company will offset any tax consequences incurred by the
employee.


All conflicts of interest must be disclosed in writing to the Chief Compliance
Officer. Employees and directors are required to file a Conflict of Interest
Statement annually. Any conflicts of interest that arise following completion
of the Conflict of Interest Statement must be promptly reported to the Chief
Compliance Officer in writing.



Corporate Opportunities



Employees and directors owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate
interests when the opportunity to do so arises. Consequently, employees and
directors are prohibited from engaging in the following activities:


.   taking for themselves personal opportunities that are discovered through
the use of corporate property, information or position;


.   using Company property, information or position for personal gain; and


.   competing with the Company.



Insider Trading and Personal Trading



Federal securities laws and Company policy prohibit the purchase or sale of
securities while in possession of material non-public information and prohibit
passing such information on to others. No employee or director may buy or sell
Phoenix securities if he or she has material non-public information. This
restriction also applies to an employee's or director's spouse, other adults
living in the employee's or director's household, minor children and persons
for whom the employee exercises investment authority. Employees, directors and
their family members also must avoid passing non-public information on to third
parties.





Information is "material" if a reasonable investor would probably consider the
information important in deciding whether to buy, hold or sell securities of
the company to which the information relates.


Directors, officers and their family members1 are also subject to certain
restrictions under New York Insurance Law governing acquisition of Phoenix
shares. Until June 25, 2006, directors and officers, whether acting directly or
indirectly, may only acquire, or offer to acquire, such shares: (i) through a
Phoenix plan; or (ii) through a registered broker or dealer at quoted prices on
the date of purchase. Family members may only acquire such shares through the
latter method.


All directors, all employees with a title of Vice President or higher, plus
certain other employees whose positions place them in regular contact with
non-public information, and certain family members of all of them are subject
to a further restriction as well: these individuals may only buy or sell
Phoenix securities during "window" periods. You have been or will be notified:

(i) if these restrictions apply to you; and (ii) when periods begin and end.


In addition, officers with a title of Executive Vice President or higher,
certain other individuals who have been notified by the Corporate Secretary,
and certain family members of each of them, must pre-clear all transactions in
Phoenix securities through our Corporate Secretary. Further, they must promptly
report such transactions to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").


No employee or director may buy or sell securities of another company with the
knowledge that those securities are being considered for purchase or sale by
Phoenix, any of its subsidiaries or any of the Company's advisory accounts. In
the case of any company in which Phoenix owns 10 percent or more of the
outstanding equity, no employee (nor certain family members) may make any
personal investment without prior approval from the Law Department.


Certain employees who are involved with the Company's investment adviser and
broker-dealer operations may be required to secure pre-clearance of and/or
report all personal securities transactions by these individuals. In addition,
the Company reserves the right to require duplicate confirmations, quarterly
transaction reports and prior clearance for any personal securities
transactions by those individuals. If you have any question as to whether your
position requires pre-clearance or reporting, you should contact the compliance
officer for your business area (investment adviser or broker-dealer) or the
Corporate Compliance Department.


Footnote 1 An officer's or director's child, stepchild, grandchild, parent,
step-parent, grandparent, spouse, or sibling, including in-laws and adoptive
relationships.



Market Timing



Company policy prohibits employees from engaging in excessive trading or market
timing activities with respect to any mutual fund, regardless of whether such
mutual fund is affiliated with the Company. This prohibition does not apply to
money market funds or other funds designed to permit short term investment or
to non-volitional investment vehicles such as 401(k) plans, automatic
reinvestment programs, or asset allocation programs.



Confidentiality



Directors and employees are required to maintain the confidentiality of
information entrusted to them in the course of their work for the Company.
Disclosure of confidential information is restricted to authorized persons or
situations in which disclosure is legally mandated. Confidential information
includes all non-public information about the Company or persons with which it
conducts business (such as customers, vendors and potential investment targets)
including, but not limited to: internal operating procedures; investment
strategies; sales data and customer lists; financial plans; projections; and
clients' personal information. (See also Privacy and Confidential Personal
Information below). A director's or employee's obligation to protect
confidential information continues even after termination of his or her
position with the Company.






Protection and Use of Company Property and Assets



Employees have access to Company property to assist them in effectively
carrying out their duties to the Company. Company property should only be used
for legitimate purposes. All employees should protect the Company's property
and ensure its efficient use. Theft, fraud, carelessness and waste have a
direct impact on the Company's profitability.


Examples of Company property include proprietary and non-public information,
equipment, facilities, vehicles, funds and other assets. Improper use or abuse
of Company property is prohibited. Expenses to be paid for by the Company, via
reimbursement or direct payment, are limited to those expenses that are
authorized and related to legitimate business activities.



Contract Review



The following contracts must be reviewed by the Law Department prior to being
signed, amended or terminated early:


.   Contracts that involve an expenditure or value of greater than $25,000;


.   Contracts that pose significant legal obligations on Phoenix (such as an
obligation not to solicit business, not to hire, or to provide
indemnification); and


.   Contracts that involve employment or consulting services.


In addition, contracts that could have a significant impact on Phoenix's
financial results or reports must be reviewed by Corporate Finance for business
risks and financial implications.



Corporate Disclosures



As a public company, Phoenix is required to publicly disclose certain
information on a regular basis. This includes financial information and other
material information about the Company. It is imperative that such information
be disseminated in a consistent manner and in accordance with SEC disclosure
requirements and Company policy. In order to ensure that information released
is accurate and properly disseminated, only certain individuals are authorized
to speak on behalf of the Company. Employees are prohibited from speaking with
rating agencies, analysts, investors or the press without obtaining prior
authorization from the President and Chief Executive Officer. Employees
receiving any such inquiries should refer such individuals to the appropriate
area for response:


.   Members of the Press - to the senior officer, Corporate Communications;


.   Rating Agencies - to any officer in the Rating Agency Relations unit; and


.   Securities Analysts and Investors - to any officer in the Investor
Relations unit.


In order to enable the Company to comply with applicable law, Company policy
prohibits directors and employees from publicly disclosing any non-public
information about the Company's financial performance, other than at times and
through methods approved by the Company's President or Chief Financial Officer.
Employees are also prohibited from commenting on the Company's stock
performance.



Accuracy and Retention of Company Records



The integrity of Phoenix's records is vital to the Company's continued success.
The falsification, misuse or inappropriate alteration of Company documents is
strictly prohibited. Phoenix's business transactions must be accurately
recorded on the Company's books and records in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, any other required accounting basis and
established Company policy. Financial information must fairly represent all
relevant information.


The retention and destruction of Company records must follow established
Company policies and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.






Commitment to Customers



Phoenix upholds its commitment to our customers by conducting our business
fairly and honestly and maintaining the highest ethical standards in all
dealings with customers.



Safeguarding Customer Assets



Employees have an obligation to safeguard the assets of our customers at all
times, and to protect them from all forms of misuse. Misappropriation of funds
can include theft, fraud, embezzlement or unauthorized borrowing. Employees
must not, under any circumstances, misappropriate funds, property or other
assets, or assist another individual in doing so.



Ethical Market Conduct



The Company expects all who are involved in the sales and marketing of its
products and services to abide by the following principles:


.   conduct business according to high standards of honesty and fairness;


.   provide competent and customer-focused sales and service;


.   engage in active and fair competition;


.   provide clear, honest and fair advertising and sales materials;


.   handle customer complaints and disputes in an appropriate and timely
manner; and


.   monitor sales and service procedures to help ensure compliance with ethical
market conduct.



Privacy and Confidential Personal Information



It is the responsibility of every employee to maintain the privacy of
confidential personal information. Confidential personal information includes
non-public financial and health information obtained from consumers and
customers in connection with providing a financial product or service. Specific
examples of confidential personal information include information concerning
assets, income, businesses, estates, financial plans or health.


The misuse of confidential personal information could subject the Company and
its employees to civil liability or criminal penalties. Before releasing
confidential information to anyone, employees must make certain that releasing
it is permitted under the Company's policies or authorized in writing by the
person to whom it relates.



Customer Complaints



The Company is committed to fairly and expeditiously handling all customer
complaints. All complaints must be handled and reported in accordance with
established corporate policies as well as procedures established for the
applicable business unit or affiliate. To facilitate resolution of each
customer complaint, as well as to facilitate any related regulatory inquiries,
all customer complaints and related communications are centrally retained.



Fraud



The Company strongly supports all efforts to detect and prevent fraud. It
believes that only through aggressive action to combat fraud can the Company
continue to meet its fundamental obligations to its stockholders and customers.
When there is reason to believe that the Company has been the target of fraud
or attempted fraud, it will aggressively work with the appropriate law
enforcement officials to seek prosecution and conviction of the responsible
individual(s). Any employee who is aware or suspects that the Company has been
the target of fraud or attempted fraud should report it to the Corporate Audit
Department immediately.






Insurance Anti-Fraud Plan



In accordance with insurance regulatory requirements, the Company has a
comprehensive insurance anti-fraud plan that is designed to:


.   prevent insurance fraud, including internal fraud involving the Company's
officers, employees or agents, fraud resulting from misrepresentations on
applications for insurance, and claims fraud;


.   report insurance fraud to appropriate law enforcement and regulatory
authorities;


.   encourage cooperation in the prosecution of insurance fraud cases; and


.   aggressively pursue recovery of all sums improperly paid by the Company as
a result of fraud.



Commitment to Corporate Citizenship



Phoenix is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen, which includes
complying with applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we
operate as well as engaging in fair competition in the marketplace.



Complying with Legal and Regulatory Requirements



The Company expects all employees to conduct business in accordance with all
applicable laws and regulations. The laws and regulations related to the
financial services industry are complex, thus placing a duty on each employee
to take all reasonable steps to ensure his or her actions are in compliance.
Compliance with the law does not, however, comprise our entire ethical
responsibility. Rather, it is a minimum standard for performance of our duties.
(See also the provisions below on Commitment to Ethics and Compliance).



Accounting, Internal Accounting Controls and Auditing Matters



The Company treats complaints about accounting, internal accounting controls,
or auditing matters seriously and expeditiously. Employees have the opportunity
to submit confidential and anonymous complaints about accounting or auditing
matters for review by representatives of Phoenix, and if appropriate, the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors. These complaints will be handled in a
manner that protects the confidentiality and anonymity of the employee when so
requested by the employee. (See the Toll-Free Help Line section of this Code,
on page 11). No employee will be terminated or otherwise retaliated against for
submitting a complaint under this procedure if he or she reasonably believes
that the complaint may involve a violation of federal securities or anti-fraud
laws.



Fair Dealing



Each employee must deal fairly with the Company's customers, suppliers,
competitors and employees. No employee should take unfair advantage of anyone
through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information,
misrepresentation of material facts, or other unfair-dealing practice.



Antitrust



The Company is committed to preserving a free and competitive marketplace and
will not engage in any understandings or agreements with any competitor that
could result in a restraint of trade. Employees must avoid engaging in any
conduct that violates the antitrust laws, such as agreements with competitors
regarding prices, terms of sale, division of markets and allocations of
customers. Discussions with competitors related to market share, projected
sales for any specific product or service, revenues and expenses, production
schedules, unannounced products and services, pricing or marketing strategies
are prohibited.


The antitrust laws and, thus, the above prohibitions, also apply to informal
contacts with competitors, such as encounters at trade shows or meetings of
professional organizations. Every employee has an obligation to avoid
situations that could result in a violation of the antitrust laws.



Anti-Money Laundering






It is the responsibility of every employee to protect the Company from
exploitation by individuals engaged in money laundering activities.
Accordingly, affected employees must:


.   become familiar with the anti-money laundering laws and their requirements
as applied to the Company; and


.   learn and fully comply with the Company's anti-money laundering policies
and procedures.


Failure to comply with applicable laws or the Company's policies may result in
significant criminal and civil penalties for the Company as well as for those
individuals involved. Furthermore, even association with money laundering
activity could subject both the Company and its employees to civil and criminal
penalties.



Lobbying and Political Contributions



Lobbying is generally defined as communicating with a public official, or a
member of his or her staff, in the legislative or executive branch of
government, for the purpose of influencing legislative or administrative
action. Lobbying is highly regulated and lobbyists are required to be
registered and to report their activities. No employee may engage in lobbying
on behalf of Phoenix without prior permission of the Law Department. The giving
of gifts to local public officials and members of their staff, whether in the
form of meals, tickets to events or otherwise, is strictly regulated by most
states and by the federal government. Special restrictions also apply to
employees who provide investment management services to public entities.
Employees must be careful to distinguish between personal and corporate
political activities. Unless specifically requested by the Company to
communicate on its behalf on a particular issue, you should identify
communications with legislators as expressing your own personal beliefs and not
those of Phoenix. The use of Phoenix stationery for any personal political
communication is prohibited. Any employee wishing to be a candidate for
elective office should consult with his or her supervisor and department head
in advance.


Questions regarding the Company's position on proposed legislation or
regulations should be directed to Government Relations or the Law Department.



Foreign Corrupt Practices Act



The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits the payment or authorization of the
payment of any money, or the giving of value, directly or indirectly, to a
foreign official for the purpose of:


.   influencing any act or decision of the foreign official; or


.   inducing the foreign official to use his influence to assist in obtaining
business for or directing business to any person.


A "foreign official" is any person acting in an official capacity on behalf of
a foreign government, agency, department or instrumentality. Also included
under the term "foreign official" are foreign political parties, officials of
political parties and candidates for foreign political office.


The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to all directors, employees and
agents of the Company. Violation of the act can result in both fines and
imprisonment.



Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents



Employees must avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of
others. Intellectual property includes copyrights, trademarks, service marks,
patents and trade secrets. Improper use includes copying, distributing or
modifying third party copyrighted materials without permission. Infringement
may result in criminal as well as civil liabilities for Phoenix and its
employees.


The Company has an agreement with the Copyright Clearance Center that gives a
license to Phoenix employees to make photocopies of many publications for
business purposes. Questions about the types of copying that are covered by the
agreement should be directed to the Corporate Compliance Department.






Commitment to Employees



Phoenix's employees are our most important asset and we are committed to
fostering a work environment in which employees have the opportunity to grow,
contribute and participate free from discrimination.



Equal Opportunity



The Company employs and promotes on the basis of merit and achievement without
regard to age, race, gender, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sexual
orientation, marital status, or disability. This policy applies to every phase
of the employment process and every aspect of the employment relationship:

recruitment, hiring, training, promotions, transfers, terminations, benefits,
compensation and participation in Company-sponsored educational, social and
recreational programs.



Sexual Harassment



The Company prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment
includes: unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other
verbal, visual or physical conduct when:


.   submission is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a
person's employment;


.   submission to or rejection of inappropriate conduct by an employee is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting the employee; or


.   the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an
individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.


Sexual harassment also includes: unwelcome sexual flirtations and advances;
verbal abuse of a sexual nature; inappropriate touching; graphic or verbal
comments about an individual's body; displaying in the workplace a sexually
suggestive object or picture; and sexually explicit or offensive jokes.



Employment of Relatives



Except in the limited circumstances described in this section, the Company does
not permit the employment of a director's or employee's "relative", which term
includes a spouse, domestic partner, child, parent, sibling, step-parent,
step-child, step-sibling, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece,
or first cousin including in-laws. Specifically, the Company prohibits the
hiring of a "relative" of any director or officer, or of any employee working
in the Corporate Audit, Corporate Compliance, Human Resources or Law
Departments. Although this policy does not require the termination of any
employee who becomes related to a person described in the preceding sentence
through a post-hiring event such as marriage or a promotion, any employee who
becomes "related" through such an occurrence should promptly advise his or her
supervisor. The Company will then take steps to assure that no employee reports
to or supervises a relative and that related employees do not work in the same
department or report to the same supervisor. The employment of a "relative" of
any officer at the level of Executive Vice President or higher will not be
permitted or accommodated even if the relationship results from a post-hiring
event.



Workplace Safety



The Company is committed to maintaining a work environment that is safe and
healthy for its employees and others. All job-related injuries or illnesses
should be reported immediately to your supervisor or Human Resources
representative. Questions concerning health and safety matters should also be
referred to one of them.


The Company does not tolerate acts of violence or threats of violence against
employees or Company property. Possession of firearms or other weapons anywhere
on Company property or while conducting Company business is prohibited. Any
situation or concern involving violent





behavior or the threat of violence should be immediately reported to Security
or Human Resources.



Drugs and Alcohol



The sale, purchase, use, possession or transfer of narcotics or other legally
controlled substances by employees while on Company premises or on Company
business (other than use of prescription drugs in accordance with a physician's
orders) is prohibited. Employees attending functions on behalf of the Company
where alcohol is served are expected to use good judgment and avoid consuming
excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages.



Felony Convictions



Federal law prohibits the employment by an insurance company, without the
consent of the appropriate state insurance department, of any person convicted
of a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust. To assist the Company in
fulfilling its responsibilities under this law, employees are required to
disclose any felony conviction to the Company at the time of application for
employment. Any employee who is subsequently convicted of a felony must report
this fact to the Company immediately.



Employee Ownership of Phoenix Stock



Employees and directors are subject to various requirements governing their
ownership of Company stock, including federal securities law and New York
insurance law. Please refer to the Insider Trading and Personal Trading section
of this Code (at page 1) for more information.



Commitment to Ethics and Compliance



A strong commitment to business ethics and compliance is the foundation of a
successful organization. Every employee is expected to carry out the Company's
business activities in an ethical manner and in a fashion consistent with
applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidelines.



Ethical Decision Making



Phoenix's success is dependent on each of us applying the highest ethical
standards to whatever we do on behalf of the Company. Employees should consider
the following questions before making decisions.


.   Is my action consistent with approved Company practices?


.   Is my action consistent with the Company's values?


.   Does my action give the appearance of impropriety?


.   Can I, in good conscience, defend my action to my supervisor, other
employees and the general public?


.   Does my action meet my personal code of ethical behavior?


.   Does my action conform to the spirit of these and all other applicable
guidelines?



Monitoring Code Compliance



The Corporate Compliance and the Corporate Audit Departments are responsible
for monitoring the compliance activities of all areas of the Company and for
ensuring that this Code of Conduct is being followed. Compliance will be
monitored by periodic audits where appropriate. Additionally, the Company's
Chief Compliance Officer must report annually to the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors on the level of compliance with our requirement that each
employee and director complete the Code of Conduct Acknowledgement and the
Conflict of Interest Declaration. Waivers of violations of the Code by
directors or by officers with a title of Senior Vice President or higher may
only be granted by the Audit Committee or the Board. Such waivers must be
promptly reported to shareholders. All other waivers, which may be granted by





the Chief Compliance Officer, the President or any Executive Vice President,
shall be reported to the Audit Committee but need not be reported to the
shareholders.



Toll-Free Help Line



Phoenix maintains a confidential, 24-hour, toll-free telephone help line for
employees for the purpose of requesting assistance concerning, or reporting
violations of, this Code or reporting complaints about accounting or auditing
matters. The number is: 1-800-813-8180.


Assistance is available during regular business hours. If you call outside of
regular business hours, you may leave a confidential message and your call will
be returned the following business day. Special security measures have been
taken with this help line to ensure confidentiality. If you wish to remain
anonymous, you may request a case identification number and refer to that
number in subsequent phone calls.



Obligation to Report



Employees are obligated to report suspected violations of this Code to their
department head, the Chief Compliance Officer or the Law Department.



Whistleblower Protection



No retaliation or retribution of any kind will be taken against an employee who,
in good faith, reports a suspected violation of this Code.



Investigation



All allegations of suspected violations will be promptly investigated and
appropriate action will be taken. Investigations will be conducted in an
objective, professional manner. The specifics of an investigation, including
the identity of the individual reporting the information, will be kept
confidential except as such disclosure is necessary to fully investigate the
allegations, facilitate resolution and/or report the results to appropriate
authorities.



Disclosure to Government Authorities



Certain actions and omissions prohibited by this Code may also violate criminal
laws and may subject violators to criminal prosecution. The Law Department will
review the results of investigations that indicate potential violations of
criminal law and recommend to the appropriate senior officers whether
disclosure to appropriate enforcement authorities is warranted.



Disciplinary Action for Violations



Failure to adhere to this Code, other Company policies or applicable laws or
government regulations may result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment. Situations in which disciplinary action may be
appropriate include the following, insofar as they relate to conduct of the
Company's business:


.   authorization of or participation in activities that violate the law,
government regulations, this Code or other Company policies;


.   retaliation, direct or indirect, or encouragement of others to retaliate
against a Company employee who reports a suspected violation;


.   failure to cooperate with an investigation of suspected violations,
including interfering with or obstructing an investigation; and


.   failure to report a suspected violation of the law, government regulations,
this Code or other Company policies.

The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net
realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a
return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all
of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of
capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment
performance and should not be confused with "yield" or "income."


The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only
estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual
amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon
the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and
may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a
Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these
distributions for federal income tax purposes.





Information regarding the Fund's performance and distribution rates is set
forth below. Please note that all performance figures are based on the Fund's
NAV and not the market price of the Fund's shares. Performance figures are not
meant to represent individual shareholder performance.
