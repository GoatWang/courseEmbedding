LAVAL, Quebec, Sep. 25, 2014 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (nyse/tsx:VRX) today announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Jeffrey W. Ubben, Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Investment Officer of ValueAct Capital, as a director of the Board, effective as of October 1, 2014.  Mr. Ubben is a Founder, Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Investment Officer of ValueAct Capital. Prior to founding ValueAct Capital in 2000, Mr. Ubben was a Managing Partner at Blum Capital Partners for more than five years. Mr. Ubben is a director of Willis Group Holdings plc, a former chairman and director of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc., and a former director of Acxiom Corp., Catalina Marketing Corp., Gartner Group, Inc., Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc., Mentor Corporation, Omnicare, Inc., Misys, plc, Per-Se Technologies, Inc., Sara Lee Corp. and several other public and private companies. In addition, Mr. Ubben serves as chairman of the national board of the Posse Foundation, is on the board of trustees of Northwestern University, and is also on the board of the American Conservatory Theater. Mr. Ubben has a B.A. from Duke University and an M.B.A. from the J. L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.  "ValueAct is delighted to once again be a part of the Valeant Board of Directors," stated Jeffrey W. Ubben, chief executive officer of ValueAct Capital. "Valeant has been an important component to ValueAct's success over the past seven years and we strongly believe in Valeant's business model and strategy. Valeant has become significantly undervalued on a standalone basis due to recent unjustified attacks on the company. We are strongly supportive of the Allergan-Valeant combination in light of their perfect strategic fit and the potential to create enormous shareholder value for both companies. ValueAct has not reduced its position in Valeant since leaving the Board in May and we expect to increase our already substantial position in Valeant. I look forward to working with Mike and the Board of Directors to help secure the Allergan transaction and then continuing to serve on the Board to deliver long-term value to all shareholders."  "It is a privilege and an honor to have Jeff, as ValueAct's most senior partner and the chief executive officer of ValueAct, join our Board," stated J. Michael Pearson, chairman and chief executive officer of Valeant. "Jeff believes in Valeant's long-term potential and his expertise and counsel as a committed, long-term Valeant shareholder will be invaluable to me personally, as well as to the entire Board, as we continue to execute on our strategy to become a leading pharmaceutical company. It is incredibly valuable to have such a highly respected firm such as ValueAct, whose focus is on long-term value creation, to be completely aligned with us as we execute our strategy."  About Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.

        Jeffrey W. Ubben, CEO Of ValueAct Capital, Appointed To The Board Of Valeant Pharmaceuticals
        
      
    









September 25, 2014






LAVAL, Quebec, Sept. 25, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (NYSE/TSX: VRX) today announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Jeffrey W. Ubben, Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Investment Officer of ValueAct Capital, as a director of the Board, effective as of October 1, 2014.
Mr. Ubben is a Founder, Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Investment Officer of ValueAct Capital. Prior to founding ValueAct Capital in 2000, Mr. Ubben was a Managing Partner at Blum Capital Partners for more than five years.  Mr. Ubben is a director of Willis Group Holdings plc, a former chairman and director of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc., and a former director of Acxiom Corp., Catalina Marketing Corp., Gartner Group, Inc., Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc., Mentor Corporation, Omnicare, Inc., Misys, plc, Per-Se Technologies, Inc., Sara Lee Corp. and several other public and private companies.  In addition, Mr. Ubben serves as chairman of the national board of the Posse Foundation, is on the board of trustees of Northwestern University, and is also on the board of the American Conservatory Theater.  Mr. Ubben has a B.A. from Duke University and an M.B.A. from the J. L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.
"ValueAct is delighted to once again be a part of the Valeant Board of Directors," stated Jeffrey W. Ubben, chief executive officer of ValueAct Capital.  "Valeant has been an important component to ValueAct's success over the past seven years and we strongly believe in Valeant's business model and strategy. Valeant has become significantly undervalued on a standalone basis due to recent unjustified attacks on the company.  We are strongly supportive of the Allergan-Valeant combination in light of their perfect strategic fit and the potential to create enormous shareholder value for both companies.  ValueAct has not reduced its position in Valeant since leaving the Board in May and we expect to increase our already substantial position in Valeant. I look forward to working with Mike and the Board of Directors to help secure the Allergan transaction and then continuing to serve on the Board to deliver long-term value to all shareholders." 
"It is a privilege and an honor to have Jeff, as ValueAct's most senior partner and the chief executive officer of ValueAct, join our Board," stated J. Michael Pearson, chairman and chief executive officer of Valeant.  "Jeff believes in Valeant's long-term potential and his expertise and counsel as a committed, long-term Valeant shareholder will be invaluable to me personally, as well as to the entire Board, as we continue to execute on our strategy to become a leading pharmaceutical company.  It is incredibly valuable to have such a highly respected firm such as ValueAct, whose focus is on long-term value creation, to be completely aligned with us as we execute our strategy."
About Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (NYSE/TSX: VRX) is a multinational specialty pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products primarily in the areas of dermatology, eye health, neurology  and branded generics.

LAVAL, Quebec, Sept. 25, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (NYSE/TSX: VRX) today announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Jeffrey W. Ubben, Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Investment Officer of ValueAct Capital, as a director of the Board, effective as of October 1, 2014.
Mr. Ubben is a Founder, Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Investment Officer of ValueAct Capital. Prior to founding ValueAct Capital in 2000, Mr. Ubben was a Managing Partner at Blum Capital Partners for more than five years.  Mr. Ubben is a director of Willis Group Holdings plc, a former chairman and director of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc., and a former director of Acxiom Corp., Catalina Marketing Corp., Gartner Group, Inc., Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc., Mentor Corporation, Omnicare, Inc., Misys, plc, Per-Se Technologies, Inc., Sara Lee Corp. and several other public and private companies.  In addition, Mr. Ubben serves as chairman of the national board of the Posse Foundation, is on the board of trustees of Northwestern University, and is also on the board of the American Conservatory Theater.  Mr. Ubben has a B.A. from Duke University and an M.B.A. from the J. L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.
"ValueAct is delighted to once again be a part of the Valeant Board of Directors," stated Jeffrey W. Ubben, chief executive officer of ValueAct Capital.  "Valeant has been an important component to ValueAct's success over the past seven years and we strongly believe in Valeant's business model and strategy. Valeant has become significantly undervalued on a standalone basis due to recent unjustified attacks on the company.  We are strongly supportive of the Allergan-Valeant combination in light of their perfect strategic fit and the potential to create enormous shareholder value for both companies.  ValueAct has not reduced its position in Valeant since leaving the Board in May and we expect to increase our already substantial position in Valeant. I look forward to working with Mike and the Board of Directors to help secure the Allergan transaction and then continuing to serve on the Board to deliver long-term value to all shareholders." 
"It is a privilege and an honor to have Jeff, as ValueAct's most senior partner and the chief executive officer of ValueAct, join our Board," stated J. Michael Pearson, chairman and chief executive officer of Valeant.  "Jeff believes in Valeant's long-term potential and his expertise and counsel as a committed, long-term Valeant shareholder will be invaluable to me personally, as well as to the entire Board, as we continue to execute on our strategy to become a leading pharmaceutical company.  It is incredibly valuable to have such a highly respected firm such as ValueAct, whose focus is on long-term value creation, to be completely aligned with us as we execute our strategy."
About Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (NYSE/TSX: VRX) is a multinational specialty pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products primarily in the areas of dermatology, eye health, neurology  and branded generics.

Forward-looking Statements 
This communication may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Canadian securities laws.  These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding Valeant's offer to acquire Allergan, its financing of the proposed transaction, its expected future performance (including expected results of operations and financial guidance), and the combined company's future financial condition, operating results, strategy and plans.  Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of the words "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "should," "could," "would," "may," "will," "believes," "estimates," "potential," "target," "opportunity," "tentative," "positioning," "designed," "create," "predict," "project," "seek," "ongoing," "upside," "increases" or "continue" and variations or similar expressions. These statements are based upon the current expectations and beliefs of management and are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties that change over time and could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.  These assumptions, risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, assumptions, risks and uncertainties discussed in the company's most recent annual or quarterly report filed with the SEC and the Canadian Securities Administrators (the "CSA") and assumptions, risks and uncertainties relating to the proposed merger, as detailed from time to time in Valeant's filings with the SEC and the CSA, which factors are incorporated herein by reference.  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make in this communication are set forth in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the SEC and the CSA, and include, but are not limited to:

the ultimate outcome of the offer and the second-step merger, including the ultimate removal or the failure to render inapplicable the obstacles to consummation of the offer and the second-step merger described in the offer to exchange; 
the ultimate outcome and results of integrating the operations of Valeant and Allergan, the ultimate outcome of Valeant's pricing and operating strategy applied to Allergan and the ultimate ability to realize synergies; 
the effects of the proposed combination of Valeant and Allergan, including the combined company's future financial condition, operating results, strategy and plans;

the ability to obtain regulatory approvals and meet other conditions to the offer, including the necessary stockholder approval, on a timely basis; 
Valeant's ability to sustain and grow revenues and cash flow from operations in our markets and to maintain and grow our customer base, the need for innovation and the related capital expenditures and the unpredictable economic conditions in the United States and other markets; 
the impact of competition from other market participants; 
the development and commercialization of new products; 
the availability and access, in general, of funds to meet our debt obligations prior to or when they become due and to fund our operations and necessary capital expenditures, either through (i) cash on hand, (ii) free cash flow, or (iii) access to the capital or credit markets; 
our ability to comply with all covenants in our indentures and credit facilities, any violation of which, if not cured in a timely manner, could trigger a default of our other obligations under cross-default provisions; and 
the risks and uncertainties detailed by Allergan with respect to its business as described in its reports and documents filed with the SEC.
All forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof.  Valeant undertakes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this communication or to reflect actual outcomes.
