What is Lithium?
Lithium is a the chemical element with an atomic number 3, a soft silver-white metal. It is the lightest of the alkali metals.
Uses of Lithium
Electrical and Electronics:

Lithium batteries are usually disposable with lithium compounds as an anode.

Lithium niobates (lithium, niobium and oxygen) are used extensively in telecommunication products such as mobile phones and optical modulators.

Chemicals:

Lithium chloride & lithium bromide are extremely hygroscopic (the ability of a substance to attract water molecules from the surrounding environment through either absorption or adsorption.) and are used as desiccant (Induces or sustains a state of dryness in its local vicinity in a moderately well-sealed container).
Used in preparation of organo-lithium compounds to create strong bases in opposition of strong alkaline composites.

General Engineering:

Lithium stearate is a common all-purpose, high-temperature lubricant.
Promotes the fusing of metals while eliminating the forming of oxides by absorbing impurities from the base elements.

Optics:

Lithium fluoride, artificially grown as crystal, is clear and transparent and often used in specialist optics for IR, UV and VUV (vacuum UV) applications.
Sometimes used in focal lenses, including spectacles.

Rocket Propulsion:

Its complex hydrides, such a Li[AlH4], are used as high energy additives to rocket propellants.

Nuclear:

Lithium deuteride was the fusion fuel of choice in early versions of the hydrogen bomb.
Lithium fluoride (highly enriched in the common isotope lithium-7) forms the basic constituent of the preferred fluoride salt mixture (LiF-BeF2) used in liquid-fluoride nuclear reactors.
