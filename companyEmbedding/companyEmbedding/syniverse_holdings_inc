Intelligent Quality Roaming

Infographic: Intelligent Roaming
Ensure ubiquitous high-quality service 
Syniverse has an unwavering commitment to help you grow your roaming business. Our philosophy is that the full potential of roaming has been reached only when roamers consume the same amount of service when roaming as they do when on their home networks. And we know that the foundation of achieving this success is having the ability to have visibility into and to influence the quality of the subscribers’ experience at the times it matters to them. 
Understand and influence user experience when it counts 
Subscribers’ acceptance of a contextually deployed roaming pack is made on the basis that quality will match that of their home environment. To this end, with multiple thousands of users dispersed on hundreds of networks at a given point, how can roaming quality expectations be met? 
Intelligent quality roaming uses real-time detection to gain a live snapshot of when, where and how subscribers connect. Then this insight can be leveraged to ensure the quality of their connections through monitoring, analysis and troubleshooting. 
Multiprotocol network analytics provide operators visibility and control to meet roaming subscriber expectations through the following capabilities:

Success, failure rate and failure identification 
Subscriber-level management 
Individual country and operator heat maps
Proactive alerting 
Real-time session updates.

History[edit]
Syniverse was established in 1987 as a GTE business unit, GTE Telecommunication Services Inc. (GTE TSI).[5] Soon after, the company launched voice clearing, settlement and exchange, post-call validation, and message rating services. During the following years, it established several call delivery, fraud and roaming products. In 1993, it developed the first wireless SS7 network to support intelligent network-based services.[citation needed]
In 1998, the company began to offer its services globally, providing interoperability services to Australia, China, Japan and Korea. It received an international leadership award two years later for expansion between Korea, Hong Kong, Japan and North America.[citation needed]
In 2000, the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Information Services Inc. In 2001, the company changed its name from GTE TSI Telecommunication Services Inc. to Verizon Telecommunication Services Inc. That year, the company introduced several services. One was a global GRX service to allow GPRS users access to high-speed mobile Internet services. Another was a suite of mobile data services, including international SMS interoperability.
In 2002, TSI became an independent, private corporation after being acquired by a private investment group changing its name again to just Telecommunication Services Inc. In 2004, the company changed its corporate name to Syniverse Technologies.[6]
On Feb. 10, 2005, Syniverse became a public company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SVR.[7] Also in 2005, the company developed a platform to distribute wireless AMBER AlertTM messages about missing children in the United States;[8] offered the first 1xRTT/1xEV-DO solution to enable mobile data roaming for CDMA subscribers;[9] and became a founding investor, board member and technical participant of dotMobi, the registry for the .mobi domain.[10]
In 2006, Syniverse acquired Interactive Technology Holdings Limited (ITHL), expanding the company’s customer base in Asia Pacific and adding new products.[11] The following year, Syniverse was appointed to provide wireless number portability services to both Singapore[12] and Canada,[13] and acquired the wireless data and financial clearing business of Billing Services Group Limited (BSG), expanding Syniverse’s global business.[14]
In 2009, Syniverse became part of Standard & Poor’s Midcap 400 under the Global Industry Classification Index (GCIS) Wireless Telecommunications Services Sub-industry index[15] and was selected as one of two companies selected to provide mobile number portability in India.[16] Syniverse also acquired Wireless Solutions International (WSI) in 2009[17] and VeriSign, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:VRSN) Messaging and Mobile Media Services.[18]
Syniverse began delivering text messages free of charge to pregnant and expecting mothers with the Text4baby initiative in 2010.[19] In that same year, the company was chosen by CTIA - The Wireless Association to support the Latin America common short code (CSC) initiative. Syniverse uses its web-based platform to incorporate registry, CSC search and payment functionality.[20]
On Jan. 13, 2011, Syniverse became a private corporation after being acquired by an affiliate of The Carlyle Group for approximately $2.6 billion.[21] Shortly thereafter at Mobile World Congress 2011 in Barcelona, Spain, Syniverse unveiled its Mobile Video Broadcast Service, the industry’s first video communication solution that is interoperable across platforms, devices and networks. This service enables an operator’s subscribers to send live video to mobile handsets, PCs and social networks, delivering live peer-to-peer video communication as easily as sending an SMS.[22]
In July 2013, Syniverse acquired MACH, adding significant capabilities within the roaming, messaging, network and fraud space that help to simplify complexities of the mobile landscape and enable all types of mobile service providers around the globe to deliver the experiences their end users demand.[23]
On August 4, 2014, Syniverse announced that it completed its acquisition of Aicent. This acquisition is expected to expand Syniverse’s global communications network, drive increased value to customers through augmented real-time intelligence services, and extend the company’s global reach to mobile subscribers, enterprises and mobile operators.[24]
In 2015, Syniverse helped contribute to an industry milestone by enabling a U.S. operator and a Japanese operator to implement the world’s first transoceanic VoLTE (Voice over Long Term Evolution) roaming call.[25] Similarly, that same year, Syniverse made another major accomplishment by helping Western Union strengthen its customer loyalty program with a text-messaging solution that provided the financial institution the capability to send reward redemption offers for opted-in customers, and the capability for customers to send messages to check their point balances and redeem eligible rewards.[26]
Today, the company connects more than 1,500 mobile service providers and enterprises in nearly 200 countries.
Awards[edit]
In the last few years, Syniverse’s awards have included the following:

History[edit]
Syniverse was established in 1987 as a GTE business unit, GTE Telecommunication Services Inc. (GTE TSI).[5] Soon after, the company launched voice clearing, settlement and exchange, post-call validation, and message rating services. During the following years, it established several call delivery, fraud and roaming products. In 1993, it developed the first wireless SS7 network to support intelligent network-based services.[citation needed]
In 1998, the company began to offer its services globally, providing interoperability services to Australia, China, Japan and Korea. It received an international leadership award two years later for expansion between Korea, Hong Kong, Japan and North America.[citation needed]
In 2000, the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Information Services Inc. In 2001, the company changed its name from GTE TSI Telecommunication Services Inc. to Verizon Telecommunication Services Inc. That year, the company introduced several services. One was a global GRX service to allow GPRS users access to high-speed mobile Internet services. Another was a suite of mobile data services, including international SMS interoperability.
In 2002, TSI became an independent, private corporation after being acquired by a private investment group changing its name again to just Telecommunication Services Inc. In 2004, the company changed its corporate name to Syniverse Technologies.[6]
On Feb. 10, 2005, Syniverse became a public company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SVR.[7] Also in 2005, the company developed a platform to distribute wireless AMBER AlertTM messages about missing children in the United States;[8] offered the first 1xRTT/1xEV-DO solution to enable mobile data roaming for CDMA subscribers;[9] and became a founding investor, board member and technical participant of dotMobi, the registry for the .mobi domain.[10]
In 2006, Syniverse acquired Interactive Technology Holdings Limited (ITHL), expanding the company’s customer base in Asia Pacific and adding new products.[11] The following year, Syniverse was appointed to provide wireless number portability services to both Singapore[12] and Canada,[13] and acquired the wireless data and financial clearing business of Billing Services Group Limited (BSG), expanding Syniverse’s global business.[14]
In 2009, Syniverse became part of Standard & Poor’s Midcap 400 under the Global Industry Classification Index (GCIS) Wireless Telecommunications Services Sub-industry index[15] and was selected as one of two companies selected to provide mobile number portability in India.[16] Syniverse also acquired Wireless Solutions International (WSI) in 2009[17] and VeriSign, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:VRSN) Messaging and Mobile Media Services.[18]
Syniverse began delivering text messages free of charge to pregnant and expecting mothers with the Text4baby initiative in 2010.[19] In that same year, the company was chosen by CTIA - The Wireless Association to support the Latin America common short code (CSC) initiative. Syniverse uses its web-based platform to incorporate registry, CSC search and payment functionality.[20]
On Jan. 13, 2011, Syniverse became a private corporation after being acquired by an affiliate of The Carlyle Group for approximately $2.6 billion.[21] Shortly thereafter at Mobile World Congress 2011 in Barcelona, Spain, Syniverse unveiled its Mobile Video Broadcast Service, the industry’s first video communication solution that is interoperable across platforms, devices and networks. This service enables an operator’s subscribers to send live video to mobile handsets, PCs and social networks, delivering live peer-to-peer video communication as easily as sending an SMS.[22]
In July 2013, Syniverse acquired MACH, adding significant capabilities within the roaming, messaging, network and fraud space that help to simplify complexities of the mobile landscape and enable all types of mobile service providers around the globe to deliver the experiences their end users demand.[23]
On August 4, 2014, Syniverse announced that it completed its acquisition of Aicent. This acquisition is expected to expand Syniverse’s global communications network, drive increased value to customers through augmented real-time intelligence services, and extend the company’s global reach to mobile subscribers, enterprises and mobile operators.[24]
In 2015, Syniverse helped contribute to an industry milestone by enabling a U.S. operator and a Japanese operator to implement the world’s first transoceanic VoLTE (Voice over Long Term Evolution) roaming call.[25] Similarly, that same year, Syniverse made another major accomplishment by helping Western Union strengthen its customer loyalty program with a text-messaging solution that provided the financial institution the capability to send reward redemption offers for opted-in customers, and the capability for customers to send messages to check their point balances and redeem eligible rewards.[26]
Today, the company connects more than 1,500 mobile service providers and enterprises in nearly 200 countries.
Awards[edit]
In the last few years, Syniverse’s awards have included the following:

GSMA's Global Mobile Award for Best Roaming Product or Service for Syniverse DataNet, the company's near-real time roaming data exchange (NRTRDE) solution that protects network operators and their subscribers from fraud and makes fraud easier to detect and resolve.[27]
Syniverse CEO Steve Gray was named to the Global Telecoms Business Power100.[28]
Syniverse was recognized as an E-Tech award winner for Location and Proximity Services for its partnership with MasterCard that gives financial institutions the ability to compare credit card transaction locations with their cardholders' mobile device location.[29]
Syniverse was selected as a Competitive Carriers Association Associate Member Annual Achievement Award winner for its involvement with local and national charities and encouragement of employees to stay involved through community service, material contributions or monetary donations.[30]
Syniverse Chief Marketing Officer Mary Clark was included in the Hot Topics list of 100 most innovative CMOs in the world.[31]
Syniverse was recognized by Global Telecoms Business for launching the first domestic LTE roaming service in the U.S., in collaboration with GCI, Alaska's largest telecom company.[32]
Syniverse IPX was recognized at the 2015 LTE Awards with an award for Best Roaming Solution.[33]

Syniverse Holdings, Inc. Key Developments

Syniverse Enables Cable & Wireless Seychelles to Improve LTE Roaming User Experience
Jul 20 17
Syniverse announced that it has signed an agreement with Cable & Wireless Seychelles to help the operator improve roaming experiences for inbound and outbound roaming customers. The agreement builds on a multiyear relationship and marks another step in Cable & Wireless Seychelles’ ability to deliver the highest level of roaming experience and maximize revenues in a rapidly growing tourism market. LTE roaming has become a critical mobile service in the Seychelles as the number of tourists and visiting, or inbound, roamers has soared over the past few years and far exceeded the nation’s 94,000-plus citizens. According to the United Nations World Travel Organisation Tourism Barometer, the Seychelles saw a more than 18% rise in number of tourists in 2015, and, in 2016, and this number rose by almost 11% to 304,000 visitors from 275,000. To help Cable & Wireless Seychelles better manage the roaming experiences for this growing number, Syniverse will implement Syniverse Network Monitoring and Alerting as part of its global, reliable and secure platform. The service uses Syniverse’s roaming-data-monitoring product, Total Visibility, to provide a holistic approach to roaming that enables operators to efficiently and proactively solve subscribers’ problems and tailor their individual experiences in real time. With a flexible, cloud-based framework, Syniverse Network Monitoring and Alerting enables an operator to select only the capabilities that specifically pertain to its specific service features and implementation requirements. Syniverse’s agreement builds on a long-standing customer relationship with Cable & Wireless Seychelles as well as on Syniverse’s recent LTE work. Syniverse began working with Cable & Wireless Seychelles in 2008 with the implementation of data clearing services offered through Syniverse’s Revenue Management portfolio, built on the relationship with the use of Risk Management services and GRX services, and most recently expanded the relationship with the implementation of LTE roaming service.

History[edit]
Syniverse was established in 1987 as a GTE business unit, GTE Telecommunication Services Inc. (GTE TSI).[5] Soon after, the company launched voice clearing, settlement and exchange, post-call validation, and message rating services. During the following years, it established several call delivery, fraud and roaming products. In 1993, it developed the first wireless SS7 network to support intelligent network-based services.[citation needed]
In 1998, the company began to offer its services globally, providing interoperability services to Australia, China, Japan and Korea. It received an international leadership award two years later for expansion between Korea, Hong Kong, Japan and North America.[citation needed]
In 2000, the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Information Services Inc. In 2001, the company changed its name from GTE TSI Telecommunication Services Inc. to Verizon Telecommunication Services Inc. That year, the company introduced several services. One was a global GRX service to allow GPRS users access to high-speed mobile Internet services. Another was a suite of mobile data services, including international SMS interoperability.
In 2002, TSI became an independent, private corporation after being acquired by a private investment group changing its name again to just Telecommunication Services Inc. In 2004, the company changed its corporate name to Syniverse Technologies.[6]
On Feb. 10, 2005, Syniverse became a public company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SVR.[7] Also in 2005, the company developed a platform to distribute wireless AMBER AlertTM messages about missing children in the United States;[8] offered the first 1xRTT/1xEV-DO solution to enable mobile data roaming for CDMA subscribers;[9] and became a founding investor, board member and technical participant of dotMobi, the registry for the .mobi domain.[10]
In 2006, Syniverse acquired Interactive Technology Holdings Limited (ITHL), expanding the company’s customer base in Asia Pacific and adding new products.[11] The following year, Syniverse was appointed to provide wireless number portability services to both Singapore[12] and Canada,[13] and acquired the wireless data and financial clearing business of Billing Services Group Limited (BSG), expanding Syniverse’s global business.[14]
In 2009, Syniverse became part of Standard & Poor’s Midcap 400 under the Global Industry Classification Index (GCIS) Wireless Telecommunications Services Sub-industry index[15] and was selected as one of two companies selected to provide mobile number portability in India.[16] Syniverse also acquired Wireless Solutions International (WSI) in 2009[17] and VeriSign, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:VRSN) Messaging and Mobile Media Services.[18]
Syniverse began delivering text messages free of charge to pregnant and expecting mothers with the Text4baby initiative in 2010.[19] In that same year, the company was chosen by CTIA - The Wireless Association to support the Latin America common short code (CSC) initiative. Syniverse uses its web-based platform to incorporate registry, CSC search and payment functionality.[20]
On Jan. 13, 2011, Syniverse became a private corporation after being acquired by an affiliate of The Carlyle Group for approximately $2.6 billion.[21] Shortly thereafter at Mobile World Congress 2011 in Barcelona, Spain, Syniverse unveiled its Mobile Video Broadcast Service, the industry’s first video communication solution that is interoperable across platforms, devices and networks. This service enables an operator’s subscribers to send live video to mobile handsets, PCs and social networks, delivering live peer-to-peer video communication as easily as sending an SMS.[22]
In July 2013, Syniverse acquired MACH, adding significant capabilities within the roaming, messaging, network and fraud space that help to simplify complexities of the mobile landscape and enable all types of mobile service providers around the globe to deliver the experiences their end users demand.[23]
On August 4, 2014, Syniverse announced that it completed its acquisition of Aicent. This acquisition is expected to expand Syniverse’s global communications network, drive increased value to customers through augmented real-time intelligence services, and extend the company’s global reach to mobile subscribers, enterprises and mobile operators.[24]
In 2015, Syniverse helped contribute to an industry milestone by enabling a U.S. operator and a Japanese operator to implement the world’s first transoceanic VoLTE (Voice over Long Term Evolution) roaming call.[25] Similarly, that same year, Syniverse made another major accomplishment by helping Western Union strengthen its customer loyalty program with a text-messaging solution that provided the financial institution the capability to send reward redemption offers for opted-in customers, and the capability for customers to send messages to check their point balances and redeem eligible rewards.[26]
Today, the company connects more than 1,500 mobile service providers and enterprises in nearly 200 countries.
Awards[edit]
In the last few years, Syniverse’s awards have included the following:

The company’s global headquarters are in Tampa, Florida, U.S., and it has regional headquarters in Costa Rica, Argentina, Dubai, Luxembourg and Hong Kong.[3]

History[edit]
Syniverse was established in 1987 as a GTE business unit, GTE Telecommunication Services Inc. (GTE TSI).[5] Soon after, the company launched voice clearing, settlement and exchange, post-call validation, and message rating services. During the following years, it established several call delivery, fraud and roaming products. In 1993, it developed the first wireless SS7 network to support intelligent network-based services.[citation needed]
In 1998, the company began to offer its services globally, providing interoperability services to Australia, China, Japan and Korea. It received an international leadership award two years later for expansion between Korea, Hong Kong, Japan and North America.[citation needed]
In 2000, the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Information Services Inc. In 2001, the company changed its name from GTE TSI Telecommunication Services Inc. to Verizon Telecommunication Services Inc. That year, the company introduced several services. One was a global GRX service to allow GPRS users access to high-speed mobile Internet services. Another was a suite of mobile data services, including international SMS interoperability.
In 2002, TSI became an independent, private corporation after being acquired by a private investment group changing its name again to just Telecommunication Services Inc. In 2004, the company changed its corporate name to Syniverse Technologies.[6]
On Feb. 10, 2005, Syniverse became a public company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SVR.[7] Also in 2005, the company developed a platform to distribute wireless AMBER AlertTM messages about missing children in the United States;[8] offered the first 1xRTT/1xEV-DO solution to enable mobile data roaming for CDMA subscribers;[9] and became a founding investor, board member and technical participant of dotMobi, the registry for the .mobi domain.[10]
In 2006, Syniverse acquired Interactive Technology Holdings Limited (ITHL), expanding the company’s customer base in Asia Pacific and adding new products.[11] The following year, Syniverse was appointed to provide wireless number portability services to both Singapore[12] and Canada,[13] and acquired the wireless data and financial clearing business of Billing Services Group Limited (BSG), expanding Syniverse’s global business.[14]
In 2009, Syniverse became part of Standard & Poor’s Midcap 400 under the Global Industry Classification Index (GCIS) Wireless Telecommunications Services Sub-industry index[15] and was selected as one of two companies selected to provide mobile number portability in India.[16] Syniverse also acquired Wireless Solutions International (WSI) in 2009[17] and VeriSign, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:VRSN) Messaging and Mobile Media Services.[18]
Syniverse began delivering text messages free of charge to pregnant and expecting mothers with the Text4baby initiative in 2010.[19] In that same year, the company was chosen by CTIA - The Wireless Association to support the Latin America common short code (CSC) initiative. Syniverse uses its web-based platform to incorporate registry, CSC search and payment functionality.[20]
On Jan. 13, 2011, Syniverse became a private corporation after being acquired by an affiliate of The Carlyle Group for approximately $2.6 billion.[21] Shortly thereafter at Mobile World Congress 2011 in Barcelona, Spain, Syniverse unveiled its Mobile Video Broadcast Service, the industry’s first video communication solution that is interoperable across platforms, devices and networks. This service enables an operator’s subscribers to send live video to mobile handsets, PCs and social networks, delivering live peer-to-peer video communication as easily as sending an SMS.[22]
In July 2013, Syniverse acquired MACH, adding significant capabilities within the roaming, messaging, network and fraud space that help to simplify complexities of the mobile landscape and enable all types of mobile service providers around the globe to deliver the experiences their end users demand.[23]
On August 4, 2014, Syniverse announced that it completed its acquisition of Aicent. This acquisition is expected to expand Syniverse’s global communications network, drive increased value to customers through augmented real-time intelligence services, and extend the company’s global reach to mobile subscribers, enterprises and mobile operators.[24]
In 2015, Syniverse helped contribute to an industry milestone by enabling a U.S. operator and a Japanese operator to implement the world’s first transoceanic VoLTE (Voice over Long Term Evolution) roaming call.[25] Similarly, that same year, Syniverse made another major accomplishment by helping Western Union strengthen its customer loyalty program with a text-messaging solution that provided the financial institution the capability to send reward redemption offers for opted-in customers, and the capability for customers to send messages to check their point balances and redeem eligible rewards.[26]
Today, the company connects more than 1,500 mobile service providers and enterprises in nearly 200 countries.
Awards[edit]
In the last few years, Syniverse’s awards have included the following:

GSMA's Global Mobile Award for Best Roaming Product or Service for Syniverse DataNet, the company's near-real time roaming data exchange (NRTRDE) solution that protects network operators and their subscribers from fraud and makes fraud easier to detect and resolve.[27]
Syniverse CEO Steve Gray was named to the Global Telecoms Business Power100.[28]
Syniverse was recognized as an E-Tech award winner for Location and Proximity Services for its partnership with MasterCard that gives financial institutions the ability to compare credit card transaction locations with their cardholders' mobile device location.[29]
Syniverse was selected as a Competitive Carriers Association Associate Member Annual Achievement Award winner for its involvement with local and national charities and encouragement of employees to stay involved through community service, material contributions or monetary donations.[30]
Syniverse Chief Marketing Officer Mary Clark was included in the Hot Topics list of 100 most innovative CMOs in the world.[31]
Syniverse was recognized by Global Telecoms Business for launching the first domestic LTE roaming service in the U.S., in collaboration with GCI, Alaska's largest telecom company.[32]
Syniverse IPX was recognized at the 2015 LTE Awards with an award for Best Roaming Solution.[33]
Syniverse CMO Mary Clark was named to Mobile Marketer’s list of Mobile Women to Watch for 2016.[34]

The company’s solutions make it possible for disparate technologies and standards to interoperate, so operators in the mobile industry can provide their subscribers with access to voice calling, messaging, data and other services as users move across networks around the world. The solutions also help enterprises optimize mobile engagement and improve business processes through the delivery of timely, relevant information that personalizes the mobile user experience, increases customer loyalty and promotes brand loyalty.[2] The company began in 1987 as a GTE business unit called GTE Telecommunications Services Inc.
The company’s global headquarters are in Tampa, Florida, U.S., and it has regional headquarters in Costa Rica, Argentina, Dubai, Luxembourg and Hong Kong.[3]
Syniverse is ISO 9001:2008 certified and TL 9000 approved, meaning the company adheres to the principles of customer focus and quality improvement practices.[4]

History[edit]
Syniverse was established in 1987 as a GTE business unit, GTE Telecommunication Services Inc. (GTE TSI).[5] Soon after, the company launched voice clearing, settlement and exchange, post-call validation, and message rating services. During the following years, it established several call delivery, fraud and roaming products. In 1993, it developed the first wireless SS7 network to support intelligent network-based services.[citation needed]
In 1998, the company began to offer its services globally, providing interoperability services to Australia, China, Japan and Korea. It received an international leadership award two years later for expansion between Korea, Hong Kong, Japan and North America.[citation needed]
In 2000, the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Information Services Inc. In 2001, the company changed its name from GTE TSI Telecommunication Services Inc. to Verizon Telecommunication Services Inc. That year, the company introduced several services. One was a global GRX service to allow GPRS users access to high-speed mobile Internet services. Another was a suite of mobile data services, including international SMS interoperability.
In 2002, TSI became an independent, private corporation after being acquired by a private investment group changing its name again to just Telecommunication Services Inc. In 2004, the company changed its corporate name to Syniverse Technologies.[6]
On Feb. 10, 2005, Syniverse became a public company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SVR.[7] Also in 2005, the company developed a platform to distribute wireless AMBER AlertTM messages about missing children in the United States;[8] offered the first 1xRTT/1xEV-DO solution to enable mobile data roaming for CDMA subscribers;[9] and became a founding investor, board member and technical participant of dotMobi, the registry for the .mobi domain.[10]
In 2006, Syniverse acquired Interactive Technology Holdings Limited (ITHL), expanding the company’s customer base in Asia Pacific and adding new products.[11] The following year, Syniverse was appointed to provide wireless number portability services to both Singapore[12] and Canada,[13] and acquired the wireless data and financial clearing business of Billing Services Group Limited (BSG), expanding Syniverse’s global business.[14]
In 2009, Syniverse became part of Standard & Poor’s Midcap 400 under the Global Industry Classification Index (GCIS) Wireless Telecommunications Services Sub-industry index[15] and was selected as one of two companies selected to provide mobile number portability in India.[16] Syniverse also acquired Wireless Solutions International (WSI) in 2009[17] and VeriSign, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:VRSN) Messaging and Mobile Media Services.[18]
Syniverse began delivering text messages free of charge to pregnant and expecting mothers with the Text4baby initiative in 2010.[19] In that same year, the company was chosen by CTIA - The Wireless Association to support the Latin America common short code (CSC) initiative. Syniverse uses its web-based platform to incorporate registry, CSC search and payment functionality.[20]
On Jan. 13, 2011, Syniverse became a private corporation after being acquired by an affiliate of The Carlyle Group for approximately $2.6 billion.[21] Shortly thereafter at Mobile World Congress 2011 in Barcelona, Spain, Syniverse unveiled its Mobile Video Broadcast Service, the industry’s first video communication solution that is interoperable across platforms, devices and networks. This service enables an operator’s subscribers to send live video to mobile handsets, PCs and social networks, delivering live peer-to-peer video communication as easily as sending an SMS.[22]
In July 2013, Syniverse acquired MACH, adding significant capabilities within the roaming, messaging, network and fraud space that help to simplify complexities of the mobile landscape and enable all types of mobile service providers around the globe to deliver the experiences their end users demand.[23]
On August 4, 2014, Syniverse announced that it completed its acquisition of Aicent. This acquisition is expected to expand Syniverse’s global communications network, drive increased value to customers through augmented real-time intelligence services, and extend the company’s global reach to mobile subscribers, enterprises and mobile operators.[24]
In 2015, Syniverse helped contribute to an industry milestone by enabling a U.S. operator and a Japanese operator to implement the world’s first transoceanic VoLTE (Voice over Long Term Evolution) roaming call.[25] Similarly, that same year, Syniverse made another major accomplishment by helping Western Union strengthen its customer loyalty program with a text-messaging solution that provided the financial institution the capability to send reward redemption offers for opted-in customers, and the capability for customers to send messages to check their point balances and redeem eligible rewards.[26]
Today, the company connects more than 1,500 mobile service providers and enterprises in nearly 200 countries.
Awards[edit]
In the last few years, Syniverse’s awards have included the following:

GSMA's Global Mobile Award for Best Roaming Product or Service for Syniverse DataNet, the company's near-real time roaming data exchange (NRTRDE) solution that protects network operators and their subscribers from fraud and makes fraud easier to detect and resolve.[27]
Syniverse CEO Steve Gray was named to the Global Telecoms Business Power100.[28]
Syniverse was recognized as an E-Tech award winner for Location and Proximity Services for its partnership with MasterCard that gives financial institutions the ability to compare credit card transaction locations with their cardholders' mobile device location.[29]
Syniverse was selected as a Competitive Carriers Association Associate Member Annual Achievement Award winner for its involvement with local and national charities and encouragement of employees to stay involved through community service, material contributions or monetary donations.[30]
Syniverse Chief Marketing Officer Mary Clark was included in the Hot Topics list of 100 most innovative CMOs in the world.[31]
Syniverse was recognized by Global Telecoms Business for launching the first domestic LTE roaming service in the U.S., in collaboration with GCI, Alaska's largest telecom company.[32]
Syniverse IPX was recognized at the 2015 LTE Awards with an award for Best Roaming Solution.[33]
Syniverse CMO Mary Clark was named to Mobile Marketer’s list of Mobile Women to Watch for 2016.[34]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
