Innovation Global Capital partners with exceptional entrepreneurs to build innovative global companies that change the world.











The Firm

We think like entrepreneursbecause we are entrepreneurs.

Innovation Global Capital partners with visionary entrepreneurs in the development of strategies, branding, organizations, and operations throughout the progressive stages of growth. Our focus is on long-term value creation, growth and profitability â not quarterly capitalism.
We have built businesses. We understand the critical role of product, merchandising and branding, having consumer sector experience across three continents. We partner with leaders who are passionate about the customer.
In select circumstances, Innovation Global Capital will invest in innovative concepts and exciting partners that fulfill our investment criteria. We also have access to substantial pools of capital via relationships with high net worth families, institutional, and strategic investors for co-invest opportunities.
Our unique combination of executive experience and investment capital can significantly accelerate the growth of our partners.
Having met with hundreds of entrepreneurs worldwide, a universally reoccurring theme emerged. Most entrepreneurs are looking for trusted partners with executive management experience, yet paradoxically much investment capital comes from financiers with limited real world experience. Innovation Global Capital was founded to fill this void.
We have experienced the unabashed joys of entrepreneurial success, and the unique challenges of creating and building brands. We support the visionary passion of the entrepreneur yet understand the practical operational realities. We guide the critical path to market leadership.
We are entrepreneurs.















Investment Strategy



Innovation Global Capital favors opportunities to build innovative brands, leveraging our influential and proprietary relationships, to create the companies of tomorrow.
Given our extensive investment and operational track record at the intersection of fashion, commerce, and social engagement, we specialize in growth opportunities across a select range of consumer facing sectors.
Creativity and rationality must coexist. We embrace both the emotion of brands, and the realities of business.
We bring powerful executive experience and investment capital to the table.

Proposals


I'm an Entrepreneur. What kind of board and investors should I assemble?
Think of baseball. One would never try and build a World Series team full of shortstops. A winning team needs a great pitcher, a catcher, a third baseman, and so on. Individual stars who come together to pursue a common vision of achieving the unachievable.
Similarly, the best boards are a balanced team of experts. Assemble a board that can help you build a company and create value by bringing to bear expertise in general management, corporate strategy, brand strategy, tech, finance, management organization and operations. Find experienced executives and smart investors. Be sure the fund partner you respect will actually join your board. Cultivate investors with unique relationships and add a global perspective to supplement a domestic point of view.
How are opportunities assessed?We consider the following criteria:

The Founders: vision, commitment and expertise
Long-Term Value Creation potential
Innovative Nature and Competitive Advantage of the Product/Services/Concept
Ability to leverage our strengths to accelerate growth and create value

OUR WORLDVIEW 





Philosophy

The company name Innovation Global Capital reflects our worldview.
INNOVATION

We only work with the most innovative entrepreneurs and companies.
Innovation is the only competitive advantage when information is democratic and immediate. In an era where industry disruption can begin in a dorm room, companies must continually innovate to compete in the global marketplace. Equally, an innovative concept or brand can aggressively expand and pioneer a new market. We believe that innovation cannot be a one-off event â it requires a relentless and continual commitment.


 PHILOSOPHY


GLOBAL 























Philosophy

The company name Innovation Global Capital reflects our worldview.
GLOBAL

We firmly believe only global concepts and companies will survive and dominate in the 21st century. Consumers, markets, trends and information have become globalized. Entrepreneurs can no longer succeed simply by building a parochial domestic company. Whereas global opportunities were often considered only years after a company was founded, now most great ideas are globally scalable. With the right global relationships and knowledge, there are significant first mover advantages for the innovative. Globalization is an oft used word, but the world truly is Global.


 INNOVATION


CAPITAL 























Philosophy

The company name Innovation Global Capital reflects our worldview.
CAPITAL

It is a given that capital is essential to growth. Innovation Global Capital, however, is different.
We believe capital must be combined with experience, that creativity must coexist with rationality.
We integrate both the passionate emotions of brands and the profit imperative of business.

Our approach to investing is to partner with visionary entrepreneurs who are driven to change the world.
We provide capital and executive experience to propel growth and profitability, working together to create long term value as trusted confidant and partner.
We think like entrepreneurs because we are entrepreneurs.


 GLOBAL



































Entrepreneurship is built upon faith and passion. The entrepreneur will face naysayers along the journey. Yet the successful entrepreneur sees through the fog of uncertainty to create the future.

Is buying Capital Product Partners LP (CPLP) for its upcoming $0.08 dividend a good choice?



Ashwin Virk 


            				July 25, 2017			        


 If you are interested in cashing in on Capital Product Partners’s (NASDAQ:CPLP) upcoming dividend of $0.08 you have only 7 days before the so called ex-dividend date on the Tue 01 Aug 2017. The dividend is payable on Fri 11 Aug 2017. But is this actually an interesting opportunity for dividend investors? Let’s look into that. 
 What is the ex-dividend date?  If you purchase a stock on or after its ex-dividend date, you will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you purchase before the ex-dividend date, you get the dividend. 
 Check out our latest analysis for Capital Product Partners 
 Investors should be cautious of Capital Product Partners (CPLP)’s 8.27% dividend 
 The 8.27% dividend yield may look attractive at first glance, but investors should be very careful before buying Capital Product Partners LP just for the dividend. I’m going to explain why. Check out our latest analysis for Capital Product Partners 
 First up, we need to look at the company’s payout ratio.  
 Payout ratio is a measure of what portion of a company’s earnings are paid out to shareholders as a dividend. So a payout ratio of 50% would mean for every $1 earnt they pay 50c as a dividend. Likewise a payout ratio of 150% means the company is paying out more as a dividend than it earns, usually this is paid out of debt or cash. 
 The company currently pays out 93% of its earnings as a dividend, which means that the dividend is not well covered by earnings. In 3 years time the analysts are predicting dividends per share to be around $0.455 and EPS to increase to $0.49. This means shareholders should be concerned with the company’s ability to continue paying with an expected future payout ratio of 92%. 
The payout ratio is a strong indicator of a company’s ability to finance their dividend distribution, but I also encourage investors to look at how consistent those payouts have been over time. 
 If the dividend is a key criteria in your investment consideration, then you need to make sure the dividend stock you’re eyeing out is reliable. Not only have dividend payouts from Capital Product Partners fallen over the past 10 years, they have also been highly volatile in this time with drops over 25% in some years.These characteristics should have shareholders concerned and potential investors looking at alternative opportunities.
