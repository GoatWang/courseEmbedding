 Download as PDF

October 28, 2013

    PRINCETON, N.J.--
      Advaxis, Inc., (NASDAQ:ADXS), a leader in developing the next generation
      of immunotherapies for cancer and infectious diseases, announced that it
      has appointed Gregory T. Mayes to the new position of Executive Vice
      President and Chief Operating Officer.
    

      Mr. Mayes joins Advaxis following the recent closing of a financing
      totaling $26.5 million and an uplisting to the NASDAQ Capital Market.
      Advaxis is now positioned to maximize the potential of its proprietary
      immunotherapy technology platform and focus its resources on advancing
      its lead product candidate, ADXS-HPV, into registrational studies for
      invasive cervical cancer.
    

      Mr. Mayes has 15 years of experience as a biopharmaceutical executive
      with a deep and diverse background in the life sciences field and is a
      strategic leader with a proven track record heading multiple core
      operational areas of the business. Mr. Mayes will report directly to
      Daniel J. O’Connor, Chief Executive Officer, and will be responsible for
      leading Advaxis’ business operations, including business development and
      licensing, legal affairs, commercial planning, information technology,
      and human resources.
    

      Mr. Mayes stated, “The opportunity to fully exploit an
      immuno-oncology technology that has shown early evidence of
      effectiveness in the clinic, alongside an expert team of executives and
      employees in what is clearly the hottest area of oncology research and
      development, is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity. I look forward
      to contributing significantly to the team to realize the full potential
      that lies within Advaxis, and, most importantly, the ability to develop
      new treatment options for patients with cancer around the world.”
    

      “On behalf of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management Team,
      I would like to welcome Greg to the Advaxis team. I had the pleasure of
      hiring and working with Greg at ImClone. During that time, together we
      were able to achieve many transformational milestones that had
      significant impact on shareholder value. Greg’s broad and diverse
      background, combined with his passion and proven track record as an
      operational executive, will certainly be invaluable to Advaxis. While we
      have made tremendous progress this year, we have an exciting and
      challenging road ahead, with much that still needs to be accomplished. I
      have no doubt that the Advaxis management team is well poised and
      prepared to execute and deliver results on all fronts,” commented Daniel
      J. O’Connor, President and Chief Executive Officer of Advaxis.
    

      Mr. Mayes is the former Executive Vice President, Human Resources for
      Dendreon Corporation, the leading pioneer in the field of
      immuno-oncology research and development, where he was a member of the
      Executive Committee. Prior to Dendreon, Mr. Mayes was the President of
      Unigene Laboratories, Inc. (2010 to 2012) where he primarily led
      out-licensing efforts for the company's novel oral peptide drug delivery
      platform. Prior to Unigene, Mr. Mayes served as the Vice President,
      General Counsel, and Chief Compliance Officer at ImClone Systems
      Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly (2004 to 2010).
      While serving at ImClone in positions of increasing
      responsibility, Mayes supported the clinical development and
      commercialization of ERBITUX® (cetuximab), led the development and
      oversight of the company’s first corporate compliance program, and
      contributed significantly to activities related to Eli Lilly’s $6.5
      billion acquisition of ImClone in 2008. Mayes also served as Senior
      Counsel at AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP where he provided a wide range
      of legal services in connection with the development and
      commercialization of five approved products in the company’s oncology
      portfolio (2001 to 2004). Earlier, Mr. Mayes worked in private practice
      at Morgan Lewis LLP, a national law firm. He earned his B.S. degree from
      Syracuse University cum laude where he was recognized as a Remembrance
      Scholar and he earned his J.D. degree from the Temple University School
      of Law where he was the Articles Editor on the Temple Law Review.
    

      In connection with his appointment, Mr. Mayes received a one-time
      inducement award of 150,000 restricted shares, 37,500 (25%) of which are
      fully vested and not subject to forfeiture as of the grant date. The
      remaining shares vest annually over a three-year period, which vesting
      may be accelerated in certain circumstances as provided in the terms of
      his award agreement.
    

About Advaxis, Inc.


      Advaxis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing the next
      generation of immunotherapies for cancer and infectious diseases.
      Advaxis immunotherapies are based on a novel platform technology using
      live, attenuated bacteria that are bio-engineered to secrete an
      antigen/adjuvant fusion protein(s) that is designed to redirect the
      powerful immune response all human beings have to the bacterium to
      the cancer itself.
    

      ADXS-HPV is currently being evaluated in four clinical trials for human
      papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers: recurrent/refractory cervical
      cancer (India), locally advanced cervical cancer (GOG/NCI U.S. study,
      Clinical Trials.gov Identifier NCT01266460), head & neck cancer
      (CRUK study, Clinical Trials.gov Identifier NCT01598792), and anal
      cancer (BrUOG study, Clinical Trials.gov Identifier NCT01671488).
      Advaxis has over 15 distinct immunotherapies in various stages of
      development, developed directly by Advaxis and through strategic
      collaborations with recognized centers of excellence such as: the National
      Cancer Institute, Cancer
      Research – UK, the University
      of Pennsylvania, the Georgia
      Regents University Cancer Center, and others.
