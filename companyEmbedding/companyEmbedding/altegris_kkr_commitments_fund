† The inception date of both the Fund's Class A shares (including predecessor feeder fund shares), and Class I Shares (as re-classified), is 08/01/2015.
‡ Class A shares are subject to a maximum sales load of 3.5%. Class I shares have no sales load.
The total annual fund expense ratio, gross of any fee waivers or expense reimbursements, is 3.24% for Class A shares and 3.84% for Class I shares. The total annual net expense ratio is 2.82% for Class A shares and 2.12% for Class I shares. The Adviser has agreed to a cap on specified expenses not to exceed 0.65% for Class A shares and 0.55% for Class I shares. See the Prospectus for more information.
The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown above. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. The returns reflect the expense limitation and reimbursement, without which, the performance would have been lower. A Fund's performance, especially for short periods of time, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision.
For the period from the Fund's inception through May 31, 2016, the returns and expenses of Class A shares reflect the performance of the prior feeder fund; and the returns of Class I shares reflect the performance of the Fund prior to its issuance of multiple share classes and reclassification of existing shares.  From June 1, 2016 forward, the returns reflect performance of Class A and Class I shares, respectively, of the Altegris KKR Commitments Fund.
S&P 500 Total Return Index. The total return version of S&P 500 index; generally representative of certain portions of the U.S. equity markets. Returns assume reinvestment of  dividends.

MSCI All-Country World Index. The MSCI ACWI captures large and mid cap representation across 23 Developed Markets and 23 Emerging Markets countries. With 2,480 constituents, the index covers approximately 85% of the global investable equity opportunity set.

Fund distributions will vary depending upon market conditions and number of shares outstanding. Past distributions are no guarantee of future distributions or performance results.
This information is not intended to cover the complexities of a shareholder's individual tax situation. Because tax laws vary among states, you should consult your tax advisor about the specific rules in the state(s) in which you pay income taxes.
Record date is the date by which a shareholder must own fund shares to receive the distribution. Ex-date is the date on which a shareholder who purchases fund shares will not be eligible to receive the distribution. Payable date is the date on which a shareholder is paid the distribution.


















1 While the portfolio composition that has been developed by Altegris Advisors (the Fund's investment adviser) and StepStone Group (the Fund's sub-adviser) reflects their assessment of the relative attractiveness of sub-sectors within the context of an appropriately diversified portfolio, given the percentage of assets that will be invested in securities issued by a single issuer (KKR), the Fund will be a non-diversified fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
A portion of the Fund's assets may be invested in private equity or Investment Funds which are not managed by or affiliated with KKR; however, this allocation is not anticipated to be material to the Fund's overall strategy.
Diversification does not ensure profit or protect against loss in a positive or declining market. There is no guarantee that any investment will achieve its objectives, generate profits, or avoid losses. There can be no assurance that all investment types will be available, will be consistent with the Fund's objective, will satisfy the Investment Adviser's due diligence considerations, or will be selected for the Fund.

Not everyone can invest like an institution. Institutions are professional money managers who have unique access and the ability to perform extensive due diligence on managers. Many investors' experience, financial means, objectives, risk tolerance, and time frame will differ from that of institutions, and they may not be able to access the same investment opportunities as institutions. These factors should be taken into consideration when creating an allocation to alternatives. The above should not be construed as investment advice. Diversification does not ensure profit nor protect against loss.
Volatility can be measured by standard deviation, which is a statistical measure of how consistent returns are over time; a lower standard deviation indicates historically less volatility. Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.

† As of December 31, 2016.
                            References to “assets under management” or “AUM” represent the assets managed by KKR or its strategic partners as to which KKR is entitled to receive a fee or carried interest (either currently or upon deployment of capital) and general partner capital.  KKR calculates the amount of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds; (ii) uncalled capital commitments from these funds, including uncalled capital commitments from which KKR is currently not earning management fees or carried interest; (iii) the fair value of investments in KKR's co-investment vehicles; (iv) the par value of outstanding CLOs (excluding CLOs wholly-owned by KKR); (v) KKR's pro-rata portion of the AUM managed by strategic partnerships in which KKR holds a minority ownership interest and (vi) the fair value of other assets managed by KKR.  The pro-rata portion of the AUM managed by strategic partnerships is calculated based on KKR's percentage ownership interest in such entities multiplied by such entity's respective AUM.  KKR's calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and, as a result, KKR's measurements of its AUM may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. KKR's definition of AUM is not based on the definitions of AUM that may be set forth in agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts that it manages and is not calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions.

IMPORTANT UPDATE








The Altegris KKR Commitments Master Fund (“Fund”) and the Altegris KKR Commitments Fund (“Feeder”) initially began operations in August 2015 as separate investment funds within a master/feeder structure, with the Feeder investing substantially all of its assets into the Fund.  Both the Fund and Feeder had the same investment objectives, but each operated as a separate entity and issued shares separately with differing fee structures, and with Feeder shareholders bearing a proportional share of the Fund’s operating expenses in addition to the Feeder’s own expenses. 
As described in the initial Prospectus, having received both SEC and Board approval, in May 2016 the Fund converted and offers multiple share classes. As part of this conversion, each Feeder shareholder received a new class of Fund shares (“Class A” shares), in proportion to and in exchange for each such shareholder’s existing Feeder shares (at then current net asset values). The Feeder Fund will thereafter be liquidated and cease to exist. Also, existing Fund shareholders continue to hold their originally issued shares, re-classified as “Class I” shares. In each case, the original fee structures, rights and privileges of any of the exchanged or re-classified shares remain unchanged. However, the conversion positively impacts holders of Class A shares by lowering their annual expense ratio, as compared to that applicable to holding Feeder shares, because the revised Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement between the Adviser and the Fund limits Class A expenses to 0.65% per annum on specified expenses (instead of 0.80% previously for the Feeder).
In May 2016, the Fund commenced offering the two separate classes of shares—Class A and Class I—for acceptance and issuance effective as of the Fund’s June 1, 2016 subscription Closing Date, and on a continuous basis thereafter.














VALUE of an INITIAL $1,000 INVESTMENT








LOGARITHMIC SCALE | APRIL 1986 – SEPTEMBER 2016





Past performance is no guarantee of future results. There is no guarantee that any investment will achieve its objectives, generate profits or avoid losses. There are significant differences between public and private equities, which include but are not limited to, the fact that public equities have a lower barrier to entry than private equities. There is also greater access to information about public companies. Private equities typically have a longer time horizon than public equities before profits, if any, are realized. Additionally, public equities provide greater liquidity whereas private equities are considered highly illiquid.
Cambridge US Private Equity Index data based on quarterly returns. S&P 500 Total Return Index data based on monthly returns. Date range based on common period of data availability.

ALTEGRIS KKR COMMITMENTS MASTER FUND: FUND COMMENTARY AND ACTIVITY*
May Commentary
											                      May performance was driven by the Fund’s publicly-traded positions. From a geographic perspective, the Americas drove gains while Europe and Asia were flat for the month. The Financials sector was the largest positive contributor to performance, while Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples also generated profits. We continue to focus on diversifying the portfolio across sectors and geographies with investments that have a durable competitive advantage amid the backdrop of a low-growth global economy.
May Fund Activity 
                    					     					During May, the Fund executed capital calls on four portfolio companies totaling $1.0 million and received distributions on nine portfolio companies totaling $2.8 million. At month-end, the Fund held investments in 118 underlying portfolio companies.
Q1 2017 Commentary 
					     					                    The Altegris KKR Commitments Master Fund (“Fund”) performed positively in Q1. During the quarter, returns were driven by positive operating results in the Fund’s underlying portfolio companies in addition to gains related to the purchase of secondary fund interests. From a geographic perspective, the Americas and Europe generated profits while Asia was a small detractor. Consumer Discretionary, Financials and Healthcare drove profitability from a sector perspective, while Materials was a slight detractor.
Entering into 2017, we continue to focus on diversifying the portfolio across geographies and sectors with companies that have a durable competitive advantage amid the backdrop of a low-growth global economy. We believe the Fund is well-positioned to make opportunistic secondary and co-investment purchases in addition to new portfolio company investments from the Fund’s primary commitments. We are pleased with the diversity and operating strength of the Fund’s underlying portfolio companies and our growing investment pipeline in early 2017.
* The Fund’s principal investment strategy is long-term capital appreciation through allocation of its assets to private equity investments, including other private equity funds (“Underlying Funds”). References to investments or positions in portfolio companies, and/or to geographic or market sectors, relate generally to the Fund’s access or exposure to such companies or sectors through its investments in Underlying Funds, as described in the “Investment Program” section of the Fund’s Prospectus. 
                                            Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The views expressed are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as specific investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any securities. The Altegris KKR Commitments Master Fund is new with a limited history of operations and may not be suitable or available to everyone. The Fund invests in private equity securities and should be considered a speculative investment that entails substantial risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, market risk, concentration risk, illiquidity, risks of leverage, non-diversification risk, lack of transparency, regulatory risk, lack of a secondary market or exchange to trade securities, foreign investment risks, sector risks, and volatility. There is no guarantee that any investment will achieve its objectives, generate profits or avoid losses.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Altegris KKR Commitments Master Fund. This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the Fund’s prospectus, which can be obtained by calling (888) 524-9441. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

Altegris Launches Altegris KKR Commitments Fund

Fund Offers Accredited Investors Broad Exposure to Private Equity Funds Managed by KKR




Apr 27, 2015, 2:08pm EDT














LA JOLLA, Calif., April 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Altegris, a provider of premier alternative investment strategies, announces the launch of the Altegris KKR Commitments Fund. The Fund offers accredited investors an opportunity to gain diversified exposure to KKR by committing to three different forms of private equity – primaries, secondaries and co-investments, at a minimum initial investment of $25,000.
"Accredited investors will now have the opportunity to access many of the same KKR private equity funds that institutional investors have had access to for years," said Jon Sundt, CEO of Altegris. "Altegris is providing investors with a portfolio spanning multiple private equity styles, geographic regions and life cycles, from newly established primary investment funds through mature secondary investment funds, all via a single subscription." 
The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a closed-end investment fund, and its shares are registered for public offering under the Securities Act of 1933. The Fund offers a number of features to investors including diversification, 1099 tax reporting and no capital calls, all at a lower minimum access point than traditional private equity.
"We are pleased that Altegris has decided to bring individual investors the opportunity to invest in private equity, with a focus on KKR private equity, through this new and innovative fund," said Suzanne Donohoe, Member and Head of Client and Partner Group at KKR. "KKR looks forward to the fund's investments in KKR private equity offerings as selected by Altegris and StepStone."
The Altegris KKR Commitments Fund brings together one of the most established firms in private equity, KKR, with a leading alternative investment manager, Altegris, as the Fund's investment adviser, with the considered recommendations of the StepStone Group as the Fund's subadviser. StepStone oversees $60 billion in private capital allocations, including $12 billion of assets under management, with a team of 150 professionals. It is a premier global private markets asset manager and adviser. StepStone creates customized portfolios for sophisticated investors using a highly disciplined research-focused approach and will use its expertise to advise the Fund and Altegris on primary, secondary and co-investment opportunities, as well as provide guidance on portfolio construction.
"We are very pleased to advise this innovative alternatives investment product," said Monte Brem, StepStone's CEO. "Our global platform and proven research-focused investment approach position us well to assist Altegris in its goal of creating a top performing portfolio of alternatives investments."
Of particular attraction to Altegris is KKR's philosophy of being a true partner with portfolio companies' management teams, its global footprint and insight into local economies, and its commitment to environmental, social and governance factors in its investment decisions. KKR, a pioneer, brings a 38-year track record of private equity investing with over 1,000 employees in 21 cities and 15 countries across five continents. The firm aims to generate attractive investment returns using a patient and disciplined investment approach, employing world-class talent in a one-firm philosophy, and driving growth and value creation at the asset level. For more information about the Altegris KKR Commitments Fund, please visit: www.altegris.com/kkr. 
The Fund should be considered a speculative investment and entails substantial risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, market risk, concentration risk, illiquidity, risks of leverage, non-diversification risk, lack of transparency, regulatory risk, potentially unfavorable changes in tax laws, lack of a secondary market or exchange to trade securities, foreign investment risks, sector risks, pricing risk, and volatility. There is no guarantee that any investment will achieve its objectives, generate profits or avoid losses. Diversification does not ensure profit nor protect against loss in declining markets.  A prospective investor should invest in the Fund only if it can sustain a complete loss of its investment.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Altegris KKR Commitments Master Fund and Altegris KKR Commitments Fund. This and other important information about a Fund is contained in the Fund's prospectus, which can be obtained by calling (888) 524-9441. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
