TAYLOR MADE PRODUCTS INTRODUCES
FENDER ADJUSTER FOR PONTOON BOAT RAILS
 
 








GLOVERSVILLE, N.Y. – March 30, 2006 – Taylor Made Products
continues to expand its popular pontoon boat fender line with the introduction
of a fender adjuster clip designed specifically for the one-inch square rails
found on most pontoon boats.
 
The mounting clip clamps squarely over the square rail
tubing. The fender line feeds through a hole on the outside of the clip. The
height of the fender can be adjusted by tying an overhand knot in the line. The
fender adjuster can be repositioned quickly and easily as needed.
 
The product is made from quality, marine-grade components
and is designed to work with standard 5/8-inch fender line.
 
Taylor Made also offers a complete line of specialty fender
products designed for the unique requirements of pontoon boats, including
corner bumpers, fence-rail protectors and fenders that fit snugly between the
deck and pontoon.
 
Taylor Made Products, a member of the Taylor Made Group®,
is one of the largest and most innovative suppliers of marine aftermarket
products, including buoys, fenders, boat covers, bimini tops, dock products,
flags, pennants and hardware.  
 
Headquartered in Gloversville, N.Y., the Taylor Made Group,
Inc. has nearly 100 years of experience as one of the recreational marine
industry’s largest, most diversified suppliers to boatbuilders and the
aftermarket. The Taylor Made Group includes Taylor Made Products, Taylor Made
Systems, Taylorbrite LLC and Trend Marine. The Group operates 12 facilities in
the United States, the Republic of Ireland, England, Australia, New Zealand and
Mexico. Employing more than 1,300 associates, its products are distributed

Racker Culture

Why I’m Leaving Rackspace

By Taylor Rhodes -  May 3, 2017 




This morning, I announced to my fellow Rackers the toughest decision I’ve ever had to make: I’m leaving the company that I love, where I’ve worked for the past decade and made lifelong friends, and where it’s been my honor to serve as CEO.
My friend Jeff Cotten, now Rackspace president, will step up as interim CEO. Our board has launched a search for a long-term CEO, and it considers Jeff a strong candidate for that position.
Kelley Freeman, a local author who has worked as a coach to some of our executives, observes that “the last act of leading is leaving.” What he means, in the context of a CEO, is that when you’ve taken your company as far as you can, given your particular strengths and skills, it’s time to let someone else with different strengths step up and take it farther.
That’s how I feel today. I’m proud to have led Rackspace through a hinge in its history, as we seized the leadership of the young and fast-growing market for managed cloud services, and as we went private under the ownership of Apollo Global Management and its partners. We recently reported strong fourth-quarter results to our bond and debt holders. And 2017 is shaping up to be even stronger, as we’re exceeding almost all of the financial targets we established with Apollo and our board.
I know I’m leaving the company in good hands, with Jeff as its new leader, and a strong bench of leaders around him. He and I have been friends and colleagues since we worked together at EDS. I’m proud to have recruited him to Rackspace. Over the past eight years, he has held a series of increasingly challenging leadership roles across key areas of the company, from customer support to sales and new business development. He spent several years based in London and Zurich, growing our international business, which now produces about a third of our $2.1 billion in annual revenue. And he played a pivotal role in developing and scaling our new services for customers who want us to run workloads for them on the infrastructure of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure — and, in the near future, on the Google Cloud Platform. These new services are market leading, and our customers are expressing their love for them through rapid growth and high Net Promoter Scores.
In each of his roles, Jeff has inspired his teams to succeed. He commands deep respect throughout Rackspace. I leave with confidence that he and a new generation of Rackspace leaders will bring fresh eyes to the company’s challenges and opportunities.
What’s next for me? I’m going to become the CEO of a smaller private company. It’s based in another city. It does not compete with Rackspace. I’ll be able to talk more specifically about it in a couple of weeks, but for now let me just say that it’s about the size Rackspace was when I started here 10 years ago — and it’s growing about as rapidly. It’s using cloud technologies to disrupt what has been a very low-tech industry. The company is going through growing pains and needs a CEO who has been through those challenges before.
This opportunity fits my strengths and skills, and I think it will provide a reinvigorating change. This new job, at a smaller company, will also give me more control over my schedule and more time with my kids before the two oldest, who are now in high school, leave home for college.
I’ll miss Rackspace and the Rackers I love, and my family and I will miss San Antonio. But we plan to stay in touch with the great friends we’ve made here. We’ll always be fans of the city and the Spurs and Rackspace. And we’ll be watching and applauding all three from afar.
Go, Rackspace, Go!

Good luck Taylor.  You provided business and ethical leadership to a lot of people over the years.

Taylor- this is shocking as much as sad. I left rackspace a year back and have enjoyed every minute working with you. I wish you the very best and hope our paths cross again even though I am in a different continent now. I am sure you will lead from the front wherever you are headed next!

Why I’m Leaving Rackspace

By Taylor Rhodes -  May 3, 2017 




This morning, I announced to my fellow Rackers the toughest decision I’ve ever had to make: I’m leaving the company that I love, where I’ve worked for the past decade and made lifelong friends, and where it’s been my honor to serve as CEO.
My friend Jeff Cotten, now Rackspace president, will step up as interim CEO. Our board has launched a search for a long-term CEO, and it considers Jeff a strong candidate for that position.
Kelley Freeman, a local author who has worked as a coach to some of our executives, observes that “the last act of leading is leaving.” What he means, in the context of a CEO, is that when you’ve taken your company as far as you can, given your particular strengths and skills, it’s time to let someone else with different strengths step up and take it farther.
That’s how I feel today. I’m proud to have led Rackspace through a hinge in its history, as we seized the leadership of the young and fast-growing market for managed cloud services, and as we went private under the ownership of Apollo Global Management and its partners. We recently reported strong fourth-quarter results to our bond and debt holders. And 2017 is shaping up to be even stronger, as we’re exceeding almost all of the financial targets we established with Apollo and our board.
I know I’m leaving the company in good hands, with Jeff as its new leader, and a strong bench of leaders around him. He and I have been friends and colleagues since we worked together at EDS. I’m proud to have recruited him to Rackspace. Over the past eight years, he has held a series of increasingly challenging leadership roles across key areas of the company, from customer support to sales and new business development. He spent several years based in London and Zurich, growing our international business, which now produces about a third of our $2.1 billion in annual revenue. And he played a pivotal role in developing and scaling our new services for customers who want us to run workloads for them on the infrastructure of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure — and, in the near future, on the Google Cloud Platform. These new services are market leading, and our customers are expressing their love for them through rapid growth and high Net Promoter Scores.
In each of his roles, Jeff has inspired his teams to succeed. He commands deep respect throughout Rackspace. I leave with confidence that he and a new generation of Rackspace leaders will bring fresh eyes to the company’s challenges and opportunities.
What’s next for me? I’m going to become the CEO of a smaller private company. It’s based in another city. It does not compete with Rackspace. I’ll be able to talk more specifically about it in a couple of weeks, but for now let me just say that it’s about the size Rackspace was when I started here 10 years ago — and it’s growing about as rapidly. It’s using cloud technologies to disrupt what has been a very low-tech industry. The company is going through growing pains and needs a CEO who has been through those challenges before.
This opportunity fits my strengths and skills, and I think it will provide a reinvigorating change. This new job, at a smaller company, will also give me more control over my schedule and more time with my kids before the two oldest, who are now in high school, leave home for college.
I’ll miss Rackspace and the Rackers I love, and my family and I will miss San Antonio. But we plan to stay in touch with the great friends we’ve made here. We’ll always be fans of the city and the Spurs and Rackspace. And we’ll be watching and applauding all three from afar.
Go, Rackspace, Go!

Good luck Taylor.  You provided business and ethical leadership to a lot of people over the years.

Taylor- this is shocking as much as sad. I left rackspace a year back and have enjoyed every minute working with you. I wish you the very best and hope our paths cross again even though I am in a different continent now. I am sure you will lead from the front wherever you are headed next!

TAYLOR MADE PRODUCTS OFFERS NEW LINE OF 
FABRIC DOCK CUSHIONS
 
 
GLOVERSVILLE, NY – September 26, 2003 - Taylor Made
Products has expanded its line of dock protection products with the
introduction of DockGard™ fabric-covered polyethylene foam dock cushions.
 
The versatile DockGard edging consists of a tight-knit
heavy-duty polyester outer layer, over an interior foam material.  The fabric
layer has high UV stability and extra abrasion resistant qualities.  The inner
foam layer is closed-cell PE, which means superior impact performance and very
low water absorption.  Most models also have full-width LPDE backing for
improved mounting strength.
 
The DockGard products are designed to protect boats up to 50
ft., and are offered in a wide range of sizes and configurations for mounting
on horizontal edges, vertical pilings, corners and curves. 
 




The flexible, strong DockGard bumpers will not deteriorate or
harden with age and will not scuff or mar the boat.  The fabric covering cleans
easily with soap and water.   
 
Taylor Made Products, a
member of the Taylor Made Group®, is one of the largest and most
innovative suppliers of marine aftermarket products, including buoys, fenders,
boat covers, bimini tops, dock products, flags, pennants and hardware.  
 
Headquartered in
Gloversville, NY, the Taylor Made Group, Inc. has 95 years of experience as one
of the recreational marine industry’s largest, most diversified
suppliers.  The Taylor Made Group includes Taylor Made Products, Taylor Made
Systems and Taylorbrite LLC.  The Group operates 11 facilities in the United
States, the Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.  Employing more
than 800 associates, its products are distributed through a worldwide
distribution network.
