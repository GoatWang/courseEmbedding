The information included in this site, including any attachments, is strictly confidential and privileged work product and is available to you only for the limited purposes of inquiry and review in your capacity as an investor in a Centerbridge Partners, L.P. ("Centerbridge") sponsored investment fund or a parallel vehicle of such fund (in each case, a "Fund"). The information is intended for individual use only and is protected by copyright owned by Centerbridge or its affiliates. You may view and print individual records for the purposes described above, but (i) mass download of information from this site, (ii) altering information from this site and/or (iii) distribution to any third party of any information from this site in any manner is strictly prohibited. 

By clicking on "agree", you agree that, unless otherwise already agreed in a separate writing executed by you and Centerbridge and except as required by law or legal process, you will maintain the confidentiality of any information provided on this site (including information regarding any entity in which Centerbridge holds, or contemplates acquiring, any investments) in accordance with the confidentiality provisions in the governing documents for the applicable Fund(s) in which you are invested and shall use such non-public information solely in connection with the evaluation and/or monitoring of your investment in such Fund(s). 

By clicking on "agree", you agree that you: (i) are the investor to which the ID and password you utilized to log in were assigned by Centerbridge or an authorized agent of such investor; (ii) have reviewed and agree to abide by, and have abided by, each of the terms set forth herein; and (iii) understand that you are solely responsible for the proper use and safekeeping of your password and any consequences that result from the unauthorized use of your password. 

If you are a "friends and family investor" (i.e., a limited partner in Centerbridge Capital Partners Strategic, L.P., and/or a "Friends & Family Limited Partner" in Centerbridge Capital Partners II, L.P. or Centerbridge Capital Partners III, L.P. (as defined in such Fund's Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement), or you are accessing this site on behalf of any such investor (either as a representative, agent or otherwise), then by clicking on "agree" you hereby acknowledge, understand and agree that, notwithstanding any prior or existing agreement to the contrary, while you have received and will receive capital account statements, the basic quarterly financial statements and audited annual financial statements for such applicable Fund(s) in which you are invested, you have not received and will not receive other information that is or may be provided to those investors in the Fund who are not "friends and family investors." By clicking on "agree", you further acknowledge and agree that the foregoing is intended to for the mutual benefit of Centerbridge and you (in order to minimize the potential misuse of material non-public information, to reduce potential or actual conflicts of interest, and otherwise), and that you and your affiliates will hold harmless and not bring, maintain or support any action or claim against Centerbridge as a result of or otherwise relating to this arrangement regarding not receiving all information that is otherwise distributed to all investors in the applicable Fund(s). 

Centerbridge is a registered investment adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However, none of the Funds have been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the securities laws of any U.S. state or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, nor is such registration contemplated. Information on this site is provided to you upon your request and on a confidential basis for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase interests in any Fund. Any such offer or solicitation is made only pursuant to the Fund's confidential private placement memorandum (as amended, supplemented and/or restated from time to time, the "Memorandum"), which describes the significant risks and other important information related to an investment in the applicable Fund, qualifies in its entirety the information contained on this site and should be read carefully prior to subscribing for interests in the applicable Fund for a description of the merits and risks of an investment in such Fund. Any decision to invest in a Fund should be made after reviewing the Memorandum together with Form ADV Part 2A of Centerbridge (CRD #157359), which is available on this site and on the SEC’s website (http://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov/), conducting such investigations as you deem necessary and consulting your own legal, accounting and tax advisors in order to make an independent determination of the suitability and consequences of an investment in the Fund. None of Centerbridge, the Fund nor any of their respective affiliates makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained herein and nothing contained herein should be relied upon as a promise or representation as to past or future performance of the Fund or any other entity. An investment in a Fund entails a high degree of risk. Unless otherwise indicated, any information contained on this site is as of the date indicated therein. The posting of any information on this site does not imply that the information contained therein is correct as of any time subsequent to the date of such information. By accessing information on this site, you acknowledge and agree to promptly return to Centerbridge upon request by Centerbridge any information that you have downloaded from this site. Investors should not construe the information on this site as financial or other advice, and each Investor should consult with its advisors with respect to any issues concerning an investment in the applicable Fund. Neither Centerbridge nor any of its affiliates has registered with any EEA regulatory authorities to market any of the Funds anywhere within the EEA. Consequently, Centerbridge is not subject to the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFM Directive”). The information provided on this site may include information about certain Centerbridge funds in which you are not currently invested, in which you may not be eligible to invest and / or about which you may not have requested information. Such information is being provided for your monitoring and / or due diligence purposes with respect to Centerbridge (and, in certain instances, such information may include the rights of investors in Centerbridge funds that generally invest alongside the fund in which you have an interest).

Apollo, Blackstone Reportedly Among Potential Bidders For Home Capital
May 2 17
The Blackstone Group L.P. (NYSE:BX), Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE:APO) and Centerbridge Partners, L.P. are among potential suitors studying bids for Home Capital Group Inc. (TSX:HCG), people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (TSX:BAM.A) and Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (TSX:FFH) are among other firms interested in buying Home Capital, speaking on condition of anonymity as the discussions are private. The potential bidders are working with investment banks as they consider their options and are likely to wait until a Canadian regulator holds a hearing on May 4, 2017, the people said this week. Home Capital, Brookfield, Blackstone and Centerbridge declined to comment. Potential buyers are evaluating bids for the whole or part of Home Capital, the people said. Some smaller companies are looking at parts of Home Capital. It is not clear yet if Home Capital will sell itself to one buyer or if the assets would be broken up to multiple buyers, the people said. Apollo and Fairfax did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
