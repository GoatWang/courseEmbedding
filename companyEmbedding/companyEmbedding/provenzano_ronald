“I wanted to drop you a note to thank you for your kindness, caring, and professionalism dealing with the death of my grandmother, C. S.  From the moment you arrived to pick up Gram all the way through to us leaving the cemetery, I was so touched by everyone there.  You did a beautiful job and I know Gram would have been pleased.  Thank you again and bless you for all you do.”— E. C.
