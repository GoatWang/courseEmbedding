Discover the Macquarie difference
At Macquarie we uncover the opportunities others may miss. That's because we know success comes from encouraging our people to think differently. Our culture promotes innovation and entrepreneurial drive within a strong risk management framework.




















Our organisation

Our organisation structure

Macquarie has a non-hierarchical organisational structure, split into five operating groups. The Executive Committee, a central group comprising the Managing Director, Deputy Managing Director, Head of Risk Management, Global Chief Operation Officer and heads of Macquarie's major operating groups, manage the organisation as a whole.
Individual businesses operate within Macquarie's operating groups. These businesses work closely together, specialising in defined product or market sectors, and are committed to their client's relationship with the Macquarie group.
Within overall guidelines and a strong risk management framework, the operating groups have substantial discretion in the way they manage their business activities. Great emphasis is placed on a client's relationship with Macquarie as a whole.
Four service groups provide the framework, infrastructure and support that the operating groups require to manage their business. These are the Corporate Operations, Financial Management, Legal and Governance, and Risk Management Groups.

Our businesses are supported by specialist global teams.

No-Action Letter: Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. (June 1, 2017)






















Home | Previous Page


























Investment Advisers Act of 1940 — Section 206(4) / Rule 206(4)-3Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc.	

June 1, 2017



RESPONSE OF THE CHIEF COUNSEL'S OFFICE 
		    DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT



We would not recommend enforcement action to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") under section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") and Rule 206(4)-3 thereunder if any investment adviser that is required to be registered pursuant to section 203 of the Advisers Act pays to Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. ("MCUSA"), a cash payment, directly or indirectly, for the solicitation of advisory clients in accordance with Rule 206(4)-3,[1] notwithstanding a final judgment as to MCUSA, which has been entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Final Judgment"), that otherwise would preclude such an investment adviser from paying such a payment, directly or indirectly, to MCUSA.[2] 
Our position is based on the facts and representations in your letter dated April 14, 2017, particularly the representations of MCUSA that:

It, directly or indirectly, will conduct any cash solicitation arrangement entered into with any investment adviser required to be registered under section 203 of the Advisers Act in compliance with the terms of Rule 206(4)-3 as if MCUSA were not a disqualified person for purposes of Rule 206(4)-3 by virtue of the Final Judgment;

The Final Judgment does not bar or suspend any person currently associated with MCUSA from acting in any capacity under the federal securities laws;[3]
It has complied and will continue to comply with the terms of the Final Judgment, including, but not limited to, the Injunction and the payment of a disgorgement and a civil monetary penalty; and
	
Until April 1, 2025 (ten (10) years from the date of the entry of the Final Judgment), MCUSA and any person through whom MCUSA directly or indirectly conducts its solicitation activities or any investment adviser with which it or any such person has a solicitation arrangement subject to Rule 206(4)-3 will disclose the Final Judgment in a written document that is delivered to each person whom MCUSA or such persons solicit (a)  not less than 48 hours before the person enters into a written or oral investment advisory contract with the investment adviser, or (b) at the time the person enters into such a contract, if the person has the right to terminate such contract without penalty within five business days after entering into the contract.

This position applies only to the Final Judgment and not to any other basis for disqualification under Rule 206(4)-3 that may exist or arise with respect to MCUSA.


 
Jean E. Minarick
Senior Counsel
Jessica Shin
    Attorney-Adviser


 


[1] Rule 206(4)-3 prohibits any investment adviser that is required to be registered under the Advisers Act from paying a cash fee, directly or indirectly, to any solicitor with respect to solicitation activities if, among other things, the solicitor is subject to an order, judgment or decree that is described in section 203(e)(4) of the Advisers Act.


[2] Securities and Exchange Commission v. Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 15-CV-02304 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 1, 2015).


[3] Under section 9(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act"), as a result of the injunction ("Injunction") included in the Final Judgment, MCUSA and its Fund Servicing Affiliates (as defined below) were prohibited from serving or acting as, among other things, an investment adviser or depositor to any registered investment company or as principal underwriter for any registered open-end investment company or registered unit investment trust ("Fund Servicing Activities").  On August 3, 2015, the Commission issued a permanent order exempting certain affiliated persons of MCUSA:  Delaware Management Business Trust, on behalf of its series, Delaware Management Company and Delaware Investments Fund Advisers; Four Corners Capital Management, LLC; Macquarie Capital Investment Management LLC; Macquarie Funds Management Hong Kong Limited; and Delaware Distributors L.P. (the "Fund Servicing Affiliates") and any existing company of which MCUSA was an affiliated person within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act, and any other company of which MCUSA may become an affiliated person in the future (together with the Fund Servicing Affiliates, the "Covered Affiliates").  In re Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., et al., SEC Rel. No. IC-31734 (Aug. 3, 2015) ("Order").  Therefore, the Covered Affiliates are not currently barred or suspended from acting in any capacity specified in section 9(a) of the Investment Company Act as a result of the Injunction.  MCUSA was a party to the application that requested the Order, but MCUSA did not request relief under section 9(a) of the Investment Company Act for itself, because MCUSA did not engage in Fund Servicing Activities.  MCUSA currently does not engage in, and will not engage in, any Fund Servicing Activities absent seeking relief under section 9(a) of the Investment Company Act.  Since the entry of the Injunction, MCUSA has not received, directly or indirectly, any cash solicitation fees under Rule 206(4)-3.

History[edit]
1969 - 1979[edit]
Macquarie was founded on 10 December 1969 as Hill Samuel Australia Limited, a subsidiary of the UK's Hill Samuel & Co. Limited.[2]
Hill Samuel & Co. initially sought the advice of Sir John Marks, of Development Finance Corporation (DFC), regarding the establishment of an Australian subsidiary, however he suggested that Stan Owens instead be the one to compile a proposal for consideration. After presenting his report in London, Mr Owens was offered the role of implementing it by Hill Samuel's Chairman, Kenneth Keith, Baron Keith of Castleacre. Mr Owens became Executive Chairman of Hill Samuel Australia (HSA) and founded the company in Gold Fields House in Sydney's Circular Quay. The company's first three employees were Stan Owens, Blair Hesketh and Geoff Hobson Later Chris Castleman(on loan from the British parent) and Bill Clarke joined. David Clarke and Mark Johnson (both formerly of Darling & Co) were introduced to HSA and became joint Managing Directors. Despite being given a four-year allowance by the British parent to turn a profit, HSA was profitable by the end of its first twelve months of trading.
In 1971 HSA secured Australia’s biggest mandate at the time, a $US60 million financing for corrugated iron manufacturer John Lysaght Australia. HSA expanded its presence in the Australian market, opening a Melbourne office in 1972, and a Brisbane office in 1975. In 1979, HSA gained floor member status at the Sydney Futures Exchange.
1980 - 1989[edit]
In 1980 HSA began its expansion into funds management by establishing Australia’s first cash management account.[3] In 1981, in response to changes evolving from the deregulation of financial markets, HSA commenced work on a proposal to become a trading bank.[3] Authority for HSA to become Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL) was received from the Federal Treasurer on 28 February 1985, making it only the second private trading bank to be established in Australia in modern times.[4] In the same year, Macquarie established its philanthropic arm, the Macquarie Group Foundation. In 1987, Macquarie established what has become one of Australia’s largest corporate art collections, the Macquarie Group Collection.[5]
1990 - 1999[edit]
Macquarie continued its overseas expansion during the early 1990s, opening offices in London, Munich, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing. In 1994 Macquarie began its infrastructure investment business with the underwriting and placement of publicly listed equity for the Hills Motorway in Sydney.[3] On 29 July 1996, Macquarie Bank Limited listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX:MQG).[6] By 30 October 1996 Macquarie had entered the ASX All Ordinaries Index, with a market capitalisation of approximately $A1.3 billion. In June 1999, Macquarie acquired the investment banking arm of Bankers Trust Australia.[7]
2000 - 2009[edit]
Macquarie continued to expand its Asia operations in the early 2000s with the opening of offices in Seoul and Tokyo in 2000, and through the acquisition of ING Group’s Asian cash equities business for an undisclosed amount in March 2004.[8] On December 16, 2004, Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation began trading as Macquarie Infrastructure Company Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:MIC).[9]
In 2005 Macquarie announced a hostile takeover bid for the London Stock Exchange valuing the company at £1.5 billion, a bid rejected by LSE management as "derisory".[10] In October, Macquarie signalled its intention to acquire 100 per cent of U.S. energy marketing and trading company Cook Inlet Energy Supply, enabling Macquarie’s first physical natural gas trade in the US.[11]
Macquarie acquired UK gas supply company Corona Energy in August 2006.[12] In December 2006, Airline Partners Australia, a Macquarie-led consortium, launched an unsuccessful take over offer for Qantas.[13]
In 2007, MBL securityholders and the Federal Court approved the restructure of the Macquarie group into a non-operating holding company (NOHC) structure.[14] Macquarie Group is regulated by APRA, the Australian banking regulator, as the owner of Macquarie Bank Limited, an authorised deposit taker.[15]
On February 4, 2009, Macquarie announced its acquisition of Constellation Energy’s Houston-based downstream natural gas trading operations, making Macquarie Group the fourth largest physical gas trader in North America.[16] In the same year Macquarie acquired independent energy advisory firm Tristone Global Capital Inc; specialist investment bank Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Walker; Canadian wealth management business Blackmont Capital Inc; the wholesale electricity trading business of US firm Integrys Energy; US-based fixed income fund manager Allegiance Investment Management; the equity derivatives and structured products business of German private bank Sal. Oppenheim; and Condor Ferries service between the UK, Channel Islands and France.[17]
2010 - present[edit]
In 2010 Macquarie Group completed its largest foreign acquisition with the purchase of Delaware Investments, a leading US-based diversified asset management firm, from Lincoln Financial Group.[18] Delaware was rebranded as Macquarie Investment Management in 2017.[19]
In January 2015, Macquarie Group acquired a stake in Baltic 2 offshore wind park from EnBW for a fee totalling €720 million, due for completion in summer 2016 and subject to antitrust approval.[20] In March 2015 Macquarie announced the acquisition of a $US4 billion aircraft operating lease portfolio from AWAS Aviation Capital Limited.[21] Later in May that year, the group jointly acquired Australia's largest owner of mobile phone towers Crown Castle Australia Holdings for an undisclosed price, rumoured to be in the region of $A1.62 billion, from its ultimate owner, Crown Castle International Corp.[22] In October Macquarie entered into an agreement to acquire the $A8.2 billion Esanda dealer finance portfolio from ANZ Banking Group.[23]
Macquarie Group led a consortium of bidders to successfully acquire the British Green Investment Bank for $A3.9 billion. [24] The takeover means the group will manage or supervise around $A 6.8 billion of green infrastructure assets and projects. [25] The accompanying announcement stated that it will still pursue its main purpose of attracting private funds to invest in renewable energy generation assets.

Reverse of an 1813 Holey Dollar, in the collection of the State Library of NSW


Macquarie Group’s logo is a stylised representation of the ‘Holey Dollar’, Australia first official currency.[42]
In 1813 Governor Lachlan Macquarie overcame an acute currency shortage in the colony of New South Wales by importing 40,000 Spanish silver dollars and punching a hole through the centre of them to create two unique coins, the ‘Holey Dollar’ and the ‘Dump’.[42] The introduction of the currency stimulated the economy while retaining its intrinsic value, with the two new coins – the 'Holey Dollar' and the 'Dump' – worth 25 per cent more than the original.
According to Macquarie Group, the ‘Holey Dollar’ was Australia’s earliest example of ‘financial innovation’ and ‘embodies its pursuit of practical approaches with profitable outcomes’.[43]
Criticism[edit]
The company's high margins, profits and the lucrative rewards for its executives and shareholders saw the Australian media label the bank "The Millionaire Factory" due to their notably strong performances.[44] As of May 6, 2016, the group's chief executive Nicholas Moore became the nation's highest paid CEO of a listed company as they announced a net profit after tax for the year at A$2.06 billion.
Macquarie Group through its subsidiary Macquarie Equipment Rentals has allegedly been perpetrating a Telco finance scam. Macquarie Equipment Rentals has sued over 300 victims of the scam which involves bundling a finance equipment contract with a contract from a small telecommunications company, often obscuring that the finance contract exists.[45]
The scam involves the telecommunications company promising free equipment such as Plasma TVs, while offering a lower cost phone deal that offsets the cost of the equipment. The victim is then tricked into signing two contracts with the true costs often hidden, whilst being verbally promised that they will be free. The telecommunications company is paid an upfront fee by the finance company, and sometime later disappears. The victim is then left with an inflated finance company lease that requires the victim to pay often tens of thousands of dollars for equipment that in reality costs a fraction of the price.[46]
The company's high margins and profits, and the rewards for its executives and shareholders, saw the Australian media label the bank "The Millionaire Factory" up until its share price fell almost 85% in early 2009.[47]

History[edit]
1969 - 1979[edit]
Macquarie was founded on 10 December 1969 as Hill Samuel Australia Limited, a subsidiary of the UK's Hill Samuel & Co. Limited.[2]
Hill Samuel & Co. initially sought the advice of Sir John Marks, of Development Finance Corporation (DFC), regarding the establishment of an Australian subsidiary, however he suggested that Stan Owens instead be the one to compile a proposal for consideration. After presenting his report in London, Mr Owens was offered the role of implementing it by Hill Samuel's Chairman, Kenneth Keith, Baron Keith of Castleacre. Mr Owens became Executive Chairman of Hill Samuel Australia (HSA) and founded the company in Gold Fields House in Sydney's Circular Quay. The company's first three employees were Stan Owens, Blair Hesketh and Geoff Hobson Later Chris Castleman(on loan from the British parent) and Bill Clarke joined. David Clarke and Mark Johnson (both formerly of Darling & Co) were introduced to HSA and became joint Managing Directors. Despite being given a four-year allowance by the British parent to turn a profit, HSA was profitable by the end of its first twelve months of trading.
In 1971 HSA secured Australia’s biggest mandate at the time, a $US60 million financing for corrugated iron manufacturer John Lysaght Australia. HSA expanded its presence in the Australian market, opening a Melbourne office in 1972, and a Brisbane office in 1975. In 1979, HSA gained floor member status at the Sydney Futures Exchange.
1980 - 1989[edit]
In 1980 HSA began its expansion into funds management by establishing Australia’s first cash management account.[3] In 1981, in response to changes evolving from the deregulation of financial markets, HSA commenced work on a proposal to become a trading bank.[3] Authority for HSA to become Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL) was received from the Federal Treasurer on 28 February 1985, making it only the second private trading bank to be established in Australia in modern times.[4] In the same year, Macquarie established its philanthropic arm, the Macquarie Group Foundation. In 1987, Macquarie established what has become one of Australia’s largest corporate art collections, the Macquarie Group Collection.[5]
1990 - 1999[edit]
Macquarie continued its overseas expansion during the early 1990s, opening offices in London, Munich, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing. In 1994 Macquarie began its infrastructure investment business with the underwriting and placement of publicly listed equity for the Hills Motorway in Sydney.[3] On 29 July 1996, Macquarie Bank Limited listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX:MQG).[6] By 30 October 1996 Macquarie had entered the ASX All Ordinaries Index, with a market capitalisation of approximately $A1.3 billion. In June 1999, Macquarie acquired the investment banking arm of Bankers Trust Australia.[7]
2000 - 2009[edit]
Macquarie continued to expand its Asia operations in the early 2000s with the opening of offices in Seoul and Tokyo in 2000, and through the acquisition of ING Group’s Asian cash equities business for an undisclosed amount in March 2004.[8] On December 16, 2004, Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation began trading as Macquarie Infrastructure Company Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:MIC).[9]
In 2005 Macquarie announced a hostile takeover bid for the London Stock Exchange valuing the company at £1.5 billion, a bid rejected by LSE management as "derisory".[10] In October, Macquarie signalled its intention to acquire 100 per cent of U.S. energy marketing and trading company Cook Inlet Energy Supply, enabling Macquarie’s first physical natural gas trade in the US.[11]
Macquarie acquired UK gas supply company Corona Energy in August 2006.[12] In December 2006, Airline Partners Australia, a Macquarie-led consortium, launched an unsuccessful take over offer for Qantas.[13]
In 2007, MBL securityholders and the Federal Court approved the restructure of the Macquarie group into a non-operating holding company (NOHC) structure.[14] Macquarie Group is regulated by APRA, the Australian banking regulator, as the owner of Macquarie Bank Limited, an authorised deposit taker.[15]
On February 4, 2009, Macquarie announced its acquisition of Constellation Energy’s Houston-based downstream natural gas trading operations, making Macquarie Group the fourth largest physical gas trader in North America.[16] In the same year Macquarie acquired independent energy advisory firm Tristone Global Capital Inc; specialist investment bank Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Walker; Canadian wealth management business Blackmont Capital Inc; the wholesale electricity trading business of US firm Integrys Energy; US-based fixed income fund manager Allegiance Investment Management; the equity derivatives and structured products business of German private bank Sal. Oppenheim; and Condor Ferries service between the UK, Channel Islands and France.[17]
2010 - present[edit]
In 2010 Macquarie Group completed its largest foreign acquisition with the purchase of Delaware Investments, a leading US-based diversified asset management firm, from Lincoln Financial Group.[18] Delaware was rebranded as Macquarie Investment Management in 2017.[19]
In January 2015, Macquarie Group acquired a stake in Baltic 2 offshore wind park from EnBW for a fee totalling €720 million, due for completion in summer 2016 and subject to antitrust approval.[20] In March 2015 Macquarie announced the acquisition of a $US4 billion aircraft operating lease portfolio from AWAS Aviation Capital Limited.[21] Later in May that year, the group jointly acquired Australia's largest owner of mobile phone towers Crown Castle Australia Holdings for an undisclosed price, rumoured to be in the region of $A1.62 billion, from its ultimate owner, Crown Castle International Corp.[22] In October Macquarie entered into an agreement to acquire the $A8.2 billion Esanda dealer finance portfolio from ANZ Banking Group.[23]
Macquarie Group led a consortium of bidders to successfully acquire the British Green Investment Bank for $A3.9 billion. [24] The takeover means the group will manage or supervise around $A 6.8 billion of green infrastructure assets and projects. [25] The accompanying announcement stated that it will still pursue its main purpose of attracting private funds to invest in renewable energy generation assets.

Reverse of an 1813 Holey Dollar, in the collection of the State Library of NSW


Macquarie Group’s logo is a stylised representation of the ‘Holey Dollar’, Australia first official currency.[42]
In 1813 Governor Lachlan Macquarie overcame an acute currency shortage in the colony of New South Wales by importing 40,000 Spanish silver dollars and punching a hole through the centre of them to create two unique coins, the ‘Holey Dollar’ and the ‘Dump’.[42] The introduction of the currency stimulated the economy while retaining its intrinsic value, with the two new coins – the 'Holey Dollar' and the 'Dump' – worth 25 per cent more than the original.
According to Macquarie Group, the ‘Holey Dollar’ was Australia’s earliest example of ‘financial innovation’ and ‘embodies its pursuit of practical approaches with profitable outcomes’.[43]
Criticism[edit]
The company's high margins, profits and the lucrative rewards for its executives and shareholders saw the Australian media label the bank "The Millionaire Factory" due to their notably strong performances.[44] As of May 6, 2016, the group's chief executive Nicholas Moore became the nation's highest paid CEO of a listed company as they announced a net profit after tax for the year at A$2.06 billion.
Macquarie Group through its subsidiary Macquarie Equipment Rentals has allegedly been perpetrating a Telco finance scam. Macquarie Equipment Rentals has sued over 300 victims of the scam which involves bundling a finance equipment contract with a contract from a small telecommunications company, often obscuring that the finance contract exists.[45]
The scam involves the telecommunications company promising free equipment such as Plasma TVs, while offering a lower cost phone deal that offsets the cost of the equipment. The victim is then tricked into signing two contracts with the true costs often hidden, whilst being verbally promised that they will be free. The telecommunications company is paid an upfront fee by the finance company, and sometime later disappears. The victim is then left with an inflated finance company lease that requires the victim to pay often tens of thousands of dollars for equipment that in reality costs a fraction of the price.[46]
The company's high margins and profits, and the rewards for its executives and shareholders, saw the Australian media label the bank "The Millionaire Factory" up until its share price fell almost 85% in early 2009.[47]

History[edit]
1969 - 1979[edit]
Macquarie was founded on 10 December 1969 as Hill Samuel Australia Limited, a subsidiary of the UK's Hill Samuel & Co. Limited.[2]
Hill Samuel & Co. initially sought the advice of Sir John Marks, of Development Finance Corporation (DFC), regarding the establishment of an Australian subsidiary, however he suggested that Stan Owens instead be the one to compile a proposal for consideration. After presenting his report in London, Mr Owens was offered the role of implementing it by Hill Samuel's Chairman, Kenneth Keith, Baron Keith of Castleacre. Mr Owens became Executive Chairman of Hill Samuel Australia (HSA) and founded the company in Gold Fields House in Sydney's Circular Quay. The company's first three employees were Stan Owens, Blair Hesketh and Geoff Hobson Later Chris Castleman(on loan from the British parent) and Bill Clarke joined. David Clarke and Mark Johnson (both formerly of Darling & Co) were introduced to HSA and became joint Managing Directors. Despite being given a four-year allowance by the British parent to turn a profit, HSA was profitable by the end of its first twelve months of trading.
In 1971 HSA secured Australia’s biggest mandate at the time, a $US60 million financing for corrugated iron manufacturer John Lysaght Australia. HSA expanded its presence in the Australian market, opening a Melbourne office in 1972, and a Brisbane office in 1975. In 1979, HSA gained floor member status at the Sydney Futures Exchange.
1980 - 1989[edit]
In 1980 HSA began its expansion into funds management by establishing Australia’s first cash management account.[3] In 1981, in response to changes evolving from the deregulation of financial markets, HSA commenced work on a proposal to become a trading bank.[3] Authority for HSA to become Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL) was received from the Federal Treasurer on 28 February 1985, making it only the second private trading bank to be established in Australia in modern times.[4] In the same year, Macquarie established its philanthropic arm, the Macquarie Group Foundation. In 1987, Macquarie established what has become one of Australia’s largest corporate art collections, the Macquarie Group Collection.[5]
1990 - 1999[edit]
Macquarie continued its overseas expansion during the early 1990s, opening offices in London, Munich, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing. In 1994 Macquarie began its infrastructure investment business with the underwriting and placement of publicly listed equity for the Hills Motorway in Sydney.[3] On 29 July 1996, Macquarie Bank Limited listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX:MQG).[6] By 30 October 1996 Macquarie had entered the ASX All Ordinaries Index, with a market capitalisation of approximately $A1.3 billion. In June 1999, Macquarie acquired the investment banking arm of Bankers Trust Australia.[7]
2000 - 2009[edit]
Macquarie continued to expand its Asia operations in the early 2000s with the opening of offices in Seoul and Tokyo in 2000, and through the acquisition of ING Group’s Asian cash equities business for an undisclosed amount in March 2004.[8] On December 16, 2004, Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation began trading as Macquarie Infrastructure Company Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:MIC).[9]
In 2005 Macquarie announced a hostile takeover bid for the London Stock Exchange valuing the company at £1.5 billion, a bid rejected by LSE management as "derisory".[10] In October, Macquarie signalled its intention to acquire 100 per cent of U.S. energy marketing and trading company Cook Inlet Energy Supply, enabling Macquarie’s first physical natural gas trade in the US.[11]
Macquarie acquired UK gas supply company Corona Energy in August 2006.[12] In December 2006, Airline Partners Australia, a Macquarie-led consortium, launched an unsuccessful take over offer for Qantas.[13]
In 2007, MBL securityholders and the Federal Court approved the restructure of the Macquarie group into a non-operating holding company (NOHC) structure.[14] Macquarie Group is regulated by APRA, the Australian banking regulator, as the owner of Macquarie Bank Limited, an authorised deposit taker.[15]
On February 4, 2009, Macquarie announced its acquisition of Constellation Energy’s Houston-based downstream natural gas trading operations, making Macquarie Group the fourth largest physical gas trader in North America.[16] In the same year Macquarie acquired independent energy advisory firm Tristone Global Capital Inc; specialist investment bank Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Walker; Canadian wealth management business Blackmont Capital Inc; the wholesale electricity trading business of US firm Integrys Energy; US-based fixed income fund manager Allegiance Investment Management; the equity derivatives and structured products business of German private bank Sal. Oppenheim; and Condor Ferries service between the UK, Channel Islands and France.[17]
2010 - present[edit]
In 2010 Macquarie Group completed its largest foreign acquisition with the purchase of Delaware Investments, a leading US-based diversified asset management firm, from Lincoln Financial Group.[18] Delaware was rebranded as Macquarie Investment Management in 2017.[19]
In January 2015, Macquarie Group acquired a stake in Baltic 2 offshore wind park from EnBW for a fee totalling €720 million, due for completion in summer 2016 and subject to antitrust approval.[20] In March 2015 Macquarie announced the acquisition of a $US4 billion aircraft operating lease portfolio from AWAS Aviation Capital Limited.[21] Later in May that year, the group jointly acquired Australia's largest owner of mobile phone towers Crown Castle Australia Holdings for an undisclosed price, rumoured to be in the region of $A1.62 billion, from its ultimate owner, Crown Castle International Corp.[22] In October Macquarie entered into an agreement to acquire the $A8.2 billion Esanda dealer finance portfolio from ANZ Banking Group.[23]
Macquarie Group led a consortium of bidders to successfully acquire the British Green Investment Bank for $A3.9 billion. [24] The takeover means the group will manage or supervise around $A 6.8 billion of green infrastructure assets and projects. [25] The accompanying announcement stated that it will still pursue its main purpose of attracting private funds to invest in renewable energy generation assets.

Reverse of an 1813 Holey Dollar, in the collection of the State Library of NSW


Macquarie Group’s logo is a stylised representation of the ‘Holey Dollar’, Australia first official currency.[42]
In 1813 Governor Lachlan Macquarie overcame an acute currency shortage in the colony of New South Wales by importing 40,000 Spanish silver dollars and punching a hole through the centre of them to create two unique coins, the ‘Holey Dollar’ and the ‘Dump’.[42] The introduction of the currency stimulated the economy while retaining its intrinsic value, with the two new coins – the 'Holey Dollar' and the 'Dump' – worth 25 per cent more than the original.
According to Macquarie Group, the ‘Holey Dollar’ was Australia’s earliest example of ‘financial innovation’ and ‘embodies its pursuit of practical approaches with profitable outcomes’.[43]
Criticism[edit]
The company's high margins, profits and the lucrative rewards for its executives and shareholders saw the Australian media label the bank "The Millionaire Factory" due to their notably strong performances.[44] As of May 6, 2016, the group's chief executive Nicholas Moore became the nation's highest paid CEO of a listed company as they announced a net profit after tax for the year at A$2.06 billion.
Macquarie Group through its subsidiary Macquarie Equipment Rentals has allegedly been perpetrating a Telco finance scam. Macquarie Equipment Rentals has sued over 300 victims of the scam which involves bundling a finance equipment contract with a contract from a small telecommunications company, often obscuring that the finance contract exists.[45]
The scam involves the telecommunications company promising free equipment such as Plasma TVs, while offering a lower cost phone deal that offsets the cost of the equipment. The victim is then tricked into signing two contracts with the true costs often hidden, whilst being verbally promised that they will be free. The telecommunications company is paid an upfront fee by the finance company, and sometime later disappears. The victim is then left with an inflated finance company lease that requires the victim to pay often tens of thousands of dollars for equipment that in reality costs a fraction of the price.[46]
The company's high margins and profits, and the rewards for its executives and shareholders, saw the Australian media label the bank "The Millionaire Factory" up until its share price fell almost 85% in early 2009.[47]

History[edit]
1969 - 1979[edit]
Macquarie was founded on 10 December 1969 as Hill Samuel Australia Limited, a subsidiary of the UK's Hill Samuel & Co. Limited.[2]
Hill Samuel & Co. initially sought the advice of Sir John Marks, of Development Finance Corporation (DFC), regarding the establishment of an Australian subsidiary, however he suggested that Stan Owens instead be the one to compile a proposal for consideration. After presenting his report in London, Mr Owens was offered the role of implementing it by Hill Samuel's Chairman, Kenneth Keith, Baron Keith of Castleacre. Mr Owens became Executive Chairman of Hill Samuel Australia (HSA) and founded the company in Gold Fields House in Sydney's Circular Quay. The company's first three employees were Stan Owens, Blair Hesketh and Geoff Hobson Later Chris Castleman(on loan from the British parent) and Bill Clarke joined. David Clarke and Mark Johnson (both formerly of Darling & Co) were introduced to HSA and became joint Managing Directors. Despite being given a four-year allowance by the British parent to turn a profit, HSA was profitable by the end of its first twelve months of trading.
In 1971 HSA secured Australia’s biggest mandate at the time, a $US60 million financing for corrugated iron manufacturer John Lysaght Australia. HSA expanded its presence in the Australian market, opening a Melbourne office in 1972, and a Brisbane office in 1975. In 1979, HSA gained floor member status at the Sydney Futures Exchange.
1980 - 1989[edit]
In 1980 HSA began its expansion into funds management by establishing Australia’s first cash management account.[3] In 1981, in response to changes evolving from the deregulation of financial markets, HSA commenced work on a proposal to become a trading bank.[3] Authority for HSA to become Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL) was received from the Federal Treasurer on 28 February 1985, making it only the second private trading bank to be established in Australia in modern times.[4] In the same year, Macquarie established its philanthropic arm, the Macquarie Group Foundation. In 1987, Macquarie established what has become one of Australia’s largest corporate art collections, the Macquarie Group Collection.[5]
1990 - 1999[edit]
Macquarie continued its overseas expansion during the early 1990s, opening offices in London, Munich, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing. In 1994 Macquarie began its infrastructure investment business with the underwriting and placement of publicly listed equity for the Hills Motorway in Sydney.[3] On 29 July 1996, Macquarie Bank Limited listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX:MQG).[6] By 30 October 1996 Macquarie had entered the ASX All Ordinaries Index, with a market capitalisation of approximately $A1.3 billion. In June 1999, Macquarie acquired the investment banking arm of Bankers Trust Australia.[7]
2000 - 2009[edit]
Macquarie continued to expand its Asia operations in the early 2000s with the opening of offices in Seoul and Tokyo in 2000, and through the acquisition of ING Group’s Asian cash equities business for an undisclosed amount in March 2004.[8] On December 16, 2004, Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation began trading as Macquarie Infrastructure Company Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:MIC).[9]
In 2005 Macquarie announced a hostile takeover bid for the London Stock Exchange valuing the company at £1.5 billion, a bid rejected by LSE management as "derisory".[10] In October, Macquarie signalled its intention to acquire 100 per cent of U.S. energy marketing and trading company Cook Inlet Energy Supply, enabling Macquarie’s first physical natural gas trade in the US.[11]
Macquarie acquired UK gas supply company Corona Energy in August 2006.[12] In December 2006, Airline Partners Australia, a Macquarie-led consortium, launched an unsuccessful take over offer for Qantas.[13]
In 2007, MBL securityholders and the Federal Court approved the restructure of the Macquarie group into a non-operating holding company (NOHC) structure.[14] Macquarie Group is regulated by APRA, the Australian banking regulator, as the owner of Macquarie Bank Limited, an authorised deposit taker.[15]
On February 4, 2009, Macquarie announced its acquisition of Constellation Energy’s Houston-based downstream natural gas trading operations, making Macquarie Group the fourth largest physical gas trader in North America.[16] In the same year Macquarie acquired independent energy advisory firm Tristone Global Capital Inc; specialist investment bank Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Walker; Canadian wealth management business Blackmont Capital Inc; the wholesale electricity trading business of US firm Integrys Energy; US-based fixed income fund manager Allegiance Investment Management; the equity derivatives and structured products business of German private bank Sal. Oppenheim; and Condor Ferries service between the UK, Channel Islands and France.[17]
2010 - present[edit]
In 2010 Macquarie Group completed its largest foreign acquisition with the purchase of Delaware Investments, a leading US-based diversified asset management firm, from Lincoln Financial Group.[18] Delaware was rebranded as Macquarie Investment Management in 2017.[19]
In January 2015, Macquarie Group acquired a stake in Baltic 2 offshore wind park from EnBW for a fee totalling €720 million, due for completion in summer 2016 and subject to antitrust approval.[20] In March 2015 Macquarie announced the acquisition of a $US4 billion aircraft operating lease portfolio from AWAS Aviation Capital Limited.[21] Later in May that year, the group jointly acquired Australia's largest owner of mobile phone towers Crown Castle Australia Holdings for an undisclosed price, rumoured to be in the region of $A1.62 billion, from its ultimate owner, Crown Castle International Corp.[22] In October Macquarie entered into an agreement to acquire the $A8.2 billion Esanda dealer finance portfolio from ANZ Banking Group.[23]
Macquarie Group led a consortium of bidders to successfully acquire the British Green Investment Bank for $A3.9 billion. [24] The takeover means the group will manage or supervise around $A 6.8 billion of green infrastructure assets and projects. [25] The accompanying announcement stated that it will still pursue its main purpose of attracting private funds to invest in renewable energy generation assets.

Reverse of an 1813 Holey Dollar, in the collection of the State Library of NSW


Macquarie Group’s logo is a stylised representation of the ‘Holey Dollar’, Australia first official currency.[42]
In 1813 Governor Lachlan Macquarie overcame an acute currency shortage in the colony of New South Wales by importing 40,000 Spanish silver dollars and punching a hole through the centre of them to create two unique coins, the ‘Holey Dollar’ and the ‘Dump’.[42] The introduction of the currency stimulated the economy while retaining its intrinsic value, with the two new coins – the 'Holey Dollar' and the 'Dump' – worth 25 per cent more than the original.
According to Macquarie Group, the ‘Holey Dollar’ was Australia’s earliest example of ‘financial innovation’ and ‘embodies its pursuit of practical approaches with profitable outcomes’.[43]
Criticism[edit]
The company's high margins, profits and the lucrative rewards for its executives and shareholders saw the Australian media label the bank "The Millionaire Factory" due to their notably strong performances.[44] As of May 6, 2016, the group's chief executive Nicholas Moore became the nation's highest paid CEO of a listed company as they announced a net profit after tax for the year at A$2.06 billion.
Macquarie Group through its subsidiary Macquarie Equipment Rentals has allegedly been perpetrating a Telco finance scam. Macquarie Equipment Rentals has sued over 300 victims of the scam which involves bundling a finance equipment contract with a contract from a small telecommunications company, often obscuring that the finance contract exists.[45]
The scam involves the telecommunications company promising free equipment such as Plasma TVs, while offering a lower cost phone deal that offsets the cost of the equipment. The victim is then tricked into signing two contracts with the true costs often hidden, whilst being verbally promised that they will be free. The telecommunications company is paid an upfront fee by the finance company, and sometime later disappears. The victim is then left with an inflated finance company lease that requires the victim to pay often tens of thousands of dollars for equipment that in reality costs a fraction of the price.[46]
The company's high margins and profits, and the rewards for its executives and shareholders, saw the Australian media label the bank "The Millionaire Factory" up until its share price fell almost 85% in early 2009.[47]

History[edit]
1969 - 1979[edit]
Macquarie was founded on 10 December 1969 as Hill Samuel Australia Limited, a subsidiary of the UK's Hill Samuel & Co. Limited.[2]
Hill Samuel & Co. initially sought the advice of Sir John Marks, of Development Finance Corporation (DFC), regarding the establishment of an Australian subsidiary, however he suggested that Stan Owens instead be the one to compile a proposal for consideration. After presenting his report in London, Mr Owens was offered the role of implementing it by Hill Samuel's Chairman, Kenneth Keith, Baron Keith of Castleacre. Mr Owens became Executive Chairman of Hill Samuel Australia (HSA) and founded the company in Gold Fields House in Sydney's Circular Quay. The company's first three employees were Stan Owens, Blair Hesketh and Geoff Hobson Later Chris Castleman(on loan from the British parent) and Bill Clarke joined. David Clarke and Mark Johnson (both formerly of Darling & Co) were introduced to HSA and became joint Managing Directors. Despite being given a four-year allowance by the British parent to turn a profit, HSA was profitable by the end of its first twelve months of trading.
In 1971 HSA secured Australia’s biggest mandate at the time, a $US60 million financing for corrugated iron manufacturer John Lysaght Australia. HSA expanded its presence in the Australian market, opening a Melbourne office in 1972, and a Brisbane office in 1975. In 1979, HSA gained floor member status at the Sydney Futures Exchange.
1980 - 1989[edit]
In 1980 HSA began its expansion into funds management by establishing Australia’s first cash management account.[3] In 1981, in response to changes evolving from the deregulation of financial markets, HSA commenced work on a proposal to become a trading bank.[3] Authority for HSA to become Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL) was received from the Federal Treasurer on 28 February 1985, making it only the second private trading bank to be established in Australia in modern times.[4] In the same year, Macquarie established its philanthropic arm, the Macquarie Group Foundation. In 1987, Macquarie established what has become one of Australia’s largest corporate art collections, the Macquarie Group Collection.[5]
1990 - 1999[edit]
Macquarie continued its overseas expansion during the early 1990s, opening offices in London, Munich, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing. In 1994 Macquarie began its infrastructure investment business with the underwriting and placement of publicly listed equity for the Hills Motorway in Sydney.[3] On 29 July 1996, Macquarie Bank Limited listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX:MQG).[6] By 30 October 1996 Macquarie had entered the ASX All Ordinaries Index, with a market capitalisation of approximately $A1.3 billion. In June 1999, Macquarie acquired the investment banking arm of Bankers Trust Australia.[7]
2000 - 2009[edit]
Macquarie continued to expand its Asia operations in the early 2000s with the opening of offices in Seoul and Tokyo in 2000, and through the acquisition of ING Group’s Asian cash equities business for an undisclosed amount in March 2004.[8] On December 16, 2004, Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation began trading as Macquarie Infrastructure Company Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:MIC).[9]
In 2005 Macquarie announced a hostile takeover bid for the London Stock Exchange valuing the company at £1.5 billion, a bid rejected by LSE management as "derisory".[10] In October, Macquarie signalled its intention to acquire 100 per cent of U.S. energy marketing and trading company Cook Inlet Energy Supply, enabling Macquarie’s first physical natural gas trade in the US.[11]
Macquarie acquired UK gas supply company Corona Energy in August 2006.[12] In December 2006, Airline Partners Australia, a Macquarie-led consortium, launched an unsuccessful take over offer for Qantas.[13]
In 2007, MBL securityholders and the Federal Court approved the restructure of the Macquarie group into a non-operating holding company (NOHC) structure.[14] Macquarie Group is regulated by APRA, the Australian banking regulator, as the owner of Macquarie Bank Limited, an authorised deposit taker.[15]
On February 4, 2009, Macquarie announced its acquisition of Constellation Energy’s Houston-based downstream natural gas trading operations, making Macquarie Group the fourth largest physical gas trader in North America.[16] In the same year Macquarie acquired independent energy advisory firm Tristone Global Capital Inc; specialist investment bank Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Walker; Canadian wealth management business Blackmont Capital Inc; the wholesale electricity trading business of US firm Integrys Energy; US-based fixed income fund manager Allegiance Investment Management; the equity derivatives and structured products business of German private bank Sal. Oppenheim; and Condor Ferries service between the UK, Channel Islands and France.[17]
2010 - present[edit]
In 2010 Macquarie Group completed its largest foreign acquisition with the purchase of Delaware Investments, a leading US-based diversified asset management firm, from Lincoln Financial Group.[18] Delaware was rebranded as Macquarie Investment Management in 2017.[19]
In January 2015, Macquarie Group acquired a stake in Baltic 2 offshore wind park from EnBW for a fee totalling €720 million, due for completion in summer 2016 and subject to antitrust approval.[20] In March 2015 Macquarie announced the acquisition of a $US4 billion aircraft operating lease portfolio from AWAS Aviation Capital Limited.[21] Later in May that year, the group jointly acquired Australia's largest owner of mobile phone towers Crown Castle Australia Holdings for an undisclosed price, rumoured to be in the region of $A1.62 billion, from its ultimate owner, Crown Castle International Corp.[22] In October Macquarie entered into an agreement to acquire the $A8.2 billion Esanda dealer finance portfolio from ANZ Banking Group.[23]
Macquarie Group led a consortium of bidders to successfully acquire the British Green Investment Bank for $A3.9 billion. [24] The takeover means the group will manage or supervise around $A 6.8 billion of green infrastructure assets and projects. [25] The accompanying announcement stated that it will still pursue its main purpose of attracting private funds to invest in renewable energy generation assets.

Reverse of an 1813 Holey Dollar, in the collection of the State Library of NSW


Macquarie Group’s logo is a stylised representation of the ‘Holey Dollar’, Australia first official currency.[42]
In 1813 Governor Lachlan Macquarie overcame an acute currency shortage in the colony of New South Wales by importing 40,000 Spanish silver dollars and punching a hole through the centre of them to create two unique coins, the ‘Holey Dollar’ and the ‘Dump’.[42] The introduction of the currency stimulated the economy while retaining its intrinsic value, with the two new coins – the 'Holey Dollar' and the 'Dump' – worth 25 per cent more than the original.
According to Macquarie Group, the ‘Holey Dollar’ was Australia’s earliest example of ‘financial innovation’ and ‘embodies its pursuit of practical approaches with profitable outcomes’.[43]
Criticism[edit]
The company's high margins, profits and the lucrative rewards for its executives and shareholders saw the Australian media label the bank "The Millionaire Factory" due to their notably strong performances.[44] As of May 6, 2016, the group's chief executive Nicholas Moore became the nation's highest paid CEO of a listed company as they announced a net profit after tax for the year at A$2.06 billion.
Macquarie Group through its subsidiary Macquarie Equipment Rentals has allegedly been perpetrating a Telco finance scam. Macquarie Equipment Rentals has sued over 300 victims of the scam which involves bundling a finance equipment contract with a contract from a small telecommunications company, often obscuring that the finance contract exists.[45]
The scam involves the telecommunications company promising free equipment such as Plasma TVs, while offering a lower cost phone deal that offsets the cost of the equipment. The victim is then tricked into signing two contracts with the true costs often hidden, whilst being verbally promised that they will be free. The telecommunications company is paid an upfront fee by the finance company, and sometime later disappears. The victim is then left with an inflated finance company lease that requires the victim to pay often tens of thousands of dollars for equipment that in reality costs a fraction of the price.[46]
The company's high margins and profits, and the rewards for its executives and shareholders, saw the Australian media label the bank "The Millionaire Factory" up until its share price fell almost 85% in early 2009.[47]

Macquarie Global Infrastructure Income Fund


        
    


       The Fund will invest in listed equity securities of global infrastructure companies that own or operate infrastructure assets or provide services. These are entities that derive at least 65% of their revenues or profits from the ownership or operation of infrastructure assets.
    

       The Fund’s investment objectives are to generate:
    


        Quarterly distributions for holders of units (“Unitholders”) currently targeted to be $0.15 per unit ($0.60 per annum representing an annual cash distribution of 6.0% based on the $10.00 per Combined Unit issue price);
      

        Total return for Unitholders, consisting of dividend income and capital appreciation; and 
      

        Preservation of capital.
      


       Macquarie Capital Investment Management LLC (“MCIM”) will act as the portfolio manager (the “Portfolio Manager”) of the Fund. The Portfolio Manager will be responsible for the Fund’s investment strategy and will provide investment advisory and portfolio management services to the Fund. The Portfolio Manager is part of the Macquarie Funds Group (“MFG”), Macquarie Group’s funds management business. MFG is Australia’s largest asset manager and world’s largest infrastructure investor with over $366 billion globally in assets under management of which $107 billion (inclusive of MCIM’s affiliates globally) is invested in both listed and private or direct infrastructure mandates (as at June 30, 2013).
    

       Fund highlights:
    


        Infrastructure: A compelling, long-term investment opportunity with attractive income and growth potential
      

        Macquarie Funds Group: World’s largest infrastructure asset manager with $107 billion of infrastructure under management
      

        Quarterly distribution initially targeted at 6 0% p.a.
      

        Outstanding track record: Strategy has consistently outperformed its benchmark
      

        Exposure to a global portfolio of listed infrastructure securities
