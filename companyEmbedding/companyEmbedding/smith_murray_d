Early life[edit]
Smith took his post secondary education as the University of Calgary where he earned a B.A. (Economics & Political Science). He also attended London Business School’s Senior Executive Program and went to Notre Dame College in Wilcox, Saskatchewan.
After University he worked in the Alberta energy sector with a number of Alberta-based energy service companies including drilling fluids, service rigs, oilfield contracting and consulting.[1] In addition to his involvement in the private sector, he was an active community volunteer. Political Career
Smith ran for political office on the provincial level. He ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature in the electoral district of Calgary-Varsity in the 1993 Alberta general election. He won the new electoral district winning a hotly contested race against Liberal candidate Carrol Jaques and three other candidates to pick up the district for the provincial Progressive Conservatives.[2]
After the election Premier Ralph Klein appointed Smith to the Executive Council of Alberta. He served as the Minister of Economic Development and Tourism. During his tenure of the portfolio he phased out the Machinery and Equipment Tax. This was the largest industrial tax reduction in the province’s history. Klein would shuffle his cabinet on May 31, 1996 and Smith became the Minister of Labour.
Smith ran for re-election in the 1997 Alberta general election with ministerial advantage. He faced off against Jaques for the second time and ended up returning to his second term with a larger majority over the other four candidates. Jaques saw her popular vote fall from her 1993 result.[3]
Klein would shuffle his cabinet on May 26, 1999. Smith was given a new portfolio he became the first Minister of Gaming for the province.[1] He ran for a third term in office in the 2001 Alberta general election and faced Jaques for the third time. He defeated three other candidates including Jaques with a landslide majority to win his third term, while Jaques popular vote collapsed.[4]
After the election in 2001 Klein would assign Smith to another portfolio he would become the Minister of Energy on March 16, 2001. Smith was responsible in that portfolio for gaining international recognition of Alberta’s 176 billion barrels of established oil reserves—including 174 billion barrels of oil sands. During his tenure, Alberta annual oil and gas royalty revenue rose to over $9 billion, a record number of wells were drilled (over 20,000), and over $60 billion in investment was committed to Alberta oil sands projects.
Smith was also responsible for Alberta’s electricity sector, guiding the $5 billion market move to a competitive wholesale generation market. Increased investment added over 5000 megawatts in new generation, and Alberta became the top wind generation province in Canada. He retired from provincial politics at dissolution of the legislature in 2004.
Washington appointment[edit]
After leaving provincial politics Smith was appointed in January 2005 as the Official Representative of the Province of Alberta to the United States of America. He led the Alberta Office in Washington, DC, until returning to Canada in the fall of 2007. Smith is a member of the Board at Williams(WMB.nyse) He is also a member of the board at N-Solv, a private company with Hatch as the majority shareholder. N-Solv is a in situ oilsands technology company that produces oil with 85% reduction in GHG emissions and uses no water
As Alberta’s representative in Washington DC, Murray was a Congressional Nominee for Securing America’s Future Energy, a Presidential Commission, (The Energy Policy Act of 2005). Murray also built a partnership with the Smithsonian Institution that featured Alberta on the National Mall in Washington DC in 2006, as part of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival that attracted over a million visitors and garnered national media attention. During his tenure in Washington DC, Murray testified in Senate and Congressional Committees on Energy, was a frequent commentator and source for energy analysis for US print and electronic media. Murray is also a frequent presenter and speaker to investor organizations, conferences and numerous seminars.
Late Life[edit]
Smith is a current member of Energy Advisory Board of TD Securities Inc. He serves on various energy related corporate boards, and is President of a private consulting company, Murray Smith and Associates.
Smith has been the recipient of numerous awards, including being named as one of the top 40 alumni in the past 40 years at the University of Calgary (where an endowment exists in his name). In 2006 Smith was recognized as one of Alberta Venture newsmagazine’s 50 most influential Albertans. Smith was also recently recognized for his work with the First Nations of Alberta and made an honorary Chief and given the name “Seven War Bonnets Man”. Murray is a contributor to many community organizations and is a past Director of the Calgary Stampede Board.
Smith is married to Barbara Smith and has two daughters. He is a golfer and a lifetime member of the Riley Park Cricket Club.

After University he worked in the Alberta energy sector with a number of Alberta-based energy service companies including drilling fluids, service rigs, oilfield contracting and consulting.[1] In addition to his involvement in the private sector, he was an active community volunteer. Political Career
Smith ran for political office on the provincial level. He ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature in the electoral district of Calgary-Varsity in the 1993 Alberta general election. He won the new electoral district winning a hotly contested race against Liberal candidate Carrol Jaques and three other candidates to pick up the district for the provincial Progressive Conservatives.[2]
After the election Premier Ralph Klein appointed Smith to the Executive Council of Alberta. He served as the Minister of Economic Development and Tourism. During his tenure of the portfolio he phased out the Machinery and Equipment Tax. This was the largest industrial tax reduction in the province’s history. Klein would shuffle his cabinet on May 31, 1996 and Smith became the Minister of Labour.
Smith ran for re-election in the 1997 Alberta general election with ministerial advantage. He faced off against Jaques for the second time and ended up returning to his second term with a larger majority over the other four candidates. Jaques saw her popular vote fall from her 1993 result.[3]
Klein would shuffle his cabinet on May 26, 1999. Smith was given a new portfolio he became the first Minister of Gaming for the province.[1] He ran for a third term in office in the 2001 Alberta general election and faced Jaques for the third time. He defeated three other candidates including Jaques with a landslide majority to win his third term, while Jaques popular vote collapsed.[4]
After the election in 2001 Klein would assign Smith to another portfolio he would become the Minister of Energy on March 16, 2001. Smith was responsible in that portfolio for gaining international recognition of Alberta’s 176 billion barrels of established oil reserves—including 174 billion barrels of oil sands. During his tenure, Alberta annual oil and gas royalty revenue rose to over $9 billion, a record number of wells were drilled (over 20,000), and over $60 billion in investment was committed to Alberta oil sands projects.
Smith was also responsible for Alberta’s electricity sector, guiding the $5 billion market move to a competitive wholesale generation market. Increased investment added over 5000 megawatts in new generation, and Alberta became the top wind generation province in Canada. He retired from provincial politics at dissolution of the legislature in 2004.
Washington appointment[edit]
After leaving provincial politics Smith was appointed in January 2005 as the Official Representative of the Province of Alberta to the United States of America. He led the Alberta Office in Washington, DC, until returning to Canada in the fall of 2007. Smith is a member of the Board at Williams(WMB.nyse) He is also a member of the board at N-Solv, a private company with Hatch as the majority shareholder. N-Solv is a in situ oilsands technology company that produces oil with 85% reduction in GHG emissions and uses no water
As Alberta’s representative in Washington DC, Murray was a Congressional Nominee for Securing America’s Future Energy, a Presidential Commission, (The Energy Policy Act of 2005). Murray also built a partnership with the Smithsonian Institution that featured Alberta on the National Mall in Washington DC in 2006, as part of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival that attracted over a million visitors and garnered national media attention. During his tenure in Washington DC, Murray testified in Senate and Congressional Committees on Energy, was a frequent commentator and source for energy analysis for US print and electronic media. Murray is also a frequent presenter and speaker to investor organizations, conferences and numerous seminars.
Late Life[edit]
Smith is a current member of Energy Advisory Board of TD Securities Inc. He serves on various energy related corporate boards, and is President of a private consulting company, Murray Smith and Associates.
Smith has been the recipient of numerous awards, including being named as one of the top 40 alumni in the past 40 years at the University of Calgary (where an endowment exists in his name). In 2006 Smith was recognized as one of Alberta Venture newsmagazine’s 50 most influential Albertans. Smith was also recently recognized for his work with the First Nations of Alberta and made an honorary Chief and given the name “Seven War Bonnets Man”. Murray is a contributor to many community organizations and is a past Director of the Calgary Stampede Board.

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Smith's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Smith's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices.

Publisher's Description▼▲
In 1850, a nine-year-old boy living in London, England, is forcibly snatched out of a devastatingly broken family upon the disclosure of his father’s infidelity. In the care of a guardian, this child loses everything familiar as he is shipped off as part of British colonial expansion in the Canterbury region of New Zealand, supposedly “for his own good.” As a result, little Grayson’s life and sense of identity are shattered, and it seems a mysterious generational legacy propels his life into inexplicable tragedy and loss. Will a destructive family dynamic triumph, or will a transcendent power arrest the evil at work and release a positive inheritance upon this family?

Product Description
Murray Smith – Neural Networks for Statistical Modeling

 
This book provides a detailed, yet accessible technical explanation of the inner workings of backpropagation of errors, the most commonly used training method for feedforward neural networks.
 
This book is for the programmer who wishes to implement backprop, or for the data miner who wishes to understand backprop. This book is not well-suited for people without a technical (math) background.
 
Pros:
-Pseudocode is provided
-Explanation advances from plain vanilla backprop to variants including enhancements like adaptive step size and momentum
-Application of neural networks is covered, including practical issues such as appropriate data representation and avoidance of over-fitting
-A few alternative architectures are explained (briefly) at the end of the book
