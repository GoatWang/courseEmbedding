In July 2005, Flowserve underwent a leadership change. The board of directors announced Lewis M. Kling, COO at the time, as the new president, CEO, and a member of the board of directors. On May 30, 2007 Kling's employment agreement was extended until February 28, 2010.[11] Lewis M. Kling announced his retirement at the end of the upon agreement in February 2010. Kling was elected vice chairman of the board effective October 1, 2009. Mark Blinn succeeded Kling as CEO. Previously Mark Blinn served as CFO from 2004 to October 1, 2009 when he officially took over as CEO and vice chairman of the board.[12]
Current members of the board of directors of Flowserve are: Mark A. Blinn, Kevin E. Sheehan, Christopher A. Bartlett (DBA), Gayla J. Delly, Roger L. Fix, John R. Friedery, Joseph E. Harlan, Diane C. Harris, Michael F. Johnston, Lewis M. Kling, Rick J. Mills, Charles M. Rampacek, James O. Rollans and William C. Rusnack.
Educational services[edit]
Flowserve has five training centers for students around the world to attend. They are in Irving, TX, Kalamazoo, MI, Houston, TX, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Desio, Italy. The learning resource center (LRC) in Irving is 24,000 square feet (2,200 m2) with classrooms, static labs, and power labs with complete pumping systems.[13]
The LRC in Italy is the most recent, opening on April 20, 2010.[14]
Environmental efforts[edit]
To support the Hurricane Katrina disaster relief, Flowserve donated $50,000 and matched up to $50,000 in employee donations to the Red Cross according to a CNN article.[15]
Restatements[edit]
On Feb 3, 2004, Flowserve announced restatement of its financial statements for aggregate estimated pretax adjustments for 2003. The restatement was approximately $11 million.[16]
On Oct 26, 2004, Flowserve determined to restate its previously announced financial results for the second quarter of 2004, including certain post-closing adjustments and recently identified out-of-period expenses. The restatement had no impact on net cash balance.[17]
On Feb 7, 2005, Flowserve confirmed that it would restate its 2000 through first quarter 2004 financial statements, resulting from an ongoing comprehensive review of the company's accounts. The restatement reduced net income for the periods restated.[18]

On May 30, 2007 Kling's employment agreement was extended until February 28, 2010.[11] Lewis M. Kling announced his retirement at the end of the upon agreement in February 2010. Kling was elected vice chairman of the board effective October 1, 2009. Mark Blinn succeeded Kling as CEO. Previously Mark Blinn served as CFO from 2004 to October 1, 2009 when he officially took over as CEO and vice chairman of the board.[12]
Current members of the board of directors of Flowserve are: Mark A. Blinn, Kevin E. Sheehan, Christopher A. Bartlett (DBA), Gayla J. Delly, Roger L. Fix, John R. Friedery, Joseph E. Harlan, Diane C. Harris, Michael F. Johnston, Lewis M. Kling, Rick J. Mills, Charles M. Rampacek, James O. Rollans and William C. Rusnack.

Flowserve has five training centers for students around the world to attend. They are in Irving, TX, Kalamazoo, MI, Houston, TX, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Desio, Italy. The learning resource center (LRC) in Irving is 24,000 square feet (2,200 m2) with classrooms, static labs, and power labs with complete pumping systems.[13]
The LRC in Italy is the most recent, opening on April 20, 2010.[14]
Environmental efforts[edit]
To support the Hurricane Katrina disaster relief, Flowserve donated $50,000 and matched up to $50,000 in employee donations to the Red Cross according to a CNN article.[15]
Restatements[edit]
On Feb 3, 2004, Flowserve announced restatement of its financial statements for aggregate estimated pretax adjustments for 2003. The restatement was approximately $11 million.[16]
On Oct 26, 2004, Flowserve determined to restate its previously announced financial results for the second quarter of 2004, including certain post-closing adjustments and recently identified out-of-period expenses. The restatement had no impact on net cash balance.[17]
On Feb 7, 2005, Flowserve confirmed that it would restate its 2000 through first quarter 2004 financial statements, resulting from an ongoing comprehensive review of the company's accounts. The restatement reduced net income for the periods restated.[18]

On May 30, 2007 Kling's employment agreement was extended until February 28, 2010.[11] Lewis M. Kling announced his retirement at the end of the upon agreement in February 2010. Kling was elected vice chairman of the board effective October 1, 2009. Mark Blinn succeeded Kling as CEO. Previously Mark Blinn served as CFO from 2004 to October 1, 2009 when he officially took over as CEO and vice chairman of the board.[12]

The learning resource center (LRC) in Irving is 24,000 square feet (2,200 m2) with classrooms, static labs, and power labs with complete pumping systems.[13]
The LRC in Italy is the most recent, opening on April 20, 2010.[14]
Environmental efforts[edit]
To support the Hurricane Katrina disaster relief, Flowserve donated $50,000 and matched up to $50,000 in employee donations to the Red Cross according to a CNN article.[15]
Restatements[edit]
On Feb 3, 2004, Flowserve announced restatement of its financial statements for aggregate estimated pretax adjustments for 2003. The restatement was approximately $11 million.[16]
On Oct 26, 2004, Flowserve determined to restate its previously announced financial results for the second quarter of 2004, including certain post-closing adjustments and recently identified out-of-period expenses. The restatement had no impact on net cash balance.[17]
On Feb 7, 2005, Flowserve confirmed that it would restate its 2000 through first quarter 2004 financial statements, resulting from an ongoing comprehensive review of the company's accounts. The restatement reduced net income for the periods restated.[18]

On May 30, 2007 Kling's employment agreement was extended until February 28, 2010.[11] Lewis M. Kling announced his retirement at the end of the upon agreement in February 2010. Kling was elected vice chairman of the board effective October 1, 2009. Mark Blinn succeeded Kling as CEO. Previously Mark Blinn served as CFO from 2004 to October 1, 2009 when he officially took over as CEO and vice chairman of the board.[12]

To support the Hurricane Katrina disaster relief, Flowserve donated $50,000 and matched up to $50,000 in employee donations to the Red Cross according to a CNN article.[15]
Restatements[edit]
On Feb 3, 2004, Flowserve announced restatement of its financial statements for aggregate estimated pretax adjustments for 2003. The restatement was approximately $11 million.[16]
On Oct 26, 2004, Flowserve determined to restate its previously announced financial results for the second quarter of 2004, including certain post-closing adjustments and recently identified out-of-period expenses. The restatement had no impact on net cash balance.[17]
On Feb 7, 2005, Flowserve confirmed that it would restate its 2000 through first quarter 2004 financial statements, resulting from an ongoing comprehensive review of the company's accounts. The restatement reduced net income for the periods restated.[18]

Corporate governance[edit]
In July 2005, Flowserve underwent a leadership change. The board of directors announced Lewis M. Kling, COO at the time, as the new president, CEO, and a member of the board of directors. On May 30, 2007 Kling's employment agreement was extended until February 28, 2010.[11] Lewis M. Kling announced his retirement at the end of the upon agreement in February 2010. Kling was elected vice chairman of the board effective October 1, 2009. Mark Blinn succeeded Kling as CEO. Previously Mark Blinn served as CFO from 2004 to October 1, 2009 when he officially took over as CEO and vice chairman of the board.[12]
Current members of the board of directors of Flowserve are: Mark A. Blinn, Kevin E. Sheehan, Christopher A. Bartlett (DBA), Gayla J. Delly, Roger L. Fix, John R. Friedery, Joseph E. Harlan, Diane C. Harris, Michael F. Johnston, Lewis M. Kling, Rick J. Mills, Charles M. Rampacek, James O. Rollans and William C. Rusnack.
Educational services[edit]
Flowserve has five training centers for students around the world to attend. They are in Irving, TX, Kalamazoo, MI, Houston, TX, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Desio, Italy. The learning resource center (LRC) in Irving is 24,000 square feet (2,200 m2) with classrooms, static labs, and power labs with complete pumping systems.[13]
The LRC in Italy is the most recent, opening on April 20, 2010.[14]
Environmental efforts[edit]
To support the Hurricane Katrina disaster relief, Flowserve donated $50,000 and matched up to $50,000 in employee donations to the Red Cross according to a CNN article.[15]
Restatements[edit]
On Feb 3, 2004, Flowserve announced restatement of its financial statements for aggregate estimated pretax adjustments for 2003. The restatement was approximately $11 million.[16]
On Oct 26, 2004, Flowserve determined to restate its previously announced financial results for the second quarter of 2004, including certain post-closing adjustments and recently identified out-of-period expenses. The restatement had no impact on net cash balance.[17]
On Feb 7, 2005, Flowserve confirmed that it would restate its 2000 through first quarter 2004 financial statements, resulting from an ongoing comprehensive review of the company's accounts. The restatement reduced net income for the periods restated.[18]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Flowserve (FLS) Q2 Earnings Miss by Half, Guidance Falls


July 28, 2017, 10:46:00 AM EDT

  Flowserve Corp.  FLS  reversed its recent earnings beat trend as its second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 22 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents by half. On a reported basis, the company's earnings per share plunged 31.3% to 32 cents on a year-over-year basis. Precipitous top-line decline, owing to macroeconomic volatility, as well as foreign currency headwinds, proved to be major drags for the bottom line.  Quarter in Detail  Revenues fell 14.6% year over year to $877.1 million and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $926 million. Sluggish progress of the Industrial Product Division turnaround, customer delays in product pick-up, and significantly high tax rate, proved to be a drag on the revenues. Also, foreign currency headwinds eroded sales by $10 million. The company's bookings totaled $971 million in second-quarter 2017, up 0.8% year over year at constant currency (cc). After-market bookings totaled $458 million and were down 3.7% at cc, while original equipment bookings were up 5.15% at cc to $514 million. Growth in bookings came on the back of modest recovery in the oil & gas industry, and higher original equipment bookings. Operating income of the company came in at $126.1 million, up 34.5% from the year-ago period. Foreign currency headwinds and lower sales acted as major dampeners for operating income performance. Also, adjusted gross margin expanded 360 bps to 31.5%.  Segmental Results  Engineered Product Division revenues were down 16.6% year over year to $427.7 million in the quarter. Negative currency translation effects, along with lower original equipment sales in the Americas and Africa, crippled the sales of this segment. However, bookings were almost flat year over year at $465.1 million. Sales at the Flow Control Division declined 13.2% year over year to $275.4 million, marred by currency headwinds and soft customer original equipment sales in key end markets.Bookings of this segment totaled $316.2 million, up 1.1% year over year. Moreover, Industrial Product Division sales were down 10.8% year over year to $191.8 million. Foreign currency headwinds, along with low original equipment sales, resulted in the decline across all main geographies. Furthermore, bookings totaled $213.3 million, up 0.5% year over year.  Flowserve Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise       Flowserve Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise    |      Flowserve Corporation Quote   Restructuring Initiatives  Currently, the company is following its $400 million multi-year investment, which is anticipated to result in savings of $195 million in 2017. In 2018, savings from the full annualized program are projected at $230 million. These investments are aimed at streamlining management structure, reducing manufacturing costs and implementing cost-saving measures for the overall optimization of the cost structure. The company also expects to trim its workforce by 15-20%, and manufacturing footprint by 30% compared with the 2015 level, as well as shift manufacturing to lower cost regions, under this $400 million worth of restructuring initiative. Flowserve will announce all facility closures by year-end 2017. In relation to the restructuring efforts, Flowserve spent about $32 million in first-quarter 2017, which, in turn, led to incremental savings of $21 million. It remains optimistic about completing the $400-million program in 2017. Also, under the restructuring program, Flowserve completed the divestiture of the Gestra AG business unit to Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc for €186 million ($198.4 million). The sale is part of Flowserve's broader strategy to improve focus on core business, and optimize its product portfolio and manufacturing footprint.  Balance Sheet & Cash Flow  Flowserve ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $505.2 million compared with $367.2 million as of Dec 31, 2016. On Jun 30, 2017, the company's long-term debt totaled $1,501 million, up from $1,485.3 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Flowserve's net cash flow provided by operating activities came in at $46.6 million at the end Jun 30, 2017, up significantly from $10.7 million recorded in the prior-year period.  2017 Outlook  Flowserve reduced its 2017 guidance and now expects adjusted earnings per share guidance to lie in the band of $1.30-$1.50 (previous guidance: $1.55-$1.85). It estimates revenues to decline in the range of 6-10%. The company does not anticipate any major turnaround in the current geopolitical environment and end markets for 2017. Factors including currency rates, commodity prices, expected bookings and market volatility are likely to put pressure on both the top- and bottom-line performances for this year. However, in light of the continued stability of the company's bookings and modest sequential improvement in operations, Flowserve anticipates its performance to improve in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter.  To Conclude  Flowserve had a choppy first half of the year. Its biggest challenge comes in the form of capital spending constraints and aftermarket push outs. In the recent past, the company's operations have suffered from project delays, rolling maintenance deferrals, and extended timelines for both order placement and delivery acceptance. We believe Flowserve will continue to witness challenging times in the second half of the year. On the other hand, relative stability of oil at around the level of $45-$50 over the past couple of quarters is a major positive for the company. It appears that Flowserve's orders are finally showing signs of bottoming out, signaling brighter days ahead. Going forward, we believe stabilization in core aftermarket activities bode well for long-term growth of the company. Other key strengths include strong operational model, solid productivity, and considerable aftermarket content and geographical diversity. In particular, the diligent restructuring efforts are starting to manifest themselves in substantial savings. Despite these positives, there is no denying the fact that the company's waning top-line performance remains a major concern.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider  Flowserve presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader space include Barnes Group Inc. B  , Eaton Corporation, PLC ETN  and Regal Beloit Corporation RBC  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here  .  Barnes Group has a solid earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates each time for an average of 8.9%. Eaton also has a decent earnings surprise history, with an average beat of 3.3% over the trailing four quarters, beating estimates thrice. Regal Beloit generated two beats over the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 1.5%.  The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All  Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaries,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

Flowserve Corporation Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results






July 27, 2017 04:17 PM Eastern Daylight Time



DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Flowserve Corporation (NYSE: FLS), a leading provider of flow control 
      products and services for the global infrastructure markets, today 
      announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 
      2017.
    

Second Quarter 2017 Highlights (all 
      comparisons to 2016 second quarter, unless otherwise noted)
    


        Reported Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $0.32

        

            Adjusted EPS[1] was $0.22 and excludes a net gain of 
            $0.10 per share from adjusted items and was impacted by an 
            adjusted tax rate of 46.3%
          



        Sales were $877 million, down 13.6% on a constant currency basis, 
        including an approximately 2% negative impact related to the 
        previously announced Gestra business divestiture

        

            Aftermarket sales were $435 million, down 3.6% on a constant 
            currency basis
          



        Total bookings were $971 million, up 0.8% on a constant currency 
        basis, including approximately 2% negative impact due to the Gestra 
        divestiture

        

            Original equipment bookings were $514 million, up 5.1% on a 
            constant currency basis
          

            Aftermarket bookings were $458 million, or 47% of total bookings, 
            down 3.7% on a constant currency basis
          

            Total book-to-bill was 1.11
          



        Reported gross and operating margins of 27.9% and 14.4%

        

            Adjusted gross and operating margins[2] were 31.5% and 
            8.1%
          



        Backlog at June 30, 2017 was $2.1 billion, up 12.4% and 1.5% versus 
        2016 year-end, and prior year second quarter, respectively
      


      “Flowserve’s second quarter results were below our expectations for the 
      period, and do not reflect the underlying potential of our business,” 
      said Scott Rowe, Flowserve’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “A 
      number of factors impacted the quarter’s outcome, including slower than 
      expected progress of the IPD turnaround, customer delays in product 
      pick-up, and a significantly higher than guided tax rate. Despite this 
      performance, we are encouraged by the continued stability of our 
      bookings, and the modest sequential improvement in our operations. As a 
      result, we continue to expect the second half of the year to demonstrate 
      marked improvement, particularly in the fourth quarter.”
    

      Rowe added, “Over the course of my first 100 days with Flowserve, I have 
      focused on our people, customers, and operations. The leadership team 
      now understands my expectations and we are aligned on our approach to 
      achieve our objectives. I am excited about the numerous opportunities 
      ahead for Flowserve, including the ability to simplify and drive further 
      efficiencies in all aspects of our operations. Going forward, we will be 
      market led, customer centric and operationally excellent. I remain 
      confident that the company is well-positioned to drive long-term value 
      for both our customers and shareholders.”
    

Full Year 2017 Guidance


      Flowserve updated its 2017 guidance to reflect its first half results 
      and expectations for the remainder of the year, and now expects Reported 
      and Adjusted[3] EPS target ranges of $0.85 to $1.05 and $1.30 
      to $1.50, respectively. Both EPS target ranges are based on an expected 
      6 to 10 percent decline in revenues year-over-year. Adjusted EPS 
      guidance anticipates a return to the guided tax rate, of 30-to-31%, for 
      the remainder of the year, and it excludes expected realignment expense, 
      as well as the potential impact of below-the-line foreign currency 
      effects and certain other discrete items, such as the gain on sale of 
      our Gestra business, finalized in the second quarter 2017.
    

Reclassifications and Revision to Prior Periods


      The company also announced today that during the 2017 second quarter, 
      certain immaterial accounting errors were identified in prior period 
      financial statements for the period beginning in 2013 through the first 
      quarter of 2017, which occurred primarily at two non-U.S. sites, and 
      principally involved certain inventory and accounts receivable balances. 
      While not material to any prior annual or quarterly period, in order to 
      enhance transparency, the company has determined to amend its 2016 Form 
      10-K and the March 31, 2017 Form 10-Q to reflect the revisions. 
      Additionally, the company has determined material weakness existed in 
      its internal control structure at year-end 2016 and continued through 
      the end of the 2017 second quarter. The company intends to institute 
      remediation plans as a result of these errors. The cumulative effect of 
      the changes to retained earnings as of March 31, 2017 was a reduction of 
      approximately $30 million.
    

Second Quarter 2017 Results Conference Call


      Flowserve will host its conference call with the financial community on 
      Friday, July 28th at 11:00 AM Eastern. Scott Rowe, president and chief 
      executive officer, as well as other members of the management team will 
      be presenting. The call can be accessed by shareholders and other 
      interested parties at www.flowserve.com 
      under the “Investor Relations” section.
    




[1] See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures table for 
            detailed reconciliation of reported results to adjusted measures.
          





[2] Adjusted gross and operating margins are calculated 
            by dividing adjusted gross profit and operating income, 
            respectively, by revenues. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted 
            operating income are derived by excluding the adjusted items. See 
            reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures table for detailed 
            reconciliation.
          





[3] Adjusted 2017 EPS will exclude the Company’s 
            realignment expenses, the impact from other specific one-time 
            events and below-the-line foreign currency effects and utilizes 
            June 30, 2017 FX rates and approximately 131 million fully diluted 
            shares.
          





[4] FX headwind is calculated by comparing the 
            difference between the actual average FX rates of 2016 and the 
            year-end 2016 spot rates both as applied to our 2017 expectations, 
            divided by the number of shares expected for 2017.

Safe Harbor Statement: This news release includes forward-looking 
      statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 
      1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are 
      made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Words or phrases such as, 
      "may," "should," "expects," "could," "intends," "plans," "anticipates," 
      "estimates," "believes," "forecasts," "predicts" or other similar 
      expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which 
      include, without limitation, earnings forecasts, statements relating to 
      our business strategy and statements of expectations, beliefs, future 
      plans and strategies and anticipated developments concerning our 
      industry, business, operations and financial performance and condition.
    

      The forward-looking statements included in this news release are based 
      on our current expectations, projections, estimates and assumptions. 
      These statements are only predictions, not guarantees. Such 
      forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and 
      uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These risks and 
      uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from what is 
      forecast in such forward-looking statements, and include, without 
      limitation, the following: a portion of our bookings may not lead to 
      completed sales, and our ability to convert bookings into revenues at 
      acceptable profit margins; changes in global economic conditions and the 
      potential for unexpected cancellations or delays of customer orders in 
      our reported backlog; our dependence on our customers’ ability to make 
      required capital investment and maintenance expenditures; risks 
      associated with cost overruns on fixed-fee projects and in taking 
      customer orders for large complex custom engineered products; the 
      substantial dependence of our sales on the success of the oil and gas, 
      chemical, power generation and water management industries; the adverse 
      impact of volatile raw materials prices on our products and operating 
      margins; our ability to execute and realize the expected financial 
      benefits from our strategic manufacturing optimization and realignment 
      initiatives; economic, political and other risks associated with our 
      international operations, including military actions or trade embargoes 
      that could affect customer markets, particularly Middle Eastern markets 
      and global oil and gas producers, and non-compliance with U.S. 
      export/re-export control, foreign corrupt practice laws, economic 
      sanctions and import laws and regulations; increased aging and slower 
      collection of receivables, particularly in Latin America and other 
      emerging markets; our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency 
      exchange rates, including in hyperinflationary countries such as 
      Venezuela; our furnishing of products and services to nuclear power 
      plant facilities and other critical processes; potential adverse 
      consequences resulting from litigation to which we are a party, such as 
      litigation involving asbestos-containing material claims; a foreign 
      government investigation regarding our participation in the United 
      Nations Oil-for-Food Program; expectations regarding acquisitions and 
      the integration of acquired businesses; our ability to anticipate and 
      manage cybersecurity risk, including the risk of potential business 
      disruptions or financial losses; our relative geographical profitability 
      and its impact on our utilization of deferred tax assets, including 
      foreign tax credits; the potential adverse impact of an impairment in 
      the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets; our 
      dependence upon third-party suppliers whose failure to perform timely 
      could adversely affect our business operations; the highly competitive 
      nature of the markets in which we operate; environmental compliance 
      costs and liabilities; potential work stoppages and other labor matters; 
      our inability to protect our intellectual property in the U.S., as well 
      as in foreign countries; obligations under our defined benefit pension 
      plans; the review of the company’s internal financial records and 
      controls that is being conducted, including any additional time that may 
      be required to complete the review; the timing and nature of the final 
      resolution of the accounting issues discussed in this news release; any 
      delay in the filing of required periodic reports with the SEC; the 
      ability of the company to remediate any material weakness in its 
      internal control over financial reporting and ineffectiveness in 
      disclosure controls and procedures; increased regulatory, media, or 
      financial reporting issues and practices, or otherwise; and other 
      factors described from time to time in our filings with the Securities 
      and Exchange Commission.
    

      All forward-looking statements included in this news release are based 
      on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no 
      obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
    

      The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. 
      generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management 
      believes that non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain 
      non-recurring items present additional useful comparisons between 
      current results and results in prior operating periods, providing 
      investors with a clearer view of the underlying trends of the business. 
      Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making 
      financial, operating, planning and compensation decisions and in 
      evaluating the Company's performance. Throughout our materials we refer 
      to non-GAAP measures as “Adjusted.” Non-GAAP financial measures, which 
      may be inconsistent with similarly captioned measures presented by other 
      companies, should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, 
      the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Full Year 2016 and Other Highlights



        Reported EPS of $1.11 includes $1.08 per share of adjusted items, as 
        detailed below, and approximately $0.09 per share of negative currency 
        translation

        

            Adjusted EPS[1] was $2.19 excluding the adjusted items 
            but including the negative currency translation
          

            Adjusted items include $0.58 per share of realignment expenses,

            exposures, $0.05 of integration and purchase price accounting 
            expenses and $0.02 of below-the-line foreign exchange benefit
          



        Full year sales were $3.99 billion, down 10.0% on a constant currency 
        basis

        

            Aftermarket sales were $1.80 billion, down 5.9% on a constant 
            currency basis

        book-to-bill ratio of 94%

        

            Full year aftermarket bookings were $1.82 billion, or 49% of total 
            bookings, flat with prior year on a constant currency basis
          



        Achieved approximately $93 million of full year incremental cost 
        savings from the realignment program, including $12 million during the 
        2016 fourth quarter
      

        Backlog at December 31, 2016 was $1.90 billion, down 12.7% versus 
        prior year
      


      “Flowserve delivered fourth quarter and full year 2016 results in-line 
      with our expectations, supported by continued progress on our 
      realignment program,” said Mark Blinn, Flowserve’s President and Chief 
      Executive Officer. “Our focus on disciplined cost management and 
      efficiency enhancing initiatives helped mitigate what continues to be a 
      challenging industry environment. We were pleased to have experienced 
      another quarter of generally stable crude prices and are encouraged by 
      the general increased sense of optimism about the macroeconomic 
      environment. These factors, however, have yet to translate into 
      increased bookings levels, as customers remained cautious in new project 
      awards and maintenance activities during the fourth quarter, and in 
      their acceptance of completed project work. Importantly, for both the 
      fourth quarter and for the full year, our aftermarket bookings 
      stabilized relative to prior year levels, which is a positive 
      development for Flowserve. We continue to achieve meaningful cost 
      savings from our transformational realignment program and look forward 
      to completing the vast majority of the $400 million program in 2017.
    

      “While we are cautiously optimistic that certain energy and industrial 
      customers’ budgets may improve off current low levels, we are not 
      anticipating a recovery in our 2017 planning due to continued 
      geopolitical, end market and macro uncertainties. Accordingly, our near 
      term focus remains on controlling what we can by improving our speed to 
      market, enhancing our project execution, and completing our strategic 
      realignment program. We believe that these initiatives will position the 
      company successfully through cycles regardless of market conditions. We 
      will remain disciplined in our approach to the work we pursue, and are 
      confident that our actions will drive a leaner and more efficient 
      operating platform. Flowserve remains well positioned to drive value for 
      our shareholders over the long term.”
    

2017 Initial Guidance [3]


      Flowserve is providing Reported and Adjusted EPS guidance for 2017, as 
      well as certain other financial metrics, as shown in the table below.

          Reported Earnings Per Share
        







          $0.72 - $1.02
        









          Adjusted Earnings Per Share

          Tax rate (approximate)
        







          30% – 31%
        



      Flowserve’s 2017 Adjusted EPS target range excludes expected realignment 
      charges of approximately $155 million, as well as the potential impact 
      of below-the-line foreign currency effects and certain other discrete 
      items. Both the Reported and the Adjusted EPS target range includes the 
      expected revenue decline of approximately 6 to 11 percent 
      year-over-year, and is based on year-end 2016 foreign currency rates, 
      current commodity prices, expected bookings levels and market 
      conditions, the reset of annual incentive performance goals and an 
      expected merit compensation increase, an above-the-line foreign currency 
      headwind [4] of approximately 10 cents per share, net 
      interest expense in the range of $60 to $63 million and a tax rate of 30 
      to 31 percent under current U.S. tax and regulatory policies.
    

      “Flowserve’s 2017 guidance reflects our beginning backlog entering the 
      year, an expected increase in manufacturing facility under-absorption, 
      customer’s continued emphasis on price, and annual compensation 
      headwinds,” said Karyn Ovelmen, Flowserve’s Executive Vice President and 
      Chief Financial Officer. “Partially offsetting these items, we expect 
      incremental cost savings from our realignment initiatives and relatively 
      stable to increasing year-over-year aftermarket and book-and-ship work. 
      We expect the quarterly phasing of our 2017 Reported and Adjusted EPS 
      target ranges to reflect seasonality, although the traditional second 
      half weighting is anticipated to be more pronounced this year, as the 
      first quarter is expected to represent a substantially lower percentage 
      of full year earnings than in past years due to expected lower revenues 
      and elevated SG&A as compared to remaining 2017 quarters. Despite the 
      current market challenges, we will continue to invest in our business, 
      including executing on our realignment initiatives, to better position 
      the company to drive long-term shareholder value.”
    

Realignment Programs


      In full year 2016 Flowserve expensed approximately $104 million, 
      including approximately $34 million in the fourth quarter and recognized 
      approximately $12 million of incremental savings, bringing the full year 
      incremental savings to $93 million. We expect to largely complete the 
      $400 million program in 2017, including approximately $155 million of 
      expense and approximately $70 million of additional savings, with total 
      program savings of $230 million expected to be achieved in 2018.
    

Segment Performance


      Flowserve reports its operations through three segments: Engineered 
      Product Division (EPD), Industrial Product Division (IPD) and Flow 
      Control Division (FCD). Key financial highlights of segment performance 
      for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 include:

Quarterly Dividend Announced


      Flowserve announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized the 
      payment of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share on the company's 
      outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend is payable on April 7, 
      2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 24, 
      2017.
    

      While Flowserve currently intends to pay regular quarterly cash 
      dividends for the foreseeable future, any future dividends, whether at 
      this $0.19 per share quarterly rate or otherwise, will be reviewed 
      individually and declared by the Board at its discretion, dependent upon 
      the Board's assessment of the company's financial condition and business 
      outlook at the applicable time.
    

Fourth Quarter 2016 Results Conference Call


      Flowserve will host its conference call with the financial community on 
      Friday, February 17th at 11:00 AM Eastern. Mark Blinn, president and 
      chief executive officer, as well as other members of the management team 
      will be presenting. The call can be accessed by shareholders and other 
      interested parties at www.flowserve.com 
      under the “Investor Relations” section.
    




[1] See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures table for 
            detailed reconciliation of reported results to adjusted measures.
          





[2] Adjusted gross and operating margins are calculated 
            by dividing adjusted gross profit and operating income, 
            respectively, by revenues. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted 
            operating income are derived by excluding the adjusted items. See 
            reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures table for detailed 
            reconciliation.
          





[3] Adjusted 2017 EPS will exclude the Company’s 
            realignment expenses, the impact from other specific one-time 
            events and below-the-line foreign currency effects and utilizes 
            year-end 2016 FX rates and approximately 131 million fully diluted 
            shares.
          





[4] FX headwind is calculated by comparing the 
            difference between the actual average FX rates of 2016 and the 
            year-end 2016 spot rates both as applied to our 2017 expectations, 
            divided by the number of shares expected for 2017.

      1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are 
      made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Words or phrases such as, 
      "may," "should," "expects," "could," "intends," "plans," "anticipates," 
      "estimates," "believes," "forecasts," "predicts" or other similar 
      expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which 
      include, without limitation, earnings forecasts, statements relating to 
      our business strategy and statements of expectations, beliefs, future 
      plans and strategies and anticipated developments concerning our 
      industry, business, operations and financial performance and condition.
    

      The forward-looking statements included in this news release are based 
      on our current expectations, projections, estimates and assumptions. 
      These statements are only predictions, not guarantees. Such 
      forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and 
      uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These risks and 
      uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from what is 
      forecast in such forward-looking statements, and include, without 
      limitation, the following: a portion of our bookings may not lead to 
      completed sales, and our ability to convert bookings into revenues at 
      acceptable profit margins; changes in global economic conditions and the 
      potential for unexpected cancellations or delays of customer orders in 
      our reported backlog; our dependence on our customers’ ability to make 
      required capital investment and maintenance expenditures; risks 
      associated with cost overruns on fixed-fee projects and in taking 
      customer orders for large complex custom engineered products; the 
      substantial dependence of our sales on the success of the oil and gas, 
      chemical, power generation and water management industries; the adverse 
      impact of volatile raw materials prices on our products and operating 
      margins; our ability to execute and realize the expected financial 
      benefits from our strategic manufacturing optimization and realignment 
      initiatives; economic, political and other risks associated with our 
      international operations, including military actions or trade embargoes 
      that could affect customer markets, particularly Middle Eastern markets 
      and global oil and gas producers, and non-compliance with U.S. 
      export/re-export control, foreign corrupt practice laws, economic 
      sanctions and import laws and regulations; increased aging and slower 
      collection of receivables, particularly in Latin America and other 
      emerging markets; our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency 
      exchange rates, including in hyperinflationary countries such as 
      Venezuela; our furnishing of products and services to nuclear power 
      plant facilities and other critical processes; potential adverse 
      consequences resulting from litigation to which we are a party, such as 
      litigation involving asbestos-containing material claims; a foreign 
      government investigation regarding our participation in the United 
      Nations Oil-for-Food Program; expectations regarding acquisitions and 
      the integration of acquired businesses; our ability to anticipate and 
      manage cybersecurity risk, including the risk of potential business 
      disruptions or financial losses; our relative geographical profitability 
      and its impact on our utilization of deferred tax assets, including 
      foreign tax credits; the potential adverse impact of an impairment in 
      the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets; our 
      dependence upon third-party suppliers whose failure to perform timely 
      could adversely affect our business operations; the highly competitive 
      nature of the markets in which we operate; environmental compliance 
      costs and liabilities; potential work stoppages and other labor matters; 
      our inability to protect our intellectual property in the U.S., as well 
      as in foreign countries; obligations under our defined benefit pension 
      plans; and other factors described from time to time in our filings with 
      the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    

      All forward-looking statements included in this news release are based 
      on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no 
      obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
    

      The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. 
      generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management 
      believes that non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain 
      non-recurring items present additional useful comparisons between 
      current results and results in prior operating periods, providing 
      investors with a clearer view of the underlying trends of the business. 
      Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making 
      financial, operating, planning and compensation decisions and in 
      evaluating the Company's performance. Throughout our materials we refer 
      to non-GAAP measures as “Adjusted.” Non-GAAP financial measures, which 
      may be inconsistent with similarly captioned measures presented by other 
      companies, should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, 
      the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

          year amount due to the impact of changes in weighted average 
          quarterly shares outstanding.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
