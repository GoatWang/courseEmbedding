Kenneth L. Shropshire and T. Davis, The Business of Sports Agents 3rd ed (2016)Abstract: Successful sports agents are comfortable with high finance and intense competition for the right to represent talented players, and the most respected agents are those who can deal with the pressures of high-stakes negotiations in an honest fashion. But whereas rules and penalties govern the playing field, there are far fewer restrictions on agents. In The Business of Sports Agents, Kenneth L. Shropshire, Timothy Davis, and N. Jeremi Duru, experts in the fields of sports business and law, examine the history of the sports agent business and the rules and laws developed to regulate the profession. They also consider recommendations for reform, including uniform laws that would apply to all agents, redefining amateurism in college sports, and stiffening requirements for licensing agents.
This revised and expanded third edition brings the volume up to date on recent changes in the industry, including:
—the emergence and dominance of companies such as Creative Artists Agency and Wasserman Media Group
—high-profile cases of agent misconduct, principally Josh Luchs, whose agent certification was revoked by the NFLPA
—legal challenges against the NCAA that may fundamentally change the definition of amateurism
—changes to agent regulations resulting from new collective bargaining agreements in all of the major professional sports
—evaluation of the effectiveness of the Uniform Athlete Agents Act (2000) to regulate agent conduct
—issues faced by the increasing number of agents representing athletes who work abroad as well as athletes from abroad who work in the United States.
Whether aspiring sports agent, lawyer, athlete seeking an agent, or simply interested in understanding the world of sports representation, the reader will find in The Business of Sports Agents the most comprehensive overview of the industry as well as a straightforward analysis of its problems and proposed solutions.Kenneth L.
