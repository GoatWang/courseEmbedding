Investment Management
At One Capital Management we have one clear mission: To assist our clients in achieving their investment objectives at the least risk possible. Inherent in that is a fiduciary responsibility to protect the assets they have accumulated and to provide a level of comfort with their investments in the capital markets. Providing peace of mind is essential in helping clients make the right decisions, especially when their emotions might persuade them to do otherwise. 
Beginning with a belief that portfolio structure is the single most important element to creating a successful investment portfolio and experience on an after-tax basis, we build customized globally balanced portfolios. Our philosophy is that in order to achieve our clients' objectives, capital must be deployed around the globe to reach assets with high real return.
We blend active management of global large cap equities with exchange traded funds (ETFs) and fixed income to construct our multi-asset class portfolios. We utilize ETFs as a means to access capital markets and asset classes that enhance the return of portfolios and reduce risk (expressed in terms of return volatility). It is our use of low correlation asset classes and portfolio structure, rebalanced systematically that generates enhanced returns while reducing risk.



Cash & Cash Equivalents
Municipal Bonds
U.S. Government Bonds
Sovereign Bonds (Developed Markets)
Global Investment Grade Bonds
 High Yield Bonds
Preferred Stocks
Emerging Markets Bonds
US Large Cap Equity
U.S. Mid Cap Equity
U.S. Small Cap Equity
U.S. Micro Cap Equity 





Canada Large Cap Equity
Canada Small Cap Equity
International Large Cap Equity
International Mid Cap Equity
International Small Cap Equity
Emerging Markets Equity
U.S. REITs
International REITs (Developed Markets)




It's important to note as well, that we hold both growth and value style equity in our portfolios at a 50/50 mix between the two to further diversify the portfolio. 


In our efforts, we tailor each account to the particular client's financial goals, risk-tolerance levels, tax status, and special situations. Our global investment strategies position us to meet client preferences that vary along the risk return spectrum. Combining asset classes in a single optimized portfolio offers distinctly superior performance potential.


The equity allocation is structured to maximize returns while controlling risk. We do this by diversifying the portfolio with assets that have low correlations to one another. As such, we can reduce volatility and enhance returns. The majority of equity assets are allocated in large company stocks and this is enhanced with exchange traded funds to access stocks of smaller companies (including micro-cap companies) and an allocation to emerging markets stocks. 


For the fixed income portion of the account: Foremost is safety of principal, while generating a reliable stream of income. History has shown that in times of equity market volatility, bonds prove to the best stabilizer of return, in fact producing real (net of inflation) return during those times. 


The low correlation from each asset class drives down volatility, and through rebalancing, actually increases return potential. Tax management along the way assures that our clients keep most of what they earned.

Important Disclosures and Requirements
+ Show All

 1 APR is the Annual Percentage Rate. Advertised rates depend on the individual's credit and key financing characteristics, including but not limited to the Amount Financed, term, a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of less than or equal to 80%, and other vehicle characteristics. A representative example of payment terms are as follows: an Amount Financed of $25,000 with an APR of 7.50% and a term of 60 months would have a monthly payment of $500.95. APRs shown are current as of April 20, 2017. Advertised rates are subject to change without notice.
Advertised 3.24% APR is offered depending on the individual’s excellent and substantial credit, and key financing characteristics, including but not limited to the amount financed, a term less than or equal to 60 months, a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of less than or equal to 80% and a new vehicle. Your actual APR will be based on your specific situation.
2 Yearly Payment reduction claim is based on average payment reduction our customers experience over a year with their new loan (same or a longer term) compared to their prior yearly loan payments. Yearly payment reduction may result from a lower interest rate, a longer term or both. Your actual savings may be different.

Zavation is a designer and manufacturer of high quality spinal implants, instruments, and biologics. Zavation expands LVC’s healthcare portfolio and is the second medical device business LVC has partnered within the past 18 months.
Based in Jackson, MS, Zavation designs, engineers, and manufactures a portfolio of spinal hardware covering key areas including thoracolumbar, cervical, interbody fusion, and minimally invasive surgery. Founded in 2010 with its first sale in 2012, Zavation has experienced exceptional growth and created a national network of 100+ distributors across approximately 35 states. The Company has commercialized over 10 product families since inception, with 10 additional novel products expected to launch over the next two years. Zavation operates a 24,000 square foot vertically integrated facility with approximately 50 employees.
“Zavation has demonstrated exceptional growth and is a perfect cornerstone to our expanding healthcare portfolio. This is our fourth healthcare platform investment and our third in the past 18 months,” said Ryan Nagim, Principal and deal lead at LVC. “Furthermore, we believe the Company is at an inflection point and has the opportunity to become a market leader in the spinal implant sector, as management has shown an incredible ability to execute. As such, we look forward to our partnership with Zavation’s management team and driving significant growth, both organically and through acquisitions of unique technologies.”
“Zavation fits well within LVC’s investment strategy,” added Rick Rees, Founder and Managing Partner of LVC. “We love partnering with entrepreneur owned businesses at inflection points that have proven management teams willing to invest meaningfully alongside LVC. The Company’s rapid growth is a testament to management’s ability to capitalize on compelling demographics and other industry tailwinds favoring smaller, more agile, and customer focused OEMs. Lastly, although we are geographically agnostic, it is always great to partner with entrepreneurs in our back yard, the Gulf South. As such, we are incredibly excited to partner with management and welcome Zavation into the LVC family.”
“The management team at Zavation chose LVC due to their entrepreneur-friendly investment approach to value creation and their knowledge and expertise in growing middle market companies at inflection points like ours. With a shared vision and culture, we are confident Zavation will remain focused on its core values of excellent customer service and quality products,” said Jeffrey Johnson, President and CEO of Zavation. “LVC’s financial and operational resources will allow us to introduce new products, meet and exceed distributor and surgeon expectations, expand our market presence, and take market share at an even faster and more deliberate speed. We are excited for our Company, our distributors, our surgeons, and our LVC partners.”
Robert W. Baird & Co.’s healthcare team, led by Robert Andrews and Manish Gupta, served as exclusive financial advisor to LVC on the transaction. Abacus Finance Group, LLC provided the senior debt financing to Zavation Medical Products in support of the transaction. LVC’s legal counsel was provided by McGuireWoods, LLP.
