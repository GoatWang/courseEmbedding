Smithfield Foods, Inc., is a meat-processing company headquartered in Smithfield, Virginia, in the United States. The company runs facilities in 26 U.S. states—including the largest slaughterhouse and meat-processing plant in the world, located in Tar Heel, North Carolina[2]—as well as in Mexico and 10 European countries. Founded in the U.S., Smithfield was purchased in 2013, for more than its market value, by the Chinese holding company Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd.[3][4] Now known as WH Group, Shuanghui Group is the world's largest pork producer and processor. It was the largest Chinese acquisition of an American company at the time,[3] and Smithfield's 146,000 acres of farmland made Shuanghui one of the largest overseas owners of U.S. agricultural land.[5] As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees around the world and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1]
The company was founded in 1936 by Joseph W. Luter and his son as the Smithfield Packing Company, now its largest subsidiary. From 1981, it began to purchase companies such as Eckrich, Farmland Foods of Kansas; Gwaltney of Smithfield; John Morrell; Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina; and Premium Standard Farms.[6]:6 The company was able to grow as a result of its highly industrialized pig production, raising the animals using a vertical integration system of production that enables it to control the animals' development from conception to packing. Thousands of livestock are permanently confined in barns with metal roofs, known as concentrated animal feeding operations.[7]
As of 2006 Smithfield raised 15 million pigs a year and processed 27 million, producing over six billion pounds of pork.[8] It was the top pig slaughter operation in the United States in 2007, at 114,300 pigs a day, and along with three other companies slaughtered 56 percent of the cattle processed there until it sold its beef group in 2008.[9][a] Smithfield sells its products under several brand names, including Cook's Ham, Gwaltney, John Morrell, Krakus Ham, Patrick Cudahy, Smithfield, and Stefano's.[10] Kenneth M. Sullivan has been the president and chief executive officer since 2015.[11]

Company profile[edit]
The company traces its history to 1936, when Joseph W. Luter, Sr. and his son, Joseph W. Luter, Jr., opened the Smithfield Packing Company in Smithfield, Virginia. The latter served as chief executive officer (CEO) until his death in 1962. A grandson, Joseph W. Luter III, joined the company the same year, and in 1966 became chairman and CEO until Smithfield was taken over by Liberty Equities in 1969. The company hired Luter again as CEO in 1975 when it found itself in financial difficulties; his restructuring of the company is credited with its improved performance.[2] His son, Joseph W. Luter IV, became an executive vice president of Smithfield Foods and president of the Smithfield Packing Company, the parent company's largest subsidiary.[10]
Smithfield began to expand in 1981 with its purchase of its main competitor, Gwaltney of Smithfield. This was followed by the acquisition of almost 40 companies in the pork, beef, and livestock industries between 1981 and around 2008.[12] The company Patrick Cudahy was purchased in 1984 and Schluderberg-Kurdle in 1986.[10] In 1992 Smithfield opened the world's largest processing plant, a 973,000-square-foot facility in Tar Heel, North Carolina, which by 2000 could process 32,000 pigs a day.[7]
Smithfield purchased John Morrell & Co in Sioux Falls, SD, in 1995 and Circle Four Farms in 1998. In 1999 it bought two of the largest pig producers in the United States: Carroll's Foods and Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina, at that point the largest producer. According to agricultural researchers Jill Hobbs and Linda Young, Smithfield's purchase of these companies constituted a major structural change in the U.S. pig industry.[13] Farmland Foods of Kansas City was added in 2003, as were Sara Lee's European Meats, ConAgra Foods Refrigerated Meats, Butterball (the poultry producer), and Premium Standard Farms in 2007.[10][14] The company sold its 49 percent share in Butterball in 2008 for an estimated $175 million.[15] The acquisitions caused concern among regulators in the United States regarding the company's control of the food supply. After Smithfield's purchase of Murphy Family Farms, the Agriculture Department described it as "absurdly big".[7] As of 2006 four companies—Smithfield, Tyson, Swift & Company, and Cargill—were responsible for the production of 70 percent of pork in the United States.[12]
On May 29, 2013, Shuanghui Group, also known as the Shineway Group, the largest meat producer in China, announced a purchase of Smithfield Foods, Inc., for $4.72 billion.[16] Shuanghui announced that it would list Smithfield on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after completing the takeover.[17] On September 6, 2013, the U.S. government approved Shuanghui International Holding’s purchase of Smithfield Food, Inc. The deal was valued at approximately $7.1 billion. It was the largest stock acquisition by a Chinese company of an American company.[18]
As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees in the United States, Mexico and Europe, and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1] It raises 15.8 million pigs a year, producing 3.8 billion pounds of fresh pork and 2.7 billion pounds of packaged meat, sold as 50 brands of pork products and 200 other foods.[19] Along with specialty brands such as the Paula Deen Collection and Weight Watchers, the company's 12 core brands are Armour, Carando, Cook's Ham, Curly's Foods, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, Healthy Ones, John Morrell, Kretschmar, Margherita, and Smithfield.[20] The company also operates The Genuine Smithfield Ham Shoppe and a restaurant, Taste of Smithfield, both in Smithfield, Virginia.[21]
Pig production[edit]
Vertical integration[edit]
Further information: Vertical Integration
In 1990 the company bought hog-farming operations, making it a vertically integrated company. The system allows Smithfield to control every stage of pig production, from conception and birth to slaughter, processing and packing—known as "from squeal to meal" or "from birth to bacon". Joseph W. Luter III said that this produces "high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics." Luter has said that "vertical integration gives you high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics. And the only way to do that is to control the process from the farm to the packing plant."[7] According to Tyya N. Turner, the company obtained 2,000 pigs and the right to their genetic lines from Britain's National Pig Development Company in 1990, and used them to create Smithfield Lean Generation Pork, which was certified by the American Heart Association for its low fat, salt, and cholesterol content. According to Luter, it was vertical integration that enabled this.[2]
Housing and lagoons[edit]
The pigs are housed together in their thousands in identical barns with metal roofs, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[22] The floors of the buildings are slatted, allowing waste to be flushed into 30-feet-deep open-air pits the size of two football fields, referred to within the industry as lagoons. Smithfield says the lagoons contain an impervious liner made to withstand leakage.[23][23] According to Jeff Tietz, writing for Rolling Stone, the waste—a mixture of excrement, urine, blood, afterbirths, stillborn pigs, drugs and other chemicals—overflows when it rains, and the liners can be punctured by rocks.[8] Smithfield attributes the pink color of the waste to the health of the lagoons, writing that the color is "a sign of bacteria doing what it should be doing. It's indicative of lower odor and lower nutrient content".[24]
Pregnant sows[edit]




Sows used for breeding are confined in 7 ft x 2 ft gestation crates.[25] This image was taken inside a Smithfield facility in Virginia in 2010.


Smithfield said in December 2011 that it would phase out gestation crates on its company-owned farms by 2017 in the United States,[26][27] and by 2022 in Europe and Mexico.[28] Pregnant sows spend most of their lives in these stalls, which are too small to allow them to turn around.[29] When they give birth, they are moved to a farrowing crate for three weeks, then artificially inseminated and placed back into a gestation crate.[30] The practice has led to criticism from animal welfare groups, supermarket chains and McDonald's.[29]
Smithfield said in 2007 that it would phase out gestation crates by 2017,[31] but in 2009 said it would not meet the timeline because of operating losses caused by the recession.[32][33] In January 2015 it said that 71.3 percent of pregnant sows on its company-owned farms had been moved into group housing and out of the crates.[34] It would not commit to requiring its contract farms, where almost half its sows live, to phase out the crates.[35][34]
Environmental and animal welfare record[edit]
Emissions[edit]
Smithfield has come under criticism for the millions of gallons of untreated fecal matter it produces and stores in the lagoons. In a four-year period in North Carolina in the 1990s, 4.7 million gallons of hog fecal matter were released into the state's rivers. Workers and residents near Smithfield plants reported health problems and complained about the stench of hog feces.[8]
The company was fined $12.6 million in 1997 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for 6,900 violations of the Clean Water Act after discharging illegal levels of slaughterhouse waste into the Pagan River in Virginia.[36] Its facilities in North Carolina came under scrutiny in 1999 when Hurricane Floyd flooded lagoons holding fecal matter; many of Smithfield's contract farms were accused of polluting the rivers. Smithfield reached a settlement in 2000 with the state of North Carolina, agreeing to pay the state $50 million over 25 years. The company agreed to donate $1.3 million to clean up; North Carolina State University would receive $15 million to research the treatment of pig waste; and the North Carolina Foundation for Soil and Water Conservation, Ducks Unlimited and the North Carolina Coastal Federation would receive grants.[37][6]:7
According to Ralph Deptolla of Smithfield Foods, the company created new executive positions to monitor the environmental issues, and hired Dennis Treacy, a former director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, as Executive Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer. Treacy had previously been involved in the enforcement efforts against Smithfield. Deptolla writes that Smithfield also created an environmental management system (ESM), launching it in 2001 at its Murphy-Brown facilities.[6]:9
In 2005 the company received ISO 14001 certification from the International Organization for Standardization for its hog production and processing facilities in the U.S., with the exception of new acquisitions, and, in 2009, 14 plants in the U.S. and 21 in Romania received certification.[38] Deptolla writes that 578 Smithfield facilities were ISO 14001-certified as of 2011.[6]:9 In 2006 its hog-production subsidiary Murphy-Brown reached an agreement with the Waterkeeper Alliance, once one of Smithfield's biggest critics, to adopt new measures to enhance environmental protection at the former's facilities in North Carolina.[39][40] In 2009 the company said it had reduced greenhouse gas emissions at its plants by four percent since 2007, its processing emissions per 100 pounds of production by 62 percent, and its first-processing emissions per animal by 41 percent. Smithfield attributed the improvements to the divestiture of the beef group.[41] In 2010 it released its ninth annual Corporate Social Responsibility report, and announced its appointment of a chief sustainability officer and two sustainability committees.[42]
Use of antibiotics[edit]
Concerns were raised about the use by the company and its contractors of low doses of antibiotics to promote the pigs' growth, in addition to using antibiotics as part of a treatment regime. The concern was that the antibiotics were harmful to the animals and were contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.[6]:8 Smithfield said in 2005 that it would administer antibiotics only to animals who were sick themselves, or who were in close proximity to sick animals; however, in Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations all pigs are in close proximity to each other.[43]
Operations in Mexico[edit]
The earliest confirmed case of the H1N1 virus (swine flu) during the 2009 flu pandemic was in a five-year-old boy in La Gloria, Mexico, near several facilities operated by Granjas Carroll de Mexico, a Smithfield Foods subsidiary that processes 1.2 million pigs a year and employs 907 people.[23][44][45][46] This, together with tension between the company and local community over Smithfield's environmental record, prompted several newspapers to link the outbreak to Smithfield's farming practices. According to The Washington Post, over 600 other residents of La Gloria became ill from a respiratory disease in March that year (later thought to be seasonal flu). The Post writes that health officials found no link between the farms and the H1N1 outbreak.[23] Smithfield said that it had found no clinical signs of swine flu in its pigs or employees in Mexico, and had no reason to believe that the outbreak was connected to its Mexican facilities. The company said it routinely administers flu virus vaccine to its swine herds in Mexico and conducts monthly tests to detect the virus.[47]
Residents alleged that the company regularly violates local environmental regulations.[48][49] According to the Washington Post, local farmers had complained for years about headaches from the smell of the pig farms and said that wild dogs had been eating discarded pig carcasses. Smithfield was using biodigesters to convert dead pigs into renewable energy, but residents alleged that they regularly overflowed. Residents also feared that the waste stored in the lagoons would leak into the groundwater.[23]
Packaging reduction[edit]
In 2009 Armour-Eckrich introduced smaller crescent-style packaging for its smoked sausages, which reduced the plastic film and corrugated cardboard the company used by over 840,000 pounds per year. In 2010 the John Morrell plant in Sioux Falls, SD, reduced its use of plastic by 40,600 pounds a year, and Farmland Foods reduced the corrugated packaging entering waste streams by over five million pounds a year. Smithfield Packing used 17 percent less plastic for deli meat. The company also eliminated 20,000 pounds of corrugated material a year by using smaller boxes to transport chicken frankfurters to its largest customer.[41]
2010 Humane Society investigation[edit]
In December 2010 the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) released an undercover video taken by one of its investigators inside a Smithfield Foods facility.[29] The investigator had worked for a month at Murphy-Brown, a Smithfield subsidiary in Waverly, Virginia.[50] The Associated Press (AP) reported that the investigator videotaped 1,000 sows living in gestation crates. According to the AP, the material shows a pig being pulled by the snout, shot in the head with a stun gun, and thrown into a bin while trying to wriggle free. The investigator said he saw sows biting their crates and bleeding; staff jabbing them to make them move; staff tossing piglets into carts; and piglets born prematurely in gestation crates falling through the slats into the manure pits.[51][52] The video won a 2012 Webby Award in the "Public Service and Activism" category.[53]
In response, Smithfield told the AP that it has "zero tolerance for any behavior that does not conform to our established animal well-being procedures".[51] The company asked Temple Grandin, a professor of animal husbandry, to review the footage; she recommended an inspection by animal welfare expert Jennifer Woods.[54][55][56][57][58] Smithfield announced on December 21 that it had fired two workers and their supervisor.[54][59] At the company's invitation, the Virginia state veterinarian Richard Wilkes visited the facility on December 22. He told The Virginian-Pilot that Smithfield had been "very responsive and very responsible in how they've addressed the issues", and that he had not seen "any indication of abuse" of the pigs and was impressed by their demeanor. A Humane Society spokesman said that Smithfield had provided the vet "with a pre-announced, white glove tour".[60]
Legal and labor issues[edit]
Working conditions[edit]
Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a 175-page report in 2005 documenting what it said were unsafe work conditions in the U.S. meat and poultry industry. In particular, the report said, workers make thousands of repetitive motions with knives during each shift, leading to lacerations and repetitive strain injuries. According to HRW, the workers' immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions. The report cited working conditions in Smithfield Foods as an example.[61][62][6]:8 According to the report, the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers. A Smithfield manager testified in 1998, during an unfair labor practices trial, that at the Tar Heel plant in North Carolina it takes between five and ten minutes to slaughter and complete the process of "disassembly" of an animal, including draining, cleaning, and cleaving. One worker told HRW that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives, which means harder cuts have to be made, with the resultant injuries to workers.[62]:4[63] Similar criticism was made by other groups about Smithfield facilities in Poland and Romania.[6]:8

The Smithfield Packing plant in Tar Heel, North Carolina, was the site of a long dispute between the company and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW), which had tried since the early 1990s to organize the plant's roughly 5,000 hourly workers.[64] Workers voted against the union in 1994 and 1997, but the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleged that unfair election conduct had occurred and ordered a new election. During the 1997 election the company is alleged to have fired workers who supported the union, stationed police at the plant gates, and threatened plant closures. In 2000, according to Human Rights Watch, Smithfield set up its own security force with "special police agency" status under North Carolina law, and in 2003 arrested workers who supported the union.[61]
Smithfield appealed the NLRB's ruling that the 1997 election was invalid, and, in 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of the NLRB.[65] After demonstrations, lockouts, and a shareholder meeting that was disrupted by shareholders supporting the union, the UFCW called for a boycott of Smithfield products. In October 2007, Smithfield countered by filing a federal RICO Act lawsuit against UFCW.[64] In October 2008, the UFCW and Smithfield reached an agreement, under which the union agreed to suspend its boycott campaign in return for the company dropping its RICO lawsuit and allowing another election. In December 2008, workers voted 2,041 to 1,879 in favor of joining the UFCW, bringing the 15-year fight to an end.[66]
Justice Department penalty[edit]
In January 2009, Smithfield was assessed a $900,000 penalty by the U.S. Justice Department to settle charges that the company engaged in illegal merger activity during its takeover of Premium Standard Farms LLC in 2006.[67]
Philanthropy[edit]
The Smithfield-Luter Foundation, established in 2002, is a non-profit organization that acts as the philanthropic wing of Smithfield Foods, dedicated primarily to providing scholarship opportunities to the children and grandchildren of Smithfield employees. It has given $5 million to Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, to establish the Luter School of Business,[68] and $5 million to the University of Virginia Cancer Center in Charlottesville, Virginia.[69] The Foundation also provides support for its "learners to leaders" programs, begun in 2006, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Denison, Iowa; and Norfolk, Virginia.[70]
Sports sponsorships[edit]
In 2012, Smithfield announced a 15-race sponsorship with Richard Petty Motorsports and driver Aric Almirola driving the #43 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. The sponsorship was increased to 30 races beginning in 2014. Smithfield rotates its brands on the car, featuring Smithfield, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, and Nathan's Famous. It is also the official food of Richmond International Raceway in Henrico County, Virginia about an hour northwest of Smithfield HQ.

Smithfield Foods, Inc., is a meat-processing company headquartered in Smithfield, Virginia, in the United States. The company runs facilities in 26 U.S. states—including the largest slaughterhouse and meat-processing plant in the world, located in Tar Heel, North Carolina[2]—as well as in Mexico and 10 European countries. Founded in the U.S., Smithfield was purchased in 2013, for more than its market value, by the Chinese holding company Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd.[3][4] Now known as WH Group, Shuanghui Group is the world's largest pork producer and processor. It was the largest Chinese acquisition of an American company at the time,[3] and Smithfield's 146,000 acres of farmland made Shuanghui one of the largest overseas owners of U.S. agricultural land.[5] As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees around the world and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1]
The company was founded in 1936 by Joseph W. Luter and his son as the Smithfield Packing Company, now its largest subsidiary. From 1981, it began to purchase companies such as Eckrich, Farmland Foods of Kansas; Gwaltney of Smithfield; John Morrell; Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina; and Premium Standard Farms.[6]:6 The company was able to grow as a result of its highly industrialized pig production, raising the animals using a vertical integration system of production that enables it to control the animals' development from conception to packing. Thousands of livestock are permanently confined in barns with metal roofs, known as concentrated animal feeding operations.[7]
As of 2006 Smithfield raised 15 million pigs a year and processed 27 million, producing over six billion pounds of pork.[8] It was the top pig slaughter operation in the United States in 2007, at 114,300 pigs a day, and along with three other companies slaughtered 56 percent of the cattle processed there until it sold its beef group in 2008.[9][a] Smithfield sells its products under several brand names, including Cook's Ham, Gwaltney, John Morrell, Krakus Ham, Patrick Cudahy, Smithfield, and Stefano's.[10] Kenneth M. Sullivan has been the president and chief executive officer since 2015.[11]

Company profile[edit]
The company traces its history to 1936, when Joseph W. Luter, Sr. and his son, Joseph W. Luter, Jr., opened the Smithfield Packing Company in Smithfield, Virginia. The latter served as chief executive officer (CEO) until his death in 1962. A grandson, Joseph W. Luter III, joined the company the same year, and in 1966 became chairman and CEO until Smithfield was taken over by Liberty Equities in 1969. The company hired Luter again as CEO in 1975 when it found itself in financial difficulties; his restructuring of the company is credited with its improved performance.[2] His son, Joseph W. Luter IV, became an executive vice president of Smithfield Foods and president of the Smithfield Packing Company, the parent company's largest subsidiary.[10]
Smithfield began to expand in 1981 with its purchase of its main competitor, Gwaltney of Smithfield. This was followed by the acquisition of almost 40 companies in the pork, beef, and livestock industries between 1981 and around 2008.[12] The company Patrick Cudahy was purchased in 1984 and Schluderberg-Kurdle in 1986.[10] In 1992 Smithfield opened the world's largest processing plant, a 973,000-square-foot facility in Tar Heel, North Carolina, which by 2000 could process 32,000 pigs a day.[7]
Smithfield purchased John Morrell & Co in Sioux Falls, SD, in 1995 and Circle Four Farms in 1998. In 1999 it bought two of the largest pig producers in the United States: Carroll's Foods and Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina, at that point the largest producer. According to agricultural researchers Jill Hobbs and Linda Young, Smithfield's purchase of these companies constituted a major structural change in the U.S. pig industry.[13] Farmland Foods of Kansas City was added in 2003, as were Sara Lee's European Meats, ConAgra Foods Refrigerated Meats, Butterball (the poultry producer), and Premium Standard Farms in 2007.[10][14] The company sold its 49 percent share in Butterball in 2008 for an estimated $175 million.[15] The acquisitions caused concern among regulators in the United States regarding the company's control of the food supply. After Smithfield's purchase of Murphy Family Farms, the Agriculture Department described it as "absurdly big".[7] As of 2006 four companies—Smithfield, Tyson, Swift & Company, and Cargill—were responsible for the production of 70 percent of pork in the United States.[12]
On May 29, 2013, Shuanghui Group, also known as the Shineway Group, the largest meat producer in China, announced a purchase of Smithfield Foods, Inc., for $4.72 billion.[16] Shuanghui announced that it would list Smithfield on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after completing the takeover.[17] On September 6, 2013, the U.S. government approved Shuanghui International Holding’s purchase of Smithfield Food, Inc. The deal was valued at approximately $7.1 billion. It was the largest stock acquisition by a Chinese company of an American company.[18]
As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees in the United States, Mexico and Europe, and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1] It raises 15.8 million pigs a year, producing 3.8 billion pounds of fresh pork and 2.7 billion pounds of packaged meat, sold as 50 brands of pork products and 200 other foods.[19] Along with specialty brands such as the Paula Deen Collection and Weight Watchers, the company's 12 core brands are Armour, Carando, Cook's Ham, Curly's Foods, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, Healthy Ones, John Morrell, Kretschmar, Margherita, and Smithfield.[20] The company also operates The Genuine Smithfield Ham Shoppe and a restaurant, Taste of Smithfield, both in Smithfield, Virginia.[21]
Pig production[edit]
Vertical integration[edit]
Further information: Vertical Integration
In 1990 the company bought hog-farming operations, making it a vertically integrated company. The system allows Smithfield to control every stage of pig production, from conception and birth to slaughter, processing and packing—known as "from squeal to meal" or "from birth to bacon". Joseph W. Luter III said that this produces "high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics." Luter has said that "vertical integration gives you high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics. And the only way to do that is to control the process from the farm to the packing plant."[7] According to Tyya N. Turner, the company obtained 2,000 pigs and the right to their genetic lines from Britain's National Pig Development Company in 1990, and used them to create Smithfield Lean Generation Pork, which was certified by the American Heart Association for its low fat, salt, and cholesterol content. According to Luter, it was vertical integration that enabled this.[2]
Housing and lagoons[edit]
The pigs are housed together in their thousands in identical barns with metal roofs, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[22] The floors of the buildings are slatted, allowing waste to be flushed into 30-feet-deep open-air pits the size of two football fields, referred to within the industry as lagoons. Smithfield says the lagoons contain an impervious liner made to withstand leakage.[23][23] According to Jeff Tietz, writing for Rolling Stone, the waste—a mixture of excrement, urine, blood, afterbirths, stillborn pigs, drugs and other chemicals—overflows when it rains, and the liners can be punctured by rocks.[8] Smithfield attributes the pink color of the waste to the health of the lagoons, writing that the color is "a sign of bacteria doing what it should be doing. It's indicative of lower odor and lower nutrient content".[24]
Pregnant sows[edit]




Sows used for breeding are confined in 7 ft x 2 ft gestation crates.[25] This image was taken inside a Smithfield facility in Virginia in 2010.


Smithfield said in December 2011 that it would phase out gestation crates on its company-owned farms by 2017 in the United States,[26][27] and by 2022 in Europe and Mexico.[28] Pregnant sows spend most of their lives in these stalls, which are too small to allow them to turn around.[29] When they give birth, they are moved to a farrowing crate for three weeks, then artificially inseminated and placed back into a gestation crate.[30] The practice has led to criticism from animal welfare groups, supermarket chains and McDonald's.[29]
Smithfield said in 2007 that it would phase out gestation crates by 2017,[31] but in 2009 said it would not meet the timeline because of operating losses caused by the recession.[32][33] In January 2015 it said that 71.3 percent of pregnant sows on its company-owned farms had been moved into group housing and out of the crates.[34] It would not commit to requiring its contract farms, where almost half its sows live, to phase out the crates.[35][34]
Environmental and animal welfare record[edit]
Emissions[edit]
Smithfield has come under criticism for the millions of gallons of untreated fecal matter it produces and stores in the lagoons. In a four-year period in North Carolina in the 1990s, 4.7 million gallons of hog fecal matter were released into the state's rivers. Workers and residents near Smithfield plants reported health problems and complained about the stench of hog feces.[8]
The company was fined $12.6 million in 1997 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for 6,900 violations of the Clean Water Act after discharging illegal levels of slaughterhouse waste into the Pagan River in Virginia.[36] Its facilities in North Carolina came under scrutiny in 1999 when Hurricane Floyd flooded lagoons holding fecal matter; many of Smithfield's contract farms were accused of polluting the rivers. Smithfield reached a settlement in 2000 with the state of North Carolina, agreeing to pay the state $50 million over 25 years. The company agreed to donate $1.3 million to clean up; North Carolina State University would receive $15 million to research the treatment of pig waste; and the North Carolina Foundation for Soil and Water Conservation, Ducks Unlimited and the North Carolina Coastal Federation would receive grants.[37][6]:7
According to Ralph Deptolla of Smithfield Foods, the company created new executive positions to monitor the environmental issues, and hired Dennis Treacy, a former director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, as Executive Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer. Treacy had previously been involved in the enforcement efforts against Smithfield. Deptolla writes that Smithfield also created an environmental management system (ESM), launching it in 2001 at its Murphy-Brown facilities.[6]:9
In 2005 the company received ISO 14001 certification from the International Organization for Standardization for its hog production and processing facilities in the U.S., with the exception of new acquisitions, and, in 2009, 14 plants in the U.S. and 21 in Romania received certification.[38] Deptolla writes that 578 Smithfield facilities were ISO 14001-certified as of 2011.[6]:9 In 2006 its hog-production subsidiary Murphy-Brown reached an agreement with the Waterkeeper Alliance, once one of Smithfield's biggest critics, to adopt new measures to enhance environmental protection at the former's facilities in North Carolina.[39][40] In 2009 the company said it had reduced greenhouse gas emissions at its plants by four percent since 2007, its processing emissions per 100 pounds of production by 62 percent, and its first-processing emissions per animal by 41 percent. Smithfield attributed the improvements to the divestiture of the beef group.[41] In 2010 it released its ninth annual Corporate Social Responsibility report, and announced its appointment of a chief sustainability officer and two sustainability committees.[42]
Use of antibiotics[edit]
Concerns were raised about the use by the company and its contractors of low doses of antibiotics to promote the pigs' growth, in addition to using antibiotics as part of a treatment regime. The concern was that the antibiotics were harmful to the animals and were contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.[6]:8 Smithfield said in 2005 that it would administer antibiotics only to animals who were sick themselves, or who were in close proximity to sick animals; however, in Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations all pigs are in close proximity to each other.[43]
Operations in Mexico[edit]
The earliest confirmed case of the H1N1 virus (swine flu) during the 2009 flu pandemic was in a five-year-old boy in La Gloria, Mexico, near several facilities operated by Granjas Carroll de Mexico, a Smithfield Foods subsidiary that processes 1.2 million pigs a year and employs 907 people.[23][44][45][46] This, together with tension between the company and local community over Smithfield's environmental record, prompted several newspapers to link the outbreak to Smithfield's farming practices. According to The Washington Post, over 600 other residents of La Gloria became ill from a respiratory disease in March that year (later thought to be seasonal flu). The Post writes that health officials found no link between the farms and the H1N1 outbreak.[23] Smithfield said that it had found no clinical signs of swine flu in its pigs or employees in Mexico, and had no reason to believe that the outbreak was connected to its Mexican facilities. The company said it routinely administers flu virus vaccine to its swine herds in Mexico and conducts monthly tests to detect the virus.[47]
Residents alleged that the company regularly violates local environmental regulations.[48][49] According to the Washington Post, local farmers had complained for years about headaches from the smell of the pig farms and said that wild dogs had been eating discarded pig carcasses. Smithfield was using biodigesters to convert dead pigs into renewable energy, but residents alleged that they regularly overflowed. Residents also feared that the waste stored in the lagoons would leak into the groundwater.[23]
Packaging reduction[edit]
In 2009 Armour-Eckrich introduced smaller crescent-style packaging for its smoked sausages, which reduced the plastic film and corrugated cardboard the company used by over 840,000 pounds per year. In 2010 the John Morrell plant in Sioux Falls, SD, reduced its use of plastic by 40,600 pounds a year, and Farmland Foods reduced the corrugated packaging entering waste streams by over five million pounds a year. Smithfield Packing used 17 percent less plastic for deli meat. The company also eliminated 20,000 pounds of corrugated material a year by using smaller boxes to transport chicken frankfurters to its largest customer.[41]
2010 Humane Society investigation[edit]
In December 2010 the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) released an undercover video taken by one of its investigators inside a Smithfield Foods facility.[29] The investigator had worked for a month at Murphy-Brown, a Smithfield subsidiary in Waverly, Virginia.[50] The Associated Press (AP) reported that the investigator videotaped 1,000 sows living in gestation crates. According to the AP, the material shows a pig being pulled by the snout, shot in the head with a stun gun, and thrown into a bin while trying to wriggle free. The investigator said he saw sows biting their crates and bleeding; staff jabbing them to make them move; staff tossing piglets into carts; and piglets born prematurely in gestation crates falling through the slats into the manure pits.[51][52] The video won a 2012 Webby Award in the "Public Service and Activism" category.[53]
In response, Smithfield told the AP that it has "zero tolerance for any behavior that does not conform to our established animal well-being procedures".[51] The company asked Temple Grandin, a professor of animal husbandry, to review the footage; she recommended an inspection by animal welfare expert Jennifer Woods.[54][55][56][57][58] Smithfield announced on December 21 that it had fired two workers and their supervisor.[54][59] At the company's invitation, the Virginia state veterinarian Richard Wilkes visited the facility on December 22. He told The Virginian-Pilot that Smithfield had been "very responsive and very responsible in how they've addressed the issues", and that he had not seen "any indication of abuse" of the pigs and was impressed by their demeanor. A Humane Society spokesman said that Smithfield had provided the vet "with a pre-announced, white glove tour".[60]
Legal and labor issues[edit]
Working conditions[edit]
Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a 175-page report in 2005 documenting what it said were unsafe work conditions in the U.S. meat and poultry industry. In particular, the report said, workers make thousands of repetitive motions with knives during each shift, leading to lacerations and repetitive strain injuries. According to HRW, the workers' immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions. The report cited working conditions in Smithfield Foods as an example.[61][62][6]:8 According to the report, the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers. A Smithfield manager testified in 1998, during an unfair labor practices trial, that at the Tar Heel plant in North Carolina it takes between five and ten minutes to slaughter and complete the process of "disassembly" of an animal, including draining, cleaning, and cleaving. One worker told HRW that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives, which means harder cuts have to be made, with the resultant injuries to workers.[62]:4[63] Similar criticism was made by other groups about Smithfield facilities in Poland and Romania.[6]:8

The Smithfield Packing plant in Tar Heel, North Carolina, was the site of a long dispute between the company and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW), which had tried since the early 1990s to organize the plant's roughly 5,000 hourly workers.[64] Workers voted against the union in 1994 and 1997, but the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleged that unfair election conduct had occurred and ordered a new election. During the 1997 election the company is alleged to have fired workers who supported the union, stationed police at the plant gates, and threatened plant closures. In 2000, according to Human Rights Watch, Smithfield set up its own security force with "special police agency" status under North Carolina law, and in 2003 arrested workers who supported the union.[61]
Smithfield appealed the NLRB's ruling that the 1997 election was invalid, and, in 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of the NLRB.[65] After demonstrations, lockouts, and a shareholder meeting that was disrupted by shareholders supporting the union, the UFCW called for a boycott of Smithfield products. In October 2007, Smithfield countered by filing a federal RICO Act lawsuit against UFCW.[64] In October 2008, the UFCW and Smithfield reached an agreement, under which the union agreed to suspend its boycott campaign in return for the company dropping its RICO lawsuit and allowing another election. In December 2008, workers voted 2,041 to 1,879 in favor of joining the UFCW, bringing the 15-year fight to an end.[66]
Justice Department penalty[edit]
In January 2009, Smithfield was assessed a $900,000 penalty by the U.S. Justice Department to settle charges that the company engaged in illegal merger activity during its takeover of Premium Standard Farms LLC in 2006.[67]
Philanthropy[edit]
The Smithfield-Luter Foundation, established in 2002, is a non-profit organization that acts as the philanthropic wing of Smithfield Foods, dedicated primarily to providing scholarship opportunities to the children and grandchildren of Smithfield employees. It has given $5 million to Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, to establish the Luter School of Business,[68] and $5 million to the University of Virginia Cancer Center in Charlottesville, Virginia.[69] The Foundation also provides support for its "learners to leaders" programs, begun in 2006, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Denison, Iowa; and Norfolk, Virginia.[70]
Sports sponsorships[edit]
In 2012, Smithfield announced a 15-race sponsorship with Richard Petty Motorsports and driver Aric Almirola driving the #43 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. The sponsorship was increased to 30 races beginning in 2014. Smithfield rotates its brands on the car, featuring Smithfield, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, and Nathan's Famous. It is also the official food of Richmond International Raceway in Henrico County, Virginia about an hour northwest of Smithfield HQ.

Smithfield Foods, Inc., is a meat-processing company headquartered in Smithfield, Virginia, in the United States. The company runs facilities in 26 U.S. states—including the largest slaughterhouse and meat-processing plant in the world, located in Tar Heel, North Carolina[2]—as well as in Mexico and 10 European countries. Founded in the U.S., Smithfield was purchased in 2013, for more than its market value, by the Chinese holding company Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd.[3][4] Now known as WH Group, Shuanghui Group is the world's largest pork producer and processor. It was the largest Chinese acquisition of an American company at the time,[3] and Smithfield's 146,000 acres of farmland made Shuanghui one of the largest overseas owners of U.S. agricultural land.[5] As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees around the world and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1]
The company was founded in 1936 by Joseph W. Luter and his son as the Smithfield Packing Company, now its largest subsidiary. From 1981, it began to purchase companies such as Eckrich, Farmland Foods of Kansas; Gwaltney of Smithfield; John Morrell; Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina; and Premium Standard Farms.[6]:6 The company was able to grow as a result of its highly industrialized pig production, raising the animals using a vertical integration system of production that enables it to control the animals' development from conception to packing. Thousands of livestock are permanently confined in barns with metal roofs, known as concentrated animal feeding operations.[7]
As of 2006 Smithfield raised 15 million pigs a year and processed 27 million, producing over six billion pounds of pork.[8] It was the top pig slaughter operation in the United States in 2007, at 114,300 pigs a day, and along with three other companies slaughtered 56 percent of the cattle processed there until it sold its beef group in 2008.[9][a] Smithfield sells its products under several brand names, including Cook's Ham, Gwaltney, John Morrell, Krakus Ham, Patrick Cudahy, Smithfield, and Stefano's.[10] Kenneth M. Sullivan has been the president and chief executive officer since 2015.[11]

Company profile[edit]
The company traces its history to 1936, when Joseph W. Luter, Sr. and his son, Joseph W. Luter, Jr., opened the Smithfield Packing Company in Smithfield, Virginia. The latter served as chief executive officer (CEO) until his death in 1962. A grandson, Joseph W. Luter III, joined the company the same year, and in 1966 became chairman and CEO until Smithfield was taken over by Liberty Equities in 1969. The company hired Luter again as CEO in 1975 when it found itself in financial difficulties; his restructuring of the company is credited with its improved performance.[2] His son, Joseph W. Luter IV, became an executive vice president of Smithfield Foods and president of the Smithfield Packing Company, the parent company's largest subsidiary.[10]
Smithfield began to expand in 1981 with its purchase of its main competitor, Gwaltney of Smithfield. This was followed by the acquisition of almost 40 companies in the pork, beef, and livestock industries between 1981 and around 2008.[12] The company Patrick Cudahy was purchased in 1984 and Schluderberg-Kurdle in 1986.[10] In 1992 Smithfield opened the world's largest processing plant, a 973,000-square-foot facility in Tar Heel, North Carolina, which by 2000 could process 32,000 pigs a day.[7]
Smithfield purchased John Morrell & Co in Sioux Falls, SD, in 1995 and Circle Four Farms in 1998. In 1999 it bought two of the largest pig producers in the United States: Carroll's Foods and Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina, at that point the largest producer. According to agricultural researchers Jill Hobbs and Linda Young, Smithfield's purchase of these companies constituted a major structural change in the U.S. pig industry.[13] Farmland Foods of Kansas City was added in 2003, as were Sara Lee's European Meats, ConAgra Foods Refrigerated Meats, Butterball (the poultry producer), and Premium Standard Farms in 2007.[10][14] The company sold its 49 percent share in Butterball in 2008 for an estimated $175 million.[15] The acquisitions caused concern among regulators in the United States regarding the company's control of the food supply. After Smithfield's purchase of Murphy Family Farms, the Agriculture Department described it as "absurdly big".[7] As of 2006 four companies—Smithfield, Tyson, Swift & Company, and Cargill—were responsible for the production of 70 percent of pork in the United States.[12]
On May 29, 2013, Shuanghui Group, also known as the Shineway Group, the largest meat producer in China, announced a purchase of Smithfield Foods, Inc., for $4.72 billion.[16] Shuanghui announced that it would list Smithfield on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after completing the takeover.[17] On September 6, 2013, the U.S. government approved Shuanghui International Holding’s purchase of Smithfield Food, Inc. The deal was valued at approximately $7.1 billion. It was the largest stock acquisition by a Chinese company of an American company.[18]
As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees in the United States, Mexico and Europe, and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1] It raises 15.8 million pigs a year, producing 3.8 billion pounds of fresh pork and 2.7 billion pounds of packaged meat, sold as 50 brands of pork products and 200 other foods.[19] Along with specialty brands such as the Paula Deen Collection and Weight Watchers, the company's 12 core brands are Armour, Carando, Cook's Ham, Curly's Foods, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, Healthy Ones, John Morrell, Kretschmar, Margherita, and Smithfield.[20] The company also operates The Genuine Smithfield Ham Shoppe and a restaurant, Taste of Smithfield, both in Smithfield, Virginia.[21]
Pig production[edit]
Vertical integration[edit]
Further information: Vertical Integration
In 1990 the company bought hog-farming operations, making it a vertically integrated company. The system allows Smithfield to control every stage of pig production, from conception and birth to slaughter, processing and packing—known as "from squeal to meal" or "from birth to bacon". Joseph W. Luter III said that this produces "high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics." Luter has said that "vertical integration gives you high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics. And the only way to do that is to control the process from the farm to the packing plant."[7] According to Tyya N. Turner, the company obtained 2,000 pigs and the right to their genetic lines from Britain's National Pig Development Company in 1990, and used them to create Smithfield Lean Generation Pork, which was certified by the American Heart Association for its low fat, salt, and cholesterol content. According to Luter, it was vertical integration that enabled this.[2]
Housing and lagoons[edit]
The pigs are housed together in their thousands in identical barns with metal roofs, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[22] The floors of the buildings are slatted, allowing waste to be flushed into 30-feet-deep open-air pits the size of two football fields, referred to within the industry as lagoons. Smithfield says the lagoons contain an impervious liner made to withstand leakage.[23][23] According to Jeff Tietz, writing for Rolling Stone, the waste—a mixture of excrement, urine, blood, afterbirths, stillborn pigs, drugs and other chemicals—overflows when it rains, and the liners can be punctured by rocks.[8] Smithfield attributes the pink color of the waste to the health of the lagoons, writing that the color is "a sign of bacteria doing what it should be doing. It's indicative of lower odor and lower nutrient content".[24]
Pregnant sows[edit]




Sows used for breeding are confined in 7 ft x 2 ft gestation crates.[25] This image was taken inside a Smithfield facility in Virginia in 2010.


Smithfield said in December 2011 that it would phase out gestation crates on its company-owned farms by 2017 in the United States,[26][27] and by 2022 in Europe and Mexico.[28] Pregnant sows spend most of their lives in these stalls, which are too small to allow them to turn around.[29] When they give birth, they are moved to a farrowing crate for three weeks, then artificially inseminated and placed back into a gestation crate.[30] The practice has led to criticism from animal welfare groups, supermarket chains and McDonald's.[29]
Smithfield said in 2007 that it would phase out gestation crates by 2017,[31] but in 2009 said it would not meet the timeline because of operating losses caused by the recession.[32][33] In January 2015 it said that 71.3 percent of pregnant sows on its company-owned farms had been moved into group housing and out of the crates.[34] It would not commit to requiring its contract farms, where almost half its sows live, to phase out the crates.[35][34]
Environmental and animal welfare record[edit]
Emissions[edit]
Smithfield has come under criticism for the millions of gallons of untreated fecal matter it produces and stores in the lagoons. In a four-year period in North Carolina in the 1990s, 4.7 million gallons of hog fecal matter were released into the state's rivers. Workers and residents near Smithfield plants reported health problems and complained about the stench of hog feces.[8]
The company was fined $12.6 million in 1997 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for 6,900 violations of the Clean Water Act after discharging illegal levels of slaughterhouse waste into the Pagan River in Virginia.[36] Its facilities in North Carolina came under scrutiny in 1999 when Hurricane Floyd flooded lagoons holding fecal matter; many of Smithfield's contract farms were accused of polluting the rivers. Smithfield reached a settlement in 2000 with the state of North Carolina, agreeing to pay the state $50 million over 25 years. The company agreed to donate $1.3 million to clean up; North Carolina State University would receive $15 million to research the treatment of pig waste; and the North Carolina Foundation for Soil and Water Conservation, Ducks Unlimited and the North Carolina Coastal Federation would receive grants.[37][6]:7
According to Ralph Deptolla of Smithfield Foods, the company created new executive positions to monitor the environmental issues, and hired Dennis Treacy, a former director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, as Executive Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer. Treacy had previously been involved in the enforcement efforts against Smithfield. Deptolla writes that Smithfield also created an environmental management system (ESM), launching it in 2001 at its Murphy-Brown facilities.[6]:9
In 2005 the company received ISO 14001 certification from the International Organization for Standardization for its hog production and processing facilities in the U.S., with the exception of new acquisitions, and, in 2009, 14 plants in the U.S. and 21 in Romania received certification.[38] Deptolla writes that 578 Smithfield facilities were ISO 14001-certified as of 2011.[6]:9 In 2006 its hog-production subsidiary Murphy-Brown reached an agreement with the Waterkeeper Alliance, once one of Smithfield's biggest critics, to adopt new measures to enhance environmental protection at the former's facilities in North Carolina.[39][40] In 2009 the company said it had reduced greenhouse gas emissions at its plants by four percent since 2007, its processing emissions per 100 pounds of production by 62 percent, and its first-processing emissions per animal by 41 percent. Smithfield attributed the improvements to the divestiture of the beef group.[41] In 2010 it released its ninth annual Corporate Social Responsibility report, and announced its appointment of a chief sustainability officer and two sustainability committees.[42]
Use of antibiotics[edit]
Concerns were raised about the use by the company and its contractors of low doses of antibiotics to promote the pigs' growth, in addition to using antibiotics as part of a treatment regime. The concern was that the antibiotics were harmful to the animals and were contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.[6]:8 Smithfield said in 2005 that it would administer antibiotics only to animals who were sick themselves, or who were in close proximity to sick animals; however, in Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations all pigs are in close proximity to each other.[43]
Operations in Mexico[edit]
The earliest confirmed case of the H1N1 virus (swine flu) during the 2009 flu pandemic was in a five-year-old boy in La Gloria, Mexico, near several facilities operated by Granjas Carroll de Mexico, a Smithfield Foods subsidiary that processes 1.2 million pigs a year and employs 907 people.[23][44][45][46] This, together with tension between the company and local community over Smithfield's environmental record, prompted several newspapers to link the outbreak to Smithfield's farming practices. According to The Washington Post, over 600 other residents of La Gloria became ill from a respiratory disease in March that year (later thought to be seasonal flu). The Post writes that health officials found no link between the farms and the H1N1 outbreak.[23] Smithfield said that it had found no clinical signs of swine flu in its pigs or employees in Mexico, and had no reason to believe that the outbreak was connected to its Mexican facilities. The company said it routinely administers flu virus vaccine to its swine herds in Mexico and conducts monthly tests to detect the virus.[47]
Residents alleged that the company regularly violates local environmental regulations.[48][49] According to the Washington Post, local farmers had complained for years about headaches from the smell of the pig farms and said that wild dogs had been eating discarded pig carcasses. Smithfield was using biodigesters to convert dead pigs into renewable energy, but residents alleged that they regularly overflowed. Residents also feared that the waste stored in the lagoons would leak into the groundwater.[23]
Packaging reduction[edit]
In 2009 Armour-Eckrich introduced smaller crescent-style packaging for its smoked sausages, which reduced the plastic film and corrugated cardboard the company used by over 840,000 pounds per year. In 2010 the John Morrell plant in Sioux Falls, SD, reduced its use of plastic by 40,600 pounds a year, and Farmland Foods reduced the corrugated packaging entering waste streams by over five million pounds a year. Smithfield Packing used 17 percent less plastic for deli meat. The company also eliminated 20,000 pounds of corrugated material a year by using smaller boxes to transport chicken frankfurters to its largest customer.[41]
2010 Humane Society investigation[edit]
In December 2010 the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) released an undercover video taken by one of its investigators inside a Smithfield Foods facility.[29] The investigator had worked for a month at Murphy-Brown, a Smithfield subsidiary in Waverly, Virginia.[50] The Associated Press (AP) reported that the investigator videotaped 1,000 sows living in gestation crates. According to the AP, the material shows a pig being pulled by the snout, shot in the head with a stun gun, and thrown into a bin while trying to wriggle free. The investigator said he saw sows biting their crates and bleeding; staff jabbing them to make them move; staff tossing piglets into carts; and piglets born prematurely in gestation crates falling through the slats into the manure pits.[51][52] The video won a 2012 Webby Award in the "Public Service and Activism" category.[53]
In response, Smithfield told the AP that it has "zero tolerance for any behavior that does not conform to our established animal well-being procedures".[51] The company asked Temple Grandin, a professor of animal husbandry, to review the footage; she recommended an inspection by animal welfare expert Jennifer Woods.[54][55][56][57][58] Smithfield announced on December 21 that it had fired two workers and their supervisor.[54][59] At the company's invitation, the Virginia state veterinarian Richard Wilkes visited the facility on December 22. He told The Virginian-Pilot that Smithfield had been "very responsive and very responsible in how they've addressed the issues", and that he had not seen "any indication of abuse" of the pigs and was impressed by their demeanor. A Humane Society spokesman said that Smithfield had provided the vet "with a pre-announced, white glove tour".[60]
Legal and labor issues[edit]
Working conditions[edit]
Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a 175-page report in 2005 documenting what it said were unsafe work conditions in the U.S. meat and poultry industry. In particular, the report said, workers make thousands of repetitive motions with knives during each shift, leading to lacerations and repetitive strain injuries. According to HRW, the workers' immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions. The report cited working conditions in Smithfield Foods as an example.[61][62][6]:8 According to the report, the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers. A Smithfield manager testified in 1998, during an unfair labor practices trial, that at the Tar Heel plant in North Carolina it takes between five and ten minutes to slaughter and complete the process of "disassembly" of an animal, including draining, cleaning, and cleaving. One worker told HRW that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives, which means harder cuts have to be made, with the resultant injuries to workers.[62]:4[63] Similar criticism was made by other groups about Smithfield facilities in Poland and Romania.[6]:8

The Smithfield Packing plant in Tar Heel, North Carolina, was the site of a long dispute between the company and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW), which had tried since the early 1990s to organize the plant's roughly 5,000 hourly workers.[64] Workers voted against the union in 1994 and 1997, but the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleged that unfair election conduct had occurred and ordered a new election. During the 1997 election the company is alleged to have fired workers who supported the union, stationed police at the plant gates, and threatened plant closures. In 2000, according to Human Rights Watch, Smithfield set up its own security force with "special police agency" status under North Carolina law, and in 2003 arrested workers who supported the union.[61]
Smithfield appealed the NLRB's ruling that the 1997 election was invalid, and, in 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of the NLRB.[65] After demonstrations, lockouts, and a shareholder meeting that was disrupted by shareholders supporting the union, the UFCW called for a boycott of Smithfield products. In October 2007, Smithfield countered by filing a federal RICO Act lawsuit against UFCW.[64] In October 2008, the UFCW and Smithfield reached an agreement, under which the union agreed to suspend its boycott campaign in return for the company dropping its RICO lawsuit and allowing another election. In December 2008, workers voted 2,041 to 1,879 in favor of joining the UFCW, bringing the 15-year fight to an end.[66]
Justice Department penalty[edit]
In January 2009, Smithfield was assessed a $900,000 penalty by the U.S. Justice Department to settle charges that the company engaged in illegal merger activity during its takeover of Premium Standard Farms LLC in 2006.[67]
Philanthropy[edit]
The Smithfield-Luter Foundation, established in 2002, is a non-profit organization that acts as the philanthropic wing of Smithfield Foods, dedicated primarily to providing scholarship opportunities to the children and grandchildren of Smithfield employees. It has given $5 million to Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, to establish the Luter School of Business,[68] and $5 million to the University of Virginia Cancer Center in Charlottesville, Virginia.[69] The Foundation also provides support for its "learners to leaders" programs, begun in 2006, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Denison, Iowa; and Norfolk, Virginia.[70]
Sports sponsorships[edit]
In 2012, Smithfield announced a 15-race sponsorship with Richard Petty Motorsports and driver Aric Almirola driving the #43 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. The sponsorship was increased to 30 races beginning in 2014. Smithfield rotates its brands on the car, featuring Smithfield, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, and Nathan's Famous. It is also the official food of Richmond International Raceway in Henrico County, Virginia about an hour northwest of Smithfield HQ.

Smithfield Foods, Inc., is a meat-processing company headquartered in Smithfield, Virginia, in the United States. The company runs facilities in 26 U.S. states—including the largest slaughterhouse and meat-processing plant in the world, located in Tar Heel, North Carolina[2]—as well as in Mexico and 10 European countries. Founded in the U.S., Smithfield was purchased in 2013, for more than its market value, by the Chinese holding company Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd.[3][4] Now known as WH Group, Shuanghui Group is the world's largest pork producer and processor. It was the largest Chinese acquisition of an American company at the time,[3] and Smithfield's 146,000 acres of farmland made Shuanghui one of the largest overseas owners of U.S. agricultural land.[5] As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees around the world and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1]
The company was founded in 1936 by Joseph W. Luter and his son as the Smithfield Packing Company, now its largest subsidiary. From 1981, it began to purchase companies such as Eckrich, Farmland Foods of Kansas; Gwaltney of Smithfield; John Morrell; Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina; and Premium Standard Farms.[6]:6 The company was able to grow as a result of its highly industrialized pig production, raising the animals using a vertical integration system of production that enables it to control the animals' development from conception to packing. Thousands of livestock are permanently confined in barns with metal roofs, known as concentrated animal feeding operations.[7]
As of 2006 Smithfield raised 15 million pigs a year and processed 27 million, producing over six billion pounds of pork.[8] It was the top pig slaughter operation in the United States in 2007, at 114,300 pigs a day, and along with three other companies slaughtered 56 percent of the cattle processed there until it sold its beef group in 2008.[9][a] Smithfield sells its products under several brand names, including Cook's Ham, Gwaltney, John Morrell, Krakus Ham, Patrick Cudahy, Smithfield, and Stefano's.[10] Kenneth M. Sullivan has been the president and chief executive officer since 2015.[11]

Company profile[edit]
The company traces its history to 1936, when Joseph W. Luter, Sr. and his son, Joseph W. Luter, Jr., opened the Smithfield Packing Company in Smithfield, Virginia. The latter served as chief executive officer (CEO) until his death in 1962. A grandson, Joseph W. Luter III, joined the company the same year, and in 1966 became chairman and CEO until Smithfield was taken over by Liberty Equities in 1969. The company hired Luter again as CEO in 1975 when it found itself in financial difficulties; his restructuring of the company is credited with its improved performance.[2] His son, Joseph W. Luter IV, became an executive vice president of Smithfield Foods and president of the Smithfield Packing Company, the parent company's largest subsidiary.[10]
Smithfield began to expand in 1981 with its purchase of its main competitor, Gwaltney of Smithfield. This was followed by the acquisition of almost 40 companies in the pork, beef, and livestock industries between 1981 and around 2008.[12] The company Patrick Cudahy was purchased in 1984 and Schluderberg-Kurdle in 1986.[10] In 1992 Smithfield opened the world's largest processing plant, a 973,000-square-foot facility in Tar Heel, North Carolina, which by 2000 could process 32,000 pigs a day.[7]
Smithfield purchased John Morrell & Co in Sioux Falls, SD, in 1995 and Circle Four Farms in 1998. In 1999 it bought two of the largest pig producers in the United States: Carroll's Foods and Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina, at that point the largest producer. According to agricultural researchers Jill Hobbs and Linda Young, Smithfield's purchase of these companies constituted a major structural change in the U.S. pig industry.[13] Farmland Foods of Kansas City was added in 2003, as were Sara Lee's European Meats, ConAgra Foods Refrigerated Meats, Butterball (the poultry producer), and Premium Standard Farms in 2007.[10][14] The company sold its 49 percent share in Butterball in 2008 for an estimated $175 million.[15] The acquisitions caused concern among regulators in the United States regarding the company's control of the food supply. After Smithfield's purchase of Murphy Family Farms, the Agriculture Department described it as "absurdly big".[7] As of 2006 four companies—Smithfield, Tyson, Swift & Company, and Cargill—were responsible for the production of 70 percent of pork in the United States.[12]
On May 29, 2013, Shuanghui Group, also known as the Shineway Group, the largest meat producer in China, announced a purchase of Smithfield Foods, Inc., for $4.72 billion.[16] Shuanghui announced that it would list Smithfield on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after completing the takeover.[17] On September 6, 2013, the U.S. government approved Shuanghui International Holding’s purchase of Smithfield Food, Inc. The deal was valued at approximately $7.1 billion. It was the largest stock acquisition by a Chinese company of an American company.[18]
As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees in the United States, Mexico and Europe, and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1] It raises 15.8 million pigs a year, producing 3.8 billion pounds of fresh pork and 2.7 billion pounds of packaged meat, sold as 50 brands of pork products and 200 other foods.[19] Along with specialty brands such as the Paula Deen Collection and Weight Watchers, the company's 12 core brands are Armour, Carando, Cook's Ham, Curly's Foods, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, Healthy Ones, John Morrell, Kretschmar, Margherita, and Smithfield.[20] The company also operates The Genuine Smithfield Ham Shoppe and a restaurant, Taste of Smithfield, both in Smithfield, Virginia.[21]
Pig production[edit]
Vertical integration[edit]
Further information: Vertical Integration
In 1990 the company bought hog-farming operations, making it a vertically integrated company. The system allows Smithfield to control every stage of pig production, from conception and birth to slaughter, processing and packing—known as "from squeal to meal" or "from birth to bacon". Joseph W. Luter III said that this produces "high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics." Luter has said that "vertical integration gives you high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics. And the only way to do that is to control the process from the farm to the packing plant."[7] According to Tyya N. Turner, the company obtained 2,000 pigs and the right to their genetic lines from Britain's National Pig Development Company in 1990, and used them to create Smithfield Lean Generation Pork, which was certified by the American Heart Association for its low fat, salt, and cholesterol content. According to Luter, it was vertical integration that enabled this.[2]
Housing and lagoons[edit]
The pigs are housed together in their thousands in identical barns with metal roofs, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[22] The floors of the buildings are slatted, allowing waste to be flushed into 30-feet-deep open-air pits the size of two football fields, referred to within the industry as lagoons. Smithfield says the lagoons contain an impervious liner made to withstand leakage.[23][23] According to Jeff Tietz, writing for Rolling Stone, the waste—a mixture of excrement, urine, blood, afterbirths, stillborn pigs, drugs and other chemicals—overflows when it rains, and the liners can be punctured by rocks.[8] Smithfield attributes the pink color of the waste to the health of the lagoons, writing that the color is "a sign of bacteria doing what it should be doing. It's indicative of lower odor and lower nutrient content".[24]
Pregnant sows[edit]




Sows used for breeding are confined in 7 ft x 2 ft gestation crates.[25] This image was taken inside a Smithfield facility in Virginia in 2010.


Smithfield said in December 2011 that it would phase out gestation crates on its company-owned farms by 2017 in the United States,[26][27] and by 2022 in Europe and Mexico.[28] Pregnant sows spend most of their lives in these stalls, which are too small to allow them to turn around.[29] When they give birth, they are moved to a farrowing crate for three weeks, then artificially inseminated and placed back into a gestation crate.[30] The practice has led to criticism from animal welfare groups, supermarket chains and McDonald's.[29]
Smithfield said in 2007 that it would phase out gestation crates by 2017,[31] but in 2009 said it would not meet the timeline because of operating losses caused by the recession.[32][33] In January 2015 it said that 71.3 percent of pregnant sows on its company-owned farms had been moved into group housing and out of the crates.[34] It would not commit to requiring its contract farms, where almost half its sows live, to phase out the crates.[35][34]
Environmental and animal welfare record[edit]
Emissions[edit]
Smithfield has come under criticism for the millions of gallons of untreated fecal matter it produces and stores in the lagoons. In a four-year period in North Carolina in the 1990s, 4.7 million gallons of hog fecal matter were released into the state's rivers. Workers and residents near Smithfield plants reported health problems and complained about the stench of hog feces.[8]
The company was fined $12.6 million in 1997 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for 6,900 violations of the Clean Water Act after discharging illegal levels of slaughterhouse waste into the Pagan River in Virginia.[36] Its facilities in North Carolina came under scrutiny in 1999 when Hurricane Floyd flooded lagoons holding fecal matter; many of Smithfield's contract farms were accused of polluting the rivers. Smithfield reached a settlement in 2000 with the state of North Carolina, agreeing to pay the state $50 million over 25 years. The company agreed to donate $1.3 million to clean up; North Carolina State University would receive $15 million to research the treatment of pig waste; and the North Carolina Foundation for Soil and Water Conservation, Ducks Unlimited and the North Carolina Coastal Federation would receive grants.[37][6]:7
According to Ralph Deptolla of Smithfield Foods, the company created new executive positions to monitor the environmental issues, and hired Dennis Treacy, a former director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, as Executive Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer. Treacy had previously been involved in the enforcement efforts against Smithfield. Deptolla writes that Smithfield also created an environmental management system (ESM), launching it in 2001 at its Murphy-Brown facilities.[6]:9
In 2005 the company received ISO 14001 certification from the International Organization for Standardization for its hog production and processing facilities in the U.S., with the exception of new acquisitions, and, in 2009, 14 plants in the U.S. and 21 in Romania received certification.[38] Deptolla writes that 578 Smithfield facilities were ISO 14001-certified as of 2011.[6]:9 In 2006 its hog-production subsidiary Murphy-Brown reached an agreement with the Waterkeeper Alliance, once one of Smithfield's biggest critics, to adopt new measures to enhance environmental protection at the former's facilities in North Carolina.[39][40] In 2009 the company said it had reduced greenhouse gas emissions at its plants by four percent since 2007, its processing emissions per 100 pounds of production by 62 percent, and its first-processing emissions per animal by 41 percent. Smithfield attributed the improvements to the divestiture of the beef group.[41] In 2010 it released its ninth annual Corporate Social Responsibility report, and announced its appointment of a chief sustainability officer and two sustainability committees.[42]
Use of antibiotics[edit]
Concerns were raised about the use by the company and its contractors of low doses of antibiotics to promote the pigs' growth, in addition to using antibiotics as part of a treatment regime. The concern was that the antibiotics were harmful to the animals and were contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.[6]:8 Smithfield said in 2005 that it would administer antibiotics only to animals who were sick themselves, or who were in close proximity to sick animals; however, in Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations all pigs are in close proximity to each other.[43]
Operations in Mexico[edit]
The earliest confirmed case of the H1N1 virus (swine flu) during the 2009 flu pandemic was in a five-year-old boy in La Gloria, Mexico, near several facilities operated by Granjas Carroll de Mexico, a Smithfield Foods subsidiary that processes 1.2 million pigs a year and employs 907 people.[23][44][45][46] This, together with tension between the company and local community over Smithfield's environmental record, prompted several newspapers to link the outbreak to Smithfield's farming practices. According to The Washington Post, over 600 other residents of La Gloria became ill from a respiratory disease in March that year (later thought to be seasonal flu). The Post writes that health officials found no link between the farms and the H1N1 outbreak.[23] Smithfield said that it had found no clinical signs of swine flu in its pigs or employees in Mexico, and had no reason to believe that the outbreak was connected to its Mexican facilities. The company said it routinely administers flu virus vaccine to its swine herds in Mexico and conducts monthly tests to detect the virus.[47]
Residents alleged that the company regularly violates local environmental regulations.[48][49] According to the Washington Post, local farmers had complained for years about headaches from the smell of the pig farms and said that wild dogs had been eating discarded pig carcasses. Smithfield was using biodigesters to convert dead pigs into renewable energy, but residents alleged that they regularly overflowed. Residents also feared that the waste stored in the lagoons would leak into the groundwater.[23]
Packaging reduction[edit]
In 2009 Armour-Eckrich introduced smaller crescent-style packaging for its smoked sausages, which reduced the plastic film and corrugated cardboard the company used by over 840,000 pounds per year. In 2010 the John Morrell plant in Sioux Falls, SD, reduced its use of plastic by 40,600 pounds a year, and Farmland Foods reduced the corrugated packaging entering waste streams by over five million pounds a year. Smithfield Packing used 17 percent less plastic for deli meat. The company also eliminated 20,000 pounds of corrugated material a year by using smaller boxes to transport chicken frankfurters to its largest customer.[41]
2010 Humane Society investigation[edit]
In December 2010 the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) released an undercover video taken by one of its investigators inside a Smithfield Foods facility.[29] The investigator had worked for a month at Murphy-Brown, a Smithfield subsidiary in Waverly, Virginia.[50] The Associated Press (AP) reported that the investigator videotaped 1,000 sows living in gestation crates. According to the AP, the material shows a pig being pulled by the snout, shot in the head with a stun gun, and thrown into a bin while trying to wriggle free. The investigator said he saw sows biting their crates and bleeding; staff jabbing them to make them move; staff tossing piglets into carts; and piglets born prematurely in gestation crates falling through the slats into the manure pits.[51][52] The video won a 2012 Webby Award in the "Public Service and Activism" category.[53]
In response, Smithfield told the AP that it has "zero tolerance for any behavior that does not conform to our established animal well-being procedures".[51] The company asked Temple Grandin, a professor of animal husbandry, to review the footage; she recommended an inspection by animal welfare expert Jennifer Woods.[54][55][56][57][58] Smithfield announced on December 21 that it had fired two workers and their supervisor.[54][59] At the company's invitation, the Virginia state veterinarian Richard Wilkes visited the facility on December 22. He told The Virginian-Pilot that Smithfield had been "very responsive and very responsible in how they've addressed the issues", and that he had not seen "any indication of abuse" of the pigs and was impressed by their demeanor. A Humane Society spokesman said that Smithfield had provided the vet "with a pre-announced, white glove tour".[60]
Legal and labor issues[edit]
Working conditions[edit]
Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a 175-page report in 2005 documenting what it said were unsafe work conditions in the U.S. meat and poultry industry. In particular, the report said, workers make thousands of repetitive motions with knives during each shift, leading to lacerations and repetitive strain injuries. According to HRW, the workers' immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions. The report cited working conditions in Smithfield Foods as an example.[61][62][6]:8 According to the report, the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers. A Smithfield manager testified in 1998, during an unfair labor practices trial, that at the Tar Heel plant in North Carolina it takes between five and ten minutes to slaughter and complete the process of "disassembly" of an animal, including draining, cleaning, and cleaving. One worker told HRW that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives, which means harder cuts have to be made, with the resultant injuries to workers.[62]:4[63] Similar criticism was made by other groups about Smithfield facilities in Poland and Romania.[6]:8

The Smithfield Packing plant in Tar Heel, North Carolina, was the site of a long dispute between the company and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW), which had tried since the early 1990s to organize the plant's roughly 5,000 hourly workers.[64] Workers voted against the union in 1994 and 1997, but the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleged that unfair election conduct had occurred and ordered a new election. During the 1997 election the company is alleged to have fired workers who supported the union, stationed police at the plant gates, and threatened plant closures. In 2000, according to Human Rights Watch, Smithfield set up its own security force with "special police agency" status under North Carolina law, and in 2003 arrested workers who supported the union.[61]
Smithfield appealed the NLRB's ruling that the 1997 election was invalid, and, in 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of the NLRB.[65] After demonstrations, lockouts, and a shareholder meeting that was disrupted by shareholders supporting the union, the UFCW called for a boycott of Smithfield products. In October 2007, Smithfield countered by filing a federal RICO Act lawsuit against UFCW.[64] In October 2008, the UFCW and Smithfield reached an agreement, under which the union agreed to suspend its boycott campaign in return for the company dropping its RICO lawsuit and allowing another election. In December 2008, workers voted 2,041 to 1,879 in favor of joining the UFCW, bringing the 15-year fight to an end.[66]
Justice Department penalty[edit]
In January 2009, Smithfield was assessed a $900,000 penalty by the U.S. Justice Department to settle charges that the company engaged in illegal merger activity during its takeover of Premium Standard Farms LLC in 2006.[67]
Philanthropy[edit]
The Smithfield-Luter Foundation, established in 2002, is a non-profit organization that acts as the philanthropic wing of Smithfield Foods, dedicated primarily to providing scholarship opportunities to the children and grandchildren of Smithfield employees. It has given $5 million to Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, to establish the Luter School of Business,[68] and $5 million to the University of Virginia Cancer Center in Charlottesville, Virginia.[69] The Foundation also provides support for its "learners to leaders" programs, begun in 2006, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Denison, Iowa; and Norfolk, Virginia.[70]
Sports sponsorships[edit]
In 2012, Smithfield announced a 15-race sponsorship with Richard Petty Motorsports and driver Aric Almirola driving the #43 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. The sponsorship was increased to 30 races beginning in 2014. Smithfield rotates its brands on the car, featuring Smithfield, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, and Nathan's Famous. It is also the official food of Richmond International Raceway in Henrico County, Virginia about an hour northwest of Smithfield HQ.

Smithfield Foods, Inc., is a meat-processing company headquartered in Smithfield, Virginia, in the United States. The company runs facilities in 26 U.S. states—including the largest slaughterhouse and meat-processing plant in the world, located in Tar Heel, North Carolina[2]—as well as in Mexico and 10 European countries. Founded in the U.S., Smithfield was purchased in 2013, for more than its market value, by the Chinese holding company Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd.[3][4] Now known as WH Group, Shuanghui Group is the world's largest pork producer and processor. It was the largest Chinese acquisition of an American company at the time,[3] and Smithfield's 146,000 acres of farmland made Shuanghui one of the largest overseas owners of U.S. agricultural land.[5] As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees around the world and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1]
The company was founded in 1936 by Joseph W. Luter and his son as the Smithfield Packing Company, now its largest subsidiary. From 1981, it began to purchase companies such as Eckrich, Farmland Foods of Kansas; Gwaltney of Smithfield; John Morrell; Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina; and Premium Standard Farms.[6]:6 The company was able to grow as a result of its highly industrialized pig production, raising the animals using a vertical integration system of production that enables it to control the animals' development from conception to packing. Thousands of livestock are permanently confined in barns with metal roofs, known as concentrated animal feeding operations.[7]
As of 2006 Smithfield raised 15 million pigs a year and processed 27 million, producing over six billion pounds of pork.[8] It was the top pig slaughter operation in the United States in 2007, at 114,300 pigs a day, and along with three other companies slaughtered 56 percent of the cattle processed there until it sold its beef group in 2008.[9][a] Smithfield sells its products under several brand names, including Cook's Ham, Gwaltney, John Morrell, Krakus Ham, Patrick Cudahy, Smithfield, and Stefano's.[10] Kenneth M. Sullivan has been the president and chief executive officer since 2015.[11]

Company profile[edit]
The company traces its history to 1936, when Joseph W. Luter, Sr. and his son, Joseph W. Luter, Jr., opened the Smithfield Packing Company in Smithfield, Virginia. The latter served as chief executive officer (CEO) until his death in 1962. A grandson, Joseph W. Luter III, joined the company the same year, and in 1966 became chairman and CEO until Smithfield was taken over by Liberty Equities in 1969. The company hired Luter again as CEO in 1975 when it found itself in financial difficulties; his restructuring of the company is credited with its improved performance.[2] His son, Joseph W. Luter IV, became an executive vice president of Smithfield Foods and president of the Smithfield Packing Company, the parent company's largest subsidiary.[10]
Smithfield began to expand in 1981 with its purchase of its main competitor, Gwaltney of Smithfield. This was followed by the acquisition of almost 40 companies in the pork, beef, and livestock industries between 1981 and around 2008.[12] The company Patrick Cudahy was purchased in 1984 and Schluderberg-Kurdle in 1986.[10] In 1992 Smithfield opened the world's largest processing plant, a 973,000-square-foot facility in Tar Heel, North Carolina, which by 2000 could process 32,000 pigs a day.[7]
Smithfield purchased John Morrell & Co in Sioux Falls, SD, in 1995 and Circle Four Farms in 1998. In 1999 it bought two of the largest pig producers in the United States: Carroll's Foods and Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina, at that point the largest producer. According to agricultural researchers Jill Hobbs and Linda Young, Smithfield's purchase of these companies constituted a major structural change in the U.S. pig industry.[13] Farmland Foods of Kansas City was added in 2003, as were Sara Lee's European Meats, ConAgra Foods Refrigerated Meats, Butterball (the poultry producer), and Premium Standard Farms in 2007.[10][14] The company sold its 49 percent share in Butterball in 2008 for an estimated $175 million.[15] The acquisitions caused concern among regulators in the United States regarding the company's control of the food supply. After Smithfield's purchase of Murphy Family Farms, the Agriculture Department described it as "absurdly big".[7] As of 2006 four companies—Smithfield, Tyson, Swift & Company, and Cargill—were responsible for the production of 70 percent of pork in the United States.[12]
On May 29, 2013, Shuanghui Group, also known as the Shineway Group, the largest meat producer in China, announced a purchase of Smithfield Foods, Inc., for $4.72 billion.[16] Shuanghui announced that it would list Smithfield on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after completing the takeover.[17] On September 6, 2013, the U.S. government approved Shuanghui International Holding’s purchase of Smithfield Food, Inc. The deal was valued at approximately $7.1 billion. It was the largest stock acquisition by a Chinese company of an American company.[18]
As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees in the United States, Mexico and Europe, and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1] It raises 15.8 million pigs a year, producing 3.8 billion pounds of fresh pork and 2.7 billion pounds of packaged meat, sold as 50 brands of pork products and 200 other foods.[19] Along with specialty brands such as the Paula Deen Collection and Weight Watchers, the company's 12 core brands are Armour, Carando, Cook's Ham, Curly's Foods, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, Healthy Ones, John Morrell, Kretschmar, Margherita, and Smithfield.[20] The company also operates The Genuine Smithfield Ham Shoppe and a restaurant, Taste of Smithfield, both in Smithfield, Virginia.[21]
Pig production[edit]
Vertical integration[edit]
Further information: Vertical Integration
In 1990 the company bought hog-farming operations, making it a vertically integrated company. The system allows Smithfield to control every stage of pig production, from conception and birth to slaughter, processing and packing—known as "from squeal to meal" or "from birth to bacon". Joseph W. Luter III said that this produces "high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics." Luter has said that "vertical integration gives you high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics. And the only way to do that is to control the process from the farm to the packing plant."[7] According to Tyya N. Turner, the company obtained 2,000 pigs and the right to their genetic lines from Britain's National Pig Development Company in 1990, and used them to create Smithfield Lean Generation Pork, which was certified by the American Heart Association for its low fat, salt, and cholesterol content. According to Luter, it was vertical integration that enabled this.[2]
Housing and lagoons[edit]
The pigs are housed together in their thousands in identical barns with metal roofs, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[22] The floors of the buildings are slatted, allowing waste to be flushed into 30-feet-deep open-air pits the size of two football fields, referred to within the industry as lagoons. Smithfield says the lagoons contain an impervious liner made to withstand leakage.[23][23] According to Jeff Tietz, writing for Rolling Stone, the waste—a mixture of excrement, urine, blood, afterbirths, stillborn pigs, drugs and other chemicals—overflows when it rains, and the liners can be punctured by rocks.[8] Smithfield attributes the pink color of the waste to the health of the lagoons, writing that the color is "a sign of bacteria doing what it should be doing. It's indicative of lower odor and lower nutrient content".[24]
Pregnant sows[edit]




Sows used for breeding are confined in 7 ft x 2 ft gestation crates.[25] This image was taken inside a Smithfield facility in Virginia in 2010.


Smithfield said in December 2011 that it would phase out gestation crates on its company-owned farms by 2017 in the United States,[26][27] and by 2022 in Europe and Mexico.[28] Pregnant sows spend most of their lives in these stalls, which are too small to allow them to turn around.[29] When they give birth, they are moved to a farrowing crate for three weeks, then artificially inseminated and placed back into a gestation crate.[30] The practice has led to criticism from animal welfare groups, supermarket chains and McDonald's.[29]
Smithfield said in 2007 that it would phase out gestation crates by 2017,[31] but in 2009 said it would not meet the timeline because of operating losses caused by the recession.[32][33] In January 2015 it said that 71.3 percent of pregnant sows on its company-owned farms had been moved into group housing and out of the crates.[34] It would not commit to requiring its contract farms, where almost half its sows live, to phase out the crates.[35][34]
Environmental and animal welfare record[edit]
Emissions[edit]
Smithfield has come under criticism for the millions of gallons of untreated fecal matter it produces and stores in the lagoons. In a four-year period in North Carolina in the 1990s, 4.7 million gallons of hog fecal matter were released into the state's rivers. Workers and residents near Smithfield plants reported health problems and complained about the stench of hog feces.[8]
The company was fined $12.6 million in 1997 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for 6,900 violations of the Clean Water Act after discharging illegal levels of slaughterhouse waste into the Pagan River in Virginia.[36] Its facilities in North Carolina came under scrutiny in 1999 when Hurricane Floyd flooded lagoons holding fecal matter; many of Smithfield's contract farms were accused of polluting the rivers. Smithfield reached a settlement in 2000 with the state of North Carolina, agreeing to pay the state $50 million over 25 years. The company agreed to donate $1.3 million to clean up; North Carolina State University would receive $15 million to research the treatment of pig waste; and the North Carolina Foundation for Soil and Water Conservation, Ducks Unlimited and the North Carolina Coastal Federation would receive grants.[37][6]:7
According to Ralph Deptolla of Smithfield Foods, the company created new executive positions to monitor the environmental issues, and hired Dennis Treacy, a former director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, as Executive Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer. Treacy had previously been involved in the enforcement efforts against Smithfield. Deptolla writes that Smithfield also created an environmental management system (ESM), launching it in 2001 at its Murphy-Brown facilities.[6]:9
In 2005 the company received ISO 14001 certification from the International Organization for Standardization for its hog production and processing facilities in the U.S., with the exception of new acquisitions, and, in 2009, 14 plants in the U.S. and 21 in Romania received certification.[38] Deptolla writes that 578 Smithfield facilities were ISO 14001-certified as of 2011.[6]:9 In 2006 its hog-production subsidiary Murphy-Brown reached an agreement with the Waterkeeper Alliance, once one of Smithfield's biggest critics, to adopt new measures to enhance environmental protection at the former's facilities in North Carolina.[39][40] In 2009 the company said it had reduced greenhouse gas emissions at its plants by four percent since 2007, its processing emissions per 100 pounds of production by 62 percent, and its first-processing emissions per animal by 41 percent. Smithfield attributed the improvements to the divestiture of the beef group.[41] In 2010 it released its ninth annual Corporate Social Responsibility report, and announced its appointment of a chief sustainability officer and two sustainability committees.[42]
Use of antibiotics[edit]
Concerns were raised about the use by the company and its contractors of low doses of antibiotics to promote the pigs' growth, in addition to using antibiotics as part of a treatment regime. The concern was that the antibiotics were harmful to the animals and were contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.[6]:8 Smithfield said in 2005 that it would administer antibiotics only to animals who were sick themselves, or who were in close proximity to sick animals; however, in Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations all pigs are in close proximity to each other.[43]
Operations in Mexico[edit]
The earliest confirmed case of the H1N1 virus (swine flu) during the 2009 flu pandemic was in a five-year-old boy in La Gloria, Mexico, near several facilities operated by Granjas Carroll de Mexico, a Smithfield Foods subsidiary that processes 1.2 million pigs a year and employs 907 people.[23][44][45][46] This, together with tension between the company and local community over Smithfield's environmental record, prompted several newspapers to link the outbreak to Smithfield's farming practices. According to The Washington Post, over 600 other residents of La Gloria became ill from a respiratory disease in March that year (later thought to be seasonal flu). The Post writes that health officials found no link between the farms and the H1N1 outbreak.[23] Smithfield said that it had found no clinical signs of swine flu in its pigs or employees in Mexico, and had no reason to believe that the outbreak was connected to its Mexican facilities. The company said it routinely administers flu virus vaccine to its swine herds in Mexico and conducts monthly tests to detect the virus.[47]
Residents alleged that the company regularly violates local environmental regulations.[48][49] According to the Washington Post, local farmers had complained for years about headaches from the smell of the pig farms and said that wild dogs had been eating discarded pig carcasses. Smithfield was using biodigesters to convert dead pigs into renewable energy, but residents alleged that they regularly overflowed. Residents also feared that the waste stored in the lagoons would leak into the groundwater.[23]
Packaging reduction[edit]
In 2009 Armour-Eckrich introduced smaller crescent-style packaging for its smoked sausages, which reduced the plastic film and corrugated cardboard the company used by over 840,000 pounds per year. In 2010 the John Morrell plant in Sioux Falls, SD, reduced its use of plastic by 40,600 pounds a year, and Farmland Foods reduced the corrugated packaging entering waste streams by over five million pounds a year. Smithfield Packing used 17 percent less plastic for deli meat. The company also eliminated 20,000 pounds of corrugated material a year by using smaller boxes to transport chicken frankfurters to its largest customer.[41]
2010 Humane Society investigation[edit]
In December 2010 the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) released an undercover video taken by one of its investigators inside a Smithfield Foods facility.[29] The investigator had worked for a month at Murphy-Brown, a Smithfield subsidiary in Waverly, Virginia.[50] The Associated Press (AP) reported that the investigator videotaped 1,000 sows living in gestation crates. According to the AP, the material shows a pig being pulled by the snout, shot in the head with a stun gun, and thrown into a bin while trying to wriggle free. The investigator said he saw sows biting their crates and bleeding; staff jabbing them to make them move; staff tossing piglets into carts; and piglets born prematurely in gestation crates falling through the slats into the manure pits.[51][52] The video won a 2012 Webby Award in the "Public Service and Activism" category.[53]
In response, Smithfield told the AP that it has "zero tolerance for any behavior that does not conform to our established animal well-being procedures".[51] The company asked Temple Grandin, a professor of animal husbandry, to review the footage; she recommended an inspection by animal welfare expert Jennifer Woods.[54][55][56][57][58] Smithfield announced on December 21 that it had fired two workers and their supervisor.[54][59] At the company's invitation, the Virginia state veterinarian Richard Wilkes visited the facility on December 22. He told The Virginian-Pilot that Smithfield had been "very responsive and very responsible in how they've addressed the issues", and that he had not seen "any indication of abuse" of the pigs and was impressed by their demeanor. A Humane Society spokesman said that Smithfield had provided the vet "with a pre-announced, white glove tour".[60]
Legal and labor issues[edit]
Working conditions[edit]
Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a 175-page report in 2005 documenting what it said were unsafe work conditions in the U.S. meat and poultry industry. In particular, the report said, workers make thousands of repetitive motions with knives during each shift, leading to lacerations and repetitive strain injuries. According to HRW, the workers' immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions. The report cited working conditions in Smithfield Foods as an example.[61][62][6]:8 According to the report, the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers. A Smithfield manager testified in 1998, during an unfair labor practices trial, that at the Tar Heel plant in North Carolina it takes between five and ten minutes to slaughter and complete the process of "disassembly" of an animal, including draining, cleaning, and cleaving. One worker told HRW that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives, which means harder cuts have to be made, with the resultant injuries to workers.[62]:4[63] Similar criticism was made by other groups about Smithfield facilities in Poland and Romania.[6]:8

The Smithfield Packing plant in Tar Heel, North Carolina, was the site of a long dispute between the company and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW), which had tried since the early 1990s to organize the plant's roughly 5,000 hourly workers.[64] Workers voted against the union in 1994 and 1997, but the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleged that unfair election conduct had occurred and ordered a new election. During the 1997 election the company is alleged to have fired workers who supported the union, stationed police at the plant gates, and threatened plant closures. In 2000, according to Human Rights Watch, Smithfield set up its own security force with "special police agency" status under North Carolina law, and in 2003 arrested workers who supported the union.[61]
Smithfield appealed the NLRB's ruling that the 1997 election was invalid, and, in 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of the NLRB.[65] After demonstrations, lockouts, and a shareholder meeting that was disrupted by shareholders supporting the union, the UFCW called for a boycott of Smithfield products. In October 2007, Smithfield countered by filing a federal RICO Act lawsuit against UFCW.[64] In October 2008, the UFCW and Smithfield reached an agreement, under which the union agreed to suspend its boycott campaign in return for the company dropping its RICO lawsuit and allowing another election. In December 2008, workers voted 2,041 to 1,879 in favor of joining the UFCW, bringing the 15-year fight to an end.[66]
Justice Department penalty[edit]
In January 2009, Smithfield was assessed a $900,000 penalty by the U.S. Justice Department to settle charges that the company engaged in illegal merger activity during its takeover of Premium Standard Farms LLC in 2006.[67]
Philanthropy[edit]
The Smithfield-Luter Foundation, established in 2002, is a non-profit organization that acts as the philanthropic wing of Smithfield Foods, dedicated primarily to providing scholarship opportunities to the children and grandchildren of Smithfield employees. It has given $5 million to Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, to establish the Luter School of Business,[68] and $5 million to the University of Virginia Cancer Center in Charlottesville, Virginia.[69] The Foundation also provides support for its "learners to leaders" programs, begun in 2006, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Denison, Iowa; and Norfolk, Virginia.[70]
Sports sponsorships[edit]
In 2012, Smithfield announced a 15-race sponsorship with Richard Petty Motorsports and driver Aric Almirola driving the #43 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. The sponsorship was increased to 30 races beginning in 2014. Smithfield rotates its brands on the car, featuring Smithfield, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, and Nathan's Famous. It is also the official food of Richmond International Raceway in Henrico County, Virginia about an hour northwest of Smithfield HQ.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Smithfield Foods, Inc. Key Developments

Smithfield Foods, Inc. Introduces New Innovative Venture, Smithfield Bioscience
Apr 12 17
Smithfield Foods, Inc. announced the launch of Smithfield Bioscience, a new strategic platform within the organization that leverages byproducts from the meat production process for the development of pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and medical device solutions. Smithfield is taking a leadership position in developing these types of cutting edge initiatives, which support a range of biotechnology solutions in areas of human therapeutics, tissue fabrication and regenerative medicine. Smithfield sells byproducts to pharmaceutical and nutraceutical companies who use these materials to develop drugs that treat a range of issues, from indigestion, to hypothyroidism, to deep vein thrombosis. Smithfield Bioscience will expand upon these efforts by exploring new methods and technologies for addressing concerns such as tissue regeneration and the availability of viable human organs for transplantation. This dedicated team is solely focused on the responsible and transparent pursuit of these science-based endeavors. One of Smithfield Bioscience's first projects is the participation in the Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute (ARMI), a public-private U.S. manufacturing initiative that brings together 100 organizations across academia, advanced robotics and pharmaceutical to develop next-generation technologies and manufacturing processes for cells, tissue and organ development. With funding from the Department of Defense, the consortium is initially focused on technologies that would enable the repair and replacement of human tissue of soldiers injured in combat. Smithfield Bioscience is also working with Harvard Medical School and Columbia University on the research and development of immunology therapies.

Smithfield Foods, Inc., is a meat-processing company headquartered in Smithfield, Virginia, in the United States. The company runs facilities in 26 U.S. states—including the largest slaughterhouse and meat-processing plant in the world, located in Tar Heel, North Carolina[2]—as well as in Mexico and 10 European countries. Founded in the U.S., Smithfield was purchased in 2013, for more than its market value, by the Chinese holding company Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd.[3][4] Now known as WH Group, Shuanghui Group is the world's largest pork producer and processor. It was the largest Chinese acquisition of an American company at the time,[3] and Smithfield's 146,000 acres of farmland made Shuanghui one of the largest overseas owners of U.S. agricultural land.[5] As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees around the world and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1]
The company was founded in 1936 by Joseph W. Luter and his son as the Smithfield Packing Company, now its largest subsidiary. From 1981, it began to purchase companies such as Eckrich, Farmland Foods of Kansas; Gwaltney of Smithfield; John Morrell; Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina; and Premium Standard Farms.[6]:6 The company was able to grow as a result of its highly industrialized pig production, raising the animals using a vertical integration system of production that enables it to control the animals' development from conception to packing. Thousands of livestock are permanently confined in barns with metal roofs, known as concentrated animal feeding operations.[7]
As of 2006 Smithfield raised 15 million pigs a year and processed 27 million, producing over six billion pounds of pork.[8] It was the top pig slaughter operation in the United States in 2007, at 114,300 pigs a day, and along with three other companies slaughtered 56 percent of the cattle processed there until it sold its beef group in 2008.[9][a] Smithfield sells its products under several brand names, including Cook's Ham, Gwaltney, John Morrell, Krakus Ham, Patrick Cudahy, Smithfield, and Stefano's.[10] Kenneth M. Sullivan has been the president and chief executive officer since 2015.[11]

Company profile[edit]
The company traces its history to 1936, when Joseph W. Luter, Sr. and his son, Joseph W. Luter, Jr., opened the Smithfield Packing Company in Smithfield, Virginia. The latter served as chief executive officer (CEO) until his death in 1962. A grandson, Joseph W. Luter III, joined the company the same year, and in 1966 became chairman and CEO until Smithfield was taken over by Liberty Equities in 1969. The company hired Luter again as CEO in 1975 when it found itself in financial difficulties; his restructuring of the company is credited with its improved performance.[2] His son, Joseph W. Luter IV, became an executive vice president of Smithfield Foods and president of the Smithfield Packing Company, the parent company's largest subsidiary.[10]
Smithfield began to expand in 1981 with its purchase of its main competitor, Gwaltney of Smithfield. This was followed by the acquisition of almost 40 companies in the pork, beef, and livestock industries between 1981 and around 2008.[12] The company Patrick Cudahy was purchased in 1984 and Schluderberg-Kurdle in 1986.[10] In 1992 Smithfield opened the world's largest processing plant, a 973,000-square-foot facility in Tar Heel, North Carolina, which by 2000 could process 32,000 pigs a day.[7]
Smithfield purchased John Morrell & Co in Sioux Falls, SD, in 1995 and Circle Four Farms in 1998. In 1999 it bought two of the largest pig producers in the United States: Carroll's Foods and Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina, at that point the largest producer. According to agricultural researchers Jill Hobbs and Linda Young, Smithfield's purchase of these companies constituted a major structural change in the U.S. pig industry.[13] Farmland Foods of Kansas City was added in 2003, as were Sara Lee's European Meats, ConAgra Foods Refrigerated Meats, Butterball (the poultry producer), and Premium Standard Farms in 2007.[10][14] The company sold its 49 percent share in Butterball in 2008 for an estimated $175 million.[15] The acquisitions caused concern among regulators in the United States regarding the company's control of the food supply. After Smithfield's purchase of Murphy Family Farms, the Agriculture Department described it as "absurdly big".[7] As of 2006 four companies—Smithfield, Tyson, Swift & Company, and Cargill—were responsible for the production of 70 percent of pork in the United States.[12]
On May 29, 2013, Shuanghui Group, also known as the Shineway Group, the largest meat producer in China, announced a purchase of Smithfield Foods, Inc., for $4.72 billion.[16] Shuanghui announced that it would list Smithfield on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after completing the takeover.[17] On September 6, 2013, the U.S. government approved Shuanghui International Holding’s purchase of Smithfield Food, Inc. The deal was valued at approximately $7.1 billion. It was the largest stock acquisition by a Chinese company of an American company.[18]
As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees in the United States, Mexico and Europe, and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1] It raises 15.8 million pigs a year, producing 3.8 billion pounds of fresh pork and 2.7 billion pounds of packaged meat, sold as 50 brands of pork products and 200 other foods.[19] Along with specialty brands such as the Paula Deen Collection and Weight Watchers, the company's 12 core brands are Armour, Carando, Cook's Ham, Curly's Foods, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, Healthy Ones, John Morrell, Kretschmar, Margherita, and Smithfield.[20] The company also operates The Genuine Smithfield Ham Shoppe and a restaurant, Taste of Smithfield, both in Smithfield, Virginia.[21]
Pig production[edit]
Vertical integration[edit]
Further information: Vertical Integration
In 1990 the company bought hog-farming operations, making it a vertically integrated company. The system allows Smithfield to control every stage of pig production, from conception and birth to slaughter, processing and packing—known as "from squeal to meal" or "from birth to bacon". Joseph W. Luter III said that this produces "high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics." Luter has said that "vertical integration gives you high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics. And the only way to do that is to control the process from the farm to the packing plant."[7] According to Tyya N. Turner, the company obtained 2,000 pigs and the right to their genetic lines from Britain's National Pig Development Company in 1990, and used them to create Smithfield Lean Generation Pork, which was certified by the American Heart Association for its low fat, salt, and cholesterol content. According to Luter, it was vertical integration that enabled this.[2]
Housing and lagoons[edit]
The pigs are housed together in their thousands in identical barns with metal roofs, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[22] The floors of the buildings are slatted, allowing waste to be flushed into 30-feet-deep open-air pits the size of two football fields, referred to within the industry as lagoons. Smithfield says the lagoons contain an impervious liner made to withstand leakage.[23][23] According to Jeff Tietz, writing for Rolling Stone, the waste—a mixture of excrement, urine, blood, afterbirths, stillborn pigs, drugs and other chemicals—overflows when it rains, and the liners can be punctured by rocks.[8] Smithfield attributes the pink color of the waste to the health of the lagoons, writing that the color is "a sign of bacteria doing what it should be doing. It's indicative of lower odor and lower nutrient content".[24]
Pregnant sows[edit]




Sows used for breeding are confined in 7 ft x 2 ft gestation crates.[25] This image was taken inside a Smithfield facility in Virginia in 2010.


Smithfield said in December 2011 that it would phase out gestation crates on its company-owned farms by 2017 in the United States,[26][27] and by 2022 in Europe and Mexico.[28] Pregnant sows spend most of their lives in these stalls, which are too small to allow them to turn around.[29] When they give birth, they are moved to a farrowing crate for three weeks, then artificially inseminated and placed back into a gestation crate.[30] The practice has led to criticism from animal welfare groups, supermarket chains and McDonald's.[29]
Smithfield said in 2007 that it would phase out gestation crates by 2017,[31] but in 2009 said it would not meet the timeline because of operating losses caused by the recession.[32][33] In January 2015 it said that 71.3 percent of pregnant sows on its company-owned farms had been moved into group housing and out of the crates.[34] It would not commit to requiring its contract farms, where almost half its sows live, to phase out the crates.[35][34]
Environmental and animal welfare record[edit]
Emissions[edit]
Smithfield has come under criticism for the millions of gallons of untreated fecal matter it produces and stores in the lagoons. In a four-year period in North Carolina in the 1990s, 4.7 million gallons of hog fecal matter were released into the state's rivers. Workers and residents near Smithfield plants reported health problems and complained about the stench of hog feces.[8]
The company was fined $12.6 million in 1997 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for 6,900 violations of the Clean Water Act after discharging illegal levels of slaughterhouse waste into the Pagan River in Virginia.[36] Its facilities in North Carolina came under scrutiny in 1999 when Hurricane Floyd flooded lagoons holding fecal matter; many of Smithfield's contract farms were accused of polluting the rivers. Smithfield reached a settlement in 2000 with the state of North Carolina, agreeing to pay the state $50 million over 25 years. The company agreed to donate $1.3 million to clean up; North Carolina State University would receive $15 million to research the treatment of pig waste; and the North Carolina Foundation for Soil and Water Conservation, Ducks Unlimited and the North Carolina Coastal Federation would receive grants.[37][6]:7
According to Ralph Deptolla of Smithfield Foods, the company created new executive positions to monitor the environmental issues, and hired Dennis Treacy, a former director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, as Executive Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer. Treacy had previously been involved in the enforcement efforts against Smithfield. Deptolla writes that Smithfield also created an environmental management system (ESM), launching it in 2001 at its Murphy-Brown facilities.[6]:9
In 2005 the company received ISO 14001 certification from the International Organization for Standardization for its hog production and processing facilities in the U.S., with the exception of new acquisitions, and, in 2009, 14 plants in the U.S. and 21 in Romania received certification.[38] Deptolla writes that 578 Smithfield facilities were ISO 14001-certified as of 2011.[6]:9 In 2006 its hog-production subsidiary Murphy-Brown reached an agreement with the Waterkeeper Alliance, once one of Smithfield's biggest critics, to adopt new measures to enhance environmental protection at the former's facilities in North Carolina.[39][40] In 2009 the company said it had reduced greenhouse gas emissions at its plants by four percent since 2007, its processing emissions per 100 pounds of production by 62 percent, and its first-processing emissions per animal by 41 percent. Smithfield attributed the improvements to the divestiture of the beef group.[41] In 2010 it released its ninth annual Corporate Social Responsibility report, and announced its appointment of a chief sustainability officer and two sustainability committees.[42]
Use of antibiotics[edit]
Concerns were raised about the use by the company and its contractors of low doses of antibiotics to promote the pigs' growth, in addition to using antibiotics as part of a treatment regime. The concern was that the antibiotics were harmful to the animals and were contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.[6]:8 Smithfield said in 2005 that it would administer antibiotics only to animals who were sick themselves, or who were in close proximity to sick animals; however, in Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations all pigs are in close proximity to each other.[43]
Operations in Mexico[edit]
The earliest confirmed case of the H1N1 virus (swine flu) during the 2009 flu pandemic was in a five-year-old boy in La Gloria, Mexico, near several facilities operated by Granjas Carroll de Mexico, a Smithfield Foods subsidiary that processes 1.2 million pigs a year and employs 907 people.[23][44][45][46] This, together with tension between the company and local community over Smithfield's environmental record, prompted several newspapers to link the outbreak to Smithfield's farming practices. According to The Washington Post, over 600 other residents of La Gloria became ill from a respiratory disease in March that year (later thought to be seasonal flu). The Post writes that health officials found no link between the farms and the H1N1 outbreak.[23] Smithfield said that it had found no clinical signs of swine flu in its pigs or employees in Mexico, and had no reason to believe that the outbreak was connected to its Mexican facilities. The company said it routinely administers flu virus vaccine to its swine herds in Mexico and conducts monthly tests to detect the virus.[47]
Residents alleged that the company regularly violates local environmental regulations.[48][49] According to the Washington Post, local farmers had complained for years about headaches from the smell of the pig farms and said that wild dogs had been eating discarded pig carcasses. Smithfield was using biodigesters to convert dead pigs into renewable energy, but residents alleged that they regularly overflowed. Residents also feared that the waste stored in the lagoons would leak into the groundwater.[23]
Packaging reduction[edit]
In 2009 Armour-Eckrich introduced smaller crescent-style packaging for its smoked sausages, which reduced the plastic film and corrugated cardboard the company used by over 840,000 pounds per year. In 2010 the John Morrell plant in Sioux Falls, SD, reduced its use of plastic by 40,600 pounds a year, and Farmland Foods reduced the corrugated packaging entering waste streams by over five million pounds a year. Smithfield Packing used 17 percent less plastic for deli meat. The company also eliminated 20,000 pounds of corrugated material a year by using smaller boxes to transport chicken frankfurters to its largest customer.[41]
2010 Humane Society investigation[edit]
In December 2010 the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) released an undercover video taken by one of its investigators inside a Smithfield Foods facility.[29] The investigator had worked for a month at Murphy-Brown, a Smithfield subsidiary in Waverly, Virginia.[50] The Associated Press (AP) reported that the investigator videotaped 1,000 sows living in gestation crates. According to the AP, the material shows a pig being pulled by the snout, shot in the head with a stun gun, and thrown into a bin while trying to wriggle free. The investigator said he saw sows biting their crates and bleeding; staff jabbing them to make them move; staff tossing piglets into carts; and piglets born prematurely in gestation crates falling through the slats into the manure pits.[51][52] The video won a 2012 Webby Award in the "Public Service and Activism" category.[53]
In response, Smithfield told the AP that it has "zero tolerance for any behavior that does not conform to our established animal well-being procedures".[51] The company asked Temple Grandin, a professor of animal husbandry, to review the footage; she recommended an inspection by animal welfare expert Jennifer Woods.[54][55][56][57][58] Smithfield announced on December 21 that it had fired two workers and their supervisor.[54][59] At the company's invitation, the Virginia state veterinarian Richard Wilkes visited the facility on December 22. He told The Virginian-Pilot that Smithfield had been "very responsive and very responsible in how they've addressed the issues", and that he had not seen "any indication of abuse" of the pigs and was impressed by their demeanor. A Humane Society spokesman said that Smithfield had provided the vet "with a pre-announced, white glove tour".[60]
Legal and labor issues[edit]
Working conditions[edit]
Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a 175-page report in 2005 documenting what it said were unsafe work conditions in the U.S. meat and poultry industry. In particular, the report said, workers make thousands of repetitive motions with knives during each shift, leading to lacerations and repetitive strain injuries. According to HRW, the workers' immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions. The report cited working conditions in Smithfield Foods as an example.[61][62][6]:8 According to the report, the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers. A Smithfield manager testified in 1998, during an unfair labor practices trial, that at the Tar Heel plant in North Carolina it takes between five and ten minutes to slaughter and complete the process of "disassembly" of an animal, including draining, cleaning, and cleaving. One worker told HRW that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives, which means harder cuts have to be made, with the resultant injuries to workers.[62]:4[63] Similar criticism was made by other groups about Smithfield facilities in Poland and Romania.[6]:8

The Smithfield Packing plant in Tar Heel, North Carolina, was the site of a long dispute between the company and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW), which had tried since the early 1990s to organize the plant's roughly 5,000 hourly workers.[64] Workers voted against the union in 1994 and 1997, but the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleged that unfair election conduct had occurred and ordered a new election. During the 1997 election the company is alleged to have fired workers who supported the union, stationed police at the plant gates, and threatened plant closures. In 2000, according to Human Rights Watch, Smithfield set up its own security force with "special police agency" status under North Carolina law, and in 2003 arrested workers who supported the union.[61]
Smithfield appealed the NLRB's ruling that the 1997 election was invalid, and, in 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of the NLRB.[65] After demonstrations, lockouts, and a shareholder meeting that was disrupted by shareholders supporting the union, the UFCW called for a boycott of Smithfield products. In October 2007, Smithfield countered by filing a federal RICO Act lawsuit against UFCW.[64] In October 2008, the UFCW and Smithfield reached an agreement, under which the union agreed to suspend its boycott campaign in return for the company dropping its RICO lawsuit and allowing another election. In December 2008, workers voted 2,041 to 1,879 in favor of joining the UFCW, bringing the 15-year fight to an end.[66]
Justice Department penalty[edit]
In January 2009, Smithfield was assessed a $900,000 penalty by the U.S. Justice Department to settle charges that the company engaged in illegal merger activity during its takeover of Premium Standard Farms LLC in 2006.[67]
Philanthropy[edit]
The Smithfield-Luter Foundation, established in 2002, is a non-profit organization that acts as the philanthropic wing of Smithfield Foods, dedicated primarily to providing scholarship opportunities to the children and grandchildren of Smithfield employees. It has given $5 million to Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, to establish the Luter School of Business,[68] and $5 million to the University of Virginia Cancer Center in Charlottesville, Virginia.[69] The Foundation also provides support for its "learners to leaders" programs, begun in 2006, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Denison, Iowa; and Norfolk, Virginia.[70]
Sports sponsorships[edit]
In 2012, Smithfield announced a 15-race sponsorship with Richard Petty Motorsports and driver Aric Almirola driving the #43 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. The sponsorship was increased to 30 races beginning in 2014. Smithfield rotates its brands on the car, featuring Smithfield, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, and Nathan's Famous. It is also the official food of Richmond International Raceway in Henrico County, Virginia about an hour northwest of Smithfield HQ.

Smithfield Foods, Inc. Key Developments

Smithfield Foods, Inc. Introduces New Innovative Venture, Smithfield Bioscience
Apr 12 17
Smithfield Foods, Inc. announced the launch of Smithfield Bioscience, a new strategic platform within the organization that leverages byproducts from the meat production process for the development of pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and medical device solutions. Smithfield is taking a leadership position in developing these types of cutting edge initiatives, which support a range of biotechnology solutions in areas of human therapeutics, tissue fabrication and regenerative medicine. Smithfield sells byproducts to pharmaceutical and nutraceutical companies who use these materials to develop drugs that treat a range of issues, from indigestion, to hypothyroidism, to deep vein thrombosis. Smithfield Bioscience will expand upon these efforts by exploring new methods and technologies for addressing concerns such as tissue regeneration and the availability of viable human organs for transplantation. This dedicated team is solely focused on the responsible and transparent pursuit of these science-based endeavors. One of Smithfield Bioscience's first projects is the participation in the Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute (ARMI), a public-private U.S. manufacturing initiative that brings together 100 organizations across academia, advanced robotics and pharmaceutical to develop next-generation technologies and manufacturing processes for cells, tissue and organ development. With funding from the Department of Defense, the consortium is initially focused on technologies that would enable the repair and replacement of human tissue of soldiers injured in combat. Smithfield Bioscience is also working with Harvard Medical School and Columbia University on the research and development of immunology therapies.

Smithfield Foods, Inc., is a meat-processing company headquartered in Smithfield, Virginia, in the United States. The company runs facilities in 26 U.S. states—including the largest slaughterhouse and meat-processing plant in the world, located in Tar Heel, North Carolina[2]—as well as in Mexico and 10 European countries. Founded in the U.S., Smithfield was purchased in 2013, for more than its market value, by the Chinese holding company Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd.[3][4] Now known as WH Group, Shuanghui Group is the world's largest pork producer and processor. It was the largest Chinese acquisition of an American company at the time,[3] and Smithfield's 146,000 acres of farmland made Shuanghui one of the largest overseas owners of U.S. agricultural land.[5] As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees around the world and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1]
The company was founded in 1936 by Joseph W. Luter and his son as the Smithfield Packing Company, now its largest subsidiary. From 1981, it began to purchase companies such as Eckrich, Farmland Foods of Kansas; Gwaltney of Smithfield; John Morrell; Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina; and Premium Standard Farms.[6]:6 The company was able to grow as a result of its highly industrialized pig production, raising the animals using a vertical integration system of production that enables it to control the animals' development from conception to packing. Thousands of livestock are permanently confined in barns with metal roofs, known as concentrated animal feeding operations.[7]
As of 2006 Smithfield raised 15 million pigs a year and processed 27 million, producing over six billion pounds of pork.[8] It was the top pig slaughter operation in the United States in 2007, at 114,300 pigs a day, and along with three other companies slaughtered 56 percent of the cattle processed there until it sold its beef group in 2008.[9][a] Smithfield sells its products under several brand names, including Cook's Ham, Gwaltney, John Morrell, Krakus Ham, Patrick Cudahy, Smithfield, and Stefano's.[10] Kenneth M. Sullivan has been the president and chief executive officer since 2015.[11]

Company profile[edit]
The company traces its history to 1936, when Joseph W. Luter, Sr. and his son, Joseph W. Luter, Jr., opened the Smithfield Packing Company in Smithfield, Virginia. The latter served as chief executive officer (CEO) until his death in 1962. A grandson, Joseph W. Luter III, joined the company the same year, and in 1966 became chairman and CEO until Smithfield was taken over by Liberty Equities in 1969. The company hired Luter again as CEO in 1975 when it found itself in financial difficulties; his restructuring of the company is credited with its improved performance.[2] His son, Joseph W. Luter IV, became an executive vice president of Smithfield Foods and president of the Smithfield Packing Company, the parent company's largest subsidiary.[10]
Smithfield began to expand in 1981 with its purchase of its main competitor, Gwaltney of Smithfield. This was followed by the acquisition of almost 40 companies in the pork, beef, and livestock industries between 1981 and around 2008.[12] The company Patrick Cudahy was purchased in 1984 and Schluderberg-Kurdle in 1986.[10] In 1992 Smithfield opened the world's largest processing plant, a 973,000-square-foot facility in Tar Heel, North Carolina, which by 2000 could process 32,000 pigs a day.[7]
Smithfield purchased John Morrell & Co in Sioux Falls, SD, in 1995 and Circle Four Farms in 1998. In 1999 it bought two of the largest pig producers in the United States: Carroll's Foods and Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina, at that point the largest producer. According to agricultural researchers Jill Hobbs and Linda Young, Smithfield's purchase of these companies constituted a major structural change in the U.S. pig industry.[13] Farmland Foods of Kansas City was added in 2003, as were Sara Lee's European Meats, ConAgra Foods Refrigerated Meats, Butterball (the poultry producer), and Premium Standard Farms in 2007.[10][14] The company sold its 49 percent share in Butterball in 2008 for an estimated $175 million.[15] The acquisitions caused concern among regulators in the United States regarding the company's control of the food supply. After Smithfield's purchase of Murphy Family Farms, the Agriculture Department described it as "absurdly big".[7] As of 2006 four companies—Smithfield, Tyson, Swift & Company, and Cargill—were responsible for the production of 70 percent of pork in the United States.[12]
On May 29, 2013, Shuanghui Group, also known as the Shineway Group, the largest meat producer in China, announced a purchase of Smithfield Foods, Inc., for $4.72 billion.[16] Shuanghui announced that it would list Smithfield on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after completing the takeover.[17] On September 6, 2013, the U.S. government approved Shuanghui International Holding’s purchase of Smithfield Food, Inc. The deal was valued at approximately $7.1 billion. It was the largest stock acquisition by a Chinese company of an American company.[18]
As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees in the United States, Mexico and Europe, and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1] It raises 15.8 million pigs a year, producing 3.8 billion pounds of fresh pork and 2.7 billion pounds of packaged meat, sold as 50 brands of pork products and 200 other foods.[19] Along with specialty brands such as the Paula Deen Collection and Weight Watchers, the company's 12 core brands are Armour, Carando, Cook's Ham, Curly's Foods, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, Healthy Ones, John Morrell, Kretschmar, Margherita, and Smithfield.[20] The company also operates The Genuine Smithfield Ham Shoppe and a restaurant, Taste of Smithfield, both in Smithfield, Virginia.[21]
Pig production[edit]
Vertical integration[edit]
Further information: Vertical Integration
In 1990 the company bought hog-farming operations, making it a vertically integrated company. The system allows Smithfield to control every stage of pig production, from conception and birth to slaughter, processing and packing—known as "from squeal to meal" or "from birth to bacon". Joseph W. Luter III said that this produces "high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics." Luter has said that "vertical integration gives you high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics. And the only way to do that is to control the process from the farm to the packing plant."[7] According to Tyya N. Turner, the company obtained 2,000 pigs and the right to their genetic lines from Britain's National Pig Development Company in 1990, and used them to create Smithfield Lean Generation Pork, which was certified by the American Heart Association for its low fat, salt, and cholesterol content. According to Luter, it was vertical integration that enabled this.[2]
Housing and lagoons[edit]
The pigs are housed together in their thousands in identical barns with metal roofs, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[22] The floors of the buildings are slatted, allowing waste to be flushed into 30-feet-deep open-air pits the size of two football fields, referred to within the industry as lagoons. Smithfield says the lagoons contain an impervious liner made to withstand leakage.[23][23] According to Jeff Tietz, writing for Rolling Stone, the waste—a mixture of excrement, urine, blood, afterbirths, stillborn pigs, drugs and other chemicals—overflows when it rains, and the liners can be punctured by rocks.[8] Smithfield attributes the pink color of the waste to the health of the lagoons, writing that the color is "a sign of bacteria doing what it should be doing. It's indicative of lower odor and lower nutrient content".[24]
Pregnant sows[edit]




Sows used for breeding are confined in 7 ft x 2 ft gestation crates.[25] This image was taken inside a Smithfield facility in Virginia in 2010.


Smithfield said in December 2011 that it would phase out gestation crates on its company-owned farms by 2017 in the United States,[26][27] and by 2022 in Europe and Mexico.[28] Pregnant sows spend most of their lives in these stalls, which are too small to allow them to turn around.[29] When they give birth, they are moved to a farrowing crate for three weeks, then artificially inseminated and placed back into a gestation crate.[30] The practice has led to criticism from animal welfare groups, supermarket chains and McDonald's.[29]
Smithfield said in 2007 that it would phase out gestation crates by 2017,[31] but in 2009 said it would not meet the timeline because of operating losses caused by the recession.[32][33] In January 2015 it said that 71.3 percent of pregnant sows on its company-owned farms had been moved into group housing and out of the crates.[34] It would not commit to requiring its contract farms, where almost half its sows live, to phase out the crates.[35][34]
Environmental and animal welfare record[edit]
Emissions[edit]
Smithfield has come under criticism for the millions of gallons of untreated fecal matter it produces and stores in the lagoons. In a four-year period in North Carolina in the 1990s, 4.7 million gallons of hog fecal matter were released into the state's rivers. Workers and residents near Smithfield plants reported health problems and complained about the stench of hog feces.[8]
The company was fined $12.6 million in 1997 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for 6,900 violations of the Clean Water Act after discharging illegal levels of slaughterhouse waste into the Pagan River in Virginia.[36] Its facilities in North Carolina came under scrutiny in 1999 when Hurricane Floyd flooded lagoons holding fecal matter; many of Smithfield's contract farms were accused of polluting the rivers. Smithfield reached a settlement in 2000 with the state of North Carolina, agreeing to pay the state $50 million over 25 years. The company agreed to donate $1.3 million to clean up; North Carolina State University would receive $15 million to research the treatment of pig waste; and the North Carolina Foundation for Soil and Water Conservation, Ducks Unlimited and the North Carolina Coastal Federation would receive grants.[37][6]:7
According to Ralph Deptolla of Smithfield Foods, the company created new executive positions to monitor the environmental issues, and hired Dennis Treacy, a former director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, as Executive Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer. Treacy had previously been involved in the enforcement efforts against Smithfield. Deptolla writes that Smithfield also created an environmental management system (ESM), launching it in 2001 at its Murphy-Brown facilities.[6]:9
In 2005 the company received ISO 14001 certification from the International Organization for Standardization for its hog production and processing facilities in the U.S., with the exception of new acquisitions, and, in 2009, 14 plants in the U.S. and 21 in Romania received certification.[38] Deptolla writes that 578 Smithfield facilities were ISO 14001-certified as of 2011.[6]:9 In 2006 its hog-production subsidiary Murphy-Brown reached an agreement with the Waterkeeper Alliance, once one of Smithfield's biggest critics, to adopt new measures to enhance environmental protection at the former's facilities in North Carolina.[39][40] In 2009 the company said it had reduced greenhouse gas emissions at its plants by four percent since 2007, its processing emissions per 100 pounds of production by 62 percent, and its first-processing emissions per animal by 41 percent. Smithfield attributed the improvements to the divestiture of the beef group.[41] In 2010 it released its ninth annual Corporate Social Responsibility report, and announced its appointment of a chief sustainability officer and two sustainability committees.[42]
Use of antibiotics[edit]
Concerns were raised about the use by the company and its contractors of low doses of antibiotics to promote the pigs' growth, in addition to using antibiotics as part of a treatment regime. The concern was that the antibiotics were harmful to the animals and were contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.[6]:8 Smithfield said in 2005 that it would administer antibiotics only to animals who were sick themselves, or who were in close proximity to sick animals; however, in Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations all pigs are in close proximity to each other.[43]
Operations in Mexico[edit]
The earliest confirmed case of the H1N1 virus (swine flu) during the 2009 flu pandemic was in a five-year-old boy in La Gloria, Mexico, near several facilities operated by Granjas Carroll de Mexico, a Smithfield Foods subsidiary that processes 1.2 million pigs a year and employs 907 people.[23][44][45][46] This, together with tension between the company and local community over Smithfield's environmental record, prompted several newspapers to link the outbreak to Smithfield's farming practices. According to The Washington Post, over 600 other residents of La Gloria became ill from a respiratory disease in March that year (later thought to be seasonal flu). The Post writes that health officials found no link between the farms and the H1N1 outbreak.[23] Smithfield said that it had found no clinical signs of swine flu in its pigs or employees in Mexico, and had no reason to believe that the outbreak was connected to its Mexican facilities. The company said it routinely administers flu virus vaccine to its swine herds in Mexico and conducts monthly tests to detect the virus.[47]
Residents alleged that the company regularly violates local environmental regulations.[48][49] According to the Washington Post, local farmers had complained for years about headaches from the smell of the pig farms and said that wild dogs had been eating discarded pig carcasses. Smithfield was using biodigesters to convert dead pigs into renewable energy, but residents alleged that they regularly overflowed. Residents also feared that the waste stored in the lagoons would leak into the groundwater.[23]
Packaging reduction[edit]
In 2009 Armour-Eckrich introduced smaller crescent-style packaging for its smoked sausages, which reduced the plastic film and corrugated cardboard the company used by over 840,000 pounds per year. In 2010 the John Morrell plant in Sioux Falls, SD, reduced its use of plastic by 40,600 pounds a year, and Farmland Foods reduced the corrugated packaging entering waste streams by over five million pounds a year. Smithfield Packing used 17 percent less plastic for deli meat. The company also eliminated 20,000 pounds of corrugated material a year by using smaller boxes to transport chicken frankfurters to its largest customer.[41]
2010 Humane Society investigation[edit]
In December 2010 the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) released an undercover video taken by one of its investigators inside a Smithfield Foods facility.[29] The investigator had worked for a month at Murphy-Brown, a Smithfield subsidiary in Waverly, Virginia.[50] The Associated Press (AP) reported that the investigator videotaped 1,000 sows living in gestation crates. According to the AP, the material shows a pig being pulled by the snout, shot in the head with a stun gun, and thrown into a bin while trying to wriggle free. The investigator said he saw sows biting their crates and bleeding; staff jabbing them to make them move; staff tossing piglets into carts; and piglets born prematurely in gestation crates falling through the slats into the manure pits.[51][52] The video won a 2012 Webby Award in the "Public Service and Activism" category.[53]
In response, Smithfield told the AP that it has "zero tolerance for any behavior that does not conform to our established animal well-being procedures".[51] The company asked Temple Grandin, a professor of animal husbandry, to review the footage; she recommended an inspection by animal welfare expert Jennifer Woods.[54][55][56][57][58] Smithfield announced on December 21 that it had fired two workers and their supervisor.[54][59] At the company's invitation, the Virginia state veterinarian Richard Wilkes visited the facility on December 22. He told The Virginian-Pilot that Smithfield had been "very responsive and very responsible in how they've addressed the issues", and that he had not seen "any indication of abuse" of the pigs and was impressed by their demeanor. A Humane Society spokesman said that Smithfield had provided the vet "with a pre-announced, white glove tour".[60]
Legal and labor issues[edit]
Working conditions[edit]
Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a 175-page report in 2005 documenting what it said were unsafe work conditions in the U.S. meat and poultry industry. In particular, the report said, workers make thousands of repetitive motions with knives during each shift, leading to lacerations and repetitive strain injuries. According to HRW, the workers' immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions. The report cited working conditions in Smithfield Foods as an example.[61][62][6]:8 According to the report, the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers. A Smithfield manager testified in 1998, during an unfair labor practices trial, that at the Tar Heel plant in North Carolina it takes between five and ten minutes to slaughter and complete the process of "disassembly" of an animal, including draining, cleaning, and cleaving. One worker told HRW that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives, which means harder cuts have to be made, with the resultant injuries to workers.[62]:4[63] Similar criticism was made by other groups about Smithfield facilities in Poland and Romania.[6]:8
Union dispute[edit]

The Smithfield Packing plant in Tar Heel, North Carolina, was the site of a long dispute between the company and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW), which had tried since the early 1990s to organize the plant's roughly 5,000 hourly workers.[64] Workers voted against the union in 1994 and 1997, but the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleged that unfair election conduct had occurred and ordered a new election. During the 1997 election the company is alleged to have fired workers who supported the union, stationed police at the plant gates, and threatened plant closures. In 2000, according to Human Rights Watch, Smithfield set up its own security force with "special police agency" status under North Carolina law, and in 2003 arrested workers who supported the union.[61]
Smithfield appealed the NLRB's ruling that the 1997 election was invalid, and, in 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of the NLRB.[65] After demonstrations, lockouts, and a shareholder meeting that was disrupted by shareholders supporting the union, the UFCW called for a boycott of Smithfield products. In October 2007, Smithfield countered by filing a federal RICO Act lawsuit against UFCW.[64] In October 2008, the UFCW and Smithfield reached an agreement, under which the union agreed to suspend its boycott campaign in return for the company dropping its RICO lawsuit and allowing another election. In December 2008, workers voted 2,041 to 1,879 in favor of joining the UFCW, bringing the 15-year fight to an end.[66]
Justice Department penalty[edit]
In January 2009, Smithfield was assessed a $900,000 penalty by the U.S. Justice Department to settle charges that the company engaged in illegal merger activity during its takeover of Premium Standard Farms LLC in 2006.[67]
Philanthropy[edit]
The Smithfield-Luter Foundation, established in 2002, is a non-profit organization that acts as the philanthropic wing of Smithfield Foods, dedicated primarily to providing scholarship opportunities to the children and grandchildren of Smithfield employees. It has given $5 million to Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, to establish the Luter School of Business,[68] and $5 million to the University of Virginia Cancer Center in Charlottesville, Virginia.[69] The Foundation also provides support for its "learners to leaders" programs, begun in 2006, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Denison, Iowa; and Norfolk, Virginia.[70]
Sports sponsorships[edit]
In 2012, Smithfield announced a 15-race sponsorship with Richard Petty Motorsports and driver Aric Almirola driving the #43 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. The sponsorship was increased to 30 races beginning in 2014. Smithfield rotates its brands on the car, featuring Smithfield, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, and Nathan's Famous. It is also the official food of Richmond International Raceway in Henrico County, Virginia about an hour northwest of Smithfield HQ.

Smithfield Foods, Inc., is a meat-processing company headquartered in Smithfield, Virginia, in the United States. The company runs facilities in 26 U.S. states—including the largest slaughterhouse and meat-processing plant in the world, located in Tar Heel, North Carolina[2]—as well as in Mexico and 10 European countries. Founded in the U.S., Smithfield was purchased in 2013, for more than its market value, by the Chinese holding company Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd.[3][4] Now known as WH Group, Shuanghui Group is the world's largest pork producer and processor. It was the largest Chinese acquisition of an American company at the time,[3] and Smithfield's 146,000 acres of farmland made Shuanghui one of the largest overseas owners of U.S. agricultural land.[5] As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees around the world and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1]
The company was founded in 1936 by Joseph W. Luter and his son as the Smithfield Packing Company, now its largest subsidiary. From 1981, it began to purchase companies such as Eckrich, Farmland Foods of Kansas; Gwaltney of Smithfield; John Morrell; Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina; and Premium Standard Farms.[6]:6 The company was able to grow as a result of its highly industrialized pig production, raising the animals using a vertical integration system of production that enables it to control the animals' development from conception to packing. Thousands of livestock are permanently confined in barns with metal roofs, known as concentrated animal feeding operations.[7]
As of 2006 Smithfield raised 15 million pigs a year and processed 27 million, producing over six billion pounds of pork.[8] It was the top pig slaughter operation in the United States in 2007, at 114,300 pigs a day, and along with three other companies slaughtered 56 percent of the cattle processed there until it sold its beef group in 2008.[9][a] Smithfield sells its products under several brand names, including Cook's Ham, Gwaltney, John Morrell, Krakus Ham, Patrick Cudahy, Smithfield, and Stefano's.[10] Kenneth M. Sullivan has been the president and chief executive officer since 2015.[11]

Company profile[edit]
The company traces its history to 1936, when Joseph W. Luter, Sr. and his son, Joseph W. Luter, Jr., opened the Smithfield Packing Company in Smithfield, Virginia. The latter served as chief executive officer (CEO) until his death in 1962. A grandson, Joseph W. Luter III, joined the company the same year, and in 1966 became chairman and CEO until Smithfield was taken over by Liberty Equities in 1969. The company hired Luter again as CEO in 1975 when it found itself in financial difficulties; his restructuring of the company is credited with its improved performance.[2] His son, Joseph W. Luter IV, became an executive vice president of Smithfield Foods and president of the Smithfield Packing Company, the parent company's largest subsidiary.[10]
Smithfield began to expand in 1981 with its purchase of its main competitor, Gwaltney of Smithfield. This was followed by the acquisition of almost 40 companies in the pork, beef, and livestock industries between 1981 and around 2008.[12] The company Patrick Cudahy was purchased in 1984 and Schluderberg-Kurdle in 1986.[10] In 1992 Smithfield opened the world's largest processing plant, a 973,000-square-foot facility in Tar Heel, North Carolina, which by 2000 could process 32,000 pigs a day.[7]
Smithfield purchased John Morrell & Co in Sioux Falls, SD, in 1995 and Circle Four Farms in 1998. In 1999 it bought two of the largest pig producers in the United States: Carroll's Foods and Murphy Family Farms of North Carolina, at that point the largest producer. According to agricultural researchers Jill Hobbs and Linda Young, Smithfield's purchase of these companies constituted a major structural change in the U.S. pig industry.[13] Farmland Foods of Kansas City was added in 2003, as were Sara Lee's European Meats, ConAgra Foods Refrigerated Meats, Butterball (the poultry producer), and Premium Standard Farms in 2007.[10][14] The company sold its 49 percent share in Butterball in 2008 for an estimated $175 million.[15] The acquisitions caused concern among regulators in the United States regarding the company's control of the food supply. After Smithfield's purchase of Murphy Family Farms, the Agriculture Department described it as "absurdly big".[7] As of 2006 four companies—Smithfield, Tyson, Swift & Company, and Cargill—were responsible for the production of 70 percent of pork in the United States.[12]
On May 29, 2013, Shuanghui Group, also known as the Shineway Group, the largest meat producer in China, announced a purchase of Smithfield Foods, Inc., for $4.72 billion.[16] Shuanghui announced that it would list Smithfield on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after completing the takeover.[17] On September 6, 2013, the U.S. government approved Shuanghui International Holding’s purchase of Smithfield Food, Inc. The deal was valued at approximately $7.1 billion. It was the largest stock acquisition by a Chinese company of an American company.[18]
As of 2016 Smithfield had 50,200 employees in the United States, Mexico and Europe, and an annual revenue of $14 billion.[1] It raises 15.8 million pigs a year, producing 3.8 billion pounds of fresh pork and 2.7 billion pounds of packaged meat, sold as 50 brands of pork products and 200 other foods.[19] Along with specialty brands such as the Paula Deen Collection and Weight Watchers, the company's 12 core brands are Armour, Carando, Cook's Ham, Curly's Foods, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, Healthy Ones, John Morrell, Kretschmar, Margherita, and Smithfield.[20] The company also operates The Genuine Smithfield Ham Shoppe and a restaurant, Taste of Smithfield, both in Smithfield, Virginia.[21]
Pig production[edit]
Vertical integration[edit]
Further information: Vertical Integration
In 1990 the company bought hog-farming operations, making it a vertically integrated company. The system allows Smithfield to control every stage of pig production, from conception and birth to slaughter, processing and packing—known as "from squeal to meal" or "from birth to bacon". Joseph W. Luter III said that this produces "high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics." Luter has said that "vertical integration gives you high quality, consistent products with consistent genetics. And the only way to do that is to control the process from the farm to the packing plant."[7] According to Tyya N. Turner, the company obtained 2,000 pigs and the right to their genetic lines from Britain's National Pig Development Company in 1990, and used them to create Smithfield Lean Generation Pork, which was certified by the American Heart Association for its low fat, salt, and cholesterol content. According to Luter, it was vertical integration that enabled this.[2]
Housing and lagoons[edit]
The pigs are housed together in their thousands in identical barns with metal roofs, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).[22] The floors of the buildings are slatted, allowing waste to be flushed into 30-feet-deep open-air pits the size of two football fields, referred to within the industry as lagoons. Smithfield says the lagoons contain an impervious liner made to withstand leakage.[23][23] According to Jeff Tietz, writing for Rolling Stone, the waste—a mixture of excrement, urine, blood, afterbirths, stillborn pigs, drugs and other chemicals—overflows when it rains, and the liners can be punctured by rocks.[8] Smithfield attributes the pink color of the waste to the health of the lagoons, writing that the color is "a sign of bacteria doing what it should be doing. It's indicative of lower odor and lower nutrient content".[24]
Pregnant sows[edit]




Sows used for breeding are confined in 7 ft x 2 ft gestation crates.[25] This image was taken inside a Smithfield facility in Virginia in 2010.


Smithfield said in December 2011 that it would phase out gestation crates on its company-owned farms by 2017 in the United States,[26][27] and by 2022 in Europe and Mexico.[28] Pregnant sows spend most of their lives in these stalls, which are too small to allow them to turn around.[29] When they give birth, they are moved to a farrowing crate for three weeks, then artificially inseminated and placed back into a gestation crate.[30] The practice has led to criticism from animal welfare groups, supermarket chains and McDonald's.[29]
Smithfield said in 2007 that it would phase out gestation crates by 2017,[31] but in 2009 said it would not meet the timeline because of operating losses caused by the recession.[32][33] In January 2015 it said that 71.3 percent of pregnant sows on its company-owned farms had been moved into group housing and out of the crates.[34] It would not commit to requiring its contract farms, where almost half its sows live, to phase out the crates.[35][34]
Environmental and animal welfare record[edit]
Emissions[edit]
Smithfield has come under criticism for the millions of gallons of untreated fecal matter it produces and stores in the lagoons. In a four-year period in North Carolina in the 1990s, 4.7 million gallons of hog fecal matter were released into the state's rivers. Workers and residents near Smithfield plants reported health problems and complained about the stench of hog feces.[8]
The company was fined $12.6 million in 1997 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for 6,900 violations of the Clean Water Act after discharging illegal levels of slaughterhouse waste into the Pagan River in Virginia.[36] Its facilities in North Carolina came under scrutiny in 1999 when Hurricane Floyd flooded lagoons holding fecal matter; many of Smithfield's contract farms were accused of polluting the rivers. Smithfield reached a settlement in 2000 with the state of North Carolina, agreeing to pay the state $50 million over 25 years. The company agreed to donate $1.3 million to clean up; North Carolina State University would receive $15 million to research the treatment of pig waste; and the North Carolina Foundation for Soil and Water Conservation, Ducks Unlimited and the North Carolina Coastal Federation would receive grants.[37][6]:7
According to Ralph Deptolla of Smithfield Foods, the company created new executive positions to monitor the environmental issues, and hired Dennis Treacy, a former director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, as Executive Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer. Treacy had previously been involved in the enforcement efforts against Smithfield. Deptolla writes that Smithfield also created an environmental management system (ESM), launching it in 2001 at its Murphy-Brown facilities.[6]:9
In 2005 the company received ISO 14001 certification from the International Organization for Standardization for its hog production and processing facilities in the U.S., with the exception of new acquisitions, and, in 2009, 14 plants in the U.S. and 21 in Romania received certification.[38] Deptolla writes that 578 Smithfield facilities were ISO 14001-certified as of 2011.[6]:9 In 2006 its hog-production subsidiary Murphy-Brown reached an agreement with the Waterkeeper Alliance, once one of Smithfield's biggest critics, to adopt new measures to enhance environmental protection at the former's facilities in North Carolina.[39][40] In 2009 the company said it had reduced greenhouse gas emissions at its plants by four percent since 2007, its processing emissions per 100 pounds of production by 62 percent, and its first-processing emissions per animal by 41 percent. Smithfield attributed the improvements to the divestiture of the beef group.[41] In 2010 it released its ninth annual Corporate Social Responsibility report, and announced its appointment of a chief sustainability officer and two sustainability committees.[42]
Use of antibiotics[edit]
Concerns were raised about the use by the company and its contractors of low doses of antibiotics to promote the pigs' growth, in addition to using antibiotics as part of a treatment regime. The concern was that the antibiotics were harmful to the animals and were contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.[6]:8 Smithfield said in 2005 that it would administer antibiotics only to animals who were sick themselves, or who were in close proximity to sick animals; however, in Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations all pigs are in close proximity to each other.[43]
Operations in Mexico[edit]
The earliest confirmed case of the H1N1 virus (swine flu) during the 2009 flu pandemic was in a five-year-old boy in La Gloria, Mexico, near several facilities operated by Granjas Carroll de Mexico, a Smithfield Foods subsidiary that processes 1.2 million pigs a year and employs 907 people.[23][44][45][46] This, together with tension between the company and local community over Smithfield's environmental record, prompted several newspapers to link the outbreak to Smithfield's farming practices. According to The Washington Post, over 600 other residents of La Gloria became ill from a respiratory disease in March that year (later thought to be seasonal flu). The Post writes that health officials found no link between the farms and the H1N1 outbreak.[23] Smithfield said that it had found no clinical signs of swine flu in its pigs or employees in Mexico, and had no reason to believe that the outbreak was connected to its Mexican facilities. The company said it routinely administers flu virus vaccine to its swine herds in Mexico and conducts monthly tests to detect the virus.[47]
Residents alleged that the company regularly violates local environmental regulations.[48][49] According to the Washington Post, local farmers had complained for years about headaches from the smell of the pig farms and said that wild dogs had been eating discarded pig carcasses. Smithfield was using biodigesters to convert dead pigs into renewable energy, but residents alleged that they regularly overflowed. Residents also feared that the waste stored in the lagoons would leak into the groundwater.[23]
Packaging reduction[edit]
In 2009 Armour-Eckrich introduced smaller crescent-style packaging for its smoked sausages, which reduced the plastic film and corrugated cardboard the company used by over 840,000 pounds per year. In 2010 the John Morrell plant in Sioux Falls, SD, reduced its use of plastic by 40,600 pounds a year, and Farmland Foods reduced the corrugated packaging entering waste streams by over five million pounds a year. Smithfield Packing used 17 percent less plastic for deli meat. The company also eliminated 20,000 pounds of corrugated material a year by using smaller boxes to transport chicken frankfurters to its largest customer.[41]
2010 Humane Society investigation[edit]
In December 2010 the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) released an undercover video taken by one of its investigators inside a Smithfield Foods facility.[29] The investigator had worked for a month at Murphy-Brown, a Smithfield subsidiary in Waverly, Virginia.[50] The Associated Press (AP) reported that the investigator videotaped 1,000 sows living in gestation crates. According to the AP, the material shows a pig being pulled by the snout, shot in the head with a stun gun, and thrown into a bin while trying to wriggle free. The investigator said he saw sows biting their crates and bleeding; staff jabbing them to make them move; staff tossing piglets into carts; and piglets born prematurely in gestation crates falling through the slats into the manure pits.[51][52] The video won a 2012 Webby Award in the "Public Service and Activism" category.[53]
In response, Smithfield told the AP that it has "zero tolerance for any behavior that does not conform to our established animal well-being procedures".[51] The company asked Temple Grandin, a professor of animal husbandry, to review the footage; she recommended an inspection by animal welfare expert Jennifer Woods.[54][55][56][57][58] Smithfield announced on December 21 that it had fired two workers and their supervisor.[54][59] At the company's invitation, the Virginia state veterinarian Richard Wilkes visited the facility on December 22. He told The Virginian-Pilot that Smithfield had been "very responsive and very responsible in how they've addressed the issues", and that he had not seen "any indication of abuse" of the pigs and was impressed by their demeanor. A Humane Society spokesman said that Smithfield had provided the vet "with a pre-announced, white glove tour".[60]
Legal and labor issues[edit]
Working conditions[edit]
Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a 175-page report in 2005 documenting what it said were unsafe work conditions in the U.S. meat and poultry industry. In particular, the report said, workers make thousands of repetitive motions with knives during each shift, leading to lacerations and repetitive strain injuries. According to HRW, the workers' immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions. The report cited working conditions in Smithfield Foods as an example.[61][62][6]:8 According to the report, the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers. A Smithfield manager testified in 1998, during an unfair labor practices trial, that at the Tar Heel plant in North Carolina it takes between five and ten minutes to slaughter and complete the process of "disassembly" of an animal, including draining, cleaning, and cleaving. One worker told HRW that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives, which means harder cuts have to be made, with the resultant injuries to workers.[62]:4[63] Similar criticism was made by other groups about Smithfield facilities in Poland and Romania.[6]:8

The Smithfield Packing plant in Tar Heel, North Carolina, was the site of a long dispute between the company and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW), which had tried since the early 1990s to organize the plant's roughly 5,000 hourly workers.[64] Workers voted against the union in 1994 and 1997, but the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleged that unfair election conduct had occurred and ordered a new election. During the 1997 election the company is alleged to have fired workers who supported the union, stationed police at the plant gates, and threatened plant closures. In 2000, according to Human Rights Watch, Smithfield set up its own security force with "special police agency" status under North Carolina law, and in 2003 arrested workers who supported the union.[61]
Smithfield appealed the NLRB's ruling that the 1997 election was invalid, and, in 2006, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of the NLRB.[65] After demonstrations, lockouts, and a shareholder meeting that was disrupted by shareholders supporting the union, the UFCW called for a boycott of Smithfield products. In October 2007, Smithfield countered by filing a federal RICO Act lawsuit against UFCW.[64] In October 2008, the UFCW and Smithfield reached an agreement, under which the union agreed to suspend its boycott campaign in return for the company dropping its RICO lawsuit and allowing another election. In December 2008, workers voted 2,041 to 1,879 in favor of joining the UFCW, bringing the 15-year fight to an end.[66]
Justice Department penalty[edit]
In January 2009, Smithfield was assessed a $900,000 penalty by the U.S. Justice Department to settle charges that the company engaged in illegal merger activity during its takeover of Premium Standard Farms LLC in 2006.[67]
Philanthropy[edit]
The Smithfield-Luter Foundation, established in 2002, is a non-profit organization that acts as the philanthropic wing of Smithfield Foods, dedicated primarily to providing scholarship opportunities to the children and grandchildren of Smithfield employees. It has given $5 million to Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, to establish the Luter School of Business,[68] and $5 million to the University of Virginia Cancer Center in Charlottesville, Virginia.[69] The Foundation also provides support for its "learners to leaders" programs, begun in 2006, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Denison, Iowa; and Norfolk, Virginia.[70]
Sports sponsorships[edit]
In 2012, Smithfield announced a 15-race sponsorship with Richard Petty Motorsports and driver Aric Almirola driving the #43 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. The sponsorship was increased to 30 races beginning in 2014. Smithfield rotates its brands on the car, featuring Smithfield, Eckrich, Farmland, Gwaltney, and Nathan's Famous. It is also the official food of Richmond International Raceway in Henrico County, Virginia about an hour northwest of Smithfield HQ.

Smithfield Foods Introduces Pure Farms™ Antibiotic-Free Product Line




















February 20, 2017 11:00 ET

SMITHFIELD, Va., Feb.  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Smithfield Foods, Inc. announced the launch of an antibiotic-free line of fresh pork products under its Pure Farms™ brand. The Pure Farms™ product line meets the highest level of USDA standards with minimal processing and no antibiotics, steroids, hormones or artificial ingredients. The full line of products will be available in fresh pork cuts, ham cuts and packaged pork cuts such as breakfast sausage and bacon in both retail stores and food service beginning this month. “The Pure Farms™ brand is ideal for families looking to enjoy the highest quality, antibiotic-free pork,” said Ken Sullivan, president and chief executive officer for Smithfield Foods. “We’re proud to provide our customers and consumers with a broader range of products to meet a variety of needs and preferences, including antibiotic-free.” As the only company in the industry to report antibiotics usage since 2007, this new product line further affirms Smithfield’s continued leadership of practices that uphold highest standards of transparency and strengthen consumer trust. Smithfield also recently refined its definition of ‘prevention’ as related to antibiotics use in farm animals, providing a practical explanation to consumers and customers that offers greater clarity. These efforts are driven by an internal antibiotics task force, which supports Smithfield’s commitment to industry-leading antibiotics initiatives. “This new line from Pure Farms™ reflects Smithfield’s continued commitment to meeting the needs of all consumers with good food that is made the right way,” said Stewart Leeth, vice president of regulatory affairs and chief sustainability officer for Smithfield Foods. “This commitment led to the creation of this new line and other bold steps we continue to take to ensure our products exceed our customers’ and consumers’ expectations.” For more information about the all-natural, antibiotic-free product line or the Pure Farms™ brand, please contact FreshPorkSales@Smithfield.com or call 1-855-411-7675.

Complete List of Smithfield Foods Subsidiaries and Brands
June 9, 2013. Smithfield. We all heard the brief media sound bites last week announcing the sale of America’s largest meat producer, Smithfield Foods, to a Chinese corporation. What we didn’t hear were the details, warnings or implications of this record-breaking transfer of US assets to the Peoples Republic of China. Below is a complete list of Smithfield Foods brands and subsidiaries that would be transferred to Chinese ownership. 
China's "River of Dead Pigs". Image courtesy of ScoopIt.com.First, it should be noted that the Chinese buyout of Smithfield Foods is far from assured. The sale must first be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investments, a highly secret federal commission chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury. And if past Chinese offers are any indication, there is little legitimate chance of Smithfield Foods acquisition by China being approved. But with billions of dollars trading hands and Goldman Sachs lurking in the shadows, it might just happen.






Shuanghui International, aka Shineway
Shuanghui International is a pork processing company located in the Peoples Republic of China. It was created in 1958 by local Chinese government agencies to help streamline the production and availability of pork products to the ever-growing Chinese population. In 1984, the company transitioned from a single-location food distributor to what would become the largest food producer in China.
In 2006, the Chinese government sold its ownership share in Shuanghui to an investment partnership led by Goldman Sachs. Soon thereafter, Goldman Sachs sold most of its ownership to other investors, keeping a minority stake for itself. In 2009, with the help of Sachs, the company began talks to buy America’s largest meat producer – Smithfield Foods.
By 2010, Shuanghui was being accused of taking production shortcuts that put the health and lives of the Chinese people in jeopardy. In 2011, Chinese state TV announced that the company had been caught treating its animals with the banned chemical clenbuterol. In the US, Clenbuterol is only approved by the FDA for use in prescription respiratory inhalers like those used by asthma victims. In animals, where its use is banned for human consumption, the drug acts as a stimulant and fat-burner.
On May 29, 2013, Shuanghui announced it had made a $4.7 billion bid to purchase Smithfield Foods. Smithfield’s corporate officers, as well as its investors, stand to make a great deal of money from the sale. The purchase price is 31% more than the corporation’s market value at the time of the announcement.
Promises and safety
The biggest irony of the announced sale is the reasoning being given by corporate spokespeople on both sides of the deal. China’s pork industry has been devastated in recent years by scandals involving tainted meat. Chinese consumers routinely avoid Chinese produced pork in favor of higher priced, but safer, foreign imports. In fact, while the US-China trade deficit has been one-sided in China’s favor for decades, pork is one area where imports outnumber exports in the Communist nation.
So while the Chinese people purchase foreign-produced meats, the Chinese corporation guilty of tainting the country’s meat in the first place buys the foreign pork producers and takes over their operations. One of two scenarios is going to come to fruition. Either US safety standards will prevail and China will have safe pork to consume. Or the US will adopt China’s safety standards and the US meat supply will become tainted.
The empire that is Smithfield Foods
Smithfield Foods is the largest meat producer in the United States. Its corporate family is so large, it’s almost impossible to find a complete list of the corporation’s brands and subsidiaries. But that’s exactly what we at Whiteout Press spent the better part of a week attempting to do. We knew the company was big, but we didn’t know just how big. Remarkably, between part-ownerships and the rapid-fire purchases and sales of smaller companies, it’s difficult to put together an accurate and current list. But we did the best we could.
Our first stop was the Smithfield Foods website. There, the corporation displays ‘Our brands’. But if one were to believe the company, they only have 12. Nowhere on the corporate website is a full list of the company’s brands and subsidiaries.






We next took our search to the Securities and Exchange Commission. There, we found what appeared to be a complete list of Smithfield subsidiaries. Unfortunately, while the SEC does provide a full list of companies owned by the mammoth corporation, it does not include a listing of each of their full assortment of brands.
