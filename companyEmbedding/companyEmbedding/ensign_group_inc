WHO IS THE ENSIGN GROUP

Since 1999, the independent operating affiliates of The Ensign Group (ENSG) have provided communities with compassionate, post-acute care. Each of the 250+ books of business are run independently by over  28,000 employees. We foster an entrepreneurial culture of ownership coupled with a field-driven, flat structure, which empowers local leaders and their teams to provide superior solutions to the specific medical needs of the communities they serve. *
Our affiliated entities offer a broad spectrum of post-acute care including assisted living, skilled nursing, rehabilitative care, home health, home care and hospice.  We believe we exist to dignify and transform post-acute care. Our core values of celebration, accountability, passion for learning, love one another, intelligent risk taking, customer second, and ownership guide us in our decision making and inspire us to be better people, in and out of work.
In recent years, we have significantly expanded our operations. Our affiliated entities are located across more than a dozen states, and we are continuing to grow. With that growth, we are innovating and designing best-practice solutions to lower the cost and improve the quality of our care. We partner with many other healthcare organizations across our service area with the goal of ensuring our patients are receiving the best possible care.

*References herein to the consolidated “company” and “its” assets and activities, as well as the use of the terms “we,” “us,” “its”, “our” and similar verbiage, are not meant to imply that The Ensign Group, Inc. has direct operating assets, employees or revenue, or that any of the affiliated entities, including facilities, home health and hospice businesses, or the Service Center are operated or managed by the same entity.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
Zacks Style Scores Education - Learn more about the Zacks Style Scores


The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

A sector with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.

Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.

In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

About Us – The Ensign Group, Inc.









































 
 






About UsYou are here: Home / About Us
In-House Therapy
Our affiliates provide dedicated full-time in-house therapy teams—no outside contractors or agencies—so guests can rely on getting to know the same caring therapists for the duration of their stay. We work with each guest, their family and their healthcare provider to determine the best care and treatment plans. No matter your health needs, our rehabilitation team is ready to help you make a successful recovery.
The therapy staff is a major part of the foundation of our care. Each therapist is passionate about bringing the latest techniques and programs to our guests. Through continuing education and training, our therapists ensure a sold continuity between therapy and nursing care.

Skilled Nursing
Providing the best care possible dictates that Caregivers be empowered to make decisions—in many cases, every second counts. We leave the critical decisions to those who know best: the Caregivers, Doctors, and Nurses who work with the residents and patients 24-hours a day, 7-days a week.
It’s important to us that patients, as well as their family members, feel loved, informed and secure during their stay. Quality of life is just as important as quality of care in a skilled nursing facility! Our affiliates work hard to keep guests happy and comfortable, and guests have consistently shown greater motivation in achieving their goals as a result. If there’s a special need or request, the Team Member has authority to act upon it.

Senior Living
Our affiliated Assisted Living and Independent Living communities offer a wide range of lifestyle options so you can live the way you want to live. The caring and experienced staff are dedicated to making each community a place you will be delighted to call home.
Independent Living provides all of the benefits of being in your own home, without all the worry of maintenance, chores, and cooking. Each community offers a wide variety of services and features to help you maximize your independence. With no buy-in fees and convenient month-to-month leasing, residents have flexibility and freedom should their needs change.
For those residents needing an extra helping hand with their activities of daily living, Certified Assisted Living Care Givers provide both full and partial assisted living services. With a focus on individual wellness, we encourage continued independence with a tailored plan of assistance.

Home Health & Hospice
The mission of our Home, Health & Hospice affiliates is to achieve exceptional care in the patient’s home so the patient is able to remain safely at home to heal or age in place. No matter how complex or simple the medical issue at hand, experienced and specially trained professionals will create carefully crafted treatment plans with the goal of achieving the best outcome.
Our Hospice care affiliates provide physical, emotional, social and spiritual support to clients with a life-limiting, progressive illness; they provide exceptional levels of comfort, compassion, expertise and comprehensive care as they seek to make certain the lives of the patients they serve are lived with quality and dignity.
