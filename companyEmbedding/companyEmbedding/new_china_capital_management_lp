		 | 
	


 
		Cathay generally acquires meaningful minority equity positions in companies with proven management, strategically valuable market positions and successful operations. Cathay typically provides growth capital to companies seeking to expand operations across a wide range of industries.
 
		Cathay prefers domestically-focused companies, operating within ��basic industries�� such as consumer products, financial services, media and advertising, infrastructure, transportation, natural resources, chemicals, technology, pharmaceuticals, property development, light manufacturing and heavy industry. Investment sizes generally range from US$8 to $80 million. Cathay's target investment period ranges from 3 to 10 years.
 
		Cathay takes a "hands-on" approach, providing ongoing advice and assistance to entrepreneurs on corporate, strategic and capital market issues to help companies best utilize their capital in order to expand operations and to prepare for a capital market transaction. Cathay��s team includes experienced operational experts, entrepreneurs, and former senior managers of multinational and local businesses in China. 
 
		Cathay's investment model is to develop close relationships with management and to align incentive structures so as to ensure that both management and financial investors benefit from the successful growth and ultimate realization of value following the achievement of a capital event such as an IPO or trade sale.

		Cathay holds particular expertise in realizing successful capital market transactions for its portfolio companies. In 2007 alone, Cathay completed five IPOs of its portfolio companies on international stock exchanges.
 
		Cathay first helps its portfolio companies maximize capital market valuations through building strategic value and expanding operations. Cathay then assists its companies to secure the best available underwriters and works with management to initiate, manage and complete a capital event according to company needs and existing market conditions. Cathay's in-house team includes former investment bankers, lawyers, management consultants and accountants.
 
		After a capital event, Cathay continues to provide strategic advice to its portfolio companies to maximize shareholder value. Cathay IPOs are managed by top underwriters including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, and JP Morgan. 
 
		Consistent with Cathay's reputation in the marketplace, IPOs of Cathay portfolio companies are generally over-subscribed and priced at the top end of the target range.
 
		Since 1992, founders and management of Cathay portfolio companies have achieved personal value of well over US$2 billion in capital events facilitated by Cathay.
