FDA Soon to Prohibit Certain Omega-3 Fatty Acid Health Claims 
Companies marketing their Omega-3 products as a "high source" of DHA/EPA will likely have to modify their promotional messaging. Beacause the FDA has not yet established a reference of nutrient levels for DHA/EPA, it is recommended that marketers use percentage statements or qualified health claims for their Omega-3 products instead.

Can Vitamin D Help Lower Blood Pressure?
Early research published in the European Journal of Epidemiology found that oral ingestion of Vitamin D3 over the course of 3 months may help lower systolic blood pressure in certain populations. More studies linking Vitamin D consumption and and reduced blood pressure are needed before marketers can safely make those claims.

Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

EMUAID® Delivers Rapid, Natural Relief for Hidradenitis Suppurativa*

 

 

About Hidradenitis Suppurativa Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a non-contagious, recurrent skin condition or disease. Treatments for HS range from antibiotics to topical ointments. Hidradenitis suppurativa typically manifests as a progression from single boil-like, pus-filled abscesses, or hard sebaceous lumps, to painful, severe, deep-seated and often inflamed clusters of lesions with chronic seepage (suppuration) involving significant scarring. Hidradenitis Suppurativa is often misdiagnosed. It is difficult to treat, and currently there is no known cure.

TREATMENT OF HIDRADENITIS SUPPURATIVA A hidradenitis diagnosis can come based on severe symptoms or more mild symptoms. If the hidradenitis suppurativa disease becomes too severe, treatment could include carbon dioxide laser surgery or other ongoing surgical procedures. Antibiotics taken by mouth can be beneficial, and topical ointments can be another helpful treatment for the disease. Hidradenitis suppurativa patients with severe symptoms are constantly looking for treatment options. A visit to the clinic may not be enough to identify all the drugs and treatment methods necessary, but continual and diligent searching will help those who suffer from hidradenitis suppurativa find treatments that work.
EMUAID® is a revolutionary modern homeopathic topical ointment formulated with powerful natural ingredients and rare growth factor stimulators that work together to alleviate irritation, calm inflammation across a variety of disorders and provide symptomatic relief for damaged and resistant skin conditions, including the symptoms associated with hidradenitis suppurativa .

CALMS INFLAMMATION, ITCHING, PAIN AND DISCOMFORT* Upon application, the powerful natural ingredients in EMUAID® Ointment begin to soothe the skin to calm inflammation, surface pressure, pain and discomfort, regardless of your diagnosis. This makes your skin more comfortable throughout the healing process and also helps the boil to drain. The soothing homeopathic and anti-inflammatory ingredients in EMUAID® Ointment offer relief on contact to calm inflammation and relieve itching, rash and discomfort.* Each of the ingredients in EMUAID® was selected based upon having long histories and clinical support of providing outstanding benefits in skin therapy.

SPEEDS UP HEALING OF DAMAGED SKIN AND IS A PREVENTATIVE SCAR TREATMENT Any time the skin is damaged by a lesion or boil, there is a potential for scarring or permanent blemish. EMUAID® stimulates blood flow to rapidly promote the growth of new healthy skin cells and prevent scar tissue from forming.

MEDICAL GRADE INGREDIENTS TREAT SECONDARY INFECTION EMUAID® naturally fights most harmful bacteria (Staphylococcus and other common bacteria) on the skin to help prevent potential infection.

COMPLETELY SAFE AND PAINLESS – WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS  Unlike other leading products, EMUAID® has no irritating chemicals or reported side effects. It is 100% natural and can be used safely by the entire family. EMUAID® is unsurpassed in its simplicity and power. You cannot develop resistance to EMUAID® - it will work every time you need it and is backed by our 30-Day Guarantee.

 Dee Y.  -  I have recently been diagnosed with HS, I have been getting boils since a young girl but they haven’t been bad! Last week I developed a boil that was the size of a golf ball , went to the dr that’s when he told me I have HS , never heard of the condition ever! He prescribed a medication that didn’t do anything but make the boil worst. I was in so much pain for about 4 days, I have a 4 month old who is very active I could barley hold or rock him to sleep I was in so much pain. I then came across emuaid , was kind of skeptical at first but nothing else was working so why not give it a shot?! The reviews were great so I order the emuaid max, ordered it Tuesday morning received it Thursday. Started to use it immediately today is Saturday and the boil has already popped ! This was a life saver I was shocked how fast it work ! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!*

 J DAVIS  -  I have been a sufferer of HS for 5 + years. This is the ONLY thing that helps me with pain, inflammation, tenderness. This product will be in my medicine cabinet forever, for any and all skin issues. Thanks Emuaid :)*

 Lorraine M.  -  This is my second order and I am so pleased with this product. It is a life saver for treating my boils. Thank you so much!*

 Joihelene H  -  I’m 47 years old, African American female, single, never married, and no children. I’ve had Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) or Acne Inversa (AI) for about 3 to 4 years. It started very small and has built up to make me very unhappy, frustrated and honestly, depressed about the prospect of romantically socializing. My breakout is located in the pelvis, groin area and under my belly, upper pelvis. I have 3rd stage HS/AI with multiple cysts, many with sinus tracks, deep-seated abscesses. They are located in the inner thighs, vulva and buttocks as well. I do not have many of the cysts coming to head or seeping pus. Most have no seepage or are lightly bloody and/or clear seepage from the large deep-seated abscesses. I was using strong zit gel, zit cleanser, Hibiclens, and polysporin to take care of my breakouts. I stumbled upon a YouTube video of a young lady from Europe talking about your product, Emuaid. At first, I was extremely skeptical about her testimony. Though the video was short, amateurishly crafted, her testimony video rang extremely true to my need. I found myself ordering it and received it in the mail Tuesday evening (August 23, 2016). I used it in only one location to test my reactions around 9pm that night after following the directions. I have extremely sensitivity skin and can have allergic reactions easily, so I wanted to play it safe. I awoke around 2:30am to use the facilities and found that the area I had administered the Emuaid on was much changed. The abscess had had a sinus track creating a new cyst on my outer-thigh. It was now shrunk almost twice in size with the sinus track gone and the new cyst flattened and almost completely disappeared. To say I was amazed and excited is an understatement! I immediately started using it all over my pelvis area, including my vulva. I had no stinging or ill results. In fact, the total opposite! It was cooling, soothing, and felt healing immediately. I am totally amazed at your product. I wish I had known about it sooner. I would love to show you pictures but of course, I can’t due to the breakout location. But I want you to know that I’m telling all my clinician friends about this AMAZING product and all that it can do for skin issues, especially ones as serious as HS/AI. Last week, I had finally gone to a Dermatologist who had recommended putting me on a very strong drug. It has horrible side effects and my instincts told me to not to take it. I’m a singer and voice artist and taking that medicine would have been harmful to my voice instrument. After consulting two pharmacists, two nurse practitioners, and a few nurse friends, I decided not to take it and told the Dermatologist. I’m so glad that in the meantime, I discovered Emuaid instead. THANK YOU! I have a background in marketing. If you would like to utilize me as a spokesperson, please let me know! I would like to help others who have suffered like I have to know about this product.*

 Robert V.  -  I have H.S. I’ve had it for years. I’m seeing to specialist for this problem with no positive results. I received emuaidmax and started using it I got immediate results.

Today we had a Doctor appoinment , she was so surprise how it got better, she took me to the computer to show me the picture from last week and now what a different, I just have to tell her about your cream, she said , she never heard about this cream.
I strongly recomend r*

 david j  -  It is the only meds that i have ever found that totally works. the shopping exp, was awesome thanks*

 Mia  -  I do not regret buying this product. I had an out of control boil on my armpit. It was going to be some time yet before the Doctor was able to see me and I hate going to the ER. I saw this item online and thought, “what do I have to lose?” I received it and started using it. Not only did it bring it to a head and opened, it also dried it out. I will definitely reorder and make sure it is always in my medicine cabinet. Love it.*

 Maggie T.  -  This stuff is so good. I got the extra strength this time. I am assured that it will work as well or better. Nothing I have tried before worked until I discovered this product. It’s a miracle in a jar.*

  Loetitia  -  Best treatment I have ever found in 40 years to calm HS flares…………..It’s GREAT!*

  Anonymous Customer  -  Words cannot explain!! I have HS and although their is no known cure, this has done wonders to my flare ups! It brought immediate relief.*

 Nicole  -  So Ive been using it for almost two weeks now. Here are my findings. I decided in the beginning to pick an area and stick with that area. Well that didnt last because I started to flare in another spot and Emuaid makes it feel so much better. I had one start to come up in my butt crack (sorry for the verbage) yesterday and I applied it 3 times and this morning it was down and less tender. The spot I originally started to focus on was my lower tummy where I have one that constantly fills and is hard under the skin with some mild sinus tracking. Seems as though the Emuad has not only made the hardness under my skin in that particulaar area soften and condense in size, but also repairing the skin and its color from the scaring. (we all love those purple scars) My right armpit (the lesser affected one by HS) had some mild scaring and bumps are completely gone!!! Now to work on my left armpit (its the worst) with a lesion that never goes away. Emu Aid makes that lesion feel better but I know its going to take time on that to go away. I am happy with the results, and Im thinking it helps my purple scars too!! No, its not a cure all, but a HELPFULL TOOL. If these results continue until the whole free trial tub is gone, I will be a customer for life! I also slather some on in the bad areas b4 excersise to help prevent friction and chaffing and it works wonders. Im estatic for those of you that are on the trial and it is working for you. I know everyone is different and I continue to pray for those with No luck or bad reaction to the product. Hope that u find some thing that works for you soon!!!*

 Alina  -  I’m on day 4 using it at bedtime. I have definitely noticed less inflammation and many of the red areas are now pink — under arms and upper thighs*

 Amber  -  I have been using the product for about a week and a half. I still have not recieved a questionare. I have taken before pics and will take one on fri as it will be the 2 week mark and post them. I have had one flair up since using emuaid because of the stress of changing jobs but it hasn`t been as bad as it usually is and has calmed down much sooner. The redness and inflamation are both more controled it seems, and the pain level is down considerably! I will continue to document and use the product!*

 Kelly  -  I have been using mine for about a week. The extreme itching seems better. The first flare I used it on seemed alot more painful after I applied it. I used it on some areas that felt like they were getting ready to flare and they never did. It doesn’t seem to do much for the active flares.*

 Carletta  -  I’ve been using mine for a week and I’ve noticed a significant change in my groin area. Just got a spot on my belly button to pop up and I started putting it there today.*

 Christine  -  I used it last night for the first time under both arms. Within 20 minutes the pain and most of the swelling had gone down. I now move both arms with out feeling like the skin is going to rip. Also I put in on areas that had already had opened and half way drained.*

 Randi  -  I have only been using the Emuaid and Aleve. It has brought me drastic relief and does help to bring them to a head so I can drain them myself. I love EMUAID!*

 Tammy  -  Excellent
I cant tell you how glad I am that I have found Emuaid. I have Hidradenitis Suppurativa. I received Emuaid in the mail within two days and as soon as I applied it to my out break it helped. The pain stopped and the swelling receded. In about four days all was clear. There is no doubt that I will continue to use Emuaid. Thank you so much! I now have something that will help me with this condition*


“Very seldom do I write reviews, but EMUAID® is really a great product and worth the time and effort. If you suffer from hydranitis suppurativa you must give EMUAID® a try, you’ll be very happy you did. I only wish I had found this earlier! I don’t go anywhere without it. Even though I use it frequently, it lasts a long time, it is natural and doesn’t have side-effects with long-term use.”*
 -Jean S., Omaha NE*

 Jan M.  -  Good product
This product works well on my skin conditions. I originally purchased it for boil relief but also find it helpful for irritated skin and rashes. I would like to have less scent.*

 Glenda  -  Great
I have tried so many different treatments for HS and doctors really dont have a clue about this disease. After alot of searching, I am really glad to have found Emuaid. I am amazed at how fast and effective it is. I’m a believer!*

 Linda  -  I expected to throw this back in my Doctor’s face when it didn’t work, I couldn’t because it worked, I was shocked!
I have a terrible case of H.S. went to a surgeon to have it removed, he said he couldn’t because it was too close to the pelvic bone, it wouldn’t heal. But he told me to get Emuaid and try it. I was mad, thought he was copping out on me, but I was determined to go and get it and show him I tried it and it didn’t work like everything else I tried and then what else would he tell me. The first day of using it, it calmed things down, a week later I wasn’t bleeding and dripping all over the place and then they went down so that they were not hurting, amazing, I laughed and made jokes about it tried it on my brothers mosquito bites, it worked, a friend had a BBQ blow up in her face, she used it and a week later you would never know it had happened. I am on my 4th jar, doesn’t cure it but makes it so much more bareable, and my brother has a jar and my friend who had the BBQ explode on her. I wish it wasn’t as expensive, since I have to use so much of it, or maybe they could have a punch card and after so many jars you get a free one. I am like the man on the Greek Wedding putting Windex on everything, I put Emuaid on everything, and it works!*

 Dawn  -  Loooove this product, it is all it says it is.
I have HS that I have suffered in terrible pain for over 20 years, till I found EMUAID. No pain since. Use as a regimen without fail and you too will have outstanding results. This product is the best I have found and trust me I have tried prescriptions, surgeries as well as over the counter meds. My disease cannot be cured but I think with EMUAID I am as close as it gets. To some it may seem expensive but what is comfort worth to you? Give EMUAID a try you will not regret it. I am just sooooo greatful for this product, the pain is indescribable when HS flares up. I use EMUAID 2-3 times EVERYDAY. I have ordered many jars so far and they will continue to get my business. Blessing in a jar.*

 Christine  -  Life saving!!
I have suffered with Hidradenitis in my groin & upper inner thigh area for 10 + years, this ailment is utterly disgusting, extremely painful and completely embarrassing. About a year ago I bought the biggest jar of Emuaid available. I was a little skeptical, but I have tried every thing in the past to cure this disease, so I said why not? Nothing else worked maybe this stuff will. I am so glad that I did, I use it almost everyday to prevent future flare-ups, not only does this ointment clear it up and heal the area, it keeps it from coming back. I am just so grateful for this company and this product. I can now enjoy wearing a bikini at the pool in the summertime without embarrassment. Plus, I dont have to buy massive amounts of bandages to cover up and prevent leaks (from drainage) and purchase new clothes from the stains from the damage. Well, my first Tub of Emuaid is almost gone, so I just reordered a new one (a year later)! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you so much!*

 Carmen  -  Miraculous ointment!
My son has been suffering from painful, recurrent boils for over 15 years, a friend recommended Emuaid, which she uses for her diabetic mother. My son has been using Emuaid for the past two months and although he still gets breakouts, they are minimized in size, frequency and the healing time has maximized and the pain is minimum! Recently a determatologist was able to diagnose his condition with the grim news that it’s an annoying, incurable chronic condition. With the use of Emuaid, he gets much needed relief for his symptoms, not a cure but finally we found something that helps. In my last order of Emuaid, I order one for myself due to dry/itchy skin due to diabitic. Thank you so much for your product!*

 Brenda  -  This product work extremely well!
I was suprised at how well this product worked. I had been plagued with boils and had not found a product that offered relief until I tried Emuaid. Within a week I could see improvement.*

 Cheryl  -  Our Urgent Need Was Speer Lab’s/Emuaid’s Priority!
My daughter has had HS for 10+ years. I have searched high and low for a product to treat this horrible condition. To date, this is the ONLY product that I have found thus far (symptomatic treatment). My daughter had to have incision and drainage with packing for one of these horrible boils, about the size of a golf ball on the buttocks, with recurrence of the boil within a week. This is when, definitely in a panic, I called and spoke with Speer Labs in an effort to get an expedited shipment of Emuaid. This was shipped as promised expeditiously. (Thank you Monica!) Within 24 hours after application, there was a noticeable difference. Within 48 hours, today, she is still making progress. I hope this continues. I might also add that she is taking the probiotic as well.*

 Ilanhovan  -  It really works…
Hi, i’m from south east Asia. And i’m been suffering from bad HS for last 2 years. And beginning of this year. i’ve developed fistulla at groin area which was very painful and limited all my social activities out there. I almost gave up after the dermalogist to me there is no cure. That’s the time i found Emuaid oilment on the net, and bought 1 jar for trial. I was so happy when the fistulla eventually healed with the application of this oilment and the pain was not there. Emuaid gave me a new life. Even though my HS is not cured and i still have problems with it, this oilment got rid of the fistulla which was a great pain to bear mentally and physically. Now i just started Emuaid First Defense Probiotic supplement, i hope it will give me a good results to cure the HS from inside. To HS sufferers like me, please try out Emuaid, it really works rather than depending on oral supplements from the dermalogist.*

 Joseph  -  Hydradenitis supprativa kept in check with Emuaid!
Finally a product that works, and at a very good price!*

 Linda  -  Used Emuaid once and I love it!!!
Have been suffering from Hidradentis suppurativa and now have found relief! I can’t believe it! I am going to order another bottle.*

 Cynthia  -  Living Again & Loving It!!!
I had been suffering with Hydridentis Supportiva (HS) for over 15 years. I was an extremely active person working out 5 days a week & my favorite hobby was dancing. Well that all changed once I was finally diagnosed with HS. My quality of life was greatly affected. This condition made it painful to wear clothing. The pain & intense itching associated with HS is unbearable. Years of steroids, antibiotics, ice packs & the such all equaled up to the sum of NO RELIEF. Two weeks after I began using Emuaid which I’ve affectionately nicknamed Mu, the itching was significantly decreased . Two months after the flares ups were decreased and now I would say I am in 90% remission. The flares ups are now far & few between, I’m back to working out and I put on clothes to go out dancing. So close to the holidays if you are suffering with HS or any other skin disorder that involves pain & itching and loved ones ask you what they should put in your stocking tell them Emuaid. I would highly recommend you give this a try. EMUAID GAVE ME BACK MY LIFE!!!*

 Nana Yaa  -  God answered my prayers with Emuaid First Aid Ointment
I am about to order the maximum strength first aid Ointment, after 1 day of using the product. I was not happy when I got a small amount of the product, However, the product is an answer to my prayers. It works excellent. I have cystic breast and cyst that becomes boils on my breast very rare condition. It is herediteral. Went on mission and some how the shots caused my rashes to explode and have left open sores. Nothing worked until now. Thank you for creating this product.*

 Dawn  -  EmuAid the HS skin disease relief medicine
Consistent use of Emuaid will result in relief of the most irritating and painful skin diseases. I have had HS for 26 years and have taken all sorts of prescriptions and had surgeries. NOTHING has helped quite like the Emuaid. If you have HS I totally recommend Emuaid. With consistent use you will experience relief from this very painful condition. Give it a try you won’t be sorry. Sounds like some past reviewers were not patient or consistent enough with the use. HS is a very infection ridden skin disease and sometimes the flare ups are very involved. It could take days maybe a couple of weeks with consistent use of Emuaid to experience the real results. I cannot stress enough about the consistent use. HS IS NOT CUREABLE, and Emuaid is not a cure but it SURELY will help the pain and anything is an improvement with as painful as it can be. I will buy this product for the rest of my life………….*

 Alpha  -  Not a cure but a great relief.
I had major surgery to remove a large area polluted with Hidradenitis. Recently the HS has started returning causing large painful boils in my skin. I was extremely skeptical with this product but the price is what I would pay to see a doctor anyway so I took a gamble. The package arrived very quickly and they included the trial pills as well . The smell of the product is of Tea Tree Oil but not as strong. It is not a smell I find offensive but some may. The moment I applied the ointment I felt relief to the area, not a ‘deadened nerve feeling’ but a soothing pain free feeling. It allows me to get through my day without the pain from these boils. It appears to lessen the smaller ones and bring the bigger ones to a head faster. (Sorry for being gross) I am very happy with Emuaid. I don’t guarantee it will work for everyone but that is why they have a great return policy. Give it a try, if it works for you then great! if not then get a refund and try to find something else. Hope this helps.*

 Delores  -  A Miracle for my daughter!!!
My daughter has suffered and I mean suffered from HS for years now. She did ‘t have one day that was pain free. Sometimes she would lay and just cry. I gave Emuaid a shot after reading some very positive reviews. The results for her were truly amazing! Within 48 hours she was pain free. She cried again but with happiness. She is no longer taking pain pills at all! She can move without pain etc. She was skeptical and so quit Emuaid for a few days to test if it really was the Emuaid or not. Her pain came back within about 36 hours. Needless to say she went back on Emuaid and is enjoying life once again pain free. If you haven’t tried Emuaid you must! It truly will change your life! It is worth every penny! I give Emuaid a million stars!!!!*

 HOLLY  -  Life Saver
I am 41 and was recently diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa and have been dealing with scars under my armpits and groin area for the last year. I even had them removed by the doctor just to have them re-appear several weeks later. I was using tea tree oil, neosporin and hydrogen peroxide and no luck. I read about this product online and decided to give it a try and within 2 days of using it the boils burst and swelling went down considerably. This product is remarkable. I would recommend this to anyone suffering from extreme boils. I just purchased the extra strength and the swelling has already gone down within 24 hours. I cross my fingers that this will help treat and heel my skin. So far so good!*

 Laura  -  AMAZING!!
I had my doubts but was ready to try anything. It started working immediately on my boyfriends HS. He has been in pain (itching, burning, etc.) for years and he used it the first day and it worked instantly on his bumps. Then he stopped using it for a couple days because he left it at my house and the itching and soreness came back. Needless to say he has it on him at all times now

CHMP Meetings: A Rare Behind-the-Scenes Look at These Private European Regulatory Meetings
May 8, 2017
The first thing you need to know about CHMP meetings is that they are not public.
Because of this, you can’t  research the meeting by watching a video online or reading a transcript. At the same time, these are extremely high-stakes meetings, where companies present their data and answer questions before a panel of individuals who will likely decide – or at least heavily influence – the future of the company’s product.

Active Listening Can Make You a Better Speaker: Part 2
April 25, 2017
Have you ever heard that “God gave us one mouth and two ears for a reason, so we ought to listen twice as much as we speak”? The old Irish proverb holds true and is now backed up by science. In Part 1 of this blog series, we talked about how effective speakers set up their presentation to help foster active listening. In this blog, we will discuss how speakers can make sure that THEY are actively listening.
Using both ears is just the beginning.

                            "The presentation included excellent examples of a well-prepared company for a successful ad com meeting. If you have never presented at an FDA Advisory Committee meeting, 3D Communications can help prepare you for one of your company's most important steps toward new product introduction."                          
Joe Curtis, RAC
Program Chair
RAPS Boston Chapter





                            "The 3D presentation on preparation for advisory committees was very well received and enjoyed by the Indiana RAPS Chapter. Our feedback forms indicated that it exceeded the expectations of the attendees."                          
Gretchen Miller Bowker, RAC, FRAPS
Chief Operating Officer
Pearl Pathways





                            "3D's roundtable was very informative and insightful on how to take the most advantageous approach to preparing for advisory committee meetings. I would certainly keep 3D Communications on my short list of must have vendors for this very important step in the process of approval. Thank you for your time!"                          
Marian Saxon Rhodes, PhD, RAC







                            "You really whipped us into shape. We all learned a lot about how best to present and defend our position. These important learnings will find applicability beyond yesterday's event."                          
Robert Ashworth
VP of Global Regulatory Affairs
NPS





                            3D Communications was what made the difference.  They know how to tell a credible story that resonates with the FDA Advisory Committee.                          
Lynn Webster, MD
VP Scientific Affairs
PRA Life Sciences





                            "The combination of 3D's personal experiences in advisory committee meetings and their in-depth knowledge of excellent presentation techniques provided us with an informative and educational evening."                          
Jamie Robinson, RAC
Associate Program Director, Pharma Technical Regulatory

                            "3D's communications coaching was immediately impactful & a tremendous value-add. Our team's communications are more crisp, confident and persuasive - essential qualities for successful advocacy in policy and politics."                          
Bruce Mehlman
Partner
Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen Bingel & Thomas





                            "The participants found the meeting engaging, as well as educational and entertaining. The use of videos and personal anecdotes was very effective. The formal feedback we had from the attendees was uniformly positive, even effusive -- with several commenting that it was one of our best meetings ever."                          
San Francisco Bay Area RAPS Chapter Program Board







                            "3D's presentation to RAPS was both informative and entertaining. It was the perfect combination of regulatory insight and how to get to know your advisory committee, how to help your team prepare, and how to avoid the most common mistakes companies make. It's important information for anyone preparing for an FDA advisory committee meeting!"                          
Nancy Singer
President
Compliance Alliance, LLC





                            "I very much enjoyed your engaging presentation, the fascinating (and sometimes painful) video footage of FDA Panel meetings, and the interactive Q&A section at the end. The attendee comments included: "excellent presenter" and "well worth the time."                          
Lisa Peacock
VP, Regulatory Affairs

                            "3D is an extremely effective communications firm, and an excellent partner. They do their homework, come with good ideas in both content and delivery on complex issues, and help us articulate our messages in a meaningful way."                          
George Scangos

                            "Cindy was kind enough to teach a unit of my graduate class. She was informative, dynamic, and engaging. Her course materials were outstanding. She shared her book with the class. The students ranked her presentation 5 out of 5 on the feedback form. Thank you, Cindy!"                          
Andrea Chamblee, RAC
Supervisory Regulatory Counsel
Food and Drug Administration





                            "The presentation regarding FDA panel meeting was energetic and informative. The overview of the planning for a panel meeting and examples of execution were insightful."                          
Kim Strohkirch
Managing Partner
Memphis Regulatory Consulting, LLC





                            "Jim was an engaging and entertaining speaker. He portrayed a clear command of advisory committees and the business realities involved. One of the participants exclaimed afterwards, "I would hire him if we ended up in front of an advisory panel."

The Danger of Company Groupthink in FDA Advisory Committee Preparations

Active Listening Can Make You a Better Speaker: Part 1



Jerry Michaels





When we think of being a good communicator or public presenter, we often think it’s about the speaker. But a major component of great communication is whether you and the audience are engaged in “active listening.”
In this, and the next blog, we show you what you as the speaker can do to make active listening an integral part of your presentation style.

Communications Myths: Five Untruths That Can Get You in Trouble



Penny Daniels





All this talk about “fake news,” and “alternative facts” has me reflecting on the difference between relatively harmless untruths versus potentially dangerous ones. For instance, I just read yet another article debunking the “truism” that human beings use only 10% of our brains. So disappointing, since I like to think I could lose 90% of my mind and still be ok.
Seriously, though – believing or not believing this myth probably won’t hurt me.  But some myths can be dangerous – to your health, the planet – or your career.  In communications, trusting a lie can cause a huge professional blunder – and who needs that?

FDA NDA to ADCOM: Five Tips to Ensure a Smooth Transition



Christen M. Anderson





Preparing a New Drug Application (NDA) or Pre-Market Approval (PMA) is one of the most arduous tasks regulatory teams have to face – and thinking about a possible Advisory Committee (ADCOM) meeting at the same time may seem impossible.  But approaching NDA/PMA preparation with the possibility of an Advisory Committee meeting in mind not only improves a Sponsor’s chances at an ADCOM – it could prevent one from ever happening.  
Here are five tips on how to approach NDA/PMA preparation with a possible ADCOM in mind.

What an Oscars Mishap Can Teach Leaders About Authentic Communication



Penny Daniels






Cindy DiBiasi





We couldn’t have scripted a better example for leadership communications than what happened at the Academy Awards Sunday night.   
Jordan Horowitz, one of the producers of the film La La Land, had just accepted the award for Best Picture when it was discovered the presenters had been handed the wrong card and announced the wrong winner.  Amid the confusion, embarrassment, and apologies that followed, Horowitz held up the right card and declared, “Moonlight, you guys won Best Picture,’” and then, “I’m going to be really proud to hand this to my friends from Moonlight.”

Seven Steps for Success at FDA Meetings



Jim DiBiasi





For pharmaceutical or device company teams, there is one common thread for all FDA meetings: the need to tell a clear story and to set the data or issue in context. Just as FDA has a process for determining whether a drug or device should be approved, companies need a proven process to keep their team on track and prepare in the most efficient and effective way. Our process includes these seven steps.

Crisis Communications: The Insider’s Guide for Dealing with “60 Minutes” (and Other Tough TV News Interviews)



Lee Zeidman





As a former producer for “60 Minutes” and other CBS News magazines, I rarely advise clients to not do high-stakes TV interviews, especially during a crisis. Since reporters interpret silence as a tacit admission of guilt, open communication is the smart approach. But these types of interviews require preparation on an entirely different level. Here is an eleven-step strategy to limit risk and leverage opportunity when engaging with the media in high-stakes or crisis communications situations.

The foundation of what sets Cure apart from the competition is its proprietary and patent pending Tri-Active system. This composition begins with a liquid based film layer that contains and stabilizes the active ingredients. The second component of the composition is a powder matrix layer that can deliver additional active ingredients and provides many functional qualities, including: extra flavoring ingredients, pliability enhancers, mucosal permeation enhancers, and improved stability.

Advances in Technology
Delivery Systems
Intellectual Property




Utilizing our Tri-Active film matrix, Pharmaceutical companies may be able to extend the patent life cycles as well as create a new family of patent protection. The opportunity for the Tri-Active film matrix is substantial; our Tri-Active drug delivery can be applied to a large pool of drugs due to its ability to carry a variety of active pharmaceutical ingredients with higher pay loads.

The Tri-Active film matrix is more stable, durable with the ability to augment the dissolution rate, with a quicker dissolution than other dosage forms.  The technology enables differentiation within large therapeutic categories and potentially improves patient compliance. In addition, the sublingual and buccal delivery of a given drug via the Tri-Active film has the potential to improve the onset of action, lower dosing and enhance the efficacy thereby widening the therapeutic index.

		    

Cure has developed a portfolio of drug platform delivery systems to include; 

Multi-layer oral thin film (OTF)
Proprietary liquid based encapsulation technologies
Transdermal (skin) delivery
Buccal (gland) delivery
Gastrointestinal delivery systems

Cure's R&D team is further developing new and innovative ways to deliver drugs more efficiently.

		    

Pharmaceutical companies are becoming increasingly focused on product life cycle management due to expiring patents, generic encroachment and declining new drug pipelines.  It is estimated that over 80 major drugs representing over 95 billion in sales will lose patent or exclusivity protection by 2015.

CURE's IP development strategy focuses on improving product integrity, efficiency and load capacity for all drug delivery technologies.  CURE has protected these innovations using a blended strategy of patents, trade secrets and proprietary equipment design.

Quick Ratio




 


            Measures immediate liquidity or the cash available to cover immediate liabilities. A safe margin would be at least 1 (100%).
        




Financial Leverage




 


            Defined as total assets divided by total shareholders' equity. The higher the ratio, the more debt a company uses in its capital structure.

ROE




 


            Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of profitability that calculates how many dollars of profit a company generates with each dollar of shareholders equity.
            ROE is sometimes called "return on net worth."
        




ROIC




 


            The Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) measure gives a sense of how well a company is using its money to generate returns. Some investors use this figure as a final evaluation to determine whether or not to invest in a company.

FDA Soon to Prohibit Certain Omega-3 Fatty Acid Health Claims 
Companies marketing their Omega-3 products as a "high source" of DHA/EPA will likely have to modify their promotional messaging. Beacause the FDA has not yet established a reference of nutrient levels for DHA/EPA, it is recommended that marketers use percentage statements or qualified health claims for their Omega-3 products instead.

Can Vitamin D Help Lower Blood Pressure?
Early research published in the European Journal of Epidemiology found that oral ingestion of Vitamin D3 over the course of 3 months may help lower systolic blood pressure in certain populations. More studies linking Vitamin D consumption and and reduced blood pressure are needed before marketers can safely make those claims.

Blended Protein Manuacturing Benefits
A double blind randomized clinical trial conducted by the University of Texas Medial Branch compared amino acid delivery to the muscle using soy-dairy protein blend versus a single whey protein. The soy-dairy protein blend delivered key amino acids roughly one hour longer than the whey protein blend.

Package Design


Label and Package Design Services









Great Design Matters, But So Does Compliance
Good nutritional packaging design isn’t just about aesthetics, it’s also about the customers’ experience getting into the product, the materials they interact with, the warnings they must read before consumption and even the steps they should take after depleting their supply.
Maker’s Nutrition excels at preparing the package and label design for nutritional supplements because we address all aspects of interaction: visual, tactile, information.   Our graphic designers take pride in delivering the whole package.

FDA Soon to Prohibit Certain Omega-3 Fatty Acid Health Claims 
Companies marketing their Omega-3 products as a "high source" of DHA/EPA will likely have to modify their promotional messaging. Beacause the FDA has not yet established a reference of nutrient levels for DHA/EPA, it is recommended that marketers use percentage statements or qualified health claims for their Omega-3 products instead.

Can Vitamin D Help Lower Blood Pressure?
Early research published in the European Journal of Epidemiology found that oral injestion of Vitamin D3 over the course of 3 months may help lower systolic blood pressure in certain populations. More studies linking Vitamin D consumption and and reduced blood pressure are needed before marketers can safely make those claims.

Blended Protein Manuacturing Benefits
A double blind randomized clinical trial conducted by the University of Texas Medial Branch compared amino acid delivery to the muscle using soy-dairy protein blend versus a single whey protein. The soy-dairy protein blend delivered key amino acids roughly one hour longer than the whey protein blend.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

EMUAID® Delivers Rapid, Natural Relief for Hidradenitis Suppurativa*

 

 

About Hidradenitis Suppurativa Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a non-contagious, recurrent skin condition or disease. Treatments for HS range from antibiotics to topical ointments. Hidradenitis suppurativa typically manifests as a progression from single boil-like, pus-filled abscesses, or hard sebaceous lumps, to painful, severe, deep-seated and often inflamed clusters of lesions with chronic seepage (suppuration) involving significant scarring. Hidradenitis Suppurativa is often misdiagnosed. It is difficult to treat, and currently there is no known cure.

TREATMENT OF HIDRADENITIS SUPPURATIVA A hidradenitis diagnosis can come based on severe symptoms or more mild symptoms. If the hidradenitis suppurativa disease becomes too severe, treatment could include carbon dioxide laser surgery or other ongoing surgical procedures. Antibiotics taken by mouth can be beneficial, and topical ointments can be another helpful treatment for the disease. Hidradenitis suppurativa patients with severe symptoms are constantly looking for treatment options. A visit to the clinic may not be enough to identify all the drugs and treatment methods necessary, but continual and diligent searching will help those who suffer from hidradenitis suppurativa find treatments that work.
EMUAID® is a revolutionary modern homeopathic topical ointment formulated with powerful natural ingredients and rare growth factor stimulators that work together to alleviate irritation, calm inflammation across a variety of disorders and provide symptomatic relief for damaged and resistant skin conditions, including the symptoms associated with hidradenitis suppurativa .

CALMS INFLAMMATION, ITCHING, PAIN AND DISCOMFORT* Upon application, the powerful natural ingredients in EMUAID® Ointment begin to soothe the skin to calm inflammation, surface pressure, pain and discomfort, regardless of your diagnosis. This makes your skin more comfortable throughout the healing process and also helps the boil to drain. The soothing homeopathic and anti-inflammatory ingredients in EMUAID® Ointment offer relief on contact to calm inflammation and relieve itching, rash and discomfort.* Each of the ingredients in EMUAID® was selected based upon having long histories and clinical support of providing outstanding benefits in skin therapy.

SPEEDS UP HEALING OF DAMAGED SKIN AND IS A PREVENTATIVE SCAR TREATMENT Any time the skin is damaged by a lesion or boil, there is a potential for scarring or permanent blemish. EMUAID® stimulates blood flow to rapidly promote the growth of new healthy skin cells and prevent scar tissue from forming.

MEDICAL GRADE INGREDIENTS TREAT SECONDARY INFECTION EMUAID® naturally fights most harmful bacteria (Staphylococcus and other common bacteria) on the skin to help prevent potential infection.

COMPLETELY SAFE AND PAINLESS – WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS  Unlike other leading products, EMUAID® has no irritating chemicals or reported side effects. It is 100% natural and can be used safely by the entire family. EMUAID® is unsurpassed in its simplicity and power.

 Dee Y.  -  I have recently been diagnosed with HS, I have been getting boils since a young girl but they haven’t been bad! Last week I developed a boil that was the size of a golf ball , went to the dr that’s when he told me I have HS , never heard of the condition ever! He prescribed a medication that didn’t do anything but make the boil worst. I was in so much pain for about 4 days, I have a 4 month old who is very active I could barley hold or rock him to sleep I was in so much pain. I then came across emuaid , was kind of skeptical at first but nothing else was working so why not give it a shot?! The reviews were great so I order the emuaid max, ordered it Tuesday morning received it Thursday. Started to use it immediately today is Saturday and the boil has already popped ! This was a life saver I was shocked how fast it work ! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!*

 J DAVIS  -  I have been a sufferer of HS for 5 + years. This is the ONLY thing that helps me with pain, inflammation, tenderness. This product will be in my medicine cabinet forever, for any and all skin issues. Thanks Emuaid :)*

 Lorraine M.  -  This is my second order and I am so pleased with this product. It is a life saver for treating my boils. Thank you so much!*

 Joihelene H  -  I’m 47 years old, African American female, single, never married, and no children. I’ve had Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) or Acne Inversa (AI) for about 3 to 4 years. It started very small and has built up to make me very unhappy, frustrated and honestly, depressed about the prospect of romantically socializing. My breakout is located in the pelvis, groin area and under my belly, upper pelvis. I have 3rd stage HS/AI with multiple cysts, many with sinus tracks, deep-seated abscesses. They are located in the inner thighs, vulva and buttocks as well. I do not have many of the cysts coming to head or seeping pus. Most have no seepage or are lightly bloody and/or clear seepage from the large deep-seated abscesses. I was using strong zit gel, zit cleanser, Hibiclens, and polysporin to take care of my breakouts. I stumbled upon a YouTube video of a young lady from Europe talking about your product, Emuaid. At first, I was extremely skeptical about her testimony. Though the video was short, amateurishly crafted, her testimony video rang extremely true to my need. I found myself ordering it and received it in the mail Tuesday evening (August 23, 2016). I used it in only one location to test my reactions around 9pm that night after following the directions. I have extremely sensitivity skin and can have allergic reactions easily, so I wanted to play it safe. I awoke around 2:30am to use the facilities and found that the area I had administered the Emuaid on was much changed. The abscess had had a sinus track creating a new cyst on my outer-thigh. It was now shrunk almost twice in size with the sinus track gone and the new cyst flattened and almost completely disappeared. To say I was amazed and excited is an understatement! I immediately started using it all over my pelvis area, including my vulva. I had no stinging or ill results. In fact, the total opposite! It was cooling, soothing, and felt healing immediately. I am totally amazed at your product. I wish I had known about it sooner. I would love to show you pictures but of course, I can’t due to the breakout location. But I want you to know that I’m telling all my clinician friends about this AMAZING product and all that it can do for skin issues, especially ones as serious as HS/AI. Last week, I had finally gone to a Dermatologist who had recommended putting me on a very strong drug. It has horrible side effects and my instincts told me to not to take it. I’m a singer and voice artist and taking that medicine would have been harmful to my voice instrument. After consulting two pharmacists, two nurse practitioners, and a few nurse friends, I decided not to take it and told the Dermatologist. I’m so glad that in the meantime, I discovered Emuaid instead. THANK YOU! I have a background in marketing. If you would like to utilize me as a spokesperson, please let me know!

 happy c  -  My husband has hidradentitis supportive and has used Emuaid for several years. It along with antibiotics has managed the outbreaks. My dog has sebaceous cysts that have started opening.

 Robert V.  -  I have H.S. I’ve had it for years. I’m seeing to specialist for this problem with no positive results. I received emuaidmax and started using it I got immediate results. My wound care doctor was getting ready to schedule surgery when I saw him after using emuaidmax he decided I no longer need surgery because of the improvement of my condition. I want to thank you for your product.*

 Michael S  -  I suffer with hidradenitis suppurativa, and this product is literally giving me my life back!!! THANK YOU*

 Vanessa W  -  Emuaid Max is an amazing cream – since using it has kept my HS at bay with not one flare-up – I used to have flare-ups on a regular basis – now I just apply the cream when I feel one coming up and presto … it goes! Thank you :)*

 Anonymous Customer  -  I am so glad I found this cream to help my husband, in one week I could see a big different.
Today we had a Doctor appoinment , she was so surprise how it got better, she took me to the computer to show me the picture from last week and now what a different, I just have to tell her about your cream, she said , she never heard about this cream.
I strongly recomend r*

 david j  -  It is the only meds that i have ever found that totally works. the shopping exp, was awesome thanks*

 Mia  -  I do not regret buying this product. I had an out of control boil on my armpit. It was going to be some time yet before the Doctor was able to see me and I hate going to the ER. I saw this item online and thought, “what do I have to lose?” I received it and started using it. Not only did it bring it to a head and opened, it also dried it out. I will definitely reorder and make sure it is always in my medicine cabinet. Love it.*

 Maggie T.  -  This stuff is so good. I got the extra strength this time. I am assured that it will work as well or better. Nothing I have tried before worked until I discovered this product. It’s a miracle in a jar.*

  Loetitia  -  Best treatment I have ever found in 40 years to calm HS flares…………..It’s GREAT!*

  Anonymous Customer  -  Words cannot explain!! I have HS and although their is no known cure, this has done wonders to my flare ups! It brought immediate relief.*

 Nicole  -  So Ive been using it for almost two weeks now. Here are my findings. I decided in the beginning to pick an area and stick with that area. Well that didnt last because I started to flare in another spot and Emuaid makes it feel so much better. I had one start to come up in my butt crack (sorry for the verbage) yesterday and I applied it 3 times and this morning it was down and less tender. The spot I originally started to focus on was my lower tummy where I have one that constantly fills and is hard under the skin with some mild sinus tracking. Seems as though the Emuad has not only made the hardness under my skin in that particulaar area soften and condense in size, but also repairing the skin and its color from the scaring. (we all love those purple scars) My right armpit (the lesser affected one by HS) had some mild scaring and bumps are completely gone!!! Now to work on my left armpit (its the worst) with a lesion that never goes away. Emu Aid makes that lesion feel better but I know its going to take time on that to go away. I am happy with the results, and Im thinking it helps my purple scars too!! No, its not a cure all, but a HELPFULL TOOL. If these results continue until the whole free trial tub is gone, I will be a customer for life! I also slather some on in the bad areas b4 excersise to help prevent friction and chaffing and it works wonders. Im estatic for those of you that are on the trial and it is working for you. I know everyone is different and I continue to pray for those with No luck or bad reaction to the product. Hope that u find some thing that works for you soon!!!*

 Alina  -  I’m on day 4 using it at bedtime. I have definitely noticed less inflammation and many of the red areas are now pink — under arms and upper thighs*

 Amber  -  I have been using the product for about a week and a half. I still have not recieved a questionare. I have taken before pics and will take one on fri as it will be the 2 week mark and post them. I have had one flair up since using emuaid because of the stress of changing jobs but it hasn`t been as bad as it usually is and has calmed down much sooner. The redness and inflamation are both more controled it seems, and the pain level is down considerably! I will continue to document and use the product!*

 Kelly  -  I have been using mine for about a week. The extreme itching seems better. The first flare I used it on seemed alot more painful after I applied it. I used it on some areas that felt like they were getting ready to flare and they never did. It doesn’t seem to do much for the active flares.*

 Carletta  -  I’ve been using mine for a week and I’ve noticed a significant change in my groin area. Just got a spot on my belly button to pop up and I started putting it there today.*

 Christine  -  I used it last night for the first time under both arms. Within 20 minutes the pain and most of the swelling had gone down. I now move both arms with out feeling like the skin is going to rip. Also I put in on areas that had already had opened and half way drained.*

 Randi  -  I have only been using the Emuaid and Aleve. It has brought me drastic relief and does help to bring them to a head so I can drain them myself. I love EMUAID!*

 Tammy  -  Excellent
I cant tell you how glad I am that I have found Emuaid. I have Hidradenitis Suppurativa. I received Emuaid in the mail within two days and as soon as I applied it to my out break it helped. The pain stopped and the swelling receded. In about four days all was clear. There is no doubt that I will continue to use Emuaid. Thank you so much! I now have something that will help me with this condition*


“Very seldom do I write reviews, but EMUAID® is really a great product and worth the time and effort. If you suffer from hydranitis suppurativa you must give EMUAID® a try, you’ll be very happy you did. I only wish I had found this earlier! I don’t go anywhere without it. Even though I use it frequently, it lasts a long time, it is natural and doesn’t have side-effects with long-term use.”*
 -Jean S., Omaha NE*

 Jan M.  -  Good product
This product works well on my skin conditions. I originally purchased it for boil relief but also find it helpful for irritated skin and rashes. I would like to have less scent.*

 Glenda  -  Great
I have tried so many different treatments for HS and doctors really dont have a clue about this disease. After alot of searching, I am really glad to have found Emuaid. I am amazed at how fast and effective it is. I’m a believer!*

 Linda  -  I expected to throw this back in my Doctor’s face when it didn’t work, I couldn’t because it worked, I was shocked!
I have a terrible case of H.S. went to a surgeon to have it removed, he said he couldn’t because it was too close to the pelvic bone, it wouldn’t heal. But he told me to get Emuaid and try it. I was mad, thought he was copping out on me, but I was determined to go and get it and show him I tried it and it didn’t work like everything else I tried and then what else would he tell me. The first day of using it, it calmed things down, a week later I wasn’t bleeding and dripping all over the place and then they went down so that they were not hurting, amazing, I laughed and made jokes about it tried it on my brothers mosquito bites, it worked, a friend had a BBQ blow up in her face, she used it and a week later you would never know it had happened. I am on my 4th jar, doesn’t cure it but makes it so much more bareable, and my brother has a jar and my friend who had the BBQ explode on her. I wish it wasn’t as expensive, since I have to use so much of it, or maybe they could have a punch card and after so many jars you get a free one. I am like the man on the Greek Wedding putting Windex on everything, I put Emuaid on everything, and it works!*

 Dawn  -  Loooove this product, it is all it says it is.
I have HS that I have suffered in terrible pain for over 20 years, till I found EMUAID. No pain since. Use as a regimen without fail and you too will have outstanding results. This product is the best I have found and trust me I have tried prescriptions, surgeries as well as over the counter meds. My disease cannot be cured but I think with EMUAID I am as close as it gets. To some it may seem expensive but what is comfort worth to you? Give EMUAID a try you will not regret it. I am just sooooo greatful for this product, the pain is indescribable when HS flares up. I use EMUAID 2-3 times EVERYDAY. I have ordered many jars so far and they will continue to get my business. Blessing in a jar.*

 Christine  -  Life saving!!
I have suffered with Hidradenitis in my groin & upper inner thigh area for 10 + years, this ailment is utterly disgusting, extremely painful and completely embarrassing. About a year ago I bought the biggest jar of Emuaid available. I was a little skeptical, but I have tried every thing in the past to cure this disease, so I said why not? Nothing else worked maybe this stuff will. I am so glad that I did, I use it almost everyday to prevent future flare-ups, not only does this ointment clear it up and heal the area, it keeps it from coming back. I am just so grateful for this company and this product. I can now enjoy wearing a bikini at the pool in the summertime without embarrassment. Plus, I dont have to buy massive amounts of bandages to cover up and prevent leaks (from drainage) and purchase new clothes from the stains from the damage. Well, my first Tub of Emuaid is almost gone, so I just reordered a new one (a year later)! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you so much!*

 Carmen  -  Miraculous ointment!
My son has been suffering from painful, recurrent boils for over 15 years, a friend recommended Emuaid, which she uses for her diabetic mother. My son has been using Emuaid for the past two months and although he still gets breakouts, they are minimized in size, frequency and the healing time has maximized and the pain is minimum! Recently a determatologist was able to diagnose his condition with the grim news that it’s an annoying, incurable chronic condition. With the use of Emuaid, he gets much needed relief for his symptoms, not a cure but finally we found something that helps. In my last order of Emuaid, I order one for myself due to dry/itchy skin due to diabitic. Thank you so much for your product!*

 Brenda  -  This product work extremely well!
I was suprised at how well this product worked. I had been plagued with boils and had not found a product that offered relief until I tried Emuaid. Within a week I could see improvement.*

 Cheryl  -  Our Urgent Need Was Speer Lab’s/Emuaid’s Priority!
My daughter has had HS for 10+ years. I have searched high and low for a product to treat this horrible condition. To date, this is the ONLY product that I have found thus far (symptomatic treatment). My daughter had to have incision and drainage with packing for one of these horrible boils, about the size of a golf ball on the buttocks, with recurrence of the boil within a week. This is when, definitely in a panic, I called and spoke with Speer Labs in an effort to get an expedited shipment of Emuaid. This was shipped as promised expeditiously. (Thank you Monica!) Within 24 hours after application, there was a noticeable difference. Within 48 hours, today, she is still making progress. I hope this continues. I might also add that she is taking the probiotic as well.*

 Ilanhovan  -  It really works…
Hi, i’m from south east Asia. And i’m been suffering from bad HS for last 2 years. And beginning of this year. i’ve developed fistulla at groin area which was very painful and limited all my social activities out there. I almost gave up after the dermalogist to me there is no cure. That’s the time i found Emuaid oilment on the net, and bought 1 jar for trial. I was so happy when the fistulla eventually healed with the application of this oilment and the pain was not there. Emuaid gave me a new life. Even though my HS is not cured and i still have problems with it, this oilment got rid of the fistulla which was a great pain to bear mentally and physically. Now i just started Emuaid First Defense Probiotic supplement, i hope it will give me a good results to cure the HS from inside. To HS sufferers like me, please try out Emuaid, it really works rather than depending on oral supplements from the dermalogist.*

 Joseph  -  Hydradenitis supprativa kept in check with Emuaid!
Finally a product that works, and at a very good price!*

 Linda  -  Used Emuaid once and I love it!!!
Have been suffering from Hidradentis suppurativa and now have found relief! I can’t believe it! I am going to order another bottle.*

 Cynthia  -  Living Again & Loving It!!!
I had been suffering with Hydridentis Supportiva (HS) for over 15 years. I was an extremely active person working out 5 days a week & my favorite hobby was dancing. Well that all changed once I was finally diagnosed with HS. My quality of life was greatly affected. This condition made it painful to wear clothing. The pain & intense itching associated with HS is unbearable. Years of steroids, antibiotics, ice packs & the such all equaled up to the sum of NO RELIEF. Two weeks after I began using Emuaid which I’ve affectionately nicknamed Mu, the itching was significantly decreased . Two months after the flares ups were decreased and now I would say I am in 90% remission. The flares ups are now far & few between, I’m back to working out and I put on clothes to go out dancing. So close to the holidays if you are suffering with HS or any other skin disorder that involves pain & itching and loved ones ask you what they should put in your stocking tell them Emuaid. I would highly recommend you give this a try. EMUAID GAVE ME BACK MY LIFE!!!*

 Nana Yaa  -  God answered my prayers with Emuaid First Aid Ointment
I am about to order the maximum strength first aid Ointment, after 1 day of using the product. I was not happy when I got a small amount of the product, However, the product is an answer to my prayers. It works excellent. I have cystic breast and cyst that becomes boils on my breast very rare condition. It is herediteral. Went on mission and some how the shots caused my rashes to explode and have left open sores. Nothing worked until now. Thank you for creating this product.*

 Dawn  -  EmuAid the HS skin disease relief medicine
Consistent use of Emuaid will result in relief of the most irritating and painful skin diseases. I have had HS for 26 years and have taken all sorts of prescriptions and had surgeries. NOTHING has helped quite like the Emuaid. If you have HS I totally recommend Emuaid. With consistent use you will experience relief from this very painful condition. Give it a try you won’t be sorry. Sounds like some past reviewers were not patient or consistent enough with the use. HS is a very infection ridden skin disease and sometimes the flare ups are very involved. It could take days maybe a couple of weeks with consistent use of Emuaid to experience the real results. I cannot stress enough about the consistent use. HS IS NOT CUREABLE, and Emuaid is not a cure but it SURELY will help the pain and anything is an improvement with as painful as it can be. I will buy this product for the rest of my life………….*

 Alpha  -  Not a cure but a great relief.
I had major surgery to remove a large area polluted with Hidradenitis. Recently the HS has started returning causing large painful boils in my skin. I was extremely skeptical with this product but the price is what I would pay to see a doctor anyway so I took a gamble. The package arrived very quickly and they included the trial pills as well . The smell of the product is of Tea Tree Oil but not as strong. It is not a smell I find offensive but some may. The moment I applied the ointment I felt relief to the area, not a ‘deadened nerve feeling’ but a soothing pain free feeling. It allows me to get through my day without the pain from these boils. It appears to lessen the smaller ones and bring the bigger ones to a head faster. (Sorry for being gross) I am very happy with Emuaid. I don’t guarantee it will work for everyone but that is why they have a great return policy. Give it a try, if it works for you then great! if not then get a refund and try to find something else. Hope this helps.*

 Delores  -  A Miracle for my daughter!!!
My daughter has suffered and I mean suffered from HS for years now. She did ‘t have one day that was pain free. Sometimes she would lay and just cry. I gave Emuaid a shot after reading some very positive reviews. The results for her were truly amazing! Within 48 hours she was pain free. She cried again but with happiness. She is no longer taking pain pills at all! She can move without pain etc. She was skeptical and so quit Emuaid for a few days to test if it really was the Emuaid or not. Her pain came back within about 36 hours. Needless to say she went back on Emuaid and is enjoying life once again pain free. If you haven’t tried Emuaid you must! It truly will change your life! It is worth every penny! I give Emuaid a million stars!!!!*

 HOLLY  -  Life Saver
I am 41 and was recently diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa and have been dealing with scars under my armpits and groin area for the last year. I even had them removed by the doctor just to have them re-appear several weeks later. I was using tea tree oil, neosporin and hydrogen peroxide and no luck. I read about this product online and decided to give it a try and within 2 days of using it the boils burst and swelling went down considerably. This product is remarkable. I would recommend this to anyone suffering from extreme boils. I just purchased the extra strength and the swelling has already gone down within 24 hours. I cross my fingers that this will help treat and heel my skin. So far so good!*

 Laura  -  AMAZING!!
I had my doubts but was ready to try anything. It started working immediately on my boyfriends HS. He has been in pain (itching, burning, etc.) for years and he used it the first day and it worked instantly on his bumps. Then he stopped using it for a couple days because he left it at my house and the itching and soreness came back. Needless to say he has it on him at all times now

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
