FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Call us to see if you qualify.

Loan Disclosures


This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA



Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(the "Company") is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The Company has determined that the servicing criteria
are applicable in regards to the servicing platform for the period as follows:


Platform: Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain
privately-issued (i.e., for which transaction-level reporting is required
pursuant to contractual obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities,
commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities, for
which the Company provides master servicing, trustee, securities administration
or paying agent services, excluding any such securities issued by any agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government (other than the Federal Deposit
Insurance Company) or any government sponsored entity, and further excluding
the transactions issued prior to 2006 for which Wells Fargo outsources all
material servicing activities (as defined by Regulation AB) (the "Platform").
Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by the Company as
constituting the Platform.


Applicable Servicing Criteria: All servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d), to the extent required in the related transaction agreements, or
required by the Item 1122(d) servicing criteria in regards to the activities
performed by the Company, except for the following criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii),
1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x),
1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which Management has
determined are not applicable to the activities the Company performs with
respect to the Platform ("the Applicable Servicing Criteria").


Period: As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 (the "Period").


Third parties classified as vendors: With respect to servicing criterion
1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged a vendor to handle certain Uniform
Commercial Code filing functions required by the servicing criterion. The
Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a "servicer" as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company elects to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing
criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the
SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone
Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). The Company has policies and
procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion
applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining
that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendor
and related criterion.


With respect to the Platform and the Period, the Company provides the following
assessment of compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria:


1. The Company is responsible for assessing its compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria.


2. The Company has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria,
including the servicing criterion for which compliance is determined based on
Interpretation 17.06 as described above. In performing this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB.


3. Based on such assessment, the Company has complied, in all material respects
with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, except as described in Schedule A
hereto.


4. Schedule B hereto includes Management's discussion of the exceptions noted
in Schedule A, including remediation efforts taken by the Company.


As discussed in Appendix B, the Company has amended its Assessment of
Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria dated February 28, 2013 to
include certain previously omitted transactions in its Platform.


KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
attestation report on the Company's compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Period.

Schedule A




Material Instances of Noncompliance by the Company



Management's assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria
set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item
1122 of Regulation AB as of December 31, 2012 and for the Period, disclosed
that material instances of noncompliance occurred with respect to the servicing
criteria set forth in both of Items 1122(d)(3)(i)(B) and 1122(d)(3)(ii), as
follows:


* With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i)(B), certain reports to
investors did not provide information calculated in accordance with the terms
specified in the transaction agreements.


* With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(ii), certain amounts due to
investors were not allocated and remitted in accordance with timeframes,
distribution priority and other terms set forth in the transaction agreements.



Schedule B




Management's Discussion on Material Instances of Noncompliance by the Company



Disclosure: During the Period, Wells Fargo identified Payment Errors (as
defined below) and Reporting Errors (as defined below) on certain residential
mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") transactions in the Platform. Although no
individually identified error, in and of itself, was found to be material to
the Platform, when the errors were considered in the aggregate, Management
determined that, for Platform purposes, there were material instances of
noncompliance with respect to both Items 1122(d)(3)(i)(B) and 1122(d)(3)(ii) of
Regulation AB.


For purposes of this Schedule B, the term "Payment Errors" means the identified
payment errors that occurred during the Period and that, when considered in the
aggregate, led to Management's determination that there was a material instance
of noncompliance for the Platform with respect to Item 1122(d)(3)(i)(B) of
Regulation AB. For purposes of this Schedule B, the term "Reporting Errors"
means the identified reporting errors that occurred during the Period and that,
when considered in the aggregate, led to Management's determination that there
was a material instance of noncompliance for the Platform with respect to Item
1122(d)(3)(ii) of Regulation AB.


The identified Payment Errors and Reporting Errors on such RMBS transactions
were attributable to certain failures in processes relating to waterfall
calculations and reporting that, although adapted over time, still
insufficiently addressed the impact of the unprecedented levels of collateral
degradation in RMBS transactions on the calculation of principal and interest
payments and losses and associated investor reporting.


Scope of the Material Instances of Noncompliance: The identified Payment Errors
and Reporting Errors that led to Management's determination that material
instances of noncompliance with respect to the Platform had occurred were
limited to certain RMBS transactions in the Platform. There were no identified
Payment Errors or Reporting Errors for non-RMBS transactions in the Platform
which contributed to Management's determination that there were material
instances of noncompliance for the Platform. In some instances, the identified
Payment Errors which contributed to Management's determination that there were
material instances of noncompliance for the Platform were also considered
material to the transactions on which they occurred. None of the identified
Reporting Errors which contributed to Management's determination that there
were material instances of noncompliance for the Platform were considered
material for a particular transaction. For all transactions in the Platform
(including RMBS transactions with identified Payment Errors and Reporting
Errors), Management delivered an Item 1123 certification to the extent it was
required to do so pursuant to the requirements of the applicable transaction
documents and Regulation AB. Where there was an identified Payment Error that
was considered material for an individual transaction, the Item 1123
certification included a description of the nature and scope of such error.


Remediation: Appropriate actions have been taken or are in the process of being
taken to remediate the identified Payment Errors and Reporting Errors that led
to Management's determination that material instances of noncompliance with
respect to the Platform had occurred. Further, adjustments have been or will be
made to the waterfall calculations and other operational processes and quality
control measures applied to the RMBS transactions in the Platform to minimize
the risk of future payment and reporting errors.


Further Disclosure^1: Earlier this year, the Staff of the Securities Exchange
Commission issued a comment letter to an issuer of certain residential
mortgage-backed securities with questions regarding its 2012 Form 10-K filings.
Three of the questions posed on such comment letter pertained to Wells Fargo's
Schedule B discussion of the material instances of noncompliance on its
platform set forth above. The comment letter questions and Wells Fargo's
response to such questions are set forth verbatim below beginning with the
second succeeding paragraph (the "Comment Letter Questions and Wells Fargo
Responses").


The statistics about Identified Payment Errors and Identified Reporting Errors
(as such terms are defined in the responses below) set forth in Wells Fargo's
responses below were based on information known as of February 28, 2013, the
date of the original

Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria. As of the date of
this amended assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria,
Management is aware of an additional 18 Identified Payment Errors and an
additional 29 Identified Reporting Errors. The additional errors were found
both on platform transactions that are denoted as omitted transactions on
Appendix A hereto and on non-omitted platform transactions. The discussion in
the below responses about the Identified Payment Errors and Identified
Reporting Errors, including statements about remediation, is applicable to
these additional Identified Payment Errors and Identified Reporting Errors.



Comment Letter Questions and Wells Fargo Responses^2:



5. The report of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ("Wells Fargo") on its assessment of
compliance with applicable servicing criteria states that "certain failures in
processes relating to waterfall calculations and reporting that, although
adapted over time, still insufficiently addressed the impact of the
unprecedented levels of collateral degradation in RMBS transactions on the
calculation of principal and interest payments and losses associated investor
reporting." Your description is unclear. With a view towards disclosure please
explain:


* the specific failures in processes relating to waterfall calculations and
reporting;


* what you mean by "unprecedented levels of collateral degradation" and why
that would have any effect on the calculation of the waterfall; and

there was a material instance of noncompliance for Wells Fargo's Platform.


* "Identified Reporting Errors" means, with respect to the 2012 Reporting
Period, the reporting errors identified in the normal course of business and
through specific procedures performed in connection with the preparation of
the 2012 Item 1122 Compliance Reports that led to the determination that
there was a material instance of noncompliance for Wells Fargo's Platform.


* "Model" means the Model Input, the Model Program and the processes related
to the Model Input and the Model Program that function together for the
purpose of calculating payments in accordance with the requirements of

with Applicable Servicing Criteria dated February 28, 2013.


(page)


* "Model Program" means Model programming logic designed to calculate payments
in accordance with transaction document requirements.


* "Model Program Errors" means inaccurate or incomplete programming or logic
in the Model that does not produce calculations in accordance with the
transaction documents and therefore causes payment errors and/or reporting
errors.


* "Platform" means the trustee/master servicer/securities administrator/paying
agent platform designed by Wells Fargo that corresponds to the 2012
Assessment consisting of approximately 2000 RMBS transactions in addition to
other commercial mortgage-backed security and asset-backed security
transactions.


* "RMBS" means residential mortgage-backed securities.


* "Wells Fargo" means the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A.


* the specific failures in processes relating to waterfall calculations and
reporting;


Response: Wells Fargo develops a unique Model for each transaction in its
Platform. On the whole, there are millions of calculations performed by the
Models each payment period for the thousands of transactions in the Platform.


Wells Fargo's waterfall payment calculation and reporting functions can be
categorized into three processes:


* Model Inputs,

* Model Programs, and

* transmission of each Model's output to the processes and systems that generate
investor reports.


In the 2012 Reporting Period, there were 84 Identified Payment Errors on RMBS
transactions^3.


* 40 of the 84 Identified Payment Errors resulted from Model Input Errors. For
example^4, in certain transactions, defaulted fixed rate loans became subject
to unanticipated rate modifications when the loans were modified in accordance
with industry loan modification initiatives. Because the transaction documents
did not contemplate the rate modifications, the Model Input process had to be
manually adapted to incorporate the rate changes. Model Input Errors occurred
when the manual adjustments were made.


* 44 of the 84 Identified Payment Errors resulted from Model Program Errors.
For example, in many RMBS transactions, at the point credit support is
depleted (i.e. the principal balance of the subordinate bonds is reduced to
zero), payment allocations to the remaining senior bonds shift from a
sequential payment priority to a pro rata payment priority. In many cases,
the transaction documents require such shift to occur "on and after" the
month in which credit support is depleted and in other transactions the shift
occurs "after" the month in which credit support is depleted. Model Program
Errors occurred when some Model Programs shifted payment allocations from
sequential to pro rata in the wrong month inconsistent with the applicable
transaction documents. In addition, with respect to transaction documents
which direct the payment priority shift "on and after" credit support
depletion, Model Program Errors occurred because proper effect was not given
to the word "on". There is an order of operations in every waterfall that
directs payments to bonds first and allocations of losses to bonds second.
Because credit support depletion most often occurs from the allocation of
losses to subordinate bonds, this order of operation (i.e. payments first;
losses second) would have to be reversed to make a payment priority shift on
the credit support depletion date. Model Program Errors occurred when the
order of operations was not reversed in this manner.


^3 While there were also some Identified Payment Errors on CMBS and ABS
transactions in the Platform, Schedule B to the 2012 Assessment says "[T]he
identified Payment Errors and Reporting Errors that led to Management's
determination that material instances of noncompliance with respect to the
Platform had occurred was limited to certain RMBS transactions in the Platform.
There were no identified Payment Errors or Reporting Errors for non-RMBS
transactions in the Platform which contributed to Management's determination
that there were material instances of noncompliance for the Platform".
Accordingly, the statistics provided in this response relating to Identified
Payment Errors and Identified Reporting Errors are limited to RMBS transactions
in the Platform.


^4 Because it would be impractical to provide a detailed explanation of each of
the 84 Identified Payment Errors, Wells Fargo has endeavored in its responses
to questions 5, 6 and 7 to provide meaningful examples of the Identified
Payment Errors and Identified Reporting Errors. The examples are illustrative
but not representative of every individual error or error type.


(page)


For the 2012 Reporting Period, there were 148 Identified Reporting Errors on
RMBS transactions^5.


* 84 of the 148 Identified Reporting Errors resulted from the 84 Identified
Payment Errors. Inaccurate payments led to inaccurate reporting.


* 64 of the 148 Identified Reporting Errors were unrelated to the Identified
Payment Errors.

* 36 of the 64 Identified Reporting Errors resulted from
inaccurate/incomplete bond reporting.  Some examples of these 36
Identified Reporting Errors include inaccurate reporting variables related
to investor payments, incorrect tranche balance reporting and incorrect
trigger reporting.

* 28 of the 64 Identified Reporting Errors resulted from
inaccurate/incomplete mortgage loan reporting. Some examples of these 28
Identified Reporting Errors include incorrect information on the
collateral statement portion of the investor report, inaccurate
delinquency reporting and inaccurate loan level performance reporting.


* what you mean by "unprecedented levels of collateral degradation" and why that
would have any effect on the calculation of the waterfall; and


Response: "Unprecedented levels of collateral degradation" refers to the
significant decrease in mortgage loan performance experienced by RMBS
transactions generally over the past several years. The significant decrease in
loan performance is evidenced by the fact that over 50 percent of the RMBS
transactions in Wells Fargo's Platform have reached credit support depletion.
This is a significant event because waterfall payment priorities for the senior
bonds typically change at that point.


One reason why high levels of RMBS mortgage loan performance degradation affect
waterfall calculations is because such degradation contributes to Model Input
Errors. One example of such Model Input Errors relates to the extensive level
of mortgage loan delinquencies and the resulting extensive levels of servicer
advancing. High levels of advancing lead to both high advance recoveries by
servicers in single distribution periods and increased servicer stop advance
decisions^6. These phenomena require manual processing which can result in Model
Input Errors.


The high level of RMBS mortgage loan performance degradation has also
contributed to Model Program Errors. The extensive collateral losses in RMBS
transactions have triggered waterfall scenarios that were considered unlikely
to occur at the inception of the transactions (if they were considered at all)
and were not as clearly detailed as other provisions in the transaction
agreements that direct waterfall calculations and distributions. At Model
creation, those waterfall scenarios were not forecasted to reach the levels of
underperformance that RMBS mortgage loans have experienced. Because of such
lack of forecasting and the absence of benchmark data^7 for such scenarios from
the underwriters/sponsors of the transactions or other sources, Wells Fargo was
unable to test and validate such waterfall scenarios. As a result, Model
Program Errors occurred.


* what you mean by "adapted over time."


Response: "Adapted over time" refers to the fact that Model Programs and Model
Inputs and the processes related to Model Programs and Model Inputs are, over
the life of a transaction, constantly being adjusted in an effort to ensure
accurate payments. Continual adjustments are required because the transactions
and securities to which the Models relate are very complex and the technology
and processes related to Model Programs and Model Inputs are equally complex.
The level of adjustment needed for Model Programs, Model Inputs, and related
processes increased as mortgage loan performance degradation increased.


6. We note reference to "Payment Errors" and "Reporting Errors." With a view
towards disclosure, please explain whether these are the same type of Payment
Errors and Reporting Errors that were described in Wells Fargo's assessment of
compliance for 2011 that you further described in a response to us on December
31, 2012. In that response letter, Wells Fargo confirmed the correction and
resolution of modeling errors and that indicated that adjustments to payments
were made in 2012. If these are not the same type of errors as those that
occurred in 2011, please state so. In either case, with a view towards
disclosure, please explain:


^5 See footnote 1.


^6 A stop advance decision is made by a servicer when, with respect to any
advance made in the past or any proposed future advance, it determines that
such advances will not be recoverable from collections on the loan or from
liquidation proceeds.


^7 There were principally two types of benchmark data used: decrement tables
and underwriter/sponsor cash flow projections. The decrement tables in offering
documents generally only projected out at pricing speeds with zero loss
assumptions. Reconciling Models with those decrement tables based on those
assumptions would not have exposed the stresses on the Model Programs resulting
from the significant mortgage loan performance degradation in recent years. In
addition, cash flow projections received from the underwriters/sponsors at the
time of deal issuance were projected at minimal losses which were not severe
enough to expose the stresses on the Model Programs resulting from the
significant collateral degradation in recent years.

General Response: The Identified Payment Errors and the Identified Reporting
Errors were generally similar in type to the payment and reporting errors that
led to the determination that there was a material instance of noncompliance
for the 2011 assessment of compliance. However, the transactions on which the
errors occurred and the exact circumstances and details giving rise to the
Identified Payment Errors and Identified Reporting Errors in 2012 were
different than 2011. The correction of the 2011 identified payment errors and
reporting errors was specific to the Models for the affected transactions and
such corrections do not preclude the possibility that a similar type of error
would occur on a different transaction with a different Model in 2012.


Examples of Model Program Errors that occurred similarly in both years involve

(i) post-credit support depletion loss allocation methodology and payment
priority rules (e.g., pro rata versus sequential), and (ii) the calculation of
group-directed cash flows, interest calculation elements (rate, accrual day
logic, etc.), and pre-credit support depletion loss allocation.


Examples of Model Input Errors that occurred similarly in both years involve

(i) improper coding of cash adjustments and using incorrect prior month data,

(ii) loan modification inputs related to capitalization of delinquent amounts
and the recovery of advances related thereto and modified interest rates in
certain transaction structures, and (iii) cash adjustments related to servicer
advance reimbursements that caused errors in certain calculations (e.g., the
net weighted average coupon rate calculations).


Comparing the Identified Reporting Errors to the identified reporting errors in
2011, a substantial number in each year were caused by the payment errors
(i.e., reporting an incorrect payment). There were other reporting errors in
both years that related to missing and incorrect bond information and missing
and incorrect mortgage loan information.


* whether the payment errors resulted in overpayments or underpayments to
investors;


Response: In most cases, the Identified Payment Errors were a combination of
overpayments to one or more classes of investors or transaction parties and
corresponding underpayments to one or more other classes of investors or other
transaction parties. Therefore, most of the Identified Payment Errors consisted
of overpayments and underpayments that netted to zero because all the cash that
was received from a transaction party in a payment cycle was distributed to
investors or other transaction parties on the related payment date^8 .


* the types of reporting errors that occurred and how they related to the
payment errors;


Response: 84 of the 148 Identified Reporting Errors were caused by the
Identified Payment Errors in that the incorrect payment led to incorrect
reporting. Since the Identified Payment Errors were calculated incorrectly, the
payments were reported incorrectly. The remaining 64 of the 148 Identified
Reporting Errors were not caused by the Identified Payment Errors. Those 64
Identified Reporting Errors consisted of missing or inaccurate information
related to various bond reporting and mortgage loan reporting elements.


* whether investors whose payments were impacted were notified of the errors
and, if so, how they were notified;


Response: Investors received notice of the Identified Payment Errors by means
of the posting to Wells Fargo's website of corrected payment date statements.
Investors received notice of Investor Reporting Errors by either a revised
statement in connection with a restatement^9 of the affected distributions or by
correcting the reporting error on the next payment date statement.


* whether any underpayments were paid or will be paid to investors and, if so,
when the payments were made or will be made; and


^8 While most Identified Payment Errors netted to zero, a small number of the
Identified Payment Errors did not net to zero. Identified Payment Errors that
did not net to zero occurred when, inadvertently, either (i) less than 100
percent the cash that was received from a transaction party (such as a
servicer) in a payment cycle was distributed to investors or other transaction
parties on the related payment date leaving cash in the transaction's
distribution account or (ii) an amount greater than 100 percent of the cash
that was received from a transaction party (such as a servicer) in a payment
cycle was distributed to investors or other transaction parties on the related
payment date causing an overdraft of the transaction's distribution account.
The scenario described in clause (i) explains the majority of circumstances
where overpayments and underpayments did not net to zero.


^9 As used in this response, the term "restatement" and the phrase "restating
affected distribution periods" means the correction of an overpayment or
underpayment experienced by a class of book-entry securities by (i) submitting
a revised payment date statement for each affected distribution period to the
Depository Trust Company ("DTC") by which the DTC adjusts the accounts of the
overpaid and underpaid classes, and (ii) the posting of such revised payment
date statement to Wells Fargo's website. In accordance with its current policy,
the DTC revises up to twelve months of affected distributions. On a limited
number of occasions when the affected distribution periods extended beyond such
twelve month time frame, Wells Fargo included adjustments for the additional
distribution periods in the restatement of the twelve distribution periods and
notified investors of this fact on the revised payment date statements. The
process is similar for physical securities except that Wells Fargo interacts
directly with affected holders as opposed to interacting with the DTC.


(page)


Response: With one exception^10 , Identified Payment Errors that resulted in
underpayments to investors were rectified by means of restating affected
distribution periods. The restatements occurred between February 1, 2012 and
March 1, 2013.


* whether any future payments were adjusted to account for overpayments.


Response: With one exception described in footnote 8, Identified Payment Errors
that resulted in overpayments to investors were rectified by restating the
affected distribution periods. Except with respect to one Identified Payment
Error on one transaction unrelated to the transactions to which the Comment
Letter relates, no future payments were adjusted in connection with overpayment
errors. In that one case, distributions to one class of certificates were
adjusted over three distribution dates and such adjustment was disclosed on the
respective distribution date statements.


7. While we note that Wells Fargo further states that "[a]ppropriate actions
have been taken or are in the process of being taken to remediate" the
identified errors and "adjustments have been or will be made to the waterfall
calculations and other operational processes and quality control measures
applied to the RMBS transactions in the Platform to minimize the risk of future
payment and reporting errors." This disclosure, however, does not provide any
indication as to the nature and scope of the failures, or the impact of the
identified material instances of noncompliance. We believe a more granular
discussion is necessary to understand how these steps have addressed the
identified material instances of noncompliance. With a view towards disclosure,
please explain:


* the specific actions that have been taken or are in the process of being
taken to remediate the identified payment errors and reporting errors;


Response: Except as discussed in footnote 8, Wells Fargo has remediated all of
the 84 Identified Payment Errors through restatements of the affected
distribution periods. The restatements occurred between February 1, 2012 and
March 1, 2013. Wells Fargo has remediated all 148 Identified Reporting Errors
by either issuing a revised statement in connection with a restatement of the
affected payments or by ensuring that the reporting element in question was
correctly reported on the next payment date statement.


* the specific adjustments that have been or will be made to the waterfall
calculations and other operational processes and quality control measures
applied to the RMBS transactions in the platform; and


Response: Wells Fargo has determined to address not only the specific errors
that led to the determination of material instances of non-compliance on the
RMBS component of its Platform, but also to take proactive measures to identify
other problems with its Models that could cause payment or reporting errors.
Accordingly, Wells Fargo has undertaken an expansive project to identify,
rectify and prevent problems with its Models and the individual transactions
that exhibited these problems. Wells Fargo is in the early stages of this
project. Due to the size of the RMBS component of its Platform, this is a long
term, intensive project involving significant internal and external resources.
In conjunction with other steps taken, Wells Fargo believes that this
initiative will result in ongoing improvements to its payment and reporting
processes.


* any other steps that Wells Fargo has undertaken or will undertake to ensure
that similar errors do not occur in the future.


Response: Throughout 2012 and 2013, Wells Fargo has adopted numerous other
initiatives in an effort to add rigor to its operational processes and quality
control measures. The initiatives relate to both preventing Model Errors and
identifying and correcting Model Errors. Examples of measures to prevent Model
Errors include, among other things, enhancements to its (i) new Model creation
procedures, (ii) procedures for pre-closing review of waterfall language in
transaction documents, and (iii) procedures for pre-payment date testing of
transaction level payment calculations and reporting elements. Examples of
measures to identify and correct Model Errors include, among other things, (a)
enhanced procedures relating to Model revisions, (b) the creation of a team
charged with conducting a careful analysis of every Model Error to determine if
any additional controls are necessary to prevent the errors from re-occurring,
and (c) the creation of a team to proactively perform Model Program corrections
to prevent future Model Errors. Wells Fargo has hired over two dozen additional
staff and reorganized various teams to more effectively manage the
above-mentioned operational processes and quality control measures.

^10 There is one underpayment of $4992.92 (and a corresponding overpayment of
the same amount) from March 2012 which has not been remedied. The underpayment
did not occur on any transaction to which the Commission's Comment Letter
directly relates. Wells Fargo is in the process of determining an appropriate
course of action with regard to this underpayment.

Republicans are aiming for the “lowest common denominator” that can get 50 votes, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said in a CNBC interview Wednesday. “What gets us to 50 votes so that we can move forward on a health care reform legislation, … that’s what needs to happen,” Price said.Repealing Obamacare is foolish.

FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Call us to see if you qualify.

Loan Disclosures


This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
