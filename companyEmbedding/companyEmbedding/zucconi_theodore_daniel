Galectin Therapeutics Inc was incorporated in Nevada on January 26, 2001 as DTR-Med Pharma Corp. On May 10, 2001, DTR changed its name to Pro- Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On May 26, 2011, Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc. changed its name to Galectin Therapeutics Inc. Galectin Therapeutics is a development-stage company, which is engaged in drug development to create new therapies for cancer and fibrotic disease. The Company’s drug candidates are based on its method of targeting galectin proteins, which are key mediators of biologic and pathologic function. The Company uses naturally occurring plant materials to create complex carbohydrates with specific molecular weights and pharmaceutical properties. The Company focuses on diseases with serious, life-threatening consequences to patients and those where current treatment options are limited. The Company has two compounds in development, one intended to be used in cancer therapy and the other intended to be used in the treatment of liver fibrosis and fatty liver disease. These two compounds are produced from completely different natural starting materials, both possessing the property which lends itself to binding to and inhibiting galectin proteins. GM-CT-01, its product candidate for cancer therapy, is a proprietary linear polysaccharide polymer comprised of mannose and galactose that has a precisely defined chemical structure and is derived from a plant source. GR-MD-02, its other product for treatment of liver fibrosis and fatty liver disease with inflammation and fibrosis, is a proprietary complex polysaccharide polymer possessing both linear and globular structures, which also is derived from a plant source. Its competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical and chemical companies, specialized biotechnology firms and universities and other research institutions. The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, and marketing, among other things, of its products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries.
