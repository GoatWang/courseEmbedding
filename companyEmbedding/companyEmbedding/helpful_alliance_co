About Alliance Rubber Company



  



	What A Time To Be Alive

	Today’s bright new technologies are bringing the world together in such innovative ways. With just a click, it is possible to share thoughts with millions of minds—almost instantaneously.

	As traditional work methods give way to more customized solutions, the need to keep our individual lives more organized is growing. Alliance Rubber Company manufactures 2,200 products and markets them in 55 countries all to help individuals and work places with their projects. The need for organization was something our Dad, William Spencer, understood. It fueled his vision for the company, founded in 1923 in Alliance, Ohio.


A photo of Brandi Spencer, Michelle Spencer Hitt, Richard Spencer and Bonnie Spencer Swayze

	We are now celebrating a third generation of family ownership, with more than 150-team members— who are an integral part of our continuing success. Their attitude toward quality and the passion they bring in producing a quality product distinguishes the brand. 62% of the Alliance Rubber Company team has been with the company for over five years and they help us make some of the world’s best rubber band products at our manufacturing facility in Hot Springs, Arkansas.

	For nearly a century, Alliance Rubber Company has been organizing the world in fun, affordable ways. Dedicated to “Holding Your World Together” by providing the best organizational tools at the best value, all the reasons Alliance Rubber Company remains a respected leader in manufacturing resonate right here:

	History

	A true American success story, Alliance Rubber Company owes its beginning to the ingenuity of one man – our father - William H. Spencer, who left his Franklin, Kentucky home in 1904 at the age of 13. Traveling by rail to seek adventure, he found himself in Alliance, Ohio in 1917 with less than $3, and began working for the Pennsylvania Railroad. Six years later on March 7, 1923, he obtained a few Goodyear inner tubes and cut the bands by hand in his basement where he founded Alliance Rubber Company. In those days, newspapers were blocked and thrown in the general direction of the porch. After seeing the Akron Beacon Journal blowing across lawns, he persuaded Tulsa World to try wrapping them with a band. He went on to pioneer other new markets for bands, agricultural and industrial applications as well as a myriad of other uses.

	After almost a century, Alliance is still a family owned business with a rich and distinctive American heritage. What started as a simple, practical, and reliable solution for everyday life has been transformed by our 150 Alliance Rubber Company team members into a multi-faceted collection of more than 2,000 products and tools designed for “Holding Your World Together.” Our associates make the difference in our brand. Their attitude and passion for quality of customer service shines. Over 60% of the Alliance Rubber Company team has been with the company for over five years, enabling us to make some of the world’s best banding products at our manufacturing facility in Hot Springs, Arkansas.

	Variety

	We started with just a few rubber bands. Now, Alliance Rubber Company offers over 2,000 sku’s of packaging, Ad Bands®, the world’s first four-color imprinted FotoFlex Bands™, Cable Wrapz®, Gear Strapz®, waterproof UPC-imprinted ProTape® and mailing/shipping supplies.

	American-Made

	94% of our sales are of American-made products. Consumers who select these products enjoy fresher stock, faster service, better fill-rate, and consistent top quality. Products made by Alliance Rubber Company also comply with standards for Buy American set-asides in conjunction with U.S. government purchases. I would like to personally encourage you to visit the section on our site “We Can Make It In America,” take our pledge to spend $1 per day on American-made goods, and help us to create one million additional U.S. jobs.

	WOSB-Woman Owned Small Business

	Helping women advance in the boardroom and beyond, our WBENC—Women’s Business Enterprise National Council Certification helps dealers provide products for both U.S. government set-asides and Fortune 500 diversity purchases.

	Innovation

	We were recently honored by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s NIST—National Institute of Standards and Technology—as one of two U.S. companies to win the Excellence in Innovation Award. Take a look at our history section to see our new products, and know we are committed to keeping you a market leader rather than a follower.

	Trust and Reliability

	Since 1923, we’ve grown into a packaging leader, selling to dealers in 55 countries.

	Green

	Unlike many packaging items, rubber bands are reusable and cut down on the need for excessive packaging. If every person in the world reduced their garbage by as little as 10%, the results could save 100 pounds of carbon dioxide per person annually. In addition, most of our rubber bands are made from latex, a rapidly renewable resource.

	Ergonomically Correct Bands

	Our soft stretch reduces stress, which leads to Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and costly workers’ compensation claims. As our bands’ elongation is further than most other bands, the consumer can see cost savings by using a smaller size and increasing their count per pound.

	Diverse, Interesting People Committed to Your Success

	Small companies have always been known for their entrepreneurial spirit, and Alliance is no exception. Wherever you are in this vast world, you’ll find us to be helpful, friendly people, dedicated to helping you find a solution.

	Our culture respects and values diversity and inclusion; and diversity has been key to our success. Intent on continuing a tradition of designing new products to help organize your life at work, school, home, or play, we’re not interested in being your biggest supplier—we just want to be your favorite. Known for quality since 1923, count on Alliance for all your organizational needs.


	Bonnie Spencer Swayze
President

Alliance goes above and beyond to ensure that my company has all the materials, whether it be marketing to the arrival of merchandise, in a timely manner. Great customer service is a must and Alliance most certainly demonstrates that tool!

Alicia Johnson

Alliance has been willing to adapt and bring our customers into their plant for meet and greet and have one to one contact. This is an invaluable service.

Ken Martin
	IPS Packaging
	Fountain Inn, SC


As the 3rd generation owner, I remember Alliance Rubber Company back in the 60's. My father, who was the 2nd generation owner, would bring home the large #107 bands. My father would help me make a sling shot to shoot rocks at cans. Wow, what memories! I still remember that fun today, and shared the same experience with my two sons - now the 4th generation future owners! Alliance Rubber Company has been a solid product in our family office products business for over 70 years!

Charles R. Haynsworth III
	Office Plus Business Centre
	Danville, VA


Great pricing and good lead times. Very responsive customer service. Take care of any problems quickly with no hassles. Great company to deal with.

Susan Clifton

	Pelion, SC


Our customers and referrals know they can depend on Alliance for top quality products delivered on time. If a customer is unsure of the type or size of band or product that would work best for their needs, they can count on Alliance's knowledgeable and friendly personnel to solve the problem.

Susan Johns
	Netherland Rubber Co.
	Cincinnati, OH


Our first opportunity to do business with Alliance Rubber entailed very large quantities of a custom project with very little lead time. Not only did Alliance Rubber find a way to make it happen, they took a chance on a customer previously unknown to them. That was in 2006. That project worked out great, and it has been a pleasure doing business with Alliance Rubber ever since. Cameron Packaging, Inc has always worked to partner with our customers to insure mutual success. For the last seven years, it has been a pleasure doing business with a company that values the same approach. To the employees of Alliance Rubber, Thank You.

Grant Morgenstern
	Cameron Packaging
	Lima, OH


The competitive pricing we get from Alliance, allow us to win bids for rubber bands all over the country.

Bruce Kahn
	Smith Office
	Hollywood, FL


Using Alliance Tape, each and every bunch of our product (leather leaf fern for floral industry) has product identification which helps give us brand name recognition at the user level.

Rebecca Shank
	NYC, NY


Alliance’s prompt response and knowledge has been a big part of our growth. Our ability to offer quality products and provide the best service possible has always been the number one priority and Alliance makes that all possible.

Richard Meeks
	Calpine District Manager

Robin King
	Schwegmans
	Batesville, AR


We deal with quite a few automotive companies and one of them required a specific band. Alliance helped us provide them with what they needed and they have been using this since 2005. Thanks Alliance!

Irene Chan
	Mississauga, ON


We have had a very good relationship with Alliance, we love the fact that their bands are USA made and they are extremely helpful in many ways. They certainly aim to please.

Susan Lemay
	Butler Brothers
	Greene, ME


We purchase large rubber bands from Alliance to use in the newspaper industry. Our carriers use them when delivering to large retail outlets. They always hold up, they are re-usable and last quite a while. Our biggest problem is getting our stores to save them to give back to the carrier. They always seem to find uses for them at their store.

Tim Gallagher
	Ocala Star Banner
	Ocala, FL


When our customers find themselves in a bind, I never doubt that Alliance will help us to fill the order quickly.

Kelly King
	IPS Packaging
	Piedmont, SC


I just wanted to let you know your rubber bands are exceptional. I have a box of them that I used to use as a newspaper delivery boy back in 1966. I still use them around the house 46 years later, and they work as well now as back in 1966. Unbelievable quality!

Gary Hernes
	Santa Fe, NM


I bought a number of bags of your rubberbands at an auction of a defunct newspaper company The Courier Express in Buffalo, NY in 1972 I believe. Your rubberbands are THE BEST! After all these years..nearly 40...they still outperform ANY rubberbands currently made. Just wanted you to know that I am totally amazed with their longevity, good as new elasticity, and absolute highest quality! Man, did I ever get a deal.

Using Business Alliances as a Growth Strategy
















Using Business Alliances as a Growth Strategy
Overview 
Business alliances have become an increasingly

powerful weapon in the war to gain and sustain a competitive edge. When two companies

align themselves, their synergistic strengths seem more apparent, their individual

weaknesses somehow less noticeable. Joining forces with another business can give your

company deeper pockets and greater access to new technologies. It can also increase brand

awareness, enlarge your customer base, and enhance your product or service offering. Yet,

in spite of all of these wonderful benefits, if you aren't careful, there can be some

major bumps and pitfalls along the way. 
Choosing the right company to partner with can

be as important to your professional life as choosing the right husband or wife is to your

personal life. So how do you know if forming an alliance is right for you? The following

is a step-by-step guide specifically designed to help you understand if your company could

in fact benefit from an alliance and how to make the relationship work, once you have both

said your "I do's."

Types of Alliances 
In today's competitive market, there are many

reasons for forming alliances. Some of the most common include a need for increased cash,

a need to keep up with ever-changing technological advances, a need to find viable

solutions for tough problems, a need to fend off a competitor, and a need to gain market

share  to name a few. Each of these reasons, on its own, is cause enough to form an

alliance. 
For as many reasons as there might be for

forming an alliance, there are as many different types of alliances and, of course, an

array of benefits to be reaped from each. Partnerships vary, too, from the extremely

complex relationships between huge corporations to simpler arrangements, where the small

corner store partners with a supplier on a small scale promotion. Likewise, the duration

of business alliances varies from one situation to the next. Some partnerships are formed

on a long term basis while others are for one product, service or project only. 
In sniffing around for a potential alliance, you

may find yourself subconsciously disregarding various companies without giving any

consideration to their worth as a partner. In your mind, you don't want to partner with a

small company that has little to offer you, nor are you interested in a really large

corporation that will take away your power and swallow you whole. You may also steer away

from companies or people whose politics and values don't mesh with yours. 
Knocking potential alliances off your list

before you even investigate the possibilities, however, is foolish. The rule today is that

you can form an alliance with just about anybody, and that includes even your staunchest

competitors. The following is a list of assorted partnership possibilities, including some

that probably seem very unlikely, but deserve consideration nonetheless: 
Suppliers - Forming partnerships with

suppliers is a strategy that's been around for many years. By forming partnerships with

suppliers, you increase your chances of always having the product you want  when you

want it. For example, Walt Disney relied heavily on alliances with suppliers. When

he first built Disneyland, he formed alliances with companies like Coca-Cola and Eastman

Kodak, giving them exclusive rights to sell their goods at the park. It was a decision

neither he nor his financial advisers ever regretted. 
A more contemporary example of this is the

extremely successful Bristol Myers and Wal-Mart alliance. When a Wal-Mart store sells a

lot of Bristol Myers' products, company representatives inform the manufacturer, which

sends out replacements within 24 hours. This insures that Wal-Mart's shelves are always

stocked with Bristol Myers' products, whereas other stores may have to wait longer, and

thus disappoint customers and miss potential sales. 
Employees -- Odd as it may seem, some

employees make wonderful partners. You may use employees to build stronger relationships

with customers, vendors and distributors, or to perform special projects or promotions. By

offering bonuses or stock options, you can motivate your current staff to take on added

responsibilities, and they in turn will feel more ownership for your organization. And,

best of all, you already have a business relationship with them and they're familiar with

your products, services and goals, so there shouldn't be many surprises in this type of

alliance. 
Some companies who have taken advantage of

alliances with employees are 3M, IBM, Sony and Hewlett Packard. 
Competitors -- You may consider

competitors to be your enemies, but have you ever imagined the possibilities if your

organizations got together and pooled your resources? Still reluctant to explore the idea?

Take some lessons from giant corporations that are hooking up with rivals and achieving

phenomenal results. Paramount Pictures teamed up with 20th Century Fox to produce the

blockbuster movie "Titanic." Due to the film's exorbitant costs, the picture

probably wouldn't have been made had there not been two major players involved. After the

film won numerous awards and accolades, along with hefty box-office receipts, both

partners were glad they'd made the alliance. 
Two other rival companies that have joined

forces are MCI and AT&T. Not only are these two mega-companies lobbying arm in arm for

new telecommunications legislation, they've also banded together to offer customers more

products and services. By pooling their energy and resources, these two companies have

discovered that they can each better meet their customers' needs. 
Customers -- Though this is a 

  liaison that happens much more rarely, you should not overlook a chance to partner 

  with a customer. They have been on the buying end of the stick and can, most 

  likely, provide extremely useful information and feedback about your company.

How to Determine if Alliances Are Right for

Your Company 
How do you know if forming an alliance is the

right thing to do for your company? Unfortunately, the answer isn't always clear. While

many alliances are hugely successful, there are also those that flop. However, when

examining your own company, if you find yourself lagging behind the market in sales,

growth and/or technological advances, forming an alliance may be your best hope to forge

ahead. Similarly, you might want to look at alliances if you find a close competitor

breathing down your neck. 
Once you have decided that an alliance is right

for you, it's important to move slowly and choose the right partner, since choosing the

wrong partner could make your situation deteriorate substantially. The first step is

to find a company you're compatible with. How do you do this? You should be able to obtain

the information you need from the Internet, from annual reports, and by talking directly

with customers and suppliers and the company itself. Remember, you are not only attempting

to determine if the potential partner is financially sound, but also if it shares the same

core values as you do, and if it can fill the holes that you're looking to fill. 
The following are some areas to examine

closely before entering into an agreement with any potential partner: 
Financial Situation -- You want to be

fairly certain that a company isn't going to face serious financial problems after you

enter into a deal with them. If possible, find out what their annual sales are. How about

their annual growth? How much of their revenue is profit? What are their financial goals,

and more importantly, are these goals compatible with your own? 
Operations -- Ideally, you want to find

out how well the company is managed. How many employees does it have? How does this number

compare to last year and the year before? Who are the people in charge? What is their

background and experience? 
Market Presence -- You should check to

see where the company does the majority of its business. How much of the market share does

this company control? What are its plans for the future, and do those goals meet yours?

Could you garner a larger collective share of the market if you joined forces? 
Quality of Product or Service -- This is

an area you will want to approach with extreme caution. Does a potential partner take

quality as seriously as you do? Do they offer the same warrantees and service hours that

you do? If a company's standards do not live up to your own, cross them off your list

immediately. You have likely built a reputation by providing quality to your customers. If

you tarnish that image through an alliance, you may well lose the customers you have

fought so hard to get. 
Views on Customers and Service -- It is

imperative that your potential partner share your views on customers and service. The

easiest way to see exactly where your potential partner stands is by talking directly to

this company's customers and briefly surveying them about your potential partner's

customer service practices. Ask if they are satisfied with the company. Are there any

things they would like to see changed? Does the company deal well with customer

complaints? If they were in your shoes, would they form an alliance with this company?


Marketing -- You will want to see how

your new potential partner markets its product or service. You should find out

specifically how much money is in their budget for marketing and how many people they have

to do the job. Keep in mind, in addition to marketing your products and services, you will

also need to think in terms of marketing the new alliance to the public. 
Desire -- This information may be tougher

to obtain, but you'll want to figure out if your potential partner shares your level of

enthusiasm for forming an alliance. If not, this could be a sign of potential problems.


If your new potential partner seems inflexible

on many issues, it should be taken as a sign for you to move on. You may also want to

check into whether or not your potential partner has ever been in an alliance before. If

possible, talk with the company they were aligned with and see what the results were.


Quiz 
The following quiz is designed to help

If you have answered true to at least 12 of the

15 questions, you can be reasonably sure that you are well prepared to enter into an

alliance with your potential partner. Though you should consider all of the factors listed

above, you should give the heaviest weight to those areas that are most important to you

and your company values.

How to Approach Potential Partners

Once the above questions have been answered to

your satisfaction, it's time to get the partnership show on the road. The first thing you

will want to do before approaching another company is to make sure that the deal you are

proposing is equally as beneficial to them as it is for your company. Going to a potential

partner and explaining everything they can do for you but nothing you can do for them will

not entice the company to join forces. 
Once you have a potential partner's interest,

discuss all of the details of the alliance  even those you would rather not bring up

for fear of putting your partner off or because you are afraid of the answer. Remember,

it's important that you both lay all of your cards out on the table. In these

situations, it's always best to identify potential issues up front and try to work through

them rather than to wait until you're already involved in an alliance. 
Be sure to discuss all possible partnership

opportunities with your potential partner. You will also want to talk about resources and

your plans for turning each opportunity into an advantage. Additionally, you will want to

talk specifically about how you will get your new alliance up and running, and come to

some definitive terms on exactly what needs to happen in order to bring this product or

service to the market. This is also an ideal time to discuss future goals of the alliance,

including future product or service offerings. 
Be Sure to Remember 

The following is a checklist that should be

formally discussed with a potential partner or alliance before you enter into any

agreement: 
What is the business opportunity at hand?



_______________________________________________________________________


What are the financial resources and

responsibilities of each company? 

_______________________________________________________________________


What specific steps need to be taken in order to

get the alliance up and running? 

_______________________________________________________________________


If you are jointly developing a new product or

service, what specific steps need to be taken in order to get it off the ground? 

_______________________________________________________________________


Which company will supply which employees to the

project? 

_______________________________________________________________________


Is this a long-term commitment or an alliance

only for a specific product or service? 

_______________________________________________________________________


What are the future products or services that

the alliance could potentially produce? 

_______________________________________________________________________


It stands to reason that you may have issues of

trust, especially if your potential partner is a former competitor. Building trust in such

cases takes time, but there are things you can do to facilitate the process. Probably the

most important step you can take at the beginning is to spend as much time as you can with

your potential partner. Go to business lunches and trade shows together, do a joint

presentation at an industry conference, or call on a customer together. 
Then start making small commitments to each

other. Perhaps you agree to divulge a little information about your company and your

partner does the same. In cases where the shared information is sensitive, you may want to

ask each other to sign non-disclosure agreements. This binding agreement should help

put your mind at ease. Note: An attorney should be consulted when drafting or

signing any legal documents. 
Back to Outline

 
Legal Considerations 
As with any joint venture, it is extremely

important that you protect yourself legally. It should be pointed out, however, that

alliances are a fairly new proposition  a proposition all lawyers may not be

entirely used to or comfortable with yet. As a result, dickering over the details of the

arrangement can hold up the alliance for weeks. You will want your attorney to take enough

time to protect your company against any liabilities resulting from the alliance, but you

will not want him or her to take so long that you miss out on important time sensitive

opportunities. 
The one thing you should insist on is an exit

strategy that allows you to get out of the contract if in fact the alliance doesn't work

out. 
Back to Outline

 
Making Alliances Work 
You have now reached a critical juncture. You've

found a partner you feel comfortable with, hammered out the legalities and are now

formally in business together. In order to make this alliance a smooth transition for both

companies, you must now figure out specifically how to make the marriage work. Keep in

mind, however, that you are not forming an alliance between two people, but rather two

entire companies. In this situation, it's guaranteed that there will be issues that need

to be dealt with  especially when each partner feels like they are the ones

rightfully in charge. You may want to sit down ahead of time with your potential partner

and discuss your mutual expectations and an acceptable division of duties. 
Openly express your expectations up front. By

holding back, the only thing you build up is resentment down the line. Outline your goals

and objectives in writing so you will have a benchmark to use later to measure whether the

alliance is working. Keep lines of communications open every step of the way and meet

regularly to discuss what aspects of the alliance are working for both of you and what you

would like to see changed. Make sure that each of you knows how to get in touch with your

alliance partner at all times, in case urgent matters arise. 
In order to keep the alliance working, it's

imperative that you keep it balanced. The moment one partner starts to feel like the other

isn't pulling their weight or, at the opposite end of the spectrum, is being too

domineering, problems will arise. 
You will also want to discuss money matters up

front  who will invest what, as well as to how you will divide the profits and

spread out your various personnel. Customer focus will also be a key during this period.

How will you get the word out to your customers? 
It is important to remember that your companies

are now "married" in some ways, and thus you may not enjoy all of the freedoms

that you did before the alliance. It used to be that you were the sole person in charge.

Now you have a partner you must answer to  someone who may rightfully question your

decisions and judgments. 
Self-Assessment 
The following questions are designed 

  to help guide you through the beginning of a new alliance: 


Have we clearly defined which duties 

      will be assigned to which parties?

       Yes 

      

      No


Have I openly expressed my expectations 

      for the alliance?

       Yes 

      

      No


Have I put my expectations in writing?

       Yes 

      

      No


Have we established clear lines 

      of communication?

       Yes 

      

      No


Have we talked through all money 

      matters?

       Yes 

      

      No


Do we have a clear plan for dealing 

      with customer service issues?

       Yes 

      

      No

What to Do When Alliances Don't Work

Your alliance has been up and running for a

short time now, but somehow, you find that it isn't working the way you'd planned. For

whatever reason, this isn't the business arrangement that you envisioned. What should you

do? The first thing to consider is whether at least some of the problems could be your

fault. Many companies make mistakes when entering into alliances and rather than recognize

them and try to fix them, they let the relationship sour until it is virtually beyond

repair. 
Next, ask yourself whether you have been

withholding information. A common mistake is for one or both of the alliance partners to

continue to secretly view each other as the enemy. Therefore, they tend to keep secrets

and avoid revealing too much to their partner. The bottom line is, you are now partners.

If your relationship isn't based on trust, you shouldn't be in a business relationship

together. 
Next, consider whether your expectations about

the alliance were unreasonable. Were you expecting results too quickly? Did you anticipate

higher financial returns than were possible given your resources? 
Also ask yourself whether you're treating

and respecting the other person as an equal. Is it possible that you still view yourself

as the boss, making unreasonable demands or your partner? 
By talking with your partner, you can get a good

idea of whether it's time to end the relationship or not. It may be worth it to try to

come to some agreement on how to work better together before deciding to end an alliance.


Self-Assessment 
Before giving up on an alliance, ask 

  yourself the following questions: 


Do I trust my new partner?

       Yes 

      

      No


Is it possible I am withholding 

      information?

       Yes 

      

      No


Am I disappointed things aren't 

      moving quicker?

       Yes 

      

      No


Do I treat my partner as an equal?

       Yes 

      

      No


Are there actions that I can take 

      to improve the relationship?

       Yes 

      

      No


Are there actions we can take together 

      to achieve better results?

       Yes 

      

      No




If you have tried to overcome all of the above

issues, but the alliance still is not working, you may want to ask your lawyer to execute

the exit strategy to get you out of the agreement. However, this action should be taken

only as a last resort. 
The majority of business alliances work out to

both partners' advantage. It's well worth your company's time and resources to do whatever

you can to make the relationship work. The synergy that a business alliance provides can

supply your company with increased revenues, improved brand awareness, and higher market

share for many years to come.

Alliance Case Study: PeopleSoft 
Almost every high-tech company is going the

alliance route these days. One company that knows firsthand the huge benefits that can be

reaped from forming alliances is PeopleSoft. PeopleSoft is a leading enterprise software

company located in Pleasanton, Calif. PeopleSoft's products help firms manage everything

from accounting to human resources management more effectively. 
In analyzing their growing customer base,

PeopleSoft's management team recognized early on that each of their customers was unique,

and each had slightly different needs. PeopleSoft also realized that it would be

impossible for one company to properly address all of those individual needs on their

own. Not only were they short on the necessary personnel, but they also lacked other

important resources including  in some cases  expertise. So, to best serve all

of their customers, PeopleSoft began to form alliances. 
A prime example of the benefits PeopleSoft has

gained from this strategy is their alliance with IBM's HR Access International Payroll.

This alliance focuses on meeting the payroll and human resource strategies of

multinational companies. It gives customers of both companies an expanded network of

consulting services to help them best address the problems of human resource management on

an international level. Additionally, IBM's HR Access brings an installed base of more

than more than 1,100 customers in 40 countries. 
PeopleSoft formed another important alliance

with The Bombay Company, a Fort Worth, Texas-based retailer specializing in classic and

traditional home accessories. In 1997, with more than 4,000 employees and annual sales of

$332 million, The Bombay Company needed a comprehensive HR services strategy to support

its more than 400 stores in 42 states and Canada. The Bombay Company's HR department was

not equipped to support these initiatives. Neither its existing HR system, which was not

Y2K compliant, nor the outsourced payroll service met to the company's reporting or

data-tracking needs. 
In November 1997, The Bombay Company chose a

company called The Hunter Group to develop an innovative set of solutions, including

support for employee self-service and automated workflow for HR transactions. These

solutions minimized the time spent on HR processes by store managers, and enterprise-wide

linkages from loss prevention and point-of-sale processes into payroll. This unique

solution enabled the client to create incentive bonuses based on quantifiable performance,

at any level within the operation. 
The Bombay Company needed a leading HR

management system and a premier payroll service provider that was accurate and customer

service oriented. They chose the PeopleSoft HRMS application suite for its strong

reporting capability and ability to integrate with core business systems. 
Working through an alliance, The Hunter Group

provided rapid implementation assistance and training for the PeopleSoft system. In a

short, 11-month period, the new strategy was implemented and both of the new HR and

payroll management systems were live. 
In 1999, the Bombay Company had more than 5,000

employees and reported annual sales of $356 million. 
These are just two of the more than 150

successful alliances PeopleSoft has formed. Other partners include Digital, Microsoft,

Lotus and Hewlett-Packard. PeopleSoft currently employs 6,900 people and had revenues of

$1.4 billion in 1999. A recent survey revealed their customer approval rating to be 98

percent. PeopleSoft openly attributes this success to their alliance oriented growth

strategy.
