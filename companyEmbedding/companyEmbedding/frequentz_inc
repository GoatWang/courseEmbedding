PALO ALTO, Calif., Sept. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Frequentz Inc., a global leader and champion of end-to-end visibility continues its accelerated marketplace growth by delivering the latest update to its 4th Generation EPCIS solution, IRIS 4.4, across its global customer base.

"As a leader in serialization we understand the comprehensive needs of the pharmaceutical supply chain" said Charlie Sweat, CEO, Frequentz Inc. "Our IBM developed infrastructure built for a structured data environment, further enhanced by Frequentz engineers, enables us to achieve the highest levels of performance and integrity across the industry.

PALO ALTO, Calif., Nov. 4, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Frequentz, Inc., a global leader and champion of end-to-end visibility, has entered an exclusive global partnership with its customer, One Banana, to help meet the worldwide demand for responsibly produced food. By utilizing Frequentz's track and trace technology, Information Repository and Intelligence Server (IRIS), One Banana will gain visibility into all steps of their supply chain in order to assure responsible and sustainable production integrity.
 
One Banana's parent company, AgroAmerica, was founded in 1958 in Guatemala and has grown to become one of the world's largest banana growers. It supplies its produce to companies and supermarkets across the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Focused on the growing, shipping, and distribution of organic bananas, One Banana is proud to cultivate their fruit in accordance with the most demanding global safety and regulatory labor standards with the help of leading edge technology like Frequentz's IRIS platform.
"Product integrity and consumer safety are key priorities for AgroAmerica. We pride ourselves on producing the highest quality fruit while still maintaining responsible and sustainable agricultural practices in every step of the supply chain. Leveraging Frequentz's traceability software delivers the transparency we need in order to confirm that both our produce and procedures continue to meet the highest level of standards," says Ingrid Lopez, Logistics Director, One Banana. 
The SolutionAs food demands continue to grow around the world, so does the technological needs of growers, especially as food comes from multiple international sources. It's also increasingly important for growers to have full visibility and product traceability across the supply chain as more and more consumers demand to know where their food comes from. Frequentz's GS1 and global compliant solutions deliver the ability to track and analyze historical data as well as the dexterity to handle rapid operational queries from supply partners. This reduces repetitive data gathering and provides accurate records and reporting on such things as specific crop information, irrigation or even soil testing. These solutions can help identify potential sources of contamination or assist in monitoring cold chain or temperature controlled logistics, which naturally lead to better responses to recall events. 
About FrequentzFrequentz is a global leader and champion of end-to-end visibility, offering comprehensive traceability, serialization and information management technologies. Their transformative tools bolster businesses and brand reputations by improving productivity, product quality, and profitability. To accomplish this, Frequentz provides valuable insight into end-to-end supply chains and critical business processes by collecting, storing and analyzing serialized, life history data. Applications of its software are currently used in the life sciences, agricultural, fishery and sustainability, retail, and automotive industries worldwide and promote intelligent analytics and consumer safety.

Frequentz, LLC Key Developments

Frequentz Inc. Releases the Latest Update to its 4th Generation EPCIS Solution, IRIS 4.3
Feb 23 16
Frequentz Inc. has just released the latest update to their 4th Generation EPCIS solution, IRIS 4.3, in order to continue to proactively address traceability landscape shifts. With enhanced compatibilities, IRIS 4.3 is adaptable to a variety of customer needs and has been enriched to deliver  performance. While solution providers often are only able to support certain types of formats for identifiers, Frequentz's technology can support GS1, Customer, or 3rd Party Identifiers. It allows its customers' existing operations and backend infrastructure to remain unchanged as they work with new trading partners, require regulation compliance, or simply want to offer greater visibility. Frequentz's global traceability solution's leadership places an emphasis on closely monitoring worldwide traceability trends across multiple industries in order to evolve its technology and assure their customers' growth continues. Some important trends driving recent enhancements include: Transparency in the "Human Supply Chain": There was a clear call for transparency, especially as it relates to sustainability and the challenges of slavery in the "human supply chain" at SeaWeb's 2016 Sustainable Seafood Summit. Major retailers from across the nation were in attendance, demonstrating that traceability and sustainable supply chains are looking less and less like a luxury for the seafood industry, and more like a necessity. Upcoming DSCSA Regulations: Pharmaceutical suppliers are beginning to receive notifications from their partners reminding them of the compliance expectations as industry moves from the first phase of Lot Traceability into the second phase which implements serialization. With the looming deadlines, partners are urging suppliers to implement serialization solutions sooner than later so testing can begin. Big Data: While data analytics are an important factor in smart business decision-making they should not be the only factor. It is important to have big data—as long as it is the right data, and as long as the cost of data acquisition and analysis is justified by the value it brings to the work at hand. Traceability solutions should balance the cost of data capture with the value of the insight gained from that data, especially as it relates to operational excellence, legal compliance and social responsibility.


Frequentz Inc. Names Ranjit Pradhan as Chief Product Officer & Global Business Development
Jul 31 15
Frequentz Inc. announced Ranjit Pradhan in the new role of chief product officer & global business development, which was created to meet the increased global traceability demand. Prior to joining Frequentz in 2013, Pradhan was an executive at Abbott Labs, where he held the senior director, diagnostics informatics position reporting into the EVP, Abbott Diagnostics.  Pradhan has also held senior positions at several Fortune 100 companies including GE Healthcare and Philips Healthcare.

Frequentz, Inc. Provides Solution for AgroAmerica to Assure Sustainably Sourced Produce

Partnership provides traceability solutions for one of the world's largest banana producers




Nov 4, 2015, 10:02am EST














PALO ALTO, Calif., Nov. 4, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Frequentz, Inc., a global leader and champion of end-to-end visibility, has entered an exclusive global partnership with its customer, One Banana, to help meet the worldwide demand for responsibly produced food. By utilizing Frequentz's track and trace technology, Information Repository and Intelligence Server (IRIS), One Banana will gain visibility into all steps of their supply chain in order to assure responsible and sustainable production integrity.

 

One Banana's parent company, AgroAmerica, was founded in 1958 in Guatemala and has grown to become one of the world's largest banana growers. It supplies its produce to companies and supermarkets across the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Focused on the growing, shipping, and distribution of organic bananas, One Banana is proud to cultivate their fruit in accordance with the most demanding global safety and regulatory labor standards with the help of leading edge technology like Frequentz's IRIS platform.
"Product integrity and consumer safety are key priorities for AgroAmerica. We pride ourselves on producing the highest quality fruit while still maintaining responsible and sustainable agricultural practices in every step of the supply chain. Leveraging Frequentz's traceability software delivers the transparency we need in order to confirm that both our produce and procedures continue to meet the highest level of standards," says Ingrid Lopez, Logistics Director, One Banana. 
The SolutionAs food demands continue to grow around the world, so does the technological needs of growers, especially as food comes from multiple international sources. It's also increasingly important for growers to have full visibility and product traceability across the supply chain as more and more consumers demand to know where their food comes from. Frequentz's GS1 and global compliant solutions deliver the ability to track and analyze historical data as well as the dexterity to handle rapid operational queries from supply partners. This reduces repetitive data gathering and provides accurate records and reporting on such things as specific crop information, irrigation or even soil testing. These solutions can help identify potential sources of contamination or assist in monitoring cold chain or temperature controlled logistics, which naturally lead to better responses to recall events. 
About FrequentzFrequentz is a global leader and champion of end-to-end visibility, offering comprehensive traceability, serialization and information management technologies. Their transformative tools bolster businesses and brand reputations by improving productivity, product quality, and profitability. To accomplish this, Frequentz provides valuable insight into end-to-end supply chains and critical business processes by collecting, storing and analyzing serialized, life history data. Applications of its software are currently used in the life sciences, agricultural, fishery and sustainability, retail, and automotive industries worldwide and promote intelligent analytics and consumer safety.

Retail











  









Today, as purchasing decisions are made more on the basis of health-related factors than price, the power of influence is shifting from retailers to consumers. Factors such as origin and product verifiability are increasingly impacting retailers’ bottom-lines and driving retailers to meet their customer demand through global product tracking software. Retailers are also realizing that global product-tracking software can be instrumental in improving productivity, product quality, and profitability by providing comprehensive data across all of their locations.





  





Why Companies Select Us:





  


Superior EPCIS System


While still being flexible enough to adapt to those businesses that have not yet implemented the EPCIS 1.1 standards, our software uses elements including GLNs for location, GTINs for trade items, and SSCCs for shipping containers to track products on a globally accepted platform.

 Full-featured Integration


Our solution offers full-featured integration that can capture the origin of data and place it in a XML document to create seamless integration with extension elements such as trading partners, intersystem WMS communications, and  any line system.

 




Global Data Flexibility 


Our solution was built to the exacting specification put forth by GS1 Global which enforces the use of GS1 encoding. But it has the ability to support other encodings to meet global needs, including the flexibility to send data in formats that comply with differing government agency requirements.

 Robust Performance 


Our solutions are built to scale to meet volume demands, both horizontally and vertically. They can handle a wide range of out of the box and customized operations, including API integrations with ERP and WMS systems—whether processing 100 transactions a month or millions of transactions a minute.

 




Complete Serial Number Management 


Our easy-to-use solutions enable each product to be mapped to a different user or group of users. And they enable specific rules that reference a subset of the serial numbers associated to a product to be mapped to a specific user.

 Leading Mobile Solutions


By allowing for autocomplete, prefilled data selections, and custom data configurations, our mobile solutions improve data capture performance and data recall, and reduce the amount of time spent writing, copying, and sorting through paper records. Traveling with users to the most critical points in their process, our mobile solutions reduce the lag between the actual and reported event times by transmitting these events as they happen.

 



  





Why Our Solutions Matter:





  


  
Frequentz solutions provide manufacturers with extensive visibility into their supply chain, enabling properly monitored production transparency from source to consumption. Our food-traceability solutions reliably help manufacturers show the source and location of their food and beverage products in real-time, assisting in recall management. Our mobile solution and consumer engagement tools can assist in targeted marketing, messaging, and incentives.
  
Our platform has many benefits to fit your unique process.  In terms of ability to deploy, we can be hosted through a private cloud, on-premise, or with a hybrid solution. Used by many of the most well-known brands, both big and small, our customizable platform has a proven ability to scale. On the farm, in the warehouse, and across the supply chain, you’ll see our traceability solutions work with and add value to your current operations.
  
Benefits of implementing a traceability solution at the retail level include: building more trust with retail customers through ensuring the authenticity of their purchases, enabling more efficient and swifter responses to product recalls, and spotlighting the entire supply chain, especially in seafood, to eliminate unsustainable practices.

Verification












  









Serialization and track-and-trace enable the verification of products as they travel through the supply chain. Verification can provide stakeholders with insights into a product’s chain of custody, change of ownership, authentication, and recall status.





  




Frequentz provides several mechanisms stakeholders can use to view the authenticity and pedigree of a product. With permission, trading partners and government regulators can also use IRIS’s traceability portal to view a serialized product’s chain of custody and verify its serial number.
Moreover, our mobile solutions extend to the end consumer/patient level the power to verify product authenticity. A user can simply scan a product’s barcode, and our mobile solution will query the IRIS repository to ensure the serial number aligns with the requested product.
Verification alleviates supply chain problems and introduces several business benefits including:

Business Insights
Ensuring trading partners are receiving the correct products is essential and garners trust. If a trading partner uses the traceability portal and comes across an invalidated product, a business can have greater accuracy in pinpointing the location within the supply chain where bad business practices may be in place.
Brand Protection
Serialization and verification lead to more accurate information and visibility along a supply chain, raising the cost barrier for counterfeiters and increasing the ease of finding counterfeit product entry points.
Customer Retention
Improved risk- and crisis-management strategies strengthen brand equity. The ability to reach customers directly through our mobile solutions and send recall notifications, for example, creates a new channel for direct consumer engagement, generating trust between brands and their customers.
Targeted Recalls
The granularity of product data that is collected, when analyzed, can enhance the ability to understand where a problem may have been introduced into the supply chain. Immediate access to this data enables you to engage in direct consumer engagement channel and push messages directly to stakeholders and customers who may have purchased a harmful product.
Returns and Reverse Logistics
Just as consumers can use this system to verify a serialized product’s authenticity, businesses can the system to verify that a product that has been returned is the correct product.

A Potential Use Case for Using the IRIS Traceability Portal:
Scenario: A government regulator, suspicious of a drug and its origins, wants to view the drug’s chain of custody. The regulator requests the distributor or retailer to provide details on the chain of custody for the drug, using its particular and unique ID.
Procedure: The regulator uses the traceability portal web UI, enters the unique ID, and initiates the query into IRIS.
Result: The regulator reviews the pedigree and can also address potential questions, such as:

Did the pedigree request pass or fail?
Is every change of ownership legitimate?
Did the drug leave the country?
Does the pedigree show any inconsistencies?
