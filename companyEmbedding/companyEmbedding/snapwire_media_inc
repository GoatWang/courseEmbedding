On the top of that good customer service which is very important. My only regret is to not have using it earlier ;)  P.S. and to respond to user (who rate 1*) @Svetoslav Bonev sorry but maybe this is because the quality of your pictures submitted are not enough. So I recommend you to use some other app where they accept anything maybe you got more chance there. to be frank with you I have just started, not even a month and I'm already "Expert" with a lot of nominations so your statement is not true ;) Good luck                    Angel Osorio         Cool I'm starting to really like this app. Not only does it challenge you as a photographer and step into new grounds as far as photography but it can also earn you money! I haven't earned anything yet but I've gotten a couple of nominations, and some photos added onto the market place.                    Teymur Myasoutov          Overall I really like it and am willing to continue to use it. Though the desktop experience is far better.  Because looking through google requests and trying to find a specific one is a nightmare! Please add alphabetical sorting or sorting by location.  Plus, opening links through the app doesn't show the shared request, just opens the default tab.                    Mike Evans         Great app I am new to this app and love the freedom to express oneself in a marketplace environment. I gave 4 stars because the initial level up isnt easy to attain for inexperienced amatures like me and to really advance and sell, its required to level up. I will keep trying and when i can see more of this app, i will give it a 5 star.                    Lisa Norris          I reinstalled hoping this app would be fixed as I love snapwire but I am still getting error cant connect and can not even sign in manually or through facebook.

This is the next big thing yet without the drama! I love Snapwire.It's super fundamental, upload photos, get creative, learn new techniques, browse&follow awesome artists(photographers),show your talent- even get paid for it.You cant chat& back&forth communicate w/other photographers,buyers (unless u comment on a req./challenge wall) but that is no downfall,trust me. It keeps the beauty&intention of this social media place true to its vision- to be focused on the talent&art of photography& the individuals behind it.without any Drama.Well done Chad Newell   Full Review                    LJ Bazinga  June 24, 2016                        My new addiction Fantastic site "library" that features affordable stock photos for companies, a place for photo art lovers to aquire and view thousands and thousands of incredible photos, and somewhere for truly gifted photographers to actually be acknowledged & paid for their work! Win-win-win!   Full Review                    Lamarcus Smith  March 20, 2017                         OK....  I see why I deleted it the first time.  Your limited on the photo size you can post.  Then nobody really buy nothing. Plus the challenges are not realistic.  89.9% of people can't up and travel places. I had more sales at an art show.  Don't waist your time just go to an art show............ Now it saying no internet connection...  Wtf   Full Review                    Rick Nofel  March 21, 2017                         I don't know if this app works anymore. The website has a lot of buttons that don't work when you click them. Also nothing I've posted on the website shows up in my app. There are no current requests available only challenges. I have a few photos that are currently the only photos nominated for challenges so we'll see if anything happens.   Full Review                    L Reedy  March 19, 2016                        Love this app but wont connect Wont connect for weeks now and cant log in. I have emailed support with no resolution. App keeps erroring no internet connection but all my other apps are connecting fine. Galaxy note 5.   Full Review                    Rob Williams  October 14, 2015                        Great but not for the casual photographer The casual photographer takes many pics with their cell phone and maybe a dozen come out looking professional. This app is purely for the professional photographer who uses their cell not to take pics but to negotiate prices of pics they sell on the app.  Not for me.   Full Review                    Artem Repka  September 2, 2015                        100/100 Well, I really love the interface and the animations, everything is smooth. The main idea is also cool and this app is better that the other ones like Foap, Clashot, etc. because it has a thing called "Requests", so for people who want to buy someone's photos it is easier to find you. Well, it's a bit hard to explain for me, though you have to try it to understand it's benefits beneath Clashot and other apps.   Full Review                    Eric Prochnow  September 1, 2016                        Too selective. Disappointed. I switched phones and lost therefore lost access to my account. Since then all the beginner missions have been location specific for the past several months or expecially difficult like Rio Olympics. Really? The requests are things I can do, but the missions are only things a very small percentage of lucky people can get nominated for. Fix this. This is not working.   Full Review                    Fae Lynne  July 5, 2017                         You're not "selling" your photos for actual money - you're entering contests, and you get nothing if you don't win. This isn't communicated to you until you go to actually use the app, and it's not even CLEAR then, they expect you to figure it out through the "guidelines" for each request. Then, if you DO decide to enter, your pictures are declined because their app gets picture qualities wrong - all of mine are taken with a 14mpx camera but are denied because their app claims they're only 3.1mpx. If you finally DO find one that it accepts, it takes nearly ten minutes just to upload! I'm done, this app is more trouble than it's worth.   Full Review                    Retro87 Gaming  May 2, 2016                        Love it. Finally, someone has released a way for people to get paid for doing something they love. I tried some of the other apps and websites, but none of them even came close to providing the sort of service that people are looking for.   Full Review                    Edwin Chua  December 8, 2016                         There should be an easier way to filter or sort the challenges available by location nearest to you. Imagine scrolling over 100 challenges to see that none of them are related to you. 1 word, annoying   Full Review                    Jonathan Newton  November 29, 2015                        Can't log in I'll change the rating when you guys fix the issue. I try to log in with my email and password and it says no internet connection. Try to log in with Facebook and I get an invalid hash key blah blah. The app was cool on my other phone. This sucks   Full Review                    Sunny Ghosh  December 8, 2016                        Only for people who live in north America and Europe and Australia! This is not for every one! Kinda defeats the purpose of making this available worldwide but only have challenges for people of North America and Europe! Bogus! With love from India!   Full Review                    Jessica Pombo  July 21, 2015                         Love it so far, although my profile picture and background picture become squished and contorted once I save them. Am I doing something wrong?   Full Review                    Aimless Amoeba  January 25, 2017                         I like it so far(just starting), the idea is great. But they really need a search feature or nearby feature for the challenge and requests. It's time-consuming to have to scroll through seemingly endless challenges/requests, before finding one that's doable.   Full Review                    Kimberly Hebert  November 1, 2015                        WTF!? I downloaded this app 3 days ago, it would be nice if it would ACTUALLY connect! Instead of wasting my data. I have a Galaxy Note 4. Y'all need to fix this. Because it may only be 10% of users of your app that experience this problem (Regardless of make & model of phone), but EVERYONE that chooses to download your app SHOULD BE ABLE to at least TRY IT for themselves - just to see if it's worth keeping.   Full Review                    Eric Barkkari  June 19, 2016                        Addicting! I find myself looking at my phone constantly. I am still waiting to get nominated and it becomes frustrating , but I don't quit and will keep trying. All in all this app has brought out a passion in me that was hidden.   Full Review                    David Anaka  December 13, 2015                        No Internet connection?! Your logging in with the wrong info. This happened to me unfortunately to reset the app you have to Uninstall and then reinstall. Make sure you have the right email/password or you get this error and can't go back without Uninstalling. Weird glitch.   Full Review                    Waka  November 26, 2016                        Not good at all It's boring, most challenges are impossible to take part because individuals have to travel to specific locations  to take pictures there and be a part of the competitions. Layout of the app is boring, it does nothing to capture the attention of the users, and thats not what a photo app should be: BORING.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.

Snapwire is a platform that connects young photographers with brands, publishers, small businesses, and creatives around the world looking for specific images that cannot be found through traditional stock photo services.[1] Buyers post a creative image brief (called a Request) and photographers respond by submitting their photos through Snapwire website or iPhone app.[2] Winning photographers are awarded and paid.[3] Aside from Requests, Snapwire regularly runs creative Challenges concern popular image needs. Challenges are curated by Snapwire and are open to the public.[4]
Snapwire has a searchable library of authentic photos called the Marketplace, which consists of hand selected images with varying price points. In July 2014 the number of photos in Marketplace had reached 150,000;[5] in October 2014 this number exceeded 500,000 images. As of July, 2017 the company has over 3,000,000 images. Every photo on the platform has a royalty-free license.

History[edit]
In 2012, Chad Newell (Chief Executive Officer) and Sky Gilbar co-founded Snapwire Media Inc.
Chad Newell started working in the industry as a researcher at a stock photo library named Image Bank that was later acquired by Getty Images. In 2001 he co-founded Media Bakery – a premium stock photography agency with 10 million images aggregated from 170 sources that have all licensing models (macro stock, mid stock, and micro stock) and is one of the largest independent stock photo agencies in North America. He also serves as a guest lecturer at Brooks Institute of Photography.
Snapwire opened to the public in March 2014.[6] In July 2014 Snapwire launched 2.0 version, which allowed photographers to create personal portfolios and sell images from these.[7] With its 2.0 version the company made a move towards becoming a photo sharing website. At the same time, Snapwire announced partnership with gram30 – a Japanese-based startup studio focusing on incubating and developing new products and services.[5] In October 2014, Snapwire collaborated with Adobe to bring selected features of Adobe Photoshop CC and Lightroom to the Snapwire iOS app.[8] The application was revealed at Adobe MAX 2014 show in Los Angeles. On October 1 the company opened its first international office in Tokyo.[9]
Funding[edit]
About three months after the company’s formal launch in March 2014, it had secured a $1.4 million seed round,[10] with investor Sadato Tanaka. Other notable users include Allen Morgan, Alan Meckler, Tom Glocer, Safa Rashtchy, Scott Jarus, Chaotic Investments, Roger Fishman, Dave Morgan, Spencer Huang, and Mark Kingdon.[5] In August 2015, Snapwire completed a "testing the waters" campaign on equity crowdfunding platform SeedInvest to gauge interest from their users in investing in the company. [11]. In December of 2016 the company successfully raised proceeds under the Title 3 of the Jumpstart Our Business Jobs Act on Startengine, which yielded net proceeds of approximately $168,000. In April of 2017, the company successfully closed another round of equity crowd funding of approximately $198,000 on Wefunder.

                MyScript Nebo
                            

If you own a tablet with a good active stylus and you take a lot of notes, it's definitely worth giving MyScript Nebo a shot while it's free. But your mileage may vary.

                Adobe Spark
                            

A useful set of tools for creating graphics and visual stories for social media, Adobe Spark delivers nice results pretty easily.






See at Nintendo






                Miitomo
                            

Nintendo's first foray into mobile gaming doesn't feature any beloved characters, but it's still a strong start.



 





See at Scotts






                Scotts Miracle Gro Gro
                            

The Gro app from Scott's Miracle Gro will combine data from other smart garden gadgets to guide you through growing your plant of choice.






See at SoundHound






                Hound
                            

Hound is a new app hoping to do everything for you. But is it better than Siri and Google Now?






See at Apple






                Music Memos
                                    iOS


Apple's new Music Memos app captures musical inspiration, while GarageBand adds a new AI drummer and loop arranger.

                Adobe Post
                            

A free-with-registration iPhone app that produces attractive text-overlay-on-image graphics for social media, Adobe Post is fun and easy to use.

                YouTube Music
                            

Google serves up a new app for music lovers called YouTube Music that organizes all the different versions of your favorite tunes into a central hub with guided paths for artists discovery and new music curation.










See at Adobe






                Adobe Photoshop Fix
                            

A solid photo-retouching iPad app for folks who need Creative Cloud integration, Adobe Photoshop Fix is useful, but would be more so with some additional features.






See at Home Connect






                Home Connect
                            

Bosch will expand its Home Connect app launched last year to smarten up fridges, washing machines, dryers, and coffee machines.






See at Wizards of the Coast






                Magic Duels
                            

Magic Duels' tutorial mode is among the best ways to learn to play Magic, but interface problems and poor cross-device support mean the average player should look elsewhere for their fix.






See at Drivemode






                Drivemode Driving Interface
                            

It's so intuitive and simple that you could use the Drivemode app for Android while blindfolded, but don't try that while driving.














                Apple Music
                            

Apple Music has a lot of potential, but its iCloud Music Library bugs and confusing interface keep it from edging out Spotify for now.

 Snapwire Media, Inc. just released  	Snapwire 2.0 for iOS, opening the door for amateur mobile photographers to post their best work, and maybe make some cash in the offing.  	Snapwire's goal is to connect thousands of smartphone photogs with  brands and businesses from around the world. All it takes is an eye for  photography and a willingness to go out and get the photos that match  business requests you'll get in the app. It will take a little patience to get recognized in the app, but fortunately it's set up to help you get better.

Become a pro smartphone photographer with Snapwire (pictures)


Getting started  	To get started, the app prompts you right  away to upload four of your best photos. These four photos will be reviewed by Snapwire editors for quality. If they like what they see, you'll immediately be promoted to "shooter," a level designation (more on this later) in Snapwire that lets you start making money from your photos right away.If the Snapwire editors think your work isn't quite up to snuff, don't worry. Instead, you'll start out as a first-level "Explorer" and you'll be able to compete in challenges to work your way up to a shooter. 	 	So before  you start seeing dollar signs, it's important to note that you probably  won't start making money right away. Instead, the app is set up so you  can build a name for yourself, not just with great photos, but by  studying and following some of the many photographers who have had  success with Snapwire.Discover established photographers on Snapwire and view their portfolios.
                                                    Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET
                                                  	Early on in your Snapwire career, it's smart to check out other photographers by touching the menu button in  the upper left, then choosing Photographers from the list. Here you'll  find hundreds of top-level users with uploaded collections of their own.  You'll also be able to see which photos were nominated by other users  to be the best at capturing the request at hand.How Snapwire works  	As I mentioned, you'll start out as an "Explorer," letting you respond  to Snapwire Challenges built to measure your photography skill against  the masses. Completing challenges earns you points towards moving on to the  next level. Leveling up is how you build your reputation, giving you  access to app features that give you the ability to be invited to  Requests, direct commissions for your work, and better exposure.

  	To see the latest Challenges, you can open the slide out menu and then  touch a button in the upper right to filter on Challenges. Each tile in  the scrollable list gives you the theme of the challenge, the dollar  amount you would receive if you win best photo from all the submissions,  and how many days left you have to submit your work. Touching a  challenge will give you the full description with ideas for how to  capture the challenge's stated theme. You'll also be able to browse  through other user submissions for ideas. 	 	Part of your success  relies on other users as well. When people see your photo they can  "nominate" it to make sure the Snapfire people see it. The more  nominations you have, the more weight it will carry when it's time to  judge the submissions. At the end, Snapwire chooses a winner in the  category, paying the amount and awarding points towards leveling up.From the slideout menu, choose requests to see what businesses are currently looking for.
                                                    Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET
                                                  	Once you've moved up to "Shooter" (the next level above Explorer)  you'll be able to take on more advanced requests. If you open the  slideout menu again and touch requests, you'll see there are several  ways to filter the latest requests. You can see the newest requests, the  highest paying, requests that are closing soon, and several others  including requests you've been invited to once you reach more advanced  levels. 	 	Quickly browsing the current listings, there are  requests for photos of "people learning to do things" from an education  initiative looking for photos of people trying or learning to do  something. Another asks for simply "Pumpkin Drinks" from a drink client  who wants to show the drinks of the fall season. Each give specific  instructions for the resolution of the image, type of lighting, and  other rules (such as "no posed pictures") you'll need to follow in order  to be considered. 	 	At the bottom of the description there's a  button to submit your photo and from there it's up to the client whether  your image deserves the prize.When you view a request, you'll see all the requirements and you can view what others have submitted.
                                                    Screenshot by Jason Parker/CNET
                                                How you (and Snapwire) get paidSnapwire is in the business of connecting photographers to buyers, and  as such the company takes a 30 percent cut of your payment. When you  reach the top levels of the service you'll be able to get direct  commissions from buyers, but the early charges are for Snapwire creating  a platform to make these connections. 	 	Payments are sent through  the Paypal or Balance services. All earnings you make will be  automatically sent to you through your chosen payout method. 	 	For  all the information about leveling up, points, payments, and other  details, the app has extensive information with a tutorial, rules about  the leveling system, and a Frequently Asked Questions section that  outlines the entire service.A new wave of amateur photography?   	As our smartphones continue to improve with better cameras that shoot  high quality images, it only makes sense that services like Snapwire  will continue to crop up. It gives talented, yet unknown photographers a  chance to shine while also giving buyers a ton of flexibility in  choosing the best images possible for their needs. 	 	Now that the  platform is available as an app, there will inevitably be a flood of new  photographers ready to make some money. But while all the new talent  will probably lower your chances of winning challenges, Snapwire  provides a compelling service that makes it possible for just about  anyone with a smartphone to become a paid photographer.

History[edit]
In 2012, Chad Newell (Chief Executive Officer) and Sky Gilbar co-founded Snapwire Media Inc.
Chad Newell started working in the industry as a researcher at a stock photo library named Image Bank that was later acquired by Getty Images. In 2001 he co-founded Media Bakery – a premium stock photography agency with 10 million images aggregated from 170 sources that have all licensing models (macro stock, mid stock, and micro stock) and is one of the largest independent stock photo agencies in North America. He also serves as a guest lecturer at Brooks Institute of Photography.
Snapwire opened to the public in March 2014.[6] In July 2014 Snapwire launched 2.0 version, which allowed photographers to create personal portfolios and sell images from these.[7] With its 2.0 version the company made a move towards becoming a photo sharing website. At the same time, Snapwire announced partnership with gram30 – a Japanese-based startup studio focusing on incubating and developing new products and services.[5] In October 2014, Snapwire collaborated with Adobe to bring selected features of Adobe Photoshop CC and Lightroom to the Snapwire iOS app.[8] The application was revealed at Adobe MAX 2014 show in Los Angeles. On October 1 the company opened its first international office in Tokyo.[9]
Funding[edit]
About three months after the company’s formal launch in March 2014, it had secured a $1.4 million seed round,[10] with investor Sadato Tanaka. Other notable users include Allen Morgan, Alan Meckler, Tom Glocer, Safa Rashtchy, Scott Jarus, Chaotic Investments, Roger Fishman, Dave Morgan, Spencer Huang, and Mark Kingdon.[5] In August 2015, Snapwire completed a "testing the waters" campaign on equity crowdfunding platform SeedInvest to gauge interest from their users in investing in the company. [11]. In December of 2016 the company successfully raised proceeds under the Title 3 of the Jumpstart Our Business Jobs Act on Startengine, which yielded net proceeds of approximately $168,000. In April of 2017, the company successfully closed another round of equity crowd funding of approximately $198,000 on Wefunder.

Our Story






Our mission is to enable people with a passion for photography to thrive doing what they love.
Snapwire connects a new generation of photographers with businesses and brands that need on-demand creative imagery. Buyers post requests on Snapwire, and photographers submit photos that match. Buyers get custom photos that elevate their projects and photographers earn money doing what they love. Learn more about how Snapwire works for photographers. and for buyers.




Great photography is about the people who create it. Let's make photography human again.






Why is finding the right photo so difficult? We search but usually  find tired, overpriced stock photos that never feel quite right and pay the creator almost nothing. We can do better.






Make better photos together
When creatives work together, the results can be magical. On Snapwire, photographers create images to match a buyers vision. Photographers earn money for their creativity, and buyers get photos they love.


Put trust in creators
Photographers get positive ratings on Snapwire when they deliver authentic, creative imagery to buyer Requests. This helps build a community where both talent and trust help determine a photographers success.





Our goal is to help talented photographers fulfill their dreams of becoming professional creatives.






How do we move past the current, often frustrating ways mobile photographers can earn money, like hustling prints and entering long-shot brand photo contests? We can do better. Let's start with a real need. 





Build a pathway to success
We aren’t about crowdsourcing. We designed Snapwire with features that give any photographer with talent and drive a pathway to follow their dream of becoming a professional creative.


Level up and go pro
          With success on Snapwire, photographers earn points that unlock rewards like invites to requests, positive ratings, exposure, and paid commissions directly from buyers.
Learn More about leveling






We believe that mobile photographers are artists too and deserve to be treated with fairness and respect.






Why do microstock sites often pay less than 20% on sales to photographers? Newer crowdsourcing sites often take more than half--and the photographer's copyright. We can do better.






Respect your copyright 
Photographers who choose to shoot with mobile devices should be treated and respected as artists, not micro-laborers. That’s why photographers on Snapwire always keep the full copyright of their images.


Keep a high percentage on sales
Producing a great photograph is really hard-—it takes patience, creativity, and talent. That's why we have one of the highest payouts in the industry. Mobile photography is a legitimate creative medium and deserves to be rewarded fairly.

        Our Mission
      

        To enable people with a passion for photography to thrive, while making it easier for creatives to get authentic, custom photos that elevate their projects.
      
More than anything, we want to make the act of getting photos human again. We believe the next great leap in the photography business is centered on something human: creative collaboration. 
The best photos often come when photographers work with photo buyers to shoot photos that match their creative vision.
We’re here to build a better way to get beautiful photos — by connecting a new generation of photographers directly with photo buyers. Buyers post a photo request, and mobile photographers compete creatively to submit their best photos. Buyers get unique images quickly and affordably, and the winning photographers get paid fairly.

At Snapwire, we believe that when creatives work together, the results can be magical. This is why we have created the first and biggest marketplace for on-demand stock photography. On Snapwire, people needing authentic stock photos launch a creative brief and talented photographers submit photos to match the buyer’s vision, earn money for their creativity, and buyers license the photos they love. 
We believe the next great leap in photography is centered on something human: creative collaboration. 

Since launch in mid 2014, we've changed the game for thousands of image buyers and photographers worldwide. With over 285,000 photographers and an avid community of supporters, you have a unique opportunity to join our movement and help us change the entire commercial photography industry.
On average, 15K people sign up for Snapwire every single month.  The community has grown to 285,000 photographers in 180 countries. 

Finding the right photo can be like finding 'a needle in a haystack'. Spending over 20 years in the commercial photo world, we witnessed photo buyers constantly fail at finding the right photo. As Instagram & social networks gave way to a new generation photographer, we knew it was time to collide these worlds and create a community with the first scalable photo assignment model. 
Read on to learn more on how you can help make this a reality. #JoinTheStory.

Snapwire is a platform that connects visionary photographers with businesses, brands and creatives around the world. We give photo buyers the ability to post creative requests and proven photographers respond with their best shots. Buyers get unique images that match their vision, and the winning photographers get paid. Anyone can earn. 
Snapwire was built to answer the call of millions of photo buyers who are forced to use cheesy, overused stock photos. Searching for the right photo is time-consuming and often unsuccessful. We're changing this process. Buying stock photos used to be an experience that was completely disconnected from the photographer who shot the photo, but we've brought photographers directly into the buying process.





Photographers receive specific requests through our mobile app or on the web, they shoot the photo to specification & get paid when a buyer loves their images. It’s that simple. Buyers nominate their favorite photos, and build working relationships with their favorite photographers. Photographers earn points and keep 70% when their photos sell. The extra photos that aren’t purchased are curated into our Marketplace Library, where photographers earn 50% when their photos sell. 
On Snapwire, over 285,000 photographers capture insights, concepts, products, and locations; each on time and on budget. Our photographers are qualified by our platform & work their way up the ranks to professional-level photography jobs.



Getting authentic, custom made photography for brands is fragmented, expensive and hard. The stock photo industry uses mass archives of irrelevant, outdated, pre-shot photos. Searching for the right photo is inefficient and sometimes impossible.



Brands & businesses ask photographers to shoot exactly what they are looking for at a price they control. As photos are submitted in real time, brands get to choose authentic photos that best fit their creative vision and download them instantly. Imagine how different and unique photos can be produced by our photographers from 180 countries with diverse backgrounds, style and vision. 
Everyone wins on Snapwire. Even if the photographer does not have their photos purchased from a Request creative brief, they can earn a spot in our growing photo library and have their photo purchased from buyers who seek a traditional photo search.

Snapwire's Marketplace Library is a growing collection of the best photos from our photo Requests with over 2.5 million worry free images available for license. 




With the release of iPhone 5s and its revolutionary built-in camera, people no longer needed to own an expensive DSLR camera to take beautiful pictures. The entire movement of Instagram photography has emerged with millions of photography enthusiasts. This has democratized the industry enabling anyone with a phone to take outstanding pictures. 
At Snapwire, we take it one step further and help anyone with an iPhone earn by selling their epic photos. 
It’s as simple as:






Our users are loving it! Snapwire has been consistently featured on the iTunes App Store (Photo & Video > Discovery & Share) with 5 star ratings. Building a successful company in the photography space relies on a shift to mobile & social. 


We designed the app to help passionate photographers stay informed of new briefs, upload photos on the go, and stay connected to the valuable community. Photographers follow peers who inspire, learn what photos sell, and respond to photo buyer's questions. 


We’re here to build a better way to get beautiful photos by connecting a new generation of photographers directly with photo buyers. The press agrees. See where Snapwire has been talked about.

The commercial photography industry generates revenue from 2 distinct sources. Commissioned work and Pre-Shot Library licensing. Now that anyone can be a photographer, the demand for high-quality photography has never been greater.

This change in investment law, makes equity crowdfunding under Title III possible; allowing both non-accredited as well as accredited investors to invest in private companies. Equity crowdfunding like this is different than other crowdfunding efforts as you actually can own shares in the company.  It opens an investment opportunity to millions of everyday people, giving them a chance to own a part of our story.
Today, our society is obsessed with the one visual medium that quickly and succinctly has told  a story since the dawn of man.  We’ve used visuals to communicate stories. Now that we all have a camera in our pocket, capturing stories with a camera and having the tools to make that photo look incredible, is at everyone’s disposal. In order to capitalize on the abundance of supply, and inefficiencies of demand in the $10B commercial photography industry, Snapwire is trailblazing a better, more collaborative way of getting photos through human connection. Let’s make photography human again and become a part of our story. When you invest, not only will you become a valued shareholder, but you also get some incredible perks.


The idea that anyone, anywhere, can shoot, edit, and upload a beautiful photo in seconds, right from their camera, and instantly get it in front of a global audience is incredible. Photos are now considered ‘social currency’ and a form of ‘conversation’ in a way that only words once were. Each day, people shoot over a billion photos and share over 200 million of them online.  As we’ve made shooting and sharing photos easier and easier, amidst the change, the economic value of the photograph has been diminished. Snapwire aims to change the economic value of the photograph. 
Our vision is to enable anyone with a creative passion for photography to earn money doing what they love, while making it easier for photo buyers to get unique, custom photos that elevate their own projects. Now you can #jointhestory to help make a passion into a profession for millions of aspiring photographers.

These securities have not been recommended or approved by any federal or state securities commission or regulatory authority. Furthermore, these authorities have not passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this document.These securities are offered under an exemption from registration; however, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has not made an independent determination that these securities are exempt from registration. For general information on investing, we encourage you to refer to www.investor.govYou should rely only on the information contained in our offering statement filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Form C prepared by or on behalf of us. We have not authorized anyone to provide you with information different from, or in addition to, that contained in this offering statement. The offering statement is an offer to sell only the shares offered therein and only under circumstances and in jurisdictions where it is lawful to do so. The information contained in our offering statement is current only as of its date.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis offering statement contains forward-looking statements, which include information concerning our liquidity and our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies.  These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “project,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “target,” “seek,” “will,” “may,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “forecasts,” “mission,” “strive,” “more,” “goal,” or similar expressions.  The statements are based on assumptions that we have made, based on our experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors we think are appropriate.  We believe these judgments are reasonable.  However, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results.  Our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.There are a number of risks, uncertainties, and other important factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this offering statement.

StartEngine will notify investors when we meet our target offering amount.  Thereafter, we may conduct additional closings from time to time at our discretion until December 31, 2016.Please note that shares in this offering may be purchased by employees and/or affiliates of the issuer, or persons related to them, and will be counted in determining whether we sell sufficient shares to meet our target offering amount.  Therefore, if we hit our minimum target amount, you should not assume that those shares have been purchased by members of the public or otherwise assume that our reaching our minimum target is any indication of the success of our offering.An investor may cancel an investment commitment until 48 hours prior to the offering deadline.  If an investor does not cancel an investment commitment before the 48-hour period prior to the offering deadline, the investor’s funds will be released to us upon a closing of the offering, and the investor will receive Snapwire common stock in exchange for his or her investment.  At that point, you will be an investor in Snapwire.If we notify investors of a material change to the offering and you do not reconfirm your investment commitment thereafter, your investment commitment will be canceled and your committed funds will be returned to you.How much can I invest?An investor is limited in the amount that he or she may invest in a Regulation Crowdfunding offering during any 12-month period: If either the annual income or the net worth of the investor is less than $100,000, the investor is limited to the greater of $2,000 or 5% of the lesser of his or her annual income or net worth. If the annual income and net worth of the investor are both greater than $100,000, the investor is limited to 10% of the lesser of his or her annual income or net worth, to a maximum of $100,000.What happens after my investment in Snapwire?We are required to file an annual report with the SEC not later than 120 days after the end of our fiscal year and post it on our website. This annual report includes information similar to our initial Form C filing, although we are not required to file audited or reviewed financial statements. In certain circumstances we may terminate our ongoing reporting requirement if:1.         We become a fully reporting registrant with the SEC.2.         We have filed at least one annual report, and we have not more than 300 shareholders of record.3.         We have filed at least three annual reports, and we have not more than $10 million in assets.4.         We or another party repurchases or purchases all the securities sold in this offering.5.         We cease to do business.Can I sell my securities after buying them? Securities purchased through a Regulation Crowdfunding offering are not freely transferable for one year after the date of purchase, except in the case where they are transferred: 1.        To Snapwire 2.        To an “accredited investor” 3.        As part of an offering registered with the SEC (e.g., IPO) 4.        To your child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse or cohabitant occupying a relationship generally equivalent to that of a spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law of the purchaser, including adoptive relationships; to a trust controlled by the purchaser; to a trust created for the benefit of a member of the family of the purchaser, or in connection with the death or divorce of the purchaser.After the one-year holding period has expired, you should not plan on being able to readily transfer and/or sell your security. Currently, there is no market or liquidity for our common stock and the company does not have any plans to list these securities on an exchange or other secondary market. At some point, the company may choose to do so, but until then you should plan to hold your investment for a significant period of time before a “liquidation event” occurs.  Typically, a “liquidation event” is when the company either lists its securities on an exchange, is acquired, or goes bankrupt.A note about our short-term debt.  As is typical of many startups, we were fortunate to have our initial seed capital of a little over $2,000,000 provided by several Angel investors and one fund who made an investment in us in the form of convertible notes (i.e., convertible debt) – a common form of seed-stage financing.  We used this capital to build our platform and we’re now ready to scale the business. Our seed capital investors have been very supportive.  Immediately prior to the commencement of this offering, pursuant to the terms of their convertible notes, they collectively agreed to amend the terms of their debt to automatically convert it to equity, at the discounts they originally negotiated, when we reach our target offering amount of $50,000.  Therefore, because we must reach our $50,000 target in order to have our initial closing, our short-term debt of $2,150,103 on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, will automatically convert to equity and there will no longer be short-term debt on our balance sheet when we conduct our first closing.

The Company will not incur any irregular use of proceeds.

I'm writing you today to thank all of our investors for the support shown to our cause and to let you know we have decided to move up our campaign closing date from December 31st, 2016 to November 30th, 2016. Therefore, at this time, we will be conducting a final closing. On this equity crowdfunding campaign, we've reached 330% of our initial target. We are honored and humbled at the success we received to date. The investment dollars are already hard at work and many new features have been released on our platform. Specifically, our iOS mobile app has received a much-needed update and buyers and photographers now have the ability to create saved collections of images that inspire them (an important workflow feature that has been 'in demand' from buyers for quite some time). There are more product releases coming in December. Probably one of the more exciting developments in the company is that the global giant, Google Inc., as launched over 2000 local photo requests on the platform. They continue to use our product to improve image posturing of their own products and services.  As mentioned above, we have decided to close the campaign in an effort to explore other financing options at a possible higher valuation. Again, thanks for your continued support and if you want to ask specific questions regarding this decision, please use the 'Comments' feature on StartEngine.Shooting for success,Chad Newell, CEOSnapwire Media, Inc.

          Update from Snapwire CEO, Chad Newell. He asks you...did you know?
        

          12 months ago
        

It's a special thing to have built a product that solves problems and provides potential for so many. If you're a creative who's searched for stock photos, Snapwire affords you to engage with a diverse group of regional photographers who's unique style will match your brand's story. For aspiring and professional photographers, there's no faster way to get your authentic and unique photos directly in front of the brands and buyers you care about. Did you know....1. The commercial photo industry is $10B and growing. More self-publishing platforms, like Squarespace, affords anyone to launch their own business and brand.  Looking toward the future, hundreds of millions of people seek the perfect photo that represents their story, business or brand identity.2. On average, over 300 people sign up for Snapwire every single day. With nearly 300K registered account since launch, our community continues to grow and the best photographer's work rise to the top of buyer's feeds. Our users come from over 180 countries (we have a diverse user base!)3. Snapwire has over 14K registered photo buyers. Our photo buyers are creative directors, graphic designers, and small businesses/brands need fresh authentic photos to tell their brand story. On Snapwire, photographers submit photos to match a buyer's specific need. Snapwire has worked with Google's Zagat Survey to shoot over 2K locations with Snapwire's proven photographers in North America in 2016 and there's more coming. 4. Yes. You can invest again. If you have invested, I can not thank you enough. Without your early help, our followers would not believe in the opportunity to invest. I was recently asked if someone has invested, could that individual consider investing again after the initial investment? The answer is, yes you can. If you have invested, the best thing you can do is share your enthusiasm with your network. Please take a minute to share that you invested in Snapwire on social and drive your friends to our campaign page (here) so they too can explore the opportunity. Lastly, today, we've reached nearly 200% of our initial goal and we are on our way to be one of the earliest companies to have raised capital under the Title III finance structure allowing the company to raise up to a full $1M. While we've achieved a major milestone in a short period of time, we plan to keep the opportunity to invest in our company available to everyone who wants to join our story. We want to ensure that every dollar raised, helps us continue to lead this new on-demand assignment model. Shooting for success, Chad Newell, CEOSnapwire Media, Inc. 






          155% of our goal.

We've reached 155% of our goal, but $77K  is not enough so we plan to keep going up to the full $1M under the Title III allowance. 






          103% in 72 hours.

We're are humbled by the initial support in our campaign. We've reached 103% of our equity crowdfunding goal in 72 hours! Thanks to everyone for your support. We're excited to see where this goes and hope you can share the excitement. Sharing the opportunity after your investment is key to continued momentum.  






          Our Short Term Debt Converts To Equity
        

          12 months ago
        

Thanks for the support thus far. Just over a day of announcing our live campaign, we are seeing great progress and momentum. We wanted to address what happens to our short term debt. Our seed capital investors have been very supportive. Immediately prior to the commencement of this offering, pursuant to the terms of their convertible notes, they collectively agreed to amend the terms of their debt to automatically convert it to equity, at the discounts they originally negotiated, when we reach our target offering amount of $50,000. Therefore, because we must reach our $50,000 target in order to have our initial closing, our short-term debt of $2,150,103 on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, will automatically convert to equity and there will no longer be short-term debt on our balance sheet when we conduct our first closing.
