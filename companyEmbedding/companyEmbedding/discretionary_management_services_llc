Discretionary Investment Management









Share








































What is 'Discretionary Investment Management'
Discretionary investment management is a form of investment management in which buy and sell decisions are made by a portfolio manager or investment counselor for the client's account. The term "discretionary" refers to the fact that investment decisions are made at the portfolio manager's discretion. This means that the client must have the utmost trust in the investment manager's capabilities. Discretionary investment management can only be offered by individuals who have extensive experience in the investment industry and advanced educational credentials, with many investment managers possessing the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation. Discretionary investment management is generally only offered to high net worth clients who have a significant level of investable assets.

BREAKING DOWN 'Discretionary Investment Management'
Discretionary investment management offers a number of benefits to clients. It frees them from the burden of making day-to-day investment decisions, which can arguably be better made by a qualified portfolio manager who is attuned to the vagaries of the market. Delegating the investing process to a competent manager leaves the client free to focus on other things that matter to him or her.
Discretionary investment management also aligns the investment manager's interest with that of the client, since managers typically charge a percentage of the assets under administration as their management fee. Thus if the portfolio grows under the investment manager's stewardship, the manager is compensated by receiving a higher dollar amount as the management fee. This reduces the adviser's temptation to "churn" the account in order to generate more commissions, which is a major flaw of a transaction-based investment model.
Discretionary investment management may also ensure that the client has access to better investment opportunities through the portfolio manager. The client may also receive better prices for executed trades, as the portfolio manager can put through a single buy or sell order for multiple clients.
From the client's point of view, he or she must have confidence in the portfolio manager's competence, integrity and trustworthiness. It is therefore incumbent upon clients to conduct adequate due diligence on potential portfolio managers before entrusting them with their life savings.

Company Description


Discretionary Management Services' (DMS) investment approach focuses on developing an appropriate asset allocation mix for each client. After determining the asset allocation, the firm assumes responsibility for executing the investment strategy. They are responsible for all manager selections and terminations, for tactical shifts around the long-term asset allocation targets and for ongoing due diligence. DMS offers diversified equity portfolios that include: a balance of growth/value, large-cap/small-cap and domestic/international. The firm has a strategic bias toward value-oriented equity strategies. The firm also offers access to alternative strategies and fund-of-funds structures.The firm's approach to manager selection is based on the idea that active management can add value. They also believe that enhanced index strategies are attractive options for large-cap and fixed-income investments and that behavioral finance theory has a significant influence on asset management. DMS seeks to use fewer managers to protect against over diversification.DMS offers a Global Dynamic Allocation strategy for use in trendless, volatile and bear market periods.

Investment Philosophy
Different economies create different investment markets.  Different investment markets have different assets that provide leadership, or perform poorly.  Correlations between investment assets change direction.  Spreads of expected returns widen and narrow.  
Analyzing markets historically is relatively easy, and clearly documents the foregoing philosophical statements.  Forecasting markets in a future context and making appropriate changes in investment strategy is difficult.  Two crucial variables come into play:  the time frame and the process of human decision making.
DMS believes that timeframes should be defined and compartmentalized.  We believe human decision making is less "efficient" than economists taught us in the 1960s and 1970s and more "behavioral" as sociologists have taught us for years.
Investment Policy


			Integrate Investment Policy with financial decisions.

			Investment decisions must consider investment, business and legal/fiduciary 
			risks.

Portfolio Construction


			Equity Diversification - balance of growth/value, large/small capitalization, and 
			domestic/international.

			Value Tilt - adopt a strategic bias toward value equity strategies.

			Alternative Strategies - fund-of-funds structures are advantageous in most cases 
			for core exposures.

Manager Selection


			Active management can add value.

			Enhanced index strategies are attractive solutions for large cap and fixed 
			income.

			Behavioral finance theory has a significant influence on asset management.

			Fewer managers should be used to protect against over-diversification.

			Equity markets rotate through distinct phases, different stocks and management 
			styles lead/lag in each phase.

Global Dynamic Asset Allocation


			Global Dynamic Asset Allocation is a viable investment strategy in trendless, 
			volatile, and bear market periods.

								Investment fund sponsors are becoming acutely aware of the increased demands of oversight in managing institutional assets. 
								In addition to the pressure to seek greater absolute returns in what many pundits predict will be an environment of modest returns, 
								sponsors are also dealing with the expanding regulatory scrutiny and regulations to observe, the flow of new and ever more complex 
								investment products, and the need to adjust their funds dynamically to rapid market changes. To meet those needs, DeMarche founded Discretionary 
								Management services, LLC (DMS) which is a registered investment advisor and an affiliate of DeMarche Associates, Inc.





					 
				











											"Institutional Consulting

Bob Marchesi, Founder

















Outsourcing
							
Core
							
Global Tactical Asset Allocation
							




									This service provides discretionary oversight of the total portfolio for fund sponsors who wish to outsource the investment management function.  DMS helps clients define their investment policy and construct their portfolios.  Then, DMS takes on the issues of selecting the best managers and rebalancing various investment strategies.



This service manages a portion of a fund sponsor’s total portfolio.  A typical assignment is to actively manage diversification across subclasses and styles of their global equity policy portfolio.


Our GTAA service is a dynamic global macro strategy.  The DMS Investment Committee (IC) has established goals and objectives and defined benchmark targets and ranges for the portfolios.
The IC selects active sub-advisers to manage sub-allocations using DeMarche’s Manager Analysis Review Committee (MARC) approved managers universe.  ETFs/index funds are utilized for tactical moves.  There is no use of shorting or leverage.








						FAQ:
(click on link to view answers)



How do you define Tactical Asset Allocation?

							Definition

Tactical asset allocation can be defined as the active shift of assets between two or more asset categories with the intent to either reduce risk or enhance return versus a specified benchmark over a market cycle.

							Objective

To reduce risk (volatility of returns) while maintaining the expected return of a specified benchmark over a market cycle.

							Why should it work?

Emotional (psychological) factors will move the stock and bond markets to levels of extreme valuation.  Tactical asset allocation attempts to exploit these periods of mispricing.




How is Tactical Asset Allocation different from Market Timing?

							Tactical asset allocation is differentiated from "market timing" on the basis of objectives (not technique).

							Market Timing

Generally applied to one asset class
Used in periods when the manager is negative on the expected return for its primary asset class.
Perceived by a manager as a method to control or "manage" their own portfolio risk and/or return.
Tends to base allocation decisions on forecasts.
Generally uses a short time horizon for decision-making.
More concerned with relative returns.

							Tactical Asset Allocation

Used by a manager to shift among multiple asset classes (stocks/cash, stocks/bonds/cash, other assets).
Used by plan sponsors to control or manage the risk and/or return of the total fund.
Tends to base allocation decisions on reported data.
Generally uses a longer time horizon for decision-making.
More concerned with risk control.

    Strategic Outlook

                        






March, 2017

DMS Strategic Outlook and Tactical Positions
Strategic Outlook - Fixed Income:  
    The Federal Reserve will remain vigilant.  The outlook is for increasing rates in 2017 due to improved economic activity and inflation pressures.
        

Tactical positions: 

 
                    High yield struggled somewhat in the first quarter of 2017 due to slightly widening credit spreads.  During 2016, high yield bonds exhibited great performance as credit spreads tightened dramatically following the energy scare of February 2016.  However, high coupon yields in this sector provide attractive income in a low rate environment.  We view high yield to be fully valued and will use it as source of funds to bolster other positions.
                

                    We continue to overweight credit versus Treasuries with duration tilted shorter than benchmarks.
                

                    Emerging market debt denominated in U.S. dollars provides diversification and yield potential.  Stability in global growth will further entice yield investors to add to these positions.
                

                    Commercial real estate continues to provide positive returns.  Queues can delay additions to positions and an increase in interest rates could dampen valuation improvements.  Value added or opportunistic strategies can be a complement to a core real estate exposure.
                



Strategic Outlook - Equities:  
                The domestic large cap stock market appears to be fully valued and has priced in an anticipated earnings rebound.  The negative impacts on earnings of a strong dollar and energy price rebound will fade in 2017 .  The year-over-year comparisons will become easier.   
            

Tactical positions:


                        Small cap stocks are over weighted versus targets in portfolios.  Small cap stocks, while more inherently volatile, will benefit from fiscal stimulus.  Also, small cap stocks are relatively undervalued to large cap stocks.
                    

                        International stocks are equally weighted versus targets.  The quantitative easing programs in Europe and Japan should provide tailwinds to stocks.  The relative dollar weakening in the quarter added to returns on foreign stocks. 
                    

Emerging markets stocks are over weighted versus targets as they are comparatively attractive due to their low relative P/E multiples.   Asian stocks are preferred as consumer demographic trends favor that part of the globe.
                    

The dollar weakened slightly in the first quarter, retracing from strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The dollar will remain range-bound given the expectation of positive global economic data.  The currency headwind of the stronger dollar on future expected returns should be modest.
